00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
the remaining block now this may take a

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.049 
the remaining block now this may take a
while<00:00:46.500> but<00:00:46.680> if<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.129> do<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.430> right<00:00:47.640> you'll<00:00:47.820> slip

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
while but if you do it right you'll slip

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.390 
while but if you do it right you'll slip
right<00:00:48.269> through<00:00:48.739> now<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.800> must<00:00:50.070> go<00:00:50.220> to<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
right through now you must go to the

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.009 
right through now you must go to the
pipe<00:00:50.670> furthest<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.269> left<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.809> then

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019 
pipe furthest to the left and then

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.890 
pipe furthest to the left and then
you'll<00:00:52.170> be<00:00:52.199> warp<00:00:52.589> to<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.769> -<00:00:53.220> world<00:00:53.780> when<00:00:54.780> you

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
you'll be warp to the - world when you

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.689 
you'll be warp to the - world when you
complete<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.470> glitch<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.070> game<00:00:56.100> tells<00:00:56.550> you

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
complete this glitch the game tells you

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.670 
complete this glitch the game tells you
that<00:00:56.850> you're<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.120> world-<00:00:57.540> 1<00:00:58.050> which<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.500> where

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
that you're in world- 1 which is where

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.009 
that you're in world- 1 which is where
the<00:00:58.800> glitches<00:00:59.040> name<00:00:59.399> comes<00:00:59.699> from<00:01:00.000> when<00:01:00.900> you

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019 
the glitches name comes from when you

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:02.570 
the glitches name comes from when you
play<00:01:01.229> through<00:01:01.470> the<00:01:01.500> -<00:01:01.890> world<00:01:02.159> you'll<00:01:02.369> loop

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.580 
play through the - world you'll loop

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.460 
play through the - world you'll loop
through<00:01:02.879> an<00:01:03.000> identical<00:01:03.570> version<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.019> world<00:01:04.229> 2

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
through an identical version of world 2

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.330 
through an identical version of world 2
-<00:01:04.710> over<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.309> over<00:01:05.580> again<00:01:05.729> until<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.360> die<00:01:07.340> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
- over and over again until you die the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.679 
- over and over again until you die the
reason<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.820> glitch<00:01:09.060> occurs<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.659> because

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
reason this glitch occurs is because

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.359 
reason this glitch occurs is because
when<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.290> sneak<00:01:10.560> through<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.799> blocks<00:01:11.130> in

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
when you sneak through the blocks in

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.700 
when you sneak through the blocks in
world<00:01:11.580> 1<00:01:11.820> -<00:01:12.119> there<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.600> no<00:01:12.780> data<00:01:13.020> placed<00:01:13.409> at<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
world 1 - there is no data placed at the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.440 
world 1 - there is no data placed at the
warp<00:01:13.920> zone<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:14.970> brings<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.299> the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
warp zone so it brings you to the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.390 
warp zone so it brings you to the
default<00:01:15.990> level<00:01:16.229> which<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:16.979> case<00:01:17.220> is

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
default level which in this case is

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.090 
default level which in this case is
world<00:01:17.640> 36<00:01:18.320> the<00:01:19.320> reason<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.740> looks<00:01:19.920> like

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
world 36 the reason it looks like

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.859 
world 36 the reason it looks like
negative<00:01:20.520> one<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:20.850> because<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.299> programmers

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
negative one is because the programmers

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.100 
negative one is because the programmers
made<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.200> number<00:01:22.470> panel<00:01:22.890> display<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:24.110> now

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
made the number panel display that now

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.390 
made the number panel display that now
the<00:01:25.170> minus<00:01:25.560> world<00:01:25.770> may<00:01:25.950> not<00:01:26.100> seem<00:01:26.369> very

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
the minus world may not seem very

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.700 
the minus world may not seem very
interesting<00:01:27.299> but<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.570> Japanese<00:01:28.110> version<00:01:28.590> is

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
interesting but the Japanese version is

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:38.870 
interesting but the Japanese version is
another<00:01:28.979> story<00:01:37.250> after<00:01:38.250> performing<00:01:38.790> the

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
another story after performing the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.790 
another story after performing the
glitch<00:01:39.120> on<00:01:39.300> the<00:01:39.390> Japanese<00:01:39.930> Famicom<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.710> are

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
glitch on the Japanese Famicom you are

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.219 
glitch on the Japanese Famicom you are
sent<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.130> world<00:01:41.340> negative<00:01:41.760> one<00:01:41.940> yet<00:01:42.150> again<00:01:42.480> but

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
sent to world negative one yet again but

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.630 
sent to world negative one yet again but
this<00:01:43.380> time<00:01:43.590> you're<00:01:43.800> in<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.950> distorted<00:01:44.340> version

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
this time you're in a distorted version

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.580 
this time you're in a distorted version
of<00:01:44.909> world<00:01:45.150> 1-3<00:01:45.810> where<00:01:46.140> there<00:01:46.290> are<00:01:46.409> random

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
of world 1-3 where there are random

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.440 
of world 1-3 where there are random
Bowser<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.250> peach<00:01:47.490> sprites<00:01:47.850> everywhere<00:01:48.420> a

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
Bowser and peach sprites everywhere a

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.969 
Bowser and peach sprites everywhere a
messed<00:01:48.900> up<00:01:49.020> color<00:01:49.320> palette<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.860> you're

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
messed up color palette and you're

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.910 
messed up color palette and you're
swimming<00:01:50.310> if<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:52.110> make<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.650> flagpole

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
swimming if you make it to the flagpole

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.100 
swimming if you make it to the flagpole
you'll<00:01:53.340> be<00:01:53.460> transported<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.330> copy<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.870> world

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
you'll be transported to a copy of world

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.320 
you'll be transported to a copy of world
73<00:01:55.740> with<00:01:55.890> some<00:01:56.070> crazy<00:01:56.310> glitches<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.000> its<00:01:57.150> own

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
73 with some crazy glitches of its own

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.200 
73 with some crazy glitches of its own
then<00:01:58.290> we<00:01:58.470> finally<00:01:58.770> get<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.159> world<00:01:59.430> negative<00:01:59.909> 3

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
then we finally get to world negative 3

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.050 
then we finally get to world negative 3
which<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.420> similar<00:02:00.900> to<00:02:01.080> world<00:02:01.290> 4<00:02:01.590> 4<00:02:01.950> after<00:02:02.340> that

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
which is similar to world 4 4 after that
