style<00:04:13.780> which<00:04:14.049> doesn't<00:04:14.560> work<00:04:14.769> and<00:04:15.100> then

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
style which doesn't work and then

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.520 
style which doesn't work and then
they'll<00:04:16.239> just<00:04:16.450> make<00:04:16.570> another<00:04:16.630> new<00:04:17.109> gameplay

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
style there was Sonic Adventure after

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.220 
style there was Sonic Adventure after
like<00:04:21.220> a<00:04:21.250> game<00:04:21.580> or<00:04:21.789> two<00:04:21.820> that<00:04:22.180> fell<00:04:22.419> apart

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
like a game or two that fell apart

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.180
