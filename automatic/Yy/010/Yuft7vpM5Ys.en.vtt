00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
looks unnatural because the end always

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.190 
looks unnatural because the end always
does<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:38.640> where<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.090> here<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.720> that's

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.249 
move the thumb and put it in this kind
of<00:01:56.520> position<00:01:56.939> which<00:01:57.210> gives<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.780> all<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.049> very

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
of position which gives it all the very

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.899 
of position which gives it all the very
kind<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.590> natural<00:01:59.430> look<00:01:59.579> so<00:02:00.920> I'm<00:02:01.920> going<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.490> try

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
kind of natural look so I'm going to try

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.110 
kind of natural look so I'm going to try
out<00:02:03.119> what<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.810> can<00:02:04.049> do<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.619> as

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
out what I can do that and as

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.690 
out what I can do that and as
I've<00:02:05.300> only<00:02:05.540> had<00:02:05.720> it<00:02:05.780> for<00:02:05.930> a<00:02:06.110> couple<00:02:06.170> of<00:02:06.410> days<00:02:06.700> so

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
I've only had it for a couple of days so

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.020 
I've only had it for a couple of days so
I'm<00:02:08.119> not<00:02:08.390> very<00:02:08.510> trained<00:02:08.869> yet<00:02:09.820> so<00:02:10.820> it'll

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
I'm not very trained yet so it'll

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.280 
I'm not very trained yet so it'll
probably<00:02:11.060> look<00:02:11.570> very<00:02:11.810> clumsy<00:02:12.200> but<00:02:13.190> let's<00:02:14.290> see

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
probably look very clumsy but let's see

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.130 
probably look very clumsy but let's see
what<00:02:15.860> it<00:02:15.890> can<00:02:16.100> do<00:02:16.280> for<00:02:16.310> example<00:02:17.060> can<00:02:17.630> I<00:02:17.660> cut<00:02:17.960> a

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
what it can do for example can I cut a

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.130 
what it can do for example can I cut a
tomato<00:02:18.260> with<00:02:19.010> it
