00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Hello friends and good luck with you today 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.940
 I would like to make a video instruction on 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.550
 privat territory us servers 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.049
 minecraft this drive works almost 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:16.199
 on 80 percent of the servers that 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:19.289
 are the cis countries because on 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.359
 These servers are worth a world guard plugin 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.900
 which allows us to zaprivat 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.449
 territory this video I do specifically 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.869
 for those people who just recently 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.730
 logged in to Minecraft or just logged in 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:36.809
 play on the north mikecroft and don't know 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.520
 how to do this thing 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.110
 cover your territory so what 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.969
 let's probably get started in order to 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.590
 us at least something we provost territory 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.110
 I need to get an ax that I have 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.050
 now hands but you can get it 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:58.850
 special teams click on t selection 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.850
 chateau we enter here 2 slashes write want w 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:08.159
 ind0rill we get the usual wooden 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.439
 ax in hand also his device is just 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.540
 you can craft a scary second 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:17.280
 nothing terrible will be his 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.990
 just countries to craft but wooden 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.150
 you can't do anything with an ax 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.799
 because as you see we want 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.840
 cut down a tree and we have nothing 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.960

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.479

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:24.810
 down along with our blogs first 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:27.130

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:33.190
 secure territory itself for this we 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:35.800

 region saved as ham all friends 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.670
 Now I do not remember what kind of pigment 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.630
 check like a meniscus and seemingly and not 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:55.989
 thread is now seconds second or stick 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.569
 now one second there is no stick yet 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:02.939
 with skin 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:04.829
 thread low also does not want anything at all 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:06.749
 doesn't want to check the territory but 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:11.939
 this territory is one hundred percent secured 

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:16.829
 because the region we have survived for 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:18.949
 order to remove this selection because 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.840
 that it bothers us a little bit yes 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:26.789
 everyone will agree with me for this we 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:29.550
 we write 2 Sasha villages and we have a selection 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:32.430
 cleared now our private you somewhere 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.949
 from this unit and yes somewhere here this I 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.169
 I do not remember but this territory is locked 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:41.130
 here you can build your house with us 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:43.800
 add friends to this region to 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:52.020
 add a friend to the region we just need 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:05:00.289
 write a region a d member like and 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:05:07.159
 I remember from we write to them from a friend and we write 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:10.289
 the name of the region they stop no write 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:13.590
 region name and friend name yes yes 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.419
 friends, I made a little mistake in order to 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.860
 add 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:21.199
 any other in our region we 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:24.960
 we write just the region from dmb 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:30.659
 write the name of the region for example ham which 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:36.930
 we created and write the name of a friend there nickname 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:39.479
 and in our region a new one is added 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:43.400
 would the inhabitant we see that in the chat writes 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:45.949
 that the home region is updated well friends 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.389
