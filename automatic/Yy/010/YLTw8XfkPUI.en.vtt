00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
freestyle to be similar but they're

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.230

going<00:06:10.400> to<00:06:10.460> be<00:06:10.550> a<00:06:10.580> little<00:06:10.760> different<00:06:11.030> because

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
going to be a little different because

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.970 
going to be a little different because
obviously<00:06:11.480> it's<00:06:11.840> harder<00:06:12.140> to<00:06:12.170> get<00:06:12.320> throws<00:06:12.650> you

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:12.980 
obviously it's harder to get throws you

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.170 
obviously it's harder to get throws you
know<00:06:13.070> it's<00:06:13.190> hard<00:06:13.280> to<00:06:13.400> get<00:06:13.520> seven<00:06:13.820> points<00:06:14.090> in

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
know it's hard to get seven points in

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.700 
know it's hard to get seven points in
Greco<00:06:14.360> than<00:06:14.600> it<00:06:14.690> is<00:06:14.780> a<00:06:14.810> freestyle<00:06:15.320> yeah<00:06:15.470> i

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
Greco than it is a freestyle yeah i

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:16.840 
Greco than it is a freestyle yeah i
think<00:06:15.980> that<00:06:16.190> needs<00:06:16.490> to<00:06:16.580> be<00:06:16.670> a<00:06:16.700> little

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:16.850 
think that needs to be a little

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.520 
think that needs to be a little
different<00:06:17.120> in<00:06:17.360> the<00:06:17.630> throws<00:06:17.960> are<00:06:18.170> you<00:06:18.350> want

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.530 
different in the throws are you want

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.170 
different in the throws are you want
