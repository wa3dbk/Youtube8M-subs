exploding object so first on my hit's
Pierrot<00:00:13.160> to<00:00:13.400> the<00:00:13.460> top<00:00:13.640> right<00:00:14.920> put<00:00:15.920> it<00:00:16.039> right<00:00:16.129> in

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
Pierrot to the top right put it right in

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.689 
Pierrot to the top right put it right in
the<00:00:16.309> middle

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:16.699 
the middle

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.770 
the middle
it's<00:00:17.119> about<00:00:17.330> yay<00:00:17.660> maybe<00:00:18.289> so<00:00:19.210> then<00:00:20.210> next<00:00:20.450> i'ma

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:20.780 
it's about yay maybe so then next i'ma

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.240 
it's about yay maybe so then next i'ma
get<00:00:21.619> a<00:00:21.680> bomb<00:00:21.920> which<00:00:22.190> is<00:00:22.340> under<00:00:22.550> the<00:00:22.640> create<00:00:22.850> tab

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
get a bomb which is under the create tab

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.500 
get a bomb which is under the create tab
under<00:00:25.250> the<00:00:25.279> space<00:00:25.610> work<00:00:27.940> geometry<00:00:28.940> formable

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
under the space work geometry formable

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.959 
under the space work geometry formable
hit<00:00:29.869> bomb<00:00:32.020> somewhere<00:00:33.020> next<00:00:33.199> to<00:00:33.469> it<00:00:33.620> I<00:00:33.850> think<00:00:34.850> I

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
hit bomb somewhere next to it I think I

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:40.180 
hit bomb somewhere next to it I think I
hit<00:00:35.120> two<00:00:35.390> three<00:00:37.239> need<00:00:38.239> that

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
hit two three need that

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.250 
hit two three need that
then<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.730> next<00:00:41.969> one<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.329> go<00:00:42.449> to<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.600> bind<00:00:42.960> to

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
then the next one is to go to a bind to

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.150 
then the next one is to go to a bind to
space<00:00:43.559> war<00:00:43.829> button<00:00:44.160> just<00:00:45.000> click<00:00:45.270> on<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.449> one

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
space war button just click on that one

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.259 
space war button just click on that one
click<00:00:47.160> on<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.399> bomb<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:49.129> run<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.250> line<00:00:50.460> to

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
click on the bomb and run the line to

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.780 
click on the bomb and run the line to
the<00:00:51.390> spear<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.930> highlights<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.040> right

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
the spear and it highlights it and right

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.660 
the spear and it highlights it and right
then<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.329> should<00:00:54.360> have<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.839> bomb<00:00:55.019> exploding

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
then you should have the bomb exploding

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.950 
then you should have the bomb exploding
real<00:00:56.670> real<00:00:57.530> small<00:00:58.530> explosion<00:00:59.720> once<00:01:00.720> you<00:01:00.839> do

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
real real small explosion once you do

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.790 
real real small explosion once you do
that<00:01:01.970> select<00:01:02.970> object<00:01:05.420> modify<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.479> bomb<00:01:07.380> here

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
that select object modify the bomb here

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.700 
that select object modify the bomb here
which<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.670> right<00:01:08.909> there<00:01:08.940> and<00:01:09.390> on<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.500> top

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
which is right there and on the top

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.850 
which is right there and on the top
right<00:01:10.740> or<00:01:11.250> middle<00:01:12.149> right<00:01:12.300> you<00:01:12.660> can<00:01:12.840> adjust<00:01:13.710> the

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
right or middle right you can adjust the

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.290 
right or middle right you can adjust the
strength<00:01:14.130> which<00:01:14.789> is<00:01:15.090> I'll<00:01:15.570> put<00:01:15.750> 10<00:01:16.080> or<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.410> and

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
strength which is I'll put 10 or so and

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.919 
strength which is I'll put 10 or so and
the<00:01:18.300> spin<00:01:19.490> pretty<00:01:20.490> much<00:01:20.729> just<00:01:21.030> try<00:01:21.420> any<00:01:21.630> number

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:21.929 
the spin pretty much just try any number

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:24.499 
the spin pretty much just try any number
and<00:01:22.170> then<00:01:22.289> you<00:01:22.470> can<00:01:22.619> adjust<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.130> as<00:01:23.360> you<00:01:24.360> go

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
and then you can adjust it as you go

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.999 
and then you can adjust it as you go
along<00:01:24.539> because<00:01:25.229> you're<00:01:25.530> going<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.679> see<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
along because you're going to see the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.810 
along because you're going to see the
bomb<00:01:26.190> blowing<00:01:27.119> up<00:01:27.300> so<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:28.130> just<00:01:29.130> put<00:01:29.310> any<00:01:29.460> number

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
bomb blowing up so I just put any number

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.320 
bomb blowing up so I just put any number
actually<00:01:31.369> but<00:01:32.369> down<00:01:32.520> here<00:01:32.550> where<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.000> says

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.570 

denote<00:01:36.330> 8<00:01:36.539> that's<00:01:36.780> fine<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.289> then<00:01:37.950> there<00:01:38.429> it

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
denote 8 that's fine and then there it

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.430 
denote 8 that's fine and then there it
is<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.880> little<00:01:39.270> bit<00:01:39.390> stronger<00:01:39.659> explosion<00:01:40.289> this

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
is a little bit stronger explosion this

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.710 
is a little bit stronger explosion this
time<00:01:40.789> see<00:01:41.789> that<00:01:42.050> so<00:01:43.050> if<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.890> want<00:01:44.039> to<00:01:44.130> move<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
time see that so if you want to move the

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.249 
time see that so if you want to move the
bomb<00:01:45.720> over<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.800> explode<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.399> in<00:01:47.489> the<00:01:47.610> middle

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
bomb over to explode it in the middle

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.050 
bomb over to explode it in the middle
you<00:01:49.259> just<00:01:49.289> hit<00:01:49.709> move<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.340> move<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.880> bomb

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
you just hit move and move the bomb

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.830 
you just hit move and move the bomb
right<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.450> middle<00:01:51.660> of<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.590> spear<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.840> it

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
right in the middle of the spear and it

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.990 
right in the middle of the spear and it
blows<00:01:55.679> up<00:01:55.890> from<00:01:56.069> the<00:01:56.160> middle<00:01:56.310> inside<00:01:56.819> out<00:01:57.379> okay

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
blows up from the middle inside out okay

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.430 
blows up from the middle inside out okay
so<00:02:00.000> that's<00:02:00.179> a<00:02:00.300> quick<00:02:00.479> little<00:02:00.780> tutorial<00:02:00.899> on<00:02:01.289> how

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
so that's a quick little tutorial on how

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.819 
so that's a quick little tutorial on how
to<00:02:01.470> blow<00:02:02.160> up<00:02:02.310> an<00:02:02.429> object
