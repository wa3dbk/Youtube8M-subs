performance of the Civil car personally

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.540 
performance of the Civil car personally
I<00:00:29.690> think<00:00:29.720> it's<00:00:30.230> a<00:00:30.980> very<00:00:31.460> difficult<00:00:31.790> cut<00:00:32.390> in<00:00:32.599> a

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
I think it's a very difficult cut in a

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.210 
I think it's a very difficult cut in a
sense<00:00:34.550> of<00:00:34.700> beginner<00:00:35.180> cuts<00:00:35.480> because<00:00:36.410> this<00:00:36.950> is

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
sense of beginner cuts because this is

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.630 
sense of beginner cuts because this is
pretty<00:00:37.910> much<00:00:38.060> your<00:00:38.270> way<00:00:38.540> forward<00:00:39.370> into<00:00:40.370> some

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
pretty much your way forward into some

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.000 
pretty much your way forward into some
bigger<00:00:40.940> cuts<00:00:41.300> after<00:00:41.840> you've<00:00:42.530> learned<00:00:42.770> how<00:00:42.950> to

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
bigger cuts after you've learned how to

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:49.810 
bigger cuts after you've learned how to
do<00:00:43.280> this<00:00:44.260> so<00:00:46.570> also<00:00:47.570> some<00:00:48.110> information<00:00:48.710> the<00:00:49.460> top

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
so let's get into the tutorial for this

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.740 
so let's get into the tutorial for this
cup<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.260> to<00:01:34.350> start<00:01:34.500> off<00:01:34.830> you<00:01:35.580> are<00:01:35.610> going<00:01:35.940> to<00:01:36.150> be

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
cup so to start off you are going to be

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.149 
cup so to start off you are going to be
holding<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.140> cards<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.440> the<00:01:37.530> mechanic's<00:01:37.979> grip

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
holding the cards in the mechanic's grip

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.219 
holding the cards in the mechanic's grip
just<00:01:38.610> like<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.090> you're<00:01:39.630> going<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.840> create<00:01:40.110> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
just like so you're going to create the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.330 
just like so you're going to create the
z<00:01:40.560> formation<00:01:41.000> just<00:01:42.000> like<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:43.009> now<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.070> way

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
z formation just like that now the way

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.620 
z formation just like that now the way
to<00:01:44.400> do<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.940> you're<00:01:45.240> going<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.420> be<00:01:45.540> holding

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
to do this is you're going to be holding

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.080 
to do this is you're going to be holding
it<00:01:45.869> like<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.229> quite<00:01:46.770> loosely<00:01:47.190> and<00:01:47.850> you're

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
it like this quite loosely and you're

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.480 
it like this quite loosely and you're
going<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.300> come<00:01:48.450> up<00:01:48.479> with<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:48.810> finger<00:01:49.619> lifts

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
going to come up with this finger lifts

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.730 
going to come up with this finger lifts
up<00:01:50.670> two-thirds<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.450> cards<00:01:51.840> pivoting<00:01:52.530> on

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
up two-thirds of the cards pivoting on

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.399 
up two-thirds of the cards pivoting on
this<00:01:52.979> top<00:01:53.790> pointer<00:01:54.210> finger<00:01:54.509> just<00:01:54.990> like<00:01:55.080> that

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
this top pointer finger just like that

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.889 
this top pointer finger just like that
now<00:01:55.950> with<00:01:56.009> this<00:01:56.280> middle<00:01:57.270> finger<00:01:57.540> here<00:01:57.720> you're

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
now with this middle finger here you're

now with this middle finger here you're
going<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.110> lift<00:01:58.500> up<00:01:58.710> those<00:01:59.580> cards<00:02:00.030> there<00:02:00.240> so

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
going to lift up those cards there so

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.999 
going to lift up those cards there so
you've<00:02:00.539> now<00:02:00.690> got<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:00.869> z<00:02:01.110> formation<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.860> is

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
you've now got the z formation that is

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.029 
you've now got the z formation that is
your<00:02:02.160> Z<00:02:02.340> formation<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.509> can<00:02:03.690> also<00:02:04.039> take

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
your Z formation that you can also take

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.290 
your Z formation that you can also take
into<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.820> one<00:02:06.509> card<00:02:06.899> flourish<00:02:07.910> which<00:02:08.910> looks<00:02:09.179> a

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
into the one card flourish which looks a

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.540 
into the one card flourish which looks a
little<00:02:09.450> like<00:02:09.660> that<00:02:09.959> which<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.950> very<00:02:11.250> popular

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
little like that which is a very popular

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.500 
little like that which is a very popular
flourish<00:02:12.120> too<00:02:12.650> so<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.830> z<00:02:14.010> formation<00:02:14.510> like

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
flourish too so the z formation like

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.540 
flourish too so the z formation like
this<00:02:15.810> now<00:02:16.620> from<00:02:16.800> here<00:02:16.830> you're<00:02:17.130> going<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.400> use

this now from here you're going to use

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.000 
this now from here you're going to use
this<00:02:17.790> pointer<00:02:18.600> finger<00:02:18.900> again<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.319> break<00:02:19.830> that

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
this pointer finger again to break that

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.630 
this pointer finger again to break that
pack<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.400> up<00:02:20.489> just<00:02:21.269> like<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:22.640> you're

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
pack it up just like that and you're

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.360 
pack it up just like that and you're
going<00:02:23.850> to<00:02:23.940> almost<00:02:24.239> twist<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.930> cards<00:02:25.370> sideways

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
right wrist you're going to spin out and

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.960 
right wrist you're going to spin out and
you're<00:04:25.030> ending<00:04:25.660> up<00:04:25.950> having<00:04:26.950> to<00:04:27.190> push<00:04:27.640> those

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
you're ending up having to push those

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.210 
you're ending up having to push those
cars<00:04:28.390> through<00:04:28.750> like<00:04:28.930> that<00:04:29.230> so<00:04:29.890> you've<00:04:30.010> now<00:04:30.190> got

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
cars through like that so you've now got

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:37.559 
cars through like that so you've now got
this<00:04:33.210> just<00:04:34.210> like<00:04:34.419> that<00:04:34.690> and<00:04:35.340> from<00:04:36.340> here

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:37.569 
this just like that and from here

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:41.820 
this just like that and from here
you're<00:04:38.229> going<00:04:38.499> to<00:04:39.689> just<00:04:40.689> drop<00:04:41.080> those<00:04:41.349> cards<00:04:41.710> on

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
you're going to just drop those cards on

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.480 
you're going to just drop those cards on
their<00:04:42.039> leaving<00:04:42.550> this<00:04:42.879> packet<00:04:43.300> out<00:04:43.419> jogged

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
their leaving this packet out jogged

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.939 
their leaving this packet out jogged
pull<00:04:45.490> those<00:04:45.759> cards<00:04:46.300> in<00:04:46.559> dropping<00:04:47.559> them<00:04:47.830> on

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949 
pull those cards in dropping them on

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:50.429 
pull those cards in dropping them on
there<00:04:48.189> so<00:04:48.879> you're<00:04:49.059> now<00:04:49.179> basically<00:04:49.779> left<00:04:50.199> with

00:04:50.429 --> 00:04:50.439 
there so you're now basically left with

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:53.399 
there so you're now basically left with
this<00:04:50.649> which<00:04:50.889> is<00:04:51.039> about<00:04:51.249> a<00:04:51.550> third<00:04:52.389> a<00:04:52.659> third<00:04:52.689> and

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:53.409 
this which is about a third a third and

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:58.409 
this which is about a third a third and
a<00:04:53.469> third<00:04:53.499> right<00:04:54.309> here<00:04:55.439> as<00:04:56.439> you<00:04:56.709> can<00:04:56.740> see<00:04:57.419> this

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
a third right here as you can see this

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.600 
a third right here as you can see this
is<00:04:58.659> just<00:04:58.959> some<00:04:59.709> cards<00:05:00.099> in<00:05:00.189> the<00:05:00.279> middle<00:05:00.490> of<00:05:00.520> the

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
is just some cards in the middle of the

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.989 
is just some cards in the middle of the
pack<00:05:01.110> this<00:05:02.110> is<00:05:02.319> once<00:05:02.559> you've<00:05:02.860> dropped<00:05:03.279> these

00:05:03.989 --> 00:05:03.999 
pack this is once you've dropped these

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:08.510 
pack this is once you've dropped these
cards<00:05:04.539> here<00:05:05.369> onto<00:05:06.369> the<00:05:06.759> top<00:05:07.149> just<00:05:07.959> like<00:05:08.080> that

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
cards here onto the top just like that

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.129 
cards here onto the top just like that
now<00:05:09.520> with<00:05:09.909> this<00:05:10.029> hand<00:05:10.330> you're<00:05:10.509> going<00:05:10.689> to<00:05:10.809> come

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 
now with this hand you're going to come

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:15.540 
now with this hand you're going to come
in<00:05:12.209> spin<00:05:13.209> this<00:05:13.419> packet<00:05:13.899> out<00:05:14.020> and<00:05:14.369> you<00:05:15.369> could

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
in spin this packet out and you could

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.809 
in spin this packet out and you could
just<00:05:15.580> drop<00:05:16.029> it<00:05:16.209> on<00:05:16.330> top<00:05:16.360> like<00:05:16.899> that<00:05:17.789> but<00:05:18.789> I

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:18.819 
just drop it on top like that but I

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:21.559 
just drop it on top like that but I
think<00:05:18.939> a<00:05:19.209> more<00:05:19.360> elaborate<00:05:19.779> finish<00:05:20.229> is<00:05:20.550> better

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:21.569 
think a more elaborate finish is better

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:24.929 
think a more elaborate finish is better
so<00:05:22.569> if<00:05:22.869> you<00:05:23.080> are<00:05:23.169> capable<00:05:23.439> you<00:05:24.430> spin<00:05:24.789> this

00:05:24.929 --> 00:05:24.939 
so if you are capable you spin this

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:29.909 
so if you are capable you spin this
packet<00:05:25.389> out<00:05:26.159> like<00:05:27.159> this<00:05:27.490> and<00:05:28.649> you're<00:05:29.649> going<00:05:29.800> to
