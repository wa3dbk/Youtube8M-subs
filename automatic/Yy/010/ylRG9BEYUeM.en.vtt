00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:16.669
 well back to everyone on teletrading I am discacciate luca of the site www 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:18.539
 santi.it 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.150
 as we can see in the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.759
 imagine 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:29.029
 that we are living. that in the apache hold the real time quotations present 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.839
 on the site scholarship holders. it that you can constantly watch in any 

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:35.020
 moment 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.640
 the day 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.780
 today was a particularly heavy day 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.970
 for our bags 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.820
 in particular depero is vindicio star who lost 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:51.590
 is losing since it is 17 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:52.920
 eth0 5 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.550
 il2 64% then 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.550
 certainly a very very negative performance 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.960
 to contribute to the performance that jacket starting this morning 3 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.960
 negative lira was the opening of US stock exchanges 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.250
 which as we can see 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.080
 right now they are pretty bad since the down jones lose 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.290
 half moon% remained with a 94 essen p500 even that is generally a 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:24.369
 it indicates that everyone is so big 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.180
 in the descent instead typically more volatile than the nasdaq tired and I'm 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.410
 losing 98% moon 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:40.180
 certainly a very difficult time this given that by now tact is 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.740
 several several weeks 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.990
 the post is going down in particular 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.590
 US stock exchanges have reached the minimum 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.750
 aligning April to the charts 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.070
 of the other world indices 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.450
 in this graph we can see 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.340
 in fact the s in p500 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.340
 this is a three a graph of the then 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.119
 as you can see 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.779
 today the American stock market in this case is simple in that center 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:18.439
 he returned to the levels of 4 days ago so we are always in close proximity 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.689
 last summer's minimum at the party 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:26.729
 borrelli he had reported on previous highs 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.309
 and it would seem that given that 

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:33.309
 if we also look at weekly traffic 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.789
 these minimums were just bucatini 

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:42.329
 from the bearish candle of 2 weeks ago it looks like that 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:46.229
 the unnatural tar of this movement 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:49.489
 is indeed 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.700
 here where we see the horizontal line around 1327 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.519
 very likely 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.519
 that this happens precisely because it is a rupture 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:03.289
 of the minimums 

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:04.849
 of closures 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.849
 as we can see he came. here 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:09.899
 2 weeks ago 

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:12.799
 it didn't happen practically 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.489
 from the beginning of the rise in 2003 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.970
 therefore definitely a sign of strong weakness in this market 

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:27.169
 coinciding with the supra improve mortgage crisis obviously needs 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:27.839
 of 

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:29.779
 go down a lot 

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:34.510
 to make one of those famous cleanings that are done when there is too much 

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:37.029
 market optimism 

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:38.319
 we return 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.829
 % to see the bags that still remain 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.989
 negative of course 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:52.259
 and even the index nida a star trek game examples 500 still remain 

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:56.529
 a negative curiosity 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:00.179
 I wanted to show you 

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:02.209
 the 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.089
 the index 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:06.039
 background 

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:09.039
 of the mythical tuor em baffetto 

00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:15.189
 that surely and the mirror gives a situation certainly difficult because 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:18.189
 with you can see from last December 

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:21.019
 the berkshire hathaway background 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.740
 pasta is passed by 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.450
 150,000 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.370
 and passes dollars 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.110
 operation 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.559
 coming into these 

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:33.270
 days 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.919
 in a little over 100 thirty years this means a little loss 

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:40.539
 over 10% here 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:43.449
 coming back 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.900
 they really were 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.050
 few 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.780
 the moments when the berkshire hathaway lost this figure this percentage 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.819
 so surely this 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:57.469
 % tv 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:00.770
 feat. bagging that the crisis is its own 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:05.659
 % a crisis that involves everyone and therefore 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:09.030
 now as now the market is particularly of 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.909
 ficult 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:15.059
 and therefore we renew our usual advice that to pay attention 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.550
 I remember that 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.590
 I was interested 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.699
 to operate on 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.449

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:33.190
