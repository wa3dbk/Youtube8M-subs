made fun of me for even thinking of it
in<00:02:09.600> the<00:02:09.690> first<00:02:09.869> place<00:02:10.310> but<00:02:11.310> she<00:02:11.490> knows<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.670> my

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
in the first place but she knows that my

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.400 
in the first place but she knows that my
nose<00:02:12.000> was<00:02:12.270> kind<00:02:12.630> of<00:02:12.690> looking<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.290> little

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
nose was kind of looking a little

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.560 
nose was kind of looking a little
different<00:02:13.770> looking<00:02:14.150> she<00:02:15.150> didn't<00:02:15.300> know<00:02:15.390> why

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
different looking she didn't know why

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.050 
different looking she didn't know why
and<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.290> told<00:02:16.590> her<00:02:16.710> why<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.160> I<00:02:17.640> guess<00:02:17.820> there's<00:02:18.000> a

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
and I told her why and I guess there's a

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.190 
and I told her why and I guess there's a
sigh<00:02:18.240> i<00:02:18.270> have<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.690> look<00:02:18.810> it<00:02:18.930> up<00:02:18.960> it<00:02:19.110> was

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
sigh i have to look it up it was

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.870 
sigh i have to look it up it was
actually<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.440> science<00:02:19.770> behind<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.190> most<00:02:20.700> of

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
actually a science behind it most of

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.260 
actually a science behind it most of
your<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.930> cartilage<00:02:22.350> in<00:02:22.950> your<00:02:23.010> nose<00:02:23.460> is<00:02:23.760> uh<00:02:23.790> I

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
your the cartilage in your nose is uh I

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.200 
your the cartilage in your nose is uh I
guess<00:02:24.660> water<00:02:25.100> so<00:02:26.100> I<00:02:26.130> guess<00:02:26.370> if<00:02:26.490> you<00:02:26.580> exert<00:02:26.940> that

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
guess water so I guess if you exert that

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.320 
guess water so I guess if you exert that
much<00:02:27.800> pressure<00:02:28.800> over<00:02:29.340> through<00:02:29.850> time<00:02:30.060> it

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
much pressure over through time it

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.480 
much pressure over through time it
doesn't<00:02:30.510> hurt<00:02:31.010> it's<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.040> little<00:02:32.250> uncomfortable

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
doesn't hurt it's a little uncomfortable

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.070 
doesn't hurt it's a little uncomfortable
in<00:02:32.820> the<00:02:32.910> very<00:02:33.090> beginning<00:02:33.240> but<00:02:33.630> you<00:02:33.720> get<00:02:33.840> used

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
in the very beginning but you get used

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.210 
in the very beginning but you get used
to<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:35.480> like<00:02:36.480> I<00:02:36.660> in<00:02:37.410> overtime<00:02:37.770> I<00:02:37.830> guess<00:02:38.040> it<00:02:38.190> does

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
to it like I in overtime I guess it does

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.010 
to it like I in overtime I guess it does
kinda<00:02:41.220> just<00:02:41.490> remould<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.270> remote<00:02:42.690> your<00:02:42.870> nose<00:02:42.990> a

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
kinda just remould a remote your nose a

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.000 
kinda just remould a remote your nose a
little<00:02:43.170> bit<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.590> it's<00:02:43.710> an<00:02:43.860> amazing<00:02:45.890> it's<00:02:46.890> an

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
little bit and it's an amazing it's an

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.660 
little bit and it's an amazing it's an
amazing<00:02:47.810> alternative<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:49.130> getting<00:02:50.130> cut<00:02:50.370> open

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
amazing alternative to getting cut open

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.380 
amazing alternative to getting cut open
