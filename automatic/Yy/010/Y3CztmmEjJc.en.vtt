00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.829 

and<00:00:03.650> then<00:00:04.650> I<00:00:04.680> do<00:00:04.859> my<00:00:05.100> first<00:00:05.400> pass<00:00:06.089> on<00:00:06.450> lighting

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
and then I do my first pass on lighting

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.259 
and then I do my first pass on lighting
so<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.560> light<00:00:07.680> is<00:00:07.710> coming<00:00:08.010> from<00:00:08.130> upper<00:00:09.090> right

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
so the light is coming from upper right

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.379 
so the light is coming from upper right
so<00:00:10.200> it's<00:00:10.830> gonna<00:00:11.010> hit<00:00:11.280> this<00:00:11.429> tail<00:00:11.759> most<00:00:12.030> likely

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
so it's gonna hit this tail most likely

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.870 
so it's gonna hit this tail most likely
first<00:00:12.690> because<00:00:12.990> this<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.290> in<00:00:13.590> bending<00:00:14.370> towards

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
first because this is in bending towards

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.640 
first because this is in bending towards
the<00:00:15.059> camera<00:00:15.330> bending<00:00:15.809> towards<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.470> light

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
the camera bending towards the light

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.210 
the camera bending towards the light

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
here just added some dots did you know

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.300 
here just added some dots did you know

tutorial<00:01:50.729> I'm<00:01:50.790> trying<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.060> teach<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.360> bunch<00:01:51.509> of

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
tutorial I'm trying to teach a bunch of

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.780 
tutorial I'm trying to teach a bunch of
things<00:01:51.869> at<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.049> same<00:01:52.110> time<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:53.280> what<00:01:53.700> I'm

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
things at the same time so what I'm

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.039 
things at the same time so what I'm
doing<00:01:53.820> here<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.299> you're<00:01:54.479> trying<00:01:54.600> to

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
doing here is that you're trying to

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.959 
doing here is that you're trying to
teach<00:01:55.290> students<00:01:56.070> how<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.310> make<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.640> designs

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
teach students how to make it designs

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.880 
teach students how to make it designs
you<00:01:57.479> know<00:01:57.600> different<00:01:58.049> ways<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.439> make<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.680> read

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
you know different ways to make it read

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.010 
you know different ways to make it read
across<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.399> board<00:01:59.640> so<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:00.570> case<00:02:00.810> we've

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
across the board so in this case we've

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.959 
across the board so in this case we've
got<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.170> very<00:02:01.409> long<00:02:01.680> shape<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.490> kind<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.820> goes

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
got a very long shape that kind of goes

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.120 
got a very long shape that kind of goes
across<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.479> screen<00:02:03.600> here<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.229> we<00:02:04.829> want<00:02:05.040> the

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
across the screen here and we want the

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.300 
across the screen here and we want the
users<00:02:05.490> are<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.969> kind<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.210> go<00:02:06.329> across<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:07.020> so<00:02:07.310> we

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
users are to kind of go across it so we

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.169 
users are to kind of go across it so we
have<00:02:08.429> one<00:02:08.610> way<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.759> do<00:02:09.000> it

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
have one way to do it

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.479 
have one way to do it
and<00:02:09.360> also<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:10.530> shape<00:02:10.739> is<00:02:10.890> made<00:02:11.069> out<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.340> this

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
and also the shape is made out of this

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.589 
and also the shape is made out of this
right<00:02:11.790> it's<00:02:11.940> got<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.090> lot<00:02:12.270> of

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
right it's got a lot of

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.989 
right it's got a lot of
cut<00:02:13.170> lines<00:02:13.379> like<00:02:13.590> this<00:02:13.769> so<00:02:14.189> the<00:02:14.549> tendency<00:02:14.760> is

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:14.999 
cut lines like this so the tendency is

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:17.149 
cut lines like this so the tendency is
to<00:02:15.180> make<00:02:15.329> the<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.450> read<00:02:16.019> this<00:02:16.140> way<00:02:16.349> so<00:02:16.799> what<00:02:17.069> we

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
to make the I read this way so what we

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.530 
to make the I read this way so what we
want<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.370> do<00:02:17.519> is<00:02:17.639> we<00:02:17.700> make<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:17.969> we<00:02:18.299> want<00:02:18.480> to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
want to do is we make the we want to

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.000 
want to do is we make the we want to
make<00:02:18.659> the<00:02:18.749> eyes<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:19.079> also<00:02:19.290> go<00:02:19.409> this<00:02:19.590> way<00:02:19.769> so<00:02:19.829> you

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
make the eyes to also go this way so you

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.160 
make the eyes to also go this way so you
create<00:02:20.370> some<00:02:20.549> contrasting<00:02:21.180> shapes<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.749> using

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
create some contrasting shapes and using

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.069 
create some contrasting shapes and using
these<00:02:22.260> kind<00:02:22.499> of<00:02:22.560> bioluminescence<00:02:22.999> dots<00:02:24.079> right

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
these kind of bioluminescence dots right

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.920 
these kind of bioluminescence dots right
it<00:02:25.590> brings<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.069> viewers<00:02:26.370> eye<00:02:26.579> across<00:02:27.329> the

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
it brings the viewers eye across the

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.670 
it brings the viewers eye across the
creature<00:02:28.139> like<00:02:28.829> this<00:02:29.040> way<00:02:29.250> going<00:02:30.239> this<00:02:30.389> way

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
creature like this way going this way

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.679 
creature like this way going this way
right<00:02:31.680> which<00:02:32.280> makes<00:02:32.519> a<00:02:32.639> nice<00:02:32.790> read<00:02:33.239> and<00:02:33.540> it

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:33.689 
right which makes a nice read and it

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:36.559 
right which makes a nice read and it
also<00:02:33.840> contracts<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.920> shape<00:02:35.579> here<00:02:36.120> very<00:02:36.480> very

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
also contracts the shape here very very

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.720 
also contracts the shape here very very
nicely<00:02:37.609> okay

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
nicely okay

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.640 
nicely okay
and<00:02:38.819> also<00:02:39.269> it<00:02:39.480> points<00:02:39.930> everything<00:02:40.319> this<00:02:40.469> way

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
and also it points everything this way

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.890 
and also it points everything this way
so<00:02:40.859> it<00:02:40.980> creates<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.310> nice<00:02:41.519> flow<00:02:41.969> this<00:02:42.780> whole

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
so it creates a nice flow this whole

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.649 
so it creates a nice flow this whole
composition<00:02:43.200> has<00:02:43.530> this<00:02:43.680> nice<00:02:43.919> flow<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:45.540> make

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
composition has this nice flow to make

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:47.629 
composition has this nice flow to make
it<00:02:45.780> go<00:02:45.870> forward<00:02:46.290> this<00:02:46.590> guy's<00:02:46.769> going<00:02:47.069> forward

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:47.639 
it go forward this guy's going forward

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:49.970 
it go forward this guy's going forward
in<00:02:48.120> entertainment<00:02:48.930> especially<00:02:49.049> on<00:02:49.469> films

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
in entertainment especially on films

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.159 
in entertainment especially on films
it's<00:02:50.879> quite<00:02:51.060> important<00:02:51.449> to<00:02:51.480> know<00:02:51.659> which<00:02:51.810> ways

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:52.169 
it's quite important to know which ways

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:54.050 
it's quite important to know which ways
is<00:02:52.439> front<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.069> which<00:02:53.250> way<00:02:53.370> is<00:02:53.400> back<00:02:53.699> so<00:02:53.969> the

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
is front and which way is back so the

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.759 
is front and which way is back so the
audience<00:02:54.449> know<00:02:54.659> quickly<00:02:55.109> oh<00:02:55.139> that's<00:02:55.439> the<00:02:55.560> head

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
audience know quickly oh that's the head

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.229 
audience know quickly oh that's the head
therefore<00:02:56.099> it's<00:02:56.189> going<00:02:56.280> this<00:02:56.459> way<00:02:56.609> so<00:02:57.090> they

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
therefore it's going this way so they

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.159 
therefore it's going this way so they
don't<00:02:57.389> have<00:02:57.510> any<00:02:57.540> kind<00:02:57.780> of<00:02:57.870> misunderstanding

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:58.169 
don't have any kind of misunderstanding

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.129 
don't have any kind of misunderstanding
of<00:02:58.949> a<00:02:59.069> read<00:02:59.310> meaning<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:00.150> if<00:03:00.329> a<00:03:00.449> spaceship<00:03:00.900> or

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139 
of a read meaning that if a spaceship or

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.229 
of a read meaning that if a spaceship or
vehicle<00:03:02.010> is<00:03:02.069> going<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.370> certain<00:03:02.489> direction<00:03:02.969> you

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
vehicle is going a certain direction you

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.420 
vehicle is going a certain direction you
want<00:03:03.750> them<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:03.989> know<00:03:04.199> very<00:03:04.949> quickly<00:03:05.159> which

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
want them to know very quickly which

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.610 
want them to know very quickly which
ways<00:03:05.669> it's<00:03:06.030> going<00:03:06.419> and<00:03:06.540> also<00:03:07.169> probably<00:03:07.379> which

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
ways it's going and also probably which

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.409 
ways it's going and also probably which
side<00:03:07.859> is<00:03:08.040> on<00:03:08.159> so<00:03:08.310> is<00:03:08.370> it<00:03:08.489> a<00:03:08.519> bad<00:03:08.699> guy<00:03:08.909> good<00:03:09.239> guy

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:09.419 
side is on so is it a bad guy good guy

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:11.629 
side is on so is it a bad guy good guy
which<00:03:09.659> way<00:03:09.750> is<00:03:09.840> it<00:03:09.870> going<00:03:09.989> right<00:03:10.500> just<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.430> kind

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
which way is it going right just to kind

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:13.849 
which way is it going right just to kind
of<00:03:11.669> clarify<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.090> story<00:03:12.419> here<00:03:13.290> I<00:03:13.319> add<00:03:13.620> another

of clarify the story here I add another

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.949 
of clarify the story here I add another
level<00:03:14.099> of<00:03:14.280> lighting<00:03:14.849> here<00:03:15.239> we<00:03:15.329> start<00:03:15.719> to<00:03:15.810> bring

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
level of lighting here we start to bring

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.149 
level of lighting here we start to bring
in<00:03:16.079> the<00:03:16.139> highlights<00:03:16.500> we<00:03:16.680> start<00:03:16.889> to<00:03:16.949> bring<00:03:17.099> in

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
in the highlights we start to bring in

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.159 
in the highlights we start to bring in
some<00:03:17.280> pure<00:03:17.489> whites<00:03:17.790> so<00:03:18.269> in<00:03:18.389> here<00:03:18.750> we're

okay let's zoom out here

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.020 
okay let's zoom out here
and<00:03:40.230> this<00:03:40.590> is<00:03:40.740> something<00:03:40.890> I<00:03:41.040> added<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.370> want<00:03:41.910> to

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
and this is something I added to want to

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.790 
and this is something I added to want to
put<00:03:42.240> in<00:03:42.360> this<00:03:42.510> kind<00:03:42.690> of<00:03:42.840> glowy<00:03:43.110> stuff<00:03:43.590> because

put in this kind of glowy stuff because

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.130 
put in this kind of glowy stuff because
there's<00:03:44.070> this<00:03:44.610> butt<00:03:44.910> area<00:03:45.090> kind<00:03:45.570> of<00:03:45.720> reminds

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
there's this butt area kind of reminds

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.670 
there's this butt area kind of reminds
me<00:03:46.230> of<00:03:46.320> mosquitos<00:03:47.120> back<00:03:48.120> area<00:03:48.480> and<00:03:48.630> let's<00:03:49.470> just

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
me of mosquitos back area and let's just

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.590 
me of mosquitos back area and let's just
make<00:03:50.130> it<00:03:50.160> pop<00:03:50.550> out<00:03:50.730> by<00:03:50.970> adding<00:03:51.270> some<00:03:51.420> color

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
make it pop out by adding some color

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.420 
make it pop out by adding some color
because<00:03:51.870> this<00:03:52.050> does<00:03:52.260> work<00:03:52.560> without<00:03:52.860> it<00:03:53.190> so<00:03:53.340> if

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
because this does work without it so if

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.070 
because this does work without it so if
I<00:03:53.550> turn<00:03:53.760> on<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:54.090> previous<00:03:54.510> layer<00:03:54.720> as<00:03:54.870> you<00:03:54.930> can

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
I turn on the previous layer as you can

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.490 
I turn on the previous layer as you can
see<00:03:55.230> here<00:03:55.440> it<00:03:56.040> does<00:03:56.100> read<00:03:56.550> okay<00:03:57.060> if<00:03:57.870> i<00:03:58.110> zoom<00:03:58.140> out

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
see here it does read okay if i zoom out

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.250 
see here it does read okay if i zoom out
without<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.550> red<00:03:59.760> globe<00:04:00.150> but<00:04:00.780> just<00:04:01.110> want<00:04:01.230> to

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
without the red globe but just want to

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.780 
without the red globe but just want to
make<00:04:01.410> it<00:04:01.530> more<00:04:01.620> entertaining<00:04:01.860> make<00:04:02.310> make<00:04:02.760> it

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
make it more entertaining make make it

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.040 
make it more entertaining make make it
look<00:04:02.970> like<00:04:03.120> there's<00:04:03.300> something<00:04:03.570> going<00:04:03.930> on

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
look like there's something going on

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.660 
look like there's something going on
here<00:04:04.320> so<00:04:04.500> maybe<00:04:04.650> it's<00:04:04.830> filled<00:04:05.010> with<00:04:05.100> gas<00:04:05.340> and

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
here so maybe it's filled with gas and

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.520 
here so maybe it's filled with gas and
this<00:04:05.790> gas<00:04:06.000> is<00:04:06.240> some<00:04:06.690> reacting<00:04:07.230> to<00:04:07.410> the

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
this gas is some reacting to the

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.440 
this gas is some reacting to the
environment<00:04:07.980> so<00:04:08.040> it<00:04:08.130> turns<00:04:08.340> red<00:04:08.610> and<00:04:08.880> it<00:04:09.330> could

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
environment so it turns red and it could

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.660 
environment so it turns red and it could
be<00:04:09.510> some<00:04:09.690> kind<00:04:09.810> of<00:04:09.960> signal<00:04:10.350> device<00:04:10.670> somewhere

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
be some kind of signal device somewhere

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.370 
be some kind of signal device somewhere
not<00:04:12.000> and<00:04:12.360> also<00:04:12.690> just<00:04:12.870> makes<00:04:13.020> the<00:04:13.140> painting

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
not and also just makes the painting

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.750 
not and also just makes the painting
have<00:04:13.560> a<00:04:13.590> focal<00:04:14.010> point<00:04:14.040> so<00:04:14.310> if<00:04:14.370> you<00:04:14.490> zoom<00:04:14.670> out

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
have a focal point so if you zoom out

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.729 
have a focal point so if you zoom out
here<00:04:14.820> the<00:04:15.810> viewer<00:04:16.049> is<00:04:16.200> the<00:04:16.380> first<00:04:16.620> thing<00:04:16.709> that

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
here the viewer is the first thing that

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.280 
here the viewer is the first thing that
viewers<00:04:16.980> gonna<00:04:17.160> see<00:04:17.430> is<00:04:17.700> this<00:04:18.060> area<00:04:18.810> here

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
viewers gonna see is this area here

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.770 
viewers gonna see is this area here
where<00:04:19.860> the<00:04:20.040> red<00:04:20.610> and<00:04:20.820> orange<00:04:21.060> glow<00:04:21.330> happens

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
where the red and orange glow happens

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.930 
where the red and orange glow happens
and<00:04:22.110> also<00:04:22.830> as<00:04:22.920> a<00:04:22.950> designer<00:04:23.340> I'm<00:04:23.640> trying<00:04:23.880> to

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
and also as a designer I'm trying to

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.190 
and also as a designer I'm trying to
make<00:04:24.060> these<00:04:24.180> make<00:04:24.390> sense<00:04:24.420> even<00:04:24.780> though<00:04:24.960> I'm

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
make these make sense even though I'm

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.750 
make these make sense even though I'm
coming<00:04:25.650> up<00:04:25.740> with<00:04:25.890> these<00:04:25.980> on<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:26.220> fly<00:04:26.460> when<00:04:26.700> I

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
coming up with these on the fly when I

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.430 
coming up with these on the fly when I
teach<00:04:27.030> these<00:04:27.240> without<00:04:27.840> any<00:04:28.170> kind<00:04:28.320> of

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
teach these without any kind of

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.650 
teach these without any kind of
pre-planning<00:04:29.160> really<00:04:29.400> I<00:04:29.550> still<00:04:30.360> try<00:04:30.450> to<00:04:30.510> make

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
pre-planning really I still try to make

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.510 
pre-planning really I still try to make
the<00:04:30.720> design<00:04:30.990> somewhat<00:04:31.410> believable<00:04:31.680> so<00:04:32.400> in

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
the design somewhat believable so in

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.130 
the design somewhat believable so in
this<00:04:32.670> case<00:04:32.970> you<00:04:33.540> know<00:04:33.630> let<00:04:33.750> me<00:04:33.840> just<00:04:33.990> draw

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
this case you know let me just draw

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.360 
this case you know let me just draw
another<00:04:34.200> drawing<00:04:34.590> here<00:04:35.250> a<00:04:36.980> side<00:04:37.980> view<00:04:38.160> of<00:04:38.220> this

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
another drawing here a side view of this

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.660 
another drawing here a side view of this
warm<00:04:38.730> creature<00:04:39.330> would<00:04:39.540> look<00:04:40.100> maybe<00:04:41.100> something

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
warm creature would look maybe something

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.050 
warm creature would look maybe something
like<00:04:41.870> this<00:04:42.870> route<00:04:43.140> the<00:04:43.230> tail<00:04:43.700> it's<00:04:44.700> got<00:04:44.820> his

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
like this route the tail it's got his

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.930 
like this route the tail it's got his
little<00:04:45.210> horns<00:04:45.780> eyes<00:04:46.400> kind<00:04:47.400> of<00:04:47.460> like<00:04:47.550> a<00:04:47.610> shrimp

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
little horns eyes kind of like a shrimp

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
little horns eyes kind of like a shrimp
thing<00:04:48.690> here<00:04:49.100> right<00:04:50.100> so<00:04:50.610> the<00:04:50.730> idea<00:04:51.030> was<00:04:51.360> in<00:04:51.780> my

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
thing here right so the idea was in my

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.020 
thing here right so the idea was in my
own<00:04:52.170> head<00:04:52.410> I<00:04:52.440> guess<00:04:52.770> when<00:04:52.920> I<00:04:52.980> was<00:04:53.030> sketching

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
own head I guess when I was sketching

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
own head I guess when I was sketching
this<00:04:54.330> that<00:04:55.170> when<00:04:55.800> it's<00:04:56.040> in<00:04:56.250> lower<00:04:57.050> atmosphere

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
this that when it's in lower atmosphere

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.010 
this that when it's in lower atmosphere
or<00:04:58.410> it<00:04:58.710> kind<00:04:59.040> of<00:04:59.130> wants<00:04:59.280> to<00:04:59.340> drop<00:04:59.640> lower<00:05:00.020> it

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
or it kind of wants to drop lower it

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.380 
or it kind of wants to drop lower it
kind<00:05:01.380> of<00:05:01.530> seals<00:05:02.040> up<00:05:02.340> these<00:05:02.520> kind<00:05:02.910> of<00:05:02.970> plates

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
kind of seals up these kind of plates

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.510 
kind of seals up these kind of plates
around<00:05:03.810> his<00:05:03.930> body<00:05:04.170> that<00:05:04.530> you<00:05:04.590> see<00:05:04.800> here<00:05:05.040> yeah

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
around his body that you see here yeah

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.400 
around his body that you see here yeah
so<00:05:06.030> if<00:05:06.150> you<00:05:06.180> ever<00:05:06.330> wants<00:05:06.600> to<00:05:06.690> go<00:05:06.840> higher<00:05:07.140> what

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
so if you ever wants to go higher what

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.260 
so if you ever wants to go higher what
it<00:05:07.530> does<00:05:07.710> it<00:05:07.920> kind<00:05:08.130> of<00:05:08.190> expands<00:05:08.700> out<00:05:09.000> these

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
it does it kind of expands out these

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.430 
it does it kind of expands out these
plates<00:05:09.630> like<00:05:10.080> so<00:05:11.840> you<00:05:12.840> know<00:05:12.930> and<00:05:13.200> maybe

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
plates like so you know and maybe

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.350 
plates like so you know and maybe
releasing<00:05:14.040> some<00:05:14.250> sort<00:05:14.550> of<00:05:14.610> gas<00:05:14.850> or<00:05:15.150> letting

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
releasing some sort of gas or letting

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.690 
releasing some sort of gas or letting
the<00:05:15.450> gas<00:05:15.660> expand<00:05:16.260> so<00:05:16.800> its<00:05:16.920> body<00:05:17.160> compensates

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
the gas expand so its body compensates

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.780 
the gas expand so its body compensates
for<00:05:18.000> that<00:05:18.210> by<00:05:18.390> expanding<00:05:18.870> these<00:05:19.020> panels

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
for that by expanding these panels

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.510 
for that by expanding these panels
therefore<00:05:20.790> allowing<00:05:21.030> this<00:05:21.600> creature<00:05:22.050> to<00:05:22.290> have

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
therefore allowing this creature to have

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.060 
therefore allowing this creature to have
lift<00:05:23.520> going<00:05:24.000> upwards<00:05:24.750> you<00:05:25.560> know<00:05:25.680> it<00:05:25.860> doesn't

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
lift going upwards you know it doesn't

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.800 
lift going upwards you know it doesn't
it<00:05:26.370> sort<00:05:26.610> of<00:05:26.640> makes<00:05:26.820> sense<00:05:27.000> visually<00:05:27.510> it<00:05:27.630> makes

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
it sort of makes sense visually it makes

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.380 
it sort of makes sense visually it makes
sense<00:05:28.050> in<00:05:28.290> a<00:05:28.440> way<00:05:28.470> and<00:05:28.860> that's<00:05:29.220> good<00:05:29.460> in<00:05:29.700> the

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
sense in a way and that's good in the

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.060 
sense in a way and that's good in the
kind<00:05:30.600> of<00:05:30.630> work<00:05:30.780> we<00:05:30.930> do<00:05:31.110> is<00:05:31.260> that<00:05:31.440> visually<00:05:31.950> we

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
kind of work we do is that visually we

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.770 
kind of work we do is that visually we
could<00:05:32.220> tell<00:05:32.490> this<00:05:32.970> creature<00:05:33.240> has<00:05:33.450> some<00:05:33.630> kind

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
could tell this creature has some kind

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.780 
could tell this creature has some kind
of<00:05:33.810> change<00:05:34.200> in<00:05:34.500> his<00:05:34.560> body<00:05:35.130> when<00:05:35.370> it's<00:05:35.460> going<00:05:35.610> up

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
of change in his body when it's going up

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.310 
of change in his body when it's going up
and<00:05:35.970> down<00:05:36.180> right<00:05:36.870> and<00:05:36.990> it's<00:05:37.110> great<00:05:37.230> for

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
and down right and it's great for

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.750 
and down right and it's great for
animation<00:05:37.890> it's<00:05:38.040> great<00:05:38.160> for<00:05:38.280> storytelling

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
animation it's great for storytelling

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.280 
animation it's great for storytelling
and<00:05:39.120> also<00:05:39.330> you<00:05:39.420> can<00:05:39.540> add<00:05:39.660> this<00:05:39.810> in<00:05:39.990> some<00:05:40.110> kind

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.290 
and also you can add this in some kind

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.750 
and also you can add this in some kind
of<00:05:40.320> plot<00:05:40.530> line<00:05:40.800> maybe<00:05:41.070> the<00:05:41.220> hero<00:05:41.400> can<00:05:41.580> throw<00:05:41.730> a

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
of plot line maybe the hero can throw a

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.250 
of plot line maybe the hero can throw a
grenade<00:05:42.030> in<00:05:42.150> there<00:05:42.270> and<00:05:42.420> it<00:05:42.510> seals<00:05:42.750> up<00:05:43.020> and<00:05:43.170> it

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
grenade in there and it seals up and it

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.480 
grenade in there and it seals up and it
blows<00:05:43.410> up<00:05:43.470> you<00:05:44.010> know<00:05:44.130> something<00:05:44.400> something

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
blows up you know something something

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.800 
blows up you know something something
like<00:05:44.640> that<00:05:44.850> it<00:05:44.970> gives<00:05:45.090> it<00:05:45.360> opens<00:05:45.660> up

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
like that it gives it opens up

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.230 
like that it gives it opens up
possibilities<00:05:46.140> for<00:05:46.920> ideas<00:05:47.430> and<00:05:47.640> for<00:05:48.210> the

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
possibilities for ideas and for the

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.790 
possibilities for ideas and for the
audience<00:05:48.660> it<00:05:48.900> gives<00:05:49.140> them<00:05:49.229> something<00:05:49.380> cool<00:05:49.680> to

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
audience it gives them something cool to

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.910 
audience it gives them something cool to
look<00:05:49.950> at<00:05:50.130> and

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:50.920 
look at and

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.780 
look at and
way<00:05:51.100> somewhat<00:05:51.790> believable<00:05:52.150> design<00:05:53.020> right

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
way somewhat believable design right

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.450 
way somewhat believable design right
okay<00:05:54.840> so<00:05:55.840> here<00:05:56.050> I<00:05:56.080> asked<00:05:56.350> some<00:05:56.590> micro<00:05:57.100> strains

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
okay so here I asked some micro strains

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.850 
okay so here I asked some micro strains
on<00:05:57.670> tops<00:05:57.880> I<00:05:58.150> mean<00:05:58.330> little<00:05:58.930> details<00:05:59.320> to<00:05:59.530> say

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
on tops I mean little details to say

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.200 
on tops I mean little details to say
that<00:06:00.070> I<00:06:00.100> mean<00:06:00.220> when<00:06:00.460> it's<00:06:00.550> opened<00:06:00.820> up<00:06:00.910> there's

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
that I mean when it's opened up there's

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.670 
that I mean when it's opened up there's
some<00:06:01.360> stuff<00:06:01.810> still<00:06:02.020> on<00:06:02.110> the<00:06:02.200> outside<00:06:02.500> of<00:06:02.620> the

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
some stuff still on the outside of the

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.560 
some stuff still on the outside of the
skin<00:06:02.980> so<00:06:03.130> it's<00:06:03.280> not<00:06:03.340> completely<00:06:03.520> exposed<00:06:04.330> to

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570 
skin so it's not completely exposed to

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.800 
skin so it's not completely exposed to
the<00:06:04.660> elements<00:06:04.780> and<00:06:06.150> here<00:06:07.150> I<00:06:07.180> asked<00:06:07.570> some

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
the elements and here I asked some

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.960 
the elements and here I asked some
atmosphere<00:06:08.410> to<00:06:08.710> kind<00:06:08.920> of<00:06:09.010> push<00:06:09.220> the<00:06:09.400> values<00:06:09.790> of

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970 
atmosphere to kind of push the values of

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.880 
atmosphere to kind of push the values of
the<00:06:10.090> head<00:06:10.300> area<00:06:10.510> back<00:06:10.930> you<00:06:11.170> can<00:06:11.290> see<00:06:11.410> here<00:06:11.740> it's

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:11.890 
the head area back you can see here it's

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.860 
the head area back you can see here it's
getting<00:06:12.010> quite<00:06:12.310> dark<00:06:12.610> and<00:06:12.850> this<00:06:13.330> head<00:06:13.630> is

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
getting quite dark and this head is

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.190 
getting quite dark and this head is
further<00:06:14.710> from<00:06:15.310> me<00:06:15.700> than<00:06:15.940> this<00:06:16.090> tail<00:06:16.420> so<00:06:16.990> these

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.200 
further from me than this tail so these

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.140 
further from me than this tail so these
two<00:06:17.410> values<00:06:17.800> I<00:06:17.920> don't<00:06:18.100> want<00:06:18.250> to<00:06:18.400> share<00:06:18.700> you<00:06:18.970> see

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
two values I don't want to share you see

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.030 
two values I don't want to share you see
if<00:06:19.240> we<00:06:19.330> turn<00:06:19.510> to<00:06:19.630> black<00:06:19.780> and<00:06:19.990> white<00:06:20.080> here<00:06:20.350> right

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:21.040 
if we turn to black and white here right

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.960 
if we turn to black and white here right
now<00:06:21.130> that<00:06:21.160> head<00:06:21.490> is<00:06:21.580> actually<00:06:21.790> has<00:06:21.880> a<00:06:21.910> very

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:21.970 
now that head is actually has a very

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.120 
now that head is actually has a very
dark<00:06:22.330> value<00:06:22.780> so<00:06:22.960> I<00:06:22.990> pull<00:06:23.230> back<00:06:23.260> so<00:06:23.830> actually

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.130 
dark value so I pull back so actually

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.320 
dark value so I pull back so actually
looks<00:06:24.250> like<00:06:24.340> the<00:06:24.430> head<00:06:24.700> is<00:06:24.850> in<00:06:24.880> front<00:06:25.180> of<00:06:25.240> the

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330 
looks like the head is in front of the

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.360 
looks like the head is in front of the
camera<00:06:25.690> versus<00:06:26.080> a<00:06:26.110> tail<00:06:26.410> by<00:06:26.950> putting<00:06:27.250> an

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
camera versus a tail by putting an

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.280 
camera versus a tail by putting an
atmosphere<00:06:27.880> in<00:06:28.000> here<00:06:28.030> I<00:06:28.210> push<00:06:28.510> the<00:06:28.660> head<00:06:28.840> back

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:29.290 
atmosphere in here I push the head back

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:33.000 
atmosphere in here I push the head back
into<00:06:29.860> the<00:06:30.160> distance<00:06:30.580> and<00:06:31.450> this<00:06:32.380> last<00:06:32.620> layer<00:06:32.830> is

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.010 
into the distance and this last layer is

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.760 
into the distance and this last layer is
just<00:06:33.130> some<00:06:33.310> very<00:06:33.610> very<00:06:33.940> small<00:06:34.300> hair<00:06:35.200> and<00:06:35.470> micro

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:35.770 
just some very very small hair and micro

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.680 
just some very very small hair and micro
details<00:06:36.160> all<00:06:36.790> right<00:06:36.910> this<00:06:37.210> opinion<00:06:37.450> is<00:06:37.480> quite

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:37.690 
details all right this opinion is quite

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.150 
details all right this opinion is quite
low<00:06:37.840> res<00:06:38.080> but<00:06:38.380> it's<00:06:38.500> higher<00:06:38.680> than<00:06:38.710> the<00:06:38.890> other

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.160 
low res but it's higher than the other

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.710 
low res but it's higher than the other
ones<00:06:39.430> I've<00:06:39.580> done<00:06:39.730> usually<00:06:40.090> in<00:06:40.180> class<00:06:40.330> I<00:06:40.570> do<00:06:40.630> a

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 
ones I've done usually in class I do a

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.080 
ones I've done usually in class I do a
very<00:06:40.930> very<00:06:41.800> rough<00:06:42.160> painting<00:06:42.580> usually<00:06:42.910> about

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.090 
very very rough painting usually about

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.170 
very very rough painting usually about
1000<00:06:43.990> to<00:06:44.080> 1400<00:06:44.770> pixels<00:06:44.860> wide<00:06:45.280> this<00:06:45.970> one<00:06:46.150> I

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
1000 to 1400 pixels wide this one I

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.260 
1000 to 1400 pixels wide this one I
doubled<00:06:46.600> it<00:06:46.630> to<00:06:46.800> 2,800<00:06:47.800> pixels<00:06:48.340> so<00:06:48.640> if<00:06:48.970> I<00:06:49.090> did

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270 
doubled it to 2,800 pixels so if I did

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.930 
doubled it to 2,800 pixels so if I did
an<00:06:49.390> image<00:06:49.630> size<00:06:49.840> you<00:06:50.080> can<00:06:50.230> see<00:06:50.260> here<00:06:50.500> it's<00:06:51.040> 2800

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:51.940 
an image size you can see here it's 2800

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.180 
an image size you can see here it's 2800
for<00:06:52.750> my<00:06:52.870> more<00:06:53.440> finished<00:06:53.800> paintings<00:06:54.100> I

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:54.190 
for my more finished paintings I

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.280 
for my more finished paintings I
generally<00:06:54.520> go<00:06:54.610> to<00:06:54.670> about<00:06:54.880> 4,000<00:06:55.540> 5,000<00:06:56.110> pixels

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:56.290 
generally go to about 4,000 5,000 pixels

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.080 
generally go to about 4,000 5,000 pixels
so<00:06:56.800> this<00:06:56.950> one's<00:06:57.100> consider<00:06:57.460> still<00:06:57.700> quite<00:06:57.880> low

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.090 
so this one's consider still quite low

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.420 
so this one's consider still quite low
but<00:06:58.390> enough<00:06:59.020> details<00:06:59.440> allow<00:06:59.740> me<00:06:59.890> to<00:07:00.040> zoom<00:07:00.070> in

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:00.430 
but enough details allow me to zoom in

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.360 
but enough details allow me to zoom in
here<00:07:00.640> and<00:07:00.910> add<00:07:01.590> microscopic<00:07:02.590> things<00:07:02.860> so<00:07:03.100> let

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:03.370 
here and add microscopic things so let

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.250 
here and add microscopic things so let
me<00:07:03.430> just<00:07:03.580> start<00:07:03.670> a<00:07:03.790> new<00:07:03.850> layer<00:07:04.150> here<00:07:04.420> so<00:07:04.600> you

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:05.260 
me just start a new layer here so you

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.870 
me just start a new layer here so you
can<00:07:05.350> see<00:07:05.470> here<00:07:05.710> and<00:07:05.860> but<00:07:06.250> zooming<00:07:06.520> is<00:07:06.670> great

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:06.880 
can see here and but zooming is great

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.880 
can see here and but zooming is great
because<00:07:07.120> they'll<00:07:07.300> kind<00:07:08.110> of<00:07:08.170> you<00:07:08.590> don't<00:07:08.740> need

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:08.890 
because they'll kind of you don't need

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:10.830 
because they'll kind of you don't need
to<00:07:09.010> kind<00:07:09.280> of<00:07:09.400> squint<00:07:09.940> your<00:07:10.090> eyes<00:07:10.150> to<00:07:10.570> do<00:07:10.690> these

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:10.840 
to kind of squint your eyes to do these

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.420 
to kind of squint your eyes to do these
details<00:07:11.230> on<00:07:11.500> like<00:07:11.650> traditional<00:07:12.040> paintings

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:12.430 
details on like traditional paintings

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.460 
details on like traditional paintings
rather<00:07:12.610> go<00:07:12.850> in<00:07:12.970> and<00:07:13.120> kind<00:07:13.300> of<00:07:13.420> squint<00:07:14.140> around

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:14.470 
rather go in and kind of squint around

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:15.750 
rather go in and kind of squint around
so<00:07:14.860> this<00:07:15.010> way<00:07:15.130> I<00:07:15.160> could<00:07:15.340> just<00:07:15.490> add<00:07:15.610> these

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:15.760 
so this way I could just add these

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.590 
so this way I could just add these
