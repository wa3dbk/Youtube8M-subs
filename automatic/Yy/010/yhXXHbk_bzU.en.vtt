hey<00:00:01.589> guys<00:00:01.829> this<00:00:02.460> is<00:00:02.520> my<00:00:02.760> next<00:00:02.970> tutorial<00:00:03.629> it's

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
hey guys this is my next tutorial it's

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.920 
hey guys this is my next tutorial it's
gonna<00:00:04.080> be<00:00:04.259> about<00:00:04.350> camera<00:00:05.069> movements<00:00:05.670> so<00:00:06.359> I'm

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
gonna be about camera movements so I'm

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.900 
gonna be about camera movements so I'm
gonna<00:00:07.080> do<00:00:07.290> a<00:00:07.319> short<00:00:08.750> example<00:00:09.750> of<00:00:10.910> panning

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
gonna do a short example of panning

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.440 
gonna do a short example of panning
around<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:13.309> object<00:00:14.309> that<00:00:14.580> you<00:00:14.700> are<00:00:14.730> animating

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
around a object that you are animating

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.250 
around a object that you are animating
so<00:00:16.410> what<00:00:16.590> you<00:00:16.680> go<00:00:16.800> do<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.820> pan<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.900> move<00:00:19.109> the

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
so what you go do to pan is to move the

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.750 
so what you go do to pan is to move the
camera<00:00:19.730> really<00:00:20.730> slightly<00:00:22.369> every<00:00:23.369> shot<00:00:23.670> you

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
camera really slightly every shot you

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.980 
camera really slightly every shot you
take<00:00:23.960> so<00:00:24.960> if<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.590> take<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.859> shot<00:00:26.099> now<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.990> then

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
take so if you take a shot now and then

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.410 
take so if you take a shot now and then
you<00:00:28.050> just<00:00:28.080> slightly<00:00:28.590> move<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.980> camera<00:00:29.420> and

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
you just slightly move the camera and

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.440 
you just slightly move the camera and
then<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.720> take<00:00:30.869> another<00:00:30.990> photo<00:00:32.450> slightly

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
then you take another photo slightly

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.420 
then you take another photo slightly
move<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.750> camera<00:00:34.050> again<00:00:34.230> take<00:00:34.950> another<00:00:35.190> photo

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
move the camera again take another photo

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.080 
move the camera again take another photo
and<00:00:36.350> just<00:00:37.350> keep<00:00:37.680> doing<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:38.070> until<00:00:39.200> you<00:00:40.200> get

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
and just keep doing that until you get

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.729 
and just keep doing that until you get
around<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.780> whole<00:00:43.460> figure<00:00:45.320> I'll<00:00:46.320> get<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
around the whole figure I'll get to the

00:00:46.739 --> 00:01:03.750 
around the whole figure I'll get to the
place<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:47.039> want

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.230 

this<00:01:04.299> is<00:01:04.420> a<00:01:04.449> really<00:01:04.780> good<00:01:04.930> technique<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:07.210> use

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
this is a really good technique to use

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.270 
this is a really good technique to use
in<00:01:07.840> your<00:01:07.960> animation<00:01:08.500> it<00:01:08.710> just<00:01:08.890> gives<00:01:08.979> another

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
in your animation it just gives another

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.300 
in your animation it just gives another
depth<00:01:09.850> to<00:01:10.210> your<00:01:10.240> skills<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:11.799> can<00:01:11.920> use<00:01:12.070> it<00:01:12.220> to

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
depth to your skills you can use it to

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.870 
depth to your skills you can use it to
get<00:01:12.460> different<00:01:12.670> angles<00:01:13.030> but<00:01:13.840> without<00:01:14.880> jumping

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
get different angles but without jumping

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.870 
get different angles but without jumping
from<00:01:16.210> one<00:01:16.420> shot<00:01:16.630> to<00:01:16.659> another<00:01:17.640> it's<00:01:18.640> really

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
from one shot to another it's really

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:41.330 
from one shot to another it's really
useful

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.580 

and<00:01:42.340> there<00:01:42.520> you<00:01:42.580> go<00:01:42.990> in<00:01:43.990> a<00:01:44.140> completely

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
and there you go in a completely

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.740 
and there you go in a completely
different<00:01:44.740> angle<00:01:45.040> and<00:01:46.000> it<00:01:46.150> will<00:01:46.270> look<00:01:46.390> very

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
different angle and it will look very

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.220 
different angle and it will look very
smooth<00:01:47.140> if<00:01:47.530> you<00:01:47.740> do<00:01:47.920> it<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:49.390> way<00:01:49.540> I<00:01:49.570> do<00:01:49.750> with

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
smooth if you do it the way I do with

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.820 
smooth if you do it the way I do with
very<00:01:50.500> small<00:01:50.800> movements<00:01:51.370> every<00:01:51.940> shot<00:01:52.120> you<00:01:52.210> take

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
very small movements every shot you take

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.870 
very small movements every shot you take
I'm<00:01:53.830> going<00:01:54.040> to<00:01:54.100> show<00:01:54.280> you<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:54.700> finished

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
I'm going to show you the finished

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.530 
I'm going to show you the finished
product

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
product

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.680
