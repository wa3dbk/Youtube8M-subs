now wipe all the parts down including
the<00:00:56.039> bearing<00:00:56.399> cups<00:00:58.430> inspect<00:00:59.430> your<00:00:59.520> bearings

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
the bearing cups inspect your bearings

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.639 
the bearing cups inspect your bearings
for<00:01:00.000> corrosion<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.719> excessive<00:01:01.170> wear<00:01:01.410> if

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
for corrosion and excessive wear if

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.280 
for corrosion and excessive wear if
they're<00:01:02.579> clean<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:02.940> they<00:01:03.210> feel<00:01:03.420> smooth<00:01:03.809> then

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
they're clean and they feel smooth then

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.440 
they're clean and they feel smooth then
you<00:01:04.439> can<00:01:04.619> proceed<00:01:04.799> with<00:01:04.979> reassembly<00:01:05.729> if<00:01:05.909> not

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
you can proceed with reassembly if not

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.410
