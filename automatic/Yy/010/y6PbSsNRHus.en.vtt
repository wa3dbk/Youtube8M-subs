00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.330
 Hello such are already triumphs as 

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.830
 he was recording a sample video with 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.070
 from samsung galaxy s 6 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:12.490
 in real 4k resolution I think it 's 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.410
 ultra hd is not hd like the same 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.679
 previous 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.999
 today I tell you this resolution 4k native 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:21.789
 with rec the city of mexico is a 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:23.579
 small shows the limit to record in 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.079
 This type of resolution is 5 minutes 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:27.460
 with nothing recorded here and for me 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.019
 so that this since in the quality there is 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.539
 on youtube that you put was of 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:34.750
 maximum and if that computer to the 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:38.530
 back these he was moving I think 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:41.110
 that they can see it more than 1440 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.770
 pixels would still fail to say that the 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:47.020
 double the resolution by appreciating each 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.950
 note that in this mode it is not active 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:53.240
 the shoes per second 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.730
 is recorded at 30 steps per second 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.730
 I tell them that resolution shows h 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.170
 ending with the 16 megapixel camera 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.170
 it's already in the lye case 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.810
 again and that you judge 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.890
 then studied in turn and military without 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:18.929
 nothing as it would end the format of a 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.929
 laxe is going to serve as octave 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.870
 the cons that I compressed a 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.490
 but still little 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.390
 it looks pretty pretty good here in 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.610
 display 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.610
 h the samsung galaxy s 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.350
 good the old ones convinced 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:59.920
 resolution forgiveness recorded video 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:02.460
 4k for android and see you until the 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.460
 next
