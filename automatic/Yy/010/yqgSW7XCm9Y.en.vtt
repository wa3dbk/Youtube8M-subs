 2 r as proven by the 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.540
 certifications by the tests in the 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.700
 major international journals and 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.310
 by the confidence of the shaq pilots 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.940
 quality of the helmets shark makes them 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:39.070
 so sure that they are indisputably 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:41.200
 proven innovation means seeking 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.750
 for new technical solutions 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.210
 constant improvement in products and 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.560
 technology transfer between 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.560
 line models 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:55.140
 shark helmets are always self 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.140
 surpassing and also the competitors 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:05.040
 the design and originality of the graphics 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.400
 They make every helmet and become 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.130
 keep yourself a market leader 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.890
 constantly develops systems that 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.100
 not only more complete but also 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.250
 simpler and more economical and once again 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.400
 has overcome the quality issue by launching 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.680
 newest race r pro that has many 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.410
 differentials of other helmets with 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.940
 much more comfort and safety 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:35.310
 perfection the cruel r tea pro new model 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.530
 made of Kevlar carbon fiber was 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.520
 developed primarily for the 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:45.540
 pilots of the world championships moto gb 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:48.930
 wsbk moto2 among others 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.050
 this new shark model uses technology 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.720
 cfd using wind tunnel tests 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.200
 so we had to attest that the 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.990
 essential elements to ensure the 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.950
 global and ergonomic features 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.479
 lightness stability comfort accuracy and 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.090
 aerodynamics 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.970
 rcr own question on which motorcycles 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.370
 sports both a walk as 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.190
 races in training competitions 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.459
 breath since he's treading on likes of 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.459
 sportiness 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.460
 I think the main focus is the part of the 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.230
 it uses conventional fiber with 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.270
 carbon fiber most want to see 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.790
 prejudice with this greater protection 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.770
 especially under him only has one 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.930
 200 stamp for anyone looking for 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.550
 performance changing positioning 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.050
 in pine I think it is a great 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.360
 differential at the end of the day people 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.270
 feel the difference here in the neck 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.420
 the cooling part is fantastic it 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.850
 has six weapons entry points seven 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.460
 points of extraction from the air to which 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.710
 it is stopped inside the head then you 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.810
 gets a chilling but very 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.970
 best passion until the temperature of the 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.390
 pilot and sports world the people 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.050
 gets is working between 38 degrees 39 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.060
 degrees 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.000
 when the habit of refrigeration people 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.380
 until it drops to 36 degrees both comes 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.990
 gets inside the helmet 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.840
 so for those looking for sportiness is the 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.270
 helmet and think the car boss 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.700
 part of the visor also the visor also 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.590
 distortion 01 higher thickness in 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.990
 front thickness a little thinner 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.870
 on the side so you have the same picture 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.450
 any view of your vision is a 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.670
 want to accelerate on the track does not have much 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.850
 able and this is the ideal partner for your 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.850
 head 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.110
 another great differential the internal part 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.330
 It is not only a single Styrofoam block is 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.400
 divided into shares participate a lot 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.040
 better this energy and also has a 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.860
 ead system to internal letters of 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.840
 12cm thick one styrofoam 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.610
 Conventional block form the two 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.650
 four millimeters here you have two 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.650
 senses to decrease this speed 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.020
 impact is improving a lot and this 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.680
 grace deceleration activity of the 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.380
 head 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.390
 Chaco's main goal is to 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.610
 make available different products that 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.020
 wears the century with its purpose 

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.070
 especially the style of your 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.530
 motorcycle 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.750
 I wear several helmets as 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:31.490
 test I'm going to do is a key but 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.490
 the right product for your goal 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.840
 shaq I use and recommend
