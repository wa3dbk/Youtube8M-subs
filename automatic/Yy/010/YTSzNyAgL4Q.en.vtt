about half an inch or so to make my

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.849 
about half an inch or so to make my
spout<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.969> then<00:01:00.539> i'm<00:01:00.719> going<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.050> use<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.620> rest

spout and then i'm going to use the rest

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.240 
spout and then i'm going to use the rest
to<00:01:02.010> make<00:01:02.329> the<00:01:03.329> actual<00:01:03.650> handle<00:01:04.650> i'm<00:01:04.860> going<00:01:05.129> to

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
to make the actual handle i'm going to

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.450 
to make the actual handle i'm going to
use<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.519> cup<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.890> detergent<00:01:07.890> bottle<00:01:08.280> i'm

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
going to call a piece of the tape at an

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.950 
going to call a piece of the tape at an
angle<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.070> then<00:01:14.070> i'm<00:01:14.280> going<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.640> use<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.570> rest

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
angle and then i'm going to use the rest

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.020 
angle and then i'm going to use the rest
of<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.320> tape<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.280> i<00:01:17.369> can<00:01:17.520> make<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
of the tape so that i can make the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.390 
of the tape so that i can make the
handle<00:01:18.420> for<00:01:18.659> my<00:01:18.810> spout<00:01:19.140> now<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:20.009> not<00:01:20.220> an

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
handle for my spout now this is not an

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.850 
handle for my spout now this is not an
exact<00:01:20.850> science<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.450> will<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.259> cut<00:01:22.560> and

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
exact science you will have to cut and

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.899 
exact science you will have to cut and
then<00:01:23.700> make<00:01:24.119> sure<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.750> actually<00:01:24.960> fits<00:01:25.909> the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
then make sure that it actually fits the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.609 
then make sure that it actually fits the
next<00:01:27.240> thing<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.390> I'm<00:01:27.600> going<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.930> do<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.409> to

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
next thing that I'm going to do is to

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.069 
next thing that I'm going to do is to
make<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.950> handle<00:01:29.400> by<00:01:29.790> leaving<00:01:30.420> one<00:01:30.780> side

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
make the handle by leaving one side

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.319 
make the handle by leaving one side
straight<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.040> other<00:01:32.189> side<00:01:32.610> i'm<00:01:32.880> going<00:01:32.909> to

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
straight and the other side i'm going to

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.510 
straight and the other side i'm going to
gain<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.689> little<00:01:34.049> bit<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.470> put<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:34.979> an<00:01:35.070> angle<00:01:35.430> as

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
gain a little bit and put on an angle as

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.560 
gain a little bit and put on an angle as
well<00:01:36.799> i'm<00:01:37.799> going<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.310> attach<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.759> spout<00:01:39.270> by

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
well i'm going to attach the spout by

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.940 
well i'm going to attach the spout by
putting<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.960> little<00:01:40.140> bit<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.380> glue<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.710> the
