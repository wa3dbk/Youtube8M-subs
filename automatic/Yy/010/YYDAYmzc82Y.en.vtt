00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.460
 coca cola not the santa claus 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:10.080
 invented tomorrow and Christmas 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.370
 I have a real gift for you 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.690
 but today I thought I'll be whole again 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.219
 actually cool the whole time 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.120
 to look at myths over christmas 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.600
 and if they really are 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.390
 Anyway what should we be christmas 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.300
 the feast of love 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.160
 and if indeed it is like that 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.349
 much more people after christmas 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.430
 psychiatrist run as otherwise reason for it 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.560
 are not such high expectations 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.120
 were met and see broken 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.470
 many people are doing so much 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.460
 No stress at all 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.809
 have all the time without media 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.370
 tense mood and when he has a 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.019
 Bayernern gives small mistakes right away 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.400
 a dispute the number of 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.440
 is willing to divorce after christmas 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.420
 significantly higher than any other 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.320
 time in the year coca cola has the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.760
 Santa Claus invented 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.930
 is not the myth of 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.480
 Santa Claus is already clear 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.910
 much older than the company coca cola 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.989
 the santa claus is often called 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.820
 American import product seen 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.260
 because he uses the media from the usa too 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.760
 came to us while we were 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.500
 traditionally the christkind 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.899
 have always been traditional in the 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.250
 usa the Santa Claus but actually 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:09.960
 the Santa Claus is actually even 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.970
 in europe he is a derivative 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.800
 or he interpretation of 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.200
 Nicholas and was already in the nineteenth 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.000
 century so 1800 skis me dead in 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.670
 mentions any children's books 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.320
 until 1931 coca cola used the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.060
 Santa Claus for the first time as pr 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.530
 figure customers as we see this has 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.450
 Advertising campaign to date a pretty 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.460
 shape the picture on us 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.710
 at christmas you take to 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.930
 I'm definitely saying yes but it is 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.549
 False studies could prove that 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.170
 not true because you have many 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.850
 Candy at Christmas time is coming 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.229
 Make it as fast as you would 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.789
 take something but at the same time 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.530
 leads to a faster saturation 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.869
 not automatically less of 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.640
 the normal meals on it so it comes 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.990
 that even a day at sea is in other 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.569
 less than the end it is like 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.549
 actually made well in most 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:59.079
 at least the santa claus is the 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.079
 best selling chocolate figurine 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.700
 no, even the santa will be anybody 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:08.259
 but produced a billion times 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.299
 Nevertheless, he is only in second place 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.860
 on the other hand, the easter bunny is in first place 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:13.330
 that's because it's for 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.950
 Christmas time much more others 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.750
 sweets only the 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.640
 santa to easter but there are 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.989
 comparatively less and because of the 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.819
 Just a chocolate 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.060
 he is rather horny then 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.470
 more chocolate easter bunnies are allowed 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.069
 vegetarian actually chocolates 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.110
 easter bunny eat but age one 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.260
 billions of chocolate nicholas one 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.910
 billions that's almost 100 of the 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.110
 Sledge of the santa claus is from 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.110
 pulled pulled 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.519
 yes the returns the part of a miracle 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.840
 right after the myth of 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.879
 Santa Claus will be the site of 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.739
 Eight rewards are so likely 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.330
 because of that, because the zugtier of the 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.879
 again was always the reindeer 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.709
 however, before 1860 there were quite different 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:00.650
 for example dogs hare or 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.180
 even penguin so friends what did you think 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.560
 which myths were during which ones 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.540
 Wrong write that down in the 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.489
 I honestly say at 3 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.540
 besides, if you liked the video 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.069
 then I will be glad if you ever 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.390

 Advent calendar of course and that is 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.519
