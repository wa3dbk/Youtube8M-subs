00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.960 
as a bit of a test case and 11 fold
followed<00:02:25.620> all<00:02:25.770> my<00:02:25.920> instructions<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:26.850> the

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
followed all my instructions to the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.760 
followed all my instructions to the
letter<00:02:27.000> but<00:02:27.590> I<00:02:28.590> think<00:02:29.340> this<00:02:29.489> proves<00:02:29.790> that<00:02:30.120> if

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
letter but I think this proves that if

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.800 
letter but I think this proves that if
we<00:02:31.770> actually<00:02:32.580> go<00:02:33.150> through<00:02:33.450> with<00:02:33.630> this<00:02:33.750> and

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
we actually go through with this and

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.620 
we actually go through with this and
really<00:02:34.410> develop<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.400> because<00:02:35.790> we<00:02:36.120> want<00:02:36.480> to

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
really develop it because we want to

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.540 
really develop it because we want to
develop<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:37.200> we<00:02:37.380> put<00:02:37.620> all<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:37.890> little<00:02:38.040> subtle

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
develop it we put all the little subtle

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.880 
develop it we put all the little subtle
extras<00:02:39.060> in<00:02:39.209> this<00:02:39.750> will<00:02:39.900> turn<00:02:40.080> into<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.320> paradise

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
extras in this will turn into a paradise

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.280 
extras in this will turn into a paradise
and<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.760> permanent<00:02:42.330> paradise<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.050> that's<00:02:43.170> the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
and a permanent paradise and that's the

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.620 
and a permanent paradise and that's the
thing<00:02:43.470> we<00:02:43.590> need<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:44.130> show<00:02:44.430> people<00:02:44.459> we<00:02:45.269> can<00:02:45.480> make

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
thing we need to show people we can make

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.600 
thing we need to show people we can make
eight<00:02:45.870> sustainable<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:46.950> people<00:02:47.400> can<00:02:47.519> look

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
eight sustainable and people can look

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.330 
eight sustainable and people can look
after<00:02:47.940> themselves<00:02:48.230> as<00:02:49.230> if<00:02:49.410> Africans<00:02:50.040> we<00:02:50.160> could

through this and this can be all part of
a<00:03:22.440> knowledge<00:03:22.799> system<00:03:23.459> which<00:03:23.670> we<00:03:23.850> can<00:03:24.000> teach

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
a knowledge system which we can teach

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.970 
a knowledge system which we can teach
people<00:03:24.209> wherever<00:03:24.780> they<00:03:25.110> live<00:03:25.320> to<00:03:25.500> put<00:03:25.709> their

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
people wherever they live to put their

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.690 
people wherever they live to put their
particular<00:03:26.400> style<00:03:26.910> of<00:03:27.060> system<00:03:27.420> in<00:03:28.549> so<00:03:29.549> that's

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
particular style of system in so that's

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:40.170 
particular style of system in so that's
the<00:03:29.940> other<00:03:30.060> part

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.790 

so<00:03:41.180> here<00:03:41.480> we<00:03:41.600> have<00:03:41.720> our<00:03:41.870> mulch<00:03:42.140> trees<00:03:42.650> these

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
so here we have our mulch trees these

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.650 
so here we have our mulch trees these
are<00:03:42.860> fertilizing<00:03:43.550> trees<00:03:43.970> in<00:03:44.180> this<00:03:44.300> particular

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
are fertilizing trees in this particular

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.610 
are fertilizing trees in this particular
site<00:03:45.580> is<00:03:46.580> it<00:03:46.790> cut<00:03:47.090> you<00:03:47.690> can<00:03:47.780> see<00:03:47.840> the<00:03:48.170> previous

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
site is it cut you can see the previous

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.450 
site is it cut you can see the previous
cuts<00:03:50.260> they've<00:03:51.260> been<00:03:51.410> cut<00:03:51.680> and<00:03:51.860> dropped<00:03:52.250> as

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 
cuts they've been cut and dropped as

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.830 
cuts they've been cut and dropped as
fertilizer<00:03:52.940> and<00:03:53.750> their<00:03:53.930> roots<00:03:54.170> drop<00:03:54.560> nitrogen

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
fertilizer and their roots drop nitrogen

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.270 
fertilizer and their roots drop nitrogen
we<00:03:56.840> need<00:03:56.990> more<00:03:57.230> of<00:03:57.290> these<00:03:57.560> in<00:03:57.950> all<00:03:58.100> the

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
we need more of these in all the

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.950 
we need more of these in all the
agricultural<00:03:58.910> systems<00:03:59.360> because<00:03:59.690> this<00:03:59.840> is

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
agricultural systems because this is

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.610 
agricultural systems because this is
free<00:04:00.260> fertilizer<00:04:01.090> free<00:04:02.090> function<00:04:02.620> the

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
free fertilizer free function the

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.450 
free fertilizer free function the
censored<00:04:04.070> animals<00:04:06.010> it's<00:04:07.010> quite<00:04:07.250> of<00:04:07.400> the

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:07.460 
censored animals it's quite of the

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.030 
censored animals it's quite of the
mechanics<00:04:07.940> with<00:04:08.120> ecosystem<00:04:08.890> how<00:04:09.890> it

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
mechanics with ecosystem how it

mechanics with ecosystem how it
mechanically<00:04:10.700> functions<00:04:11.390> so<00:04:12.200> we<00:04:12.410> just<00:04:12.800> copy

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
mechanically functions so we just copy

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.460 
mechanically functions so we just copy
the<00:04:13.370> natural<00:04:13.790> system<00:04:14.240> and<00:04:14.780> bring<00:04:15.110> it<00:04:15.230> up<00:04:15.320> in

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
the natural system and bring it up in

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.920 
the natural system and bring it up in
our<00:04:15.590> direction<00:04:15.740> so<00:04:16.730> we<00:04:16.850> get<00:04:17.000> fruit<00:04:17.270> food<00:04:17.630> as<00:04:17.900> a

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
our direction so we get fruit food as a

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.080 
our direction so we get fruit food as a
function<00:04:18.470> my<00:04:19.130> product<00:04:19.580> so<00:04:21.850> here<00:04:22.850> we<00:04:22.970> have

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
function my product so here we have

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.090 
function my product so here we have
great<00:04:23.390> going<00:04:23.810> up<00:04:23.930> over<00:04:24.140> the<00:04:24.380> trellis<00:04:24.770> and<00:04:24.800> the

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
great going up over the trellis and the

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.150 
great going up over the trellis and the

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
trellis is over the swell and this well

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.700 
trellis is over the swell and this well
flooded<00:04:28.700> at<00:04:29.030> the<00:04:29.210> moment<00:04:29.630> and<00:04:29.780> that<00:04:30.380> water's

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
flooded at the moment and that water's

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.080

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
going to soak into the fruit trees but

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.840 
going to soak into the fruit trees but
it<00:04:32.810> makes<00:04:33.110> a<00:04:33.290> nice<00:04:33.440> scene<00:04:33.800> in<00:04:33.980> the<00:04:34.100> desert<00:04:34.460> we

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
it makes a nice scene in the desert we

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.730 
it makes a nice scene in the desert we
