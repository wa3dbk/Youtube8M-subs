problem if they can see the athletic
trainer<00:02:27.620> right<00:02:27.859> away<00:02:28.129> they<00:02:28.400> can<00:02:28.549> get

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
trainer right away they can get

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.649 
trainer right away they can get
evaluated<00:02:28.939> there<00:02:29.840> can<00:02:29.989> be<00:02:30.109> a<00:02:31.299> treatment<00:02:32.299> plan

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:32.659 
evaluated there can be a treatment plan

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:34.839 
evaluated there can be a treatment plan
set<00:02:32.989> up<00:02:33.019> and<00:02:33.349> a<00:02:33.950> lot<00:02:34.099> of<00:02:34.189> times<00:02:34.430> this<00:02:34.639> can

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
set up and a lot of times this can

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.390 
set up and a lot of times this can
prevent<00:02:35.239> injuries<00:02:36.230> from<00:02:36.560> getting<00:02:36.859> worse

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
prevent injuries from getting worse

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.720 
prevent injuries from getting worse
I<00:02:37.480> think<00:02:38.480> parents<00:02:38.870> should<00:02:39.469> be<00:02:39.730> challenging

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
I think parents should be challenging

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.789 
I think parents should be challenging
the<00:02:40.819> school<00:02:41.090> systems<00:02:41.540> when<00:02:42.019> they<00:02:42.049> provide<00:02:42.590> an

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
the school systems when they provide an

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.500 
the school systems when they provide an
opportunity<00:02:43.340> for<00:02:43.489> kids<00:02:43.639> to<00:02:43.760> participate<00:02:44.329> they

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
opportunity for kids to participate they

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.619 
opportunity for kids to participate they
should<00:02:44.689> also<00:02:44.870> be<00:02:45.049> providing<00:02:45.829> the<00:02:46.819> mechanism

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
should also be providing the mechanism

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.199 
should also be providing the mechanism
for<00:02:47.659> their<00:02:48.260> injured<00:02:48.859> athlete<00:02:49.280> to<00:02:49.459> get<00:02:49.879> care

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
for their injured athlete to get care

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.929 
for their injured athlete to get care
and<00:02:50.719> coaches<00:02:51.260> you<00:02:52.040> know<00:02:52.099> they're<00:02:52.340> going<00:02:52.519> to<00:02:52.639> be

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:52.939 
and coaches you know they're going to be

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.699 
and coaches you know they're going to be
right<00:02:53.329> there<00:02:53.659> on<00:02:53.689> the<00:02:53.959> field<00:02:54.199> so<00:02:54.349> they<00:02:54.500> do<00:02:54.560> have

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
right there on the field so they do have

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.890 
right there on the field so they do have

to have ownership of being able to

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.629 
to have ownership of being able to
deliver<00:02:57.260> that<00:02:57.469> first<00:02:57.709> level<00:02:58.069> of<00:02:58.159> first<00:02:58.400> aid

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639 
deliver that first level of first aid

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.509 
deliver that first level of first aid
but<00:02:59.299> also<00:02:59.689> be<00:03:00.530> smart<00:03:00.799> enough<00:03:01.010> not<00:03:01.189> to<00:03:01.370> go

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
but also be smart enough not to go

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.349 
but also be smart enough not to go
beyond<00:03:01.909> that<00:03:02.209> first<00:03:02.540> aid<00:03:02.900> provision<00:03:03.769> so<00:03:04.549> to

beyond that first aid provision so to

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:07.720 
beyond that first aid provision so to

have someone on site to be able to that

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.509 
have someone on site to be able to that
is<00:03:07.879> educated<00:03:08.480> to<00:03:08.599> provide<00:03:08.959> that<00:03:09.199> care<00:03:09.530> that's

is educated to provide that care that's
that's<00:03:10.939> even<00:03:11.269> more<00:03:11.449> critical<00:03:11.659> and<00:03:12.290> the

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
that's even more critical and the

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.570 
that's even more critical and the
parents<00:03:13.069> should<00:03:13.159> be<00:03:13.280> looking<00:03:13.579> at<00:03:13.699> that
