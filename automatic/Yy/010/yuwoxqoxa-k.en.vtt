with those loops here all right so so

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.699 
with those loops here all right so so
that's<00:02:54.430> basically<00:02:55.000> what<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.299> inside<00:02:55.780> has<00:02:56.260> so

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.170 
that's basically what the inside has so
you've<00:02:56.830> got<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.160> four<00:02:57.430> here<00:02:57.670> I<00:02:57.700> still<00:02:58.000> open

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
here and it's going one to keep separate

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.170 
here and it's going one to keep separate
and<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:08.590> outside<00:03:09.100> I<00:03:09.130> have<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:09.610> other<00:03:09.760> pocket

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
and the outside I have the other pocket

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.300 
and the outside I have the other pocket
so<00:03:10.360> one<00:03:10.570> pocket<00:03:10.810> in<00:03:11.110> two<00:03:11.260> pockets<00:03:11.680> in<00:03:11.769> the<00:03:11.950> four

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
so one pocket in two pockets in the four

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.930 
so one pocket in two pockets in the four
loops<00:03:12.910> on<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.930> inside<00:03:14.290> as<00:03:14.560> well<00:03:14.739> so<00:03:15.370> and<00:03:15.670> that

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
loops on the inside as well so and that

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.699 
loops on the inside as well so and that
is<00:03:16.209> basically<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:17.290> bag<00:03:18.160> in<00:03:18.370> a<00:03:18.430> nutshell<00:03:19.530> but<00:03:20.530> I
