 detectives can see his character or not 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:16.579
 the character is considered visible if he 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.769
 is on the line of sight of a detective and 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.400
 no obstacle blocks it 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.010
 overview 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.620

 characters sherlock holmes only sees 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.470
 one character from both does not see anyone 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.169
 if there are any visible characters 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.430
 mr jack and these characters are somewhat 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:39.019
 then all the quarters with invisible characters 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.209
 turn the picture with the character 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.519

 if in the current round mr jack 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.099
 appeared among the visible characters then he 

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:58.310
 does not get a round token 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:00.500
 after that the detective picks up everything 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.079
 action tokens roll over on 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.689
 back side since mr. jack 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:08.629
 players take turns choosing one action 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:10.639
 and perform it on the playing field in our 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:13.389
 example after coup tokens 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:16.729

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:20.030
 If he is chosen by a detective, he can 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:23.090
 move any one character to 1 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.460

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:39.240
 without moving anyone 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:42.090

 this is an interesting puzzle game for two 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:29.929
 players there is no place for chance and 

00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:31.580
 it all depends on deduction and your 

00:06:29.929 --> 00:06:34.309
 ability to calculate their actions 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.319
 a few steps ahead the hardest 

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:38.599

 calculate the enemy's movement 

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:45.379
 otherwise criminals quickly 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:48.080
 will catch the core holds opponents 

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:50.209

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:58.039
 hours the situation can drastic 

00:06:56.479 --> 00:07:01.009
 way to change at any time 

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:03.080
