00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.980
 Hello everyone, welcome to my channel 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.940
 in this guide we will see how to change 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.940
 the case of an iphone 5 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.179
 we start with almost two screws 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.440
 this I call the block this way 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.920
 ok paying attention that here are the 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:07.340
 attached connectors we do a lot 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.720
 be careful if it doesn't break ok we'll go 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.970
 take away consider 20 that I do to you 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.180
 see these screws better than the 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:22.390
 same measure and this is different 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:22.390
 this when you sit down, be careful 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:56.520
 we will hear this stuck piece outside 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:59.970
 this force and let's take off the three 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.940
 LCD connectors for the glass and the 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.210
 front camera sense now that I am 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.210
 together 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.570
 ok the third one was this 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.370
 not disconnected from the drive anyway 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.920
 to you it will surely remain attached 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.959
 so just push down and yes 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.959
 off we wait for these two screws 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.019
 and this is the case of an iphone 5 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.519
 we take the house but this way 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:20.540
 we take the block and go and put 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.540
 all the connectors we start from this 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:50.340
 but to proceed to close for everything 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:53.700
 you can try at least the phone 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.040
 works ok 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.700
 let's take this piece that should be put with 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.700
 this way 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.510
 see the location because you have to stay 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.269
 very careful that the block does not fall ok 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.770
 with your fingers hold it in place with your 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.770
 thumbs keep this phase crushed 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.200
 now we can proceed to closure 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:15.600
 total 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:17.670
 on the other hand we always bring fans from 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.150
 part time because sometimes it remains 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:28.430
 slightly outside this leads ok 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:28.430
 you can also inside and then the sides 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.090
 how much tension that is all 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.430
 inside because it still happens that 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:50.250
 this part first is not slightly 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:53.180
 outside ok at the end we put the 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.180
 last two screws 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.730
 thanks to everyone, thanks for following me 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.180
 to the next 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.180
 Hi everyone
