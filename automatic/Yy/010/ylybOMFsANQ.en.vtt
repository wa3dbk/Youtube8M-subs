was<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.810> beginning<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.469> then<00:02:08.009> later<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.759> built

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
was the beginning and then later I built

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.290 
was the beginning and then later I built
a<00:02:09.899> Carl<00:02:10.470> Goldberg<00:02:11.190> Eagle<00:02:12.090> -<00:02:12.360> with

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
a Carl Goldberg Eagle - with

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.750 
a Carl Goldberg Eagle - with
Fox<00:02:13.660> 40<00:02:14.230> glow<00:02:14.470> engine<00:02:14.710> on<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.160> and<00:02:15.310> I<00:02:15.700> know

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
Fox 40 glow engine on it and I know

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.100 
Fox 40 glow engine on it and I know
that's<00:02:16.030> going<00:02:16.240> to<00:02:16.330> bring<00:02:16.540> back<00:02:16.690> a<00:02:16.750> lot<00:02:17.050> of

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
that's going to bring back a lot of

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.170 
that's going to bring back a lot of
memories<00:02:17.620> for<00:02:17.830> a<00:02:17.890> lot<00:02:18.100> of<00:02:18.250> you<00:02:18.400> as<00:02:18.580> well<00:02:18.880> and

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
memories for a lot of you as well and

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.380 
memories for a lot of you as well and
that's<00:02:19.810> what<00:02:20.110> I<00:02:20.170> learned<00:02:20.500> how<00:02:20.740> to<00:02:20.770> fly<00:02:21.100> a<00:02:21.670> full

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
that's what I learned how to fly a full

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.260 
that's what I learned how to fly a full
four<00:02:22.690> channel<00:02:23.140> model<00:02:24.010> airplane<00:02:24.460> on<00:02:24.610> but<00:02:25.030> once

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
four channel model airplane on but once

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.470 
four channel model airplane on but once
again<00:02:25.630> I<00:02:25.840> had<00:02:26.170> to<00:02:26.200> build<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:26.850> from<00:02:27.850> a<00:02:27.970> box<00:02:28.240> of

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
again I had to build that from a box of

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.930 
again I had to build that from a box of
sticks<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:29.170> here<00:02:30.070> look<00:02:30.280> at<00:02:30.370> this<00:02:30.520> one<00:02:30.760> this

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
sticks and here look at this one this

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.590 
sticks and here look at this one this
one<00:02:31.150> also<00:02:31.540> survived<00:02:32.020> this<00:02:32.950> I<00:02:33.250> built<00:02:33.460> in<00:02:33.670> 1990

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
one also survived this I built in 1990

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.850 
one also survived this I built in 1990
this<00:02:35.440> is<00:02:35.740> a<00:02:35.770> pilot<00:02:36.700> model<00:02:37.000> of<00:02:37.330> a<00:02:37.690> Pitts<00:02:38.050> biplane

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
this is a pilot model of a Pitts biplane

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.810 
this is a pilot model of a Pitts biplane
and<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:41.440> know<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:41.620> can<00:02:41.890> see<00:02:42.160> all<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.580> work

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
and you know you can see all the work

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.690 
and you know you can see all the work
that<00:02:42.850> went<00:02:43.300> into<00:02:43.480> building<00:02:44.110> this<00:02:44.260> with<00:02:45.010> balsa

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
that went into building this with balsa

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.030 
that went into building this with balsa
and<00:02:45.730> ply<00:02:45.910> wood<00:02:46.390> and<00:02:46.630> then<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:47.200> had<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:47.590> cover<00:02:47.890> it

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
and ply wood and then I had to cover it

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.610 
and ply wood and then I had to cover it
and<00:02:48.280> look<00:02:48.520> here<00:02:48.880> I<00:02:48.910> had<00:02:49.240> to<00:02:49.510> you<00:02:50.080> know<00:02:50.170> cut

these pieces of white covering to two

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.900 
these pieces of white covering to two
iron-on<00:02:54.820> to<00:02:55.540> get<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.930> stripes<00:02:56.710> on<00:02:56.980> but<00:02:57.790> you

had<00:03:09.850> time<00:03:10.210> for<00:03:10.540> model<00:03:11.410> airplanes<00:03:11.830> so<00:03:12.640> I<00:03:12.670> kind

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
had time for model airplanes so I kind

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.630 
had time for model airplanes so I kind
of<00:03:13.090> set<00:03:13.300> the<00:03:13.450> hobby<00:03:13.660> aside<00:03:14.110> but<00:03:14.560> about<00:03:15.220> four

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
of set the hobby aside but about four

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.690 
of set the hobby aside but about four
years<00:03:16.030> ago<00:03:16.270> I<00:03:16.690> decided<00:03:17.290> you<00:03:17.770> know<00:03:18.250> I<00:03:18.370> need<00:03:18.670> a

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
to get back into the Hobby and boy I

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.780 
to get back into the Hobby and boy I
could<00:03:24.160> not<00:03:24.489> believe<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.930> changes<00:03:26.580> that<00:03:27.580> had

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
things to put it together so now it's a

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.790 
things to put it together so now it's a
whole<00:04:09.790> new<00:04:10.030> ballgame<00:04:10.290> with<00:04:11.290> all<00:04:11.560> these
