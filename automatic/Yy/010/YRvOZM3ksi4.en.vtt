00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.340 
exploded my bonus or upgrade or whatever
you<00:02:57.400> want<00:02:57.610> to<00:02:57.700> call<00:02:57.850> it<00:02:57.910> was<00:02:58.630> that<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:59.200> whole

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
you want to call it was that the whole

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.070 
you want to call it was that the whole
screen<00:02:59.620> was<00:03:00.040> cleared<00:03:00.489> so<00:03:01.209> that's<00:03:01.450> why<00:03:01.630> all<00:03:01.660> the

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
screen was cleared so that's why all the

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.650 
screen was cleared so that's why all the
bombs<00:03:02.260> disappeared<00:03:02.890> there<00:03:03.099> okay<00:03:03.489> so<00:03:04.269> we'll<00:03:04.540> go

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
bombs disappeared there okay so we'll go

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.900 
bombs disappeared there okay so we'll go
to<00:03:04.720> main<00:03:05.110> menu<00:03:05.459> like<00:03:06.459> I<00:03:06.489> said<00:03:06.640> that<00:03:06.790> was<00:03:06.880> the

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
to main menu like I said that was the

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.059 
to main menu like I said that was the
first<00:03:07.209> level<00:03:07.390> there<00:03:07.810> obviously<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:08.890> higher

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
first level there obviously the higher

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.990 
first level there obviously the higher
the<00:03:09.599> level<00:03:10.599> the<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.890> trickier<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.519> gameplay

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
the level the the trickier the gameplay

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.229 
the level the the trickier the gameplay
is<00:03:14.430> but<00:03:15.430> for<00:03:15.580> the<00:03:15.640> most<00:03:15.790> part<00:03:15.910> this<00:03:16.120> is<00:03:16.180> a

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
is but for the most part this is a

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.330 
is but for the most part this is a
pretty<00:03:16.420> simple<00:03:16.690> game<00:03:17.049> obviously<00:03:17.980> it's<00:03:18.250> a

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
pretty simple game obviously it's a

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.970 
pretty simple game obviously it's a
simple<00:03:18.610> concept<00:03:18.790> you<00:03:19.330> put<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.780> you<00:03:20.650> match<00:03:20.799> the

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
simple concept you put the you match the

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.560 
simple concept you put the you match the
colors<00:03:21.280> you<00:03:21.430> put<00:03:21.610> the<00:03:21.700> bombs<00:03:21.910> where<00:03:22.299> the<00:03:22.390> right

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
colors you put the bombs where the right

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.150 
colors you put the bombs where the right
colors<00:03:22.900> are<00:03:23.109> in<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.320> hole<00:03:23.500> for<00:03:24.160> the<00:03:24.250> most<00:03:24.459> part

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
colors are in the hole for the most part

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.009 
colors are in the hole for the most part
see<00:03:27.160> here's<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.459> conveyor<00:03:28.239> belt<00:03:28.540> one<00:03:28.840> this

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
see here's the conveyor belt one this

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.740 
see here's the conveyor belt one this
one's<00:03:29.340> this<00:03:30.340> one's<00:03:30.400> kind<00:03:30.820> of<00:03:30.910> kind<00:03:31.359> of<00:03:31.510> a<00:03:31.600> cool

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
one's this one's kind of kind of a cool

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.229 
one's this one's kind of kind of a cool
one<00:03:32.019> here<00:03:32.410> so<00:03:33.400> you<00:03:33.489> can<00:03:33.640> see<00:03:33.670> the<00:03:33.940> conveyor

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
one here so you can see the conveyor

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.660 
one here so you can see the conveyor
belt<00:03:34.480> moving<00:03:34.810> along<00:03:35.019> there<00:03:35.350> and<00:03:35.680> you'll<00:03:36.370> put

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
belt moving along there and you'll put

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.470 
belt moving along there and you'll put
your<00:03:36.810> bombs<00:03:37.810> down<00:03:38.170> here<00:03:38.880> blue<00:03:39.880> ones<00:03:40.120> green

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
your bombs down here blue ones green

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.479 
your bombs down here blue ones green
ones<00:03:40.540> up<00:03:40.900> top<00:03:40.930> blue<00:03:41.590> ones<00:03:41.739> on<00:03:41.859> the<00:03:41.950> bottom<00:03:44.489> and

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
ones up top blue ones on the bottom and

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.039 
ones up top blue ones on the bottom and
obviously<00:03:45.910> it<00:03:46.060> gets<00:03:46.209> a<00:03:46.269> little<00:03:46.420> trickier<00:03:46.930> as

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
obviously it gets a little trickier as

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.590 
obviously it gets a little trickier as
you<00:03:47.170> go<00:03:47.319> along<00:03:47.609> if<00:03:48.609> you<00:03:48.730> want<00:03:48.940> that<00:03:49.000> white<00:03:49.359> one

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
you go along if you want that white one

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.970 
you go along if you want that white one
you<00:03:49.750> kind<00:03:49.930> of<00:03:49.959> put<00:03:50.170> that<00:03:50.350> white<00:03:50.560> one<00:03:50.769> in<00:03:50.920> the

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
you kind of put that white one in the

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.289 
you kind of put that white one in the
middle<00:03:51.220> there<00:03:51.549> hopefully<00:03:51.940> it<00:03:52.209> won't<00:03:54.299> get

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
middle there hopefully it won't get

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.920 
middle there hopefully it won't get
caught<00:03:56.459> so<00:03:57.459> it<00:03:57.579> got<00:03:57.700> slow<00:03:57.970> motion<00:03:58.000> now<00:03:58.569> so

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
caught so it got slow motion now so

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.660 
caught so it got slow motion now so
everything<00:03:59.260> is<00:03:59.319> moving<00:03:59.620> in<00:03:59.709> slow<00:03:59.980> mo<00:04:00.190> can<00:04:00.579> you

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
everything is moving in slow mo can you

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:07.229 
everything is moving in slow mo can you
see<00:04:00.819> that<00:04:01.000> there<00:04:04.950> so<00:04:05.950> that's<00:04:06.130> that<00:04:06.549> there<00:04:07.030> will

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
see that there so that's that there will

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.670 
see that there so that's that there will
go<00:04:07.329> back<00:04:07.450> to<00:04:07.569> the<00:04:07.660> main<00:04:07.840> menu

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:22.120 

and<00:04:13.420> will<00:04:14.420> it<00:04:14.450> play<00:04:15.340> let's<00:04:16.340> see<00:04:19.870> level<00:04:20.870> 6<00:04:21.859> will

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
and will it play let's see level 6 will

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.760 
and will it play let's see level 6 will
go<00:04:22.280> to<00:04:22.340> level<00:04:22.669> 6<00:04:23.060> you<00:04:23.810> can<00:04:23.960> see<00:04:24.139> that<00:04:24.350> we've<00:04:24.560> got

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770

and bottom and you'll just said put the
bombs<00:04:41.690> where<00:04:42.020> they<00:04:42.139> need<00:04:42.380> to<00:04:42.410> be<00:04:43.419> so<00:04:44.419> we<00:04:44.479> got

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
bombs where they need to be so we got

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.089 
bombs where they need to be so we got
another<00:04:44.840> slow<00:04:45.289> mo<00:04:45.530> effect<00:04:45.949> here<00:04:47.949> so<00:04:48.949> that's

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:49.099 
another slow mo effect here so that's

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:50.350 
another slow mo effect here so that's
helping<00:04:49.280> me<00:04:49.550> out<00:04:49.580> a<00:04:49.669> little<00:04:49.910> bit<00:04:50.030> because

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360
