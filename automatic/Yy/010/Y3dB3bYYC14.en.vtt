00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:07.660
 very good to all that as we are 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.460
 here of the believe and today I bring you a guide 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.129
 for the demon hunter in his 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.010
 fire version for devil 3 repair of 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:17.520
 soul 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:21.600
 the first thing for the most novice will be 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.530
 give the escape options game and activate 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.710
 the optional mode 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.300
 what is one thing that you ask me a lot 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.250
 those who just started over everything and 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.330
 This is useful to configure our 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.330
 skills at will 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.539
 in this guide we will talk about the 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.850
 skills of team stats and 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:44.149
 How to distribute our points of 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.149
 stop 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.989
 let's start with the ville ie the 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.140
 skills configuration we go with 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:55.390
 the passive ones in the first place 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.190
 perfectionist to reduce 10% of the 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.120
 discipline cost and increase by 10% 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.260
 our life armory resistances 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.879
 night stalker to have the 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.420
 probability of generating a point of 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.979
 discipline for every critical hit 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.509
 tactical advantage to move fast 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.810
 after using our skills of 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:16.210
 curtain survival and so on and by 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.710
 last archery I advise you if 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.429
 you carry mostly a crossbow of two 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.830
 hands if you do not convince stability 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:26.140
 we could opt for bloody revenge 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.610
 that would increase our maximum hatred and 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.580
 every time we take a little ball of 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.250
 life as we would increase more hatred and 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.409
 discipline or ambush to infringe 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.710
 We have 40% more damage to enemies 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:41.979
 whose superior health is 75 percent 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.600
 that is to say at the beginning of the combats with 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.050
 any of these three passives we would go 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.050
 all right 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.170
 we continue with the active skills 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.060
 as primary we would use arrow 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.670
 hungry with closed arrow to 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:00.289
 generate more hate arrow of racism 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:03.409
 loaded and ready this is what hurt the most 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.890
 will do and we will try to use all the 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.940
 little while 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.259
 somersault with consecutive jump here 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.850
 you can also choose if you want 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.920
 ash trail if you seek to be a 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.080
 little bit more damage but I'm looking for a 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.470
 little bit more quickly so I go with 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.020
 consecutive jump 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.600
 smoke curtain with healing vapors 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.560
 to get out of combat and to regenerate us 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.140
 a little bit in life 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.090
 partner with the wolf also if you want 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.879
 degenerate if you are just regenerating 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.420
 of hate you could use the bat 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:40.239
 would generate hate when you use 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.340
 the active but I prefer a lot more 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.030
 the wolf that does a lot of damage and huffs 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.500
 team with 30% damage last 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.079
 we would use resentment with animosity 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.079
 if we look as I have told you more 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:56.379
 hate feedback or we could opt 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:03:00.099
 also by using preparation with the 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:02.200
 constant preparation rune to be 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:05.189
 sure we will not be left without 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.189
 discipline 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:13.810
 this would be the life we ​​would use 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.810
 for our the moon hunter of fire 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.150
 we go with the stats that the the 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.870
 moon hunter 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.510
 first of all it would be dexterity followed 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.480
 of attack speed probability of 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:33.340
 critical hit critical hit 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:36.530
 damage to the elites vitality 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.379
 resistances to everything and regeneration of 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.659
 hate for second also in the 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:45.060
 secondary is very important to 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:47.489
 maximum discipline 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.220
 the team that I would recommend as they are 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:53.099
 these objects that you are looking at 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.130
 continuation the level of embers 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:58.410
 example that reduces the cost of resources 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.080
 of fire skills in a 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.239
 percentage as a secondary skill the 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.690
 jordán ring that also hurt us 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:10.410
 of fire and damage to the elites is very 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:13.170
 well the magician's fists also damage 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.840
 fire you can also get in the 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.479
 bracelets also more fire damage or 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.510
 the viewer of andy ariel for example that 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:24.479
 increases the damage suffered from fire what 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.150
 ideal is to have more or less a 100 or a 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:29.729
 120 percent fire damage for 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.430
 start noticing how well another option very 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:35.010
 interesting is the designer grouper set 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.720
 that when you have four pieces the 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.820
 fellow ability can invoke 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.530
 all the classmates is can say 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.800
 take the bat to the wolf 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:46.710
 ferrets and all that thing is very very 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.170
 well I really like this being people 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.490
 we went to distribute our points of 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:54.970
 paragon 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.430
 in the primary tab we will look at 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.740
 always have a 25% speed of 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.259
 move as I already have it in several 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:07.169
 objects with 2% already reached the cap 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:10.120
 which is 25% the rest all in dexterity 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:12.910
 to raise the damage 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.850
 in the attacks tab we'll start 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.030
 going up the year of the critical hit 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:21.030
 followed by attack speed 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:25.000
 reduction of the cooldown and 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:27.640
 finally critical hit probability 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.880
 in the defense tab we'll start 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:34.360
 climbing resistance to everything after 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:38.740
 we will go up life followed by the armor 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:40.690
 and then the regeneration of life 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.210
 finally on the utility tab 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.729
 we will start raising the reduction of 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.849
 resource cost 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:54.449
 followed by life by blow damage of 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:54.449
 area and finally gold find 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:00.910
 this would be the proper way to 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.910
 distribute our paragon points 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.160
 to finalize the guide we will talk about 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.290
 follower par excellence 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:13.289
 the moon hunter for my taste is the 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:16.860
 sorceress with the aura 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:19.919
 of attack speed if you get 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:22.919
 the object this so you have access 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:25.559
 to all the skills much better 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:28.499
 You see I have it so full of magic 

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:31.080
 of magical finding to get good 

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:32.399
 light and others is not that I use much 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.439
 the follower as you see I do not have a 

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:37.710
 little abandoned with level objects 

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:39.569
 60 since I usually play in 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.379
