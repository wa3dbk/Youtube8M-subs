it<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.930> certain<00:01:34.320> tab<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.820> comes<00:01:35.970> with

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
it in the certain tab so it comes with

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.760 
it in the certain tab so it comes with
labels<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:37.020> thought<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.320> was<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.560> good<00:01:37.650> idea

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
labels so I thought this was a good idea

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.580 
labels so I thought this was a good idea
and<00:01:37.979> it's<00:01:38.100> really<00:01:38.640> small<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.590> that's

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
and it's really small so that's

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.460 
and it's really small so that's
convenient<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.460> guess<00:01:41.720> then<00:01:42.720> also<00:01:42.869> filled<00:01:43.140> also

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
convenient I guess then also filled also

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.260 
convenient I guess then also filled also
