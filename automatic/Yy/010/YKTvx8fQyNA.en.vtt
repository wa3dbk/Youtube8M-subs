00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:21.320
 Hello to all , I have not had 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.480
 since it's very big now 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:28.369
 tension with work 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:31.339
 fox and so I let the wool big 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:34.610
 attention we put just such a dad in order 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:36.589
 to attach the tail afterwards and 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.440
 grinding was not on the ears 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:43.900
 sanded only attractive face can be here 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:46.370
 to see very few protruding hairs 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.860
 therefore polished only a muzzle that 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.949
 could paint eyes today we 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.489
 with you we will draw hairs and you 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:57.410
 introduce you to the basic principles of this 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.940
 Doing things when we draw eyes 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.079
 attention to what pens should be 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:06.590
 the same 2 eyes so now 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:09.610
 I just plan with a pencil 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.610
 surprised face 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.960
 like this and here for what 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.640
 said that hare because you could 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.640
 draw here so small for the crustacean 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:24.170
 and we would have a fox and very adequate 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:29.860
 And so we assume that the next is the pupil 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.860
 is under our cheeks 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.910
 like that i will draw acrylic 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.440
 paints 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:43.280
 the wisdom of creation here is a little bit of them already 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:46.510
 drip can all do this 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.510
 small palettes ochku 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.350
 first draw light green 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:15.280
 now starting from the edge you can add 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.280
 slightly blue 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:28.660
 all colors i mix with white so 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.660
 more red tone is obtained 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:42.889
 and here are such movements to 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:42.889
 create relief music 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:03:03.049
 so now we take the black paint not 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.049
 what mr 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.129
 this is also acrylic over another form usually i 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.000
 I use acarin we are here 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:27.590
 tubes well this is a black target so as not 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.590
 all becky bolt 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:59.070
 and finishing well my brush 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.170
 we will have glitter in our eyes 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.320
 pay attention that here the twins are already 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.770
 parties 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.770
 as here 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.479
 Here are the eyes I cover no matter how 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:54.300
 strangely ordinary nail polish 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:57.300
 I tried to cover with acrylic a little bit 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.300
 increased 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:09.570
 So 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:09.570
 and cover with ordinary nail polish 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.930
 These are the eyes we also got 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:50.819
 I also want to tell you what to cover 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:52.849
 lacquer oddly enough spout and slightly 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:55.770
 to soak 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:59.900
 what is it done for so that we have 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:02.900
 Here is such a wet nose effect 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.900
 ulissa 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.530
 well, he will be firm 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.840
 the nose is already polished 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:28.979
 dries you can repeat the layer 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:33.139
 so subscribe 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:33.139
