pick<00:02:56.320> up<00:02:56.410> an<00:02:56.560> in-form<00:02:56.860> and<00:02:57.160> I<00:02:57.220> know<00:02:57.280> we've

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
pick up an in-form and I know we've

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.490 
pick up an in-form and I know we've
already<00:02:57.730> got<00:02:57.970> two<00:02:58.240> cams<00:02:58.540> in<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:58.870> one<00:02:59.110> cam

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
already got two cams in a one cam

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.710 
already got two cams in a one cam
formation<00:03:00.250> I<00:03:00.430> decided<00:03:01.210> to<00:03:01.300> go<00:03:01.390> and<00:03:01.510> pick<00:03:01.600> up

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
formation I decided to go and pick up

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.170 
formation I decided to go and pick up
risky<00:03:02.170> nonetheless<00:03:02.440> thinking<00:03:03.130> what<00:03:03.940> we<00:03:04.030> can

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
risky nonetheless thinking what we can

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.610 
risky nonetheless thinking what we can
do<00:03:04.300> with<00:03:04.420> this<00:03:04.480> obviously<00:03:05.200> now<00:03:05.350> we're<00:03:05.530> on<00:03:05.590> to

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
do with this obviously now we're on to

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.070 
do with this obviously now we're on to
15<00:03:06.190> players<00:03:06.460> and<00:03:06.640> finally<00:03:07.480> and<00:03:07.630> inform<00:03:07.960> which

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
15 players and finally and inform which

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.100 
15 players and finally and inform which
is<00:03:08.200> fantastic<00:03:08.400> if<00:03:09.400> you<00:03:09.460> can<00:03:10.000> see<00:03:10.240> I<00:03:10.270> kind<00:03:10.990> of

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
is fantastic if you can see I kind of

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.110 
is fantastic if you can see I kind of
blocked<00:03:11.320> it<00:03:11.470> up<00:03:11.560> a<00:03:11.650> bit<00:03:11.680> here<00:03:11.980> but<00:03:12.010> we<00:03:12.820> can<00:03:13.000> now

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
blocked it up a bit here but we can now

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.820 
blocked it up a bit here but we can now
play<00:03:13.270> like<00:03:13.510> Santi<00:03:13.930> on<00:03:14.050> the<00:03:14.140> left<00:03:14.410> or<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.710> right

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
play like Santi on the left or the right

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.070 
play like Santi on the left or the right
and<00:03:15.190> he'll<00:03:15.310> get<00:03:15.490> seven<00:03:15.880> chemistry<00:03:16.360> whilst<00:03:16.870> we

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
and he'll get seven chemistry whilst we

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.420 
and he'll get seven chemistry whilst we
play<00:03:17.260> with<00:03:17.440> its<00:03:17.620> key<00:03:17.740> through<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.040> middle<00:03:18.280> now

of<00:03:18.459> course<00:03:18.760> that's<00:03:19.000> not<00:03:19.120> going<00:03:19.240> to<00:03:19.330> be<00:03:19.390> ideal

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
of course that's not going to be ideal

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.890 
of course that's not going to be ideal
for<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.920> long<00:03:21.070> run<00:03:21.250> but<00:03:22.000> for<00:03:22.240> now<00:03:22.390> whilst<00:03:22.750> we

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
right on at seven chemistry is not bad

Giroux as your route that that's how
you're<00:04:13.959> going<00:04:14.050> to<00:04:14.140> tell<00:04:14.320> the<00:04:14.440> names<00:04:14.650> apart

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
you're going to tell the names apart

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.199 
you're going to tell the names apart
because<00:04:15.130> they're<00:04:15.340> very<00:04:15.550> similar<00:04:15.700> i'll<00:04:16.000> put

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
because they're very similar i'll put

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.820 
because they're very similar i'll put
more<00:04:16.419> emphasis<00:04:16.690> on<00:04:16.840> the<00:04:16.930> date<00:04:17.200> with<00:04:17.620> DES

here a nice little parser I probably

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.000 
here a nice little parser I probably
shouldn't<00:05:56.660> have<00:05:56.690> bought<00:05:57.230> my<00:05:57.380> player<00:05:57.620> to<00:05:57.860> him

it's<00:06:04.820> time<00:06:04.970> to<00:06:05.090> get<00:06:05.180> little<00:06:05.360> bit<00:06:05.450> worried

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 
it's time to get little bit worried

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.180 
it's time to get little bit worried
because<00:06:05.840> although<00:06:06.110> I'd<00:06:06.290> dominated<00:06:06.890> he<00:06:07.040> was

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
because although I'd dominated he was

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.800 
because although I'd dominated he was
back<00:06:07.400> in<00:06:07.580> it<00:06:07.700> but<00:06:07.880> it<00:06:08.150> didn't<00:06:08.360> take<00:06:08.480> too<00:06:08.510> long

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
back in it but it didn't take too long

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.750 
back in it but it didn't take too long
for<00:06:09.290> a<00:06:09.320> ball<00:06:09.500> to<00:06:09.620> be<00:06:09.710> friended<00:06:10.040> through<00:06:10.220> to<00:06:10.430> yes

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
and it wasn't quite over there they did

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.519
