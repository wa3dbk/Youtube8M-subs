00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.349
 I think it's a proposal a little out of tune because it lends itself 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:10.559
 for 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.459
 many percent 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:16.379
 problems on the part of students that this plan that involves a person 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.850
 with intentions to profit with a completely innocent person until 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:26.570
 she is informed third part plus it seems safe for the student we 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.310
 can lead to a risk 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.359
 total 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.690
 There are people who are looking at who are collaborating with him 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.440
 who are collaborating with the central government since when one 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.450
 he wants to give information he has to give 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.200
 One hundred lion to pay 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.590
 it is not like that now they are going to pay for something is the one that acceded to the teacher 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.290
 information seems to be corruption 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.620
 mambertí corruption and I think it's not the right way to get the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.520
 information since ana has to learn to find the source and exploit 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.170
 the mine but in the best way not giving him money is also planned towards 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.630
 this zone 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.100
 cecilia for the government and is autonomous does not even have information has 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.350
 that go directly with the specific agents as are the actors like 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.260
 are the educational representatives and not 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.300
 behind the scenes in form you could say that 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.510
 frowned upon it seems to me that it is frowned upon and I consider that to be a form also 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.900
 of corruption because there will be 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.260
 ossa and valorie has like all the country chávez wants more and then it 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.130
 would grant and as decent as pawns to wait to see if it can be 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.510
 in common the worst and do not operate baltc company is fighting is like the 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.370
 justice and all the roll with the government nor weighs and uribe would be more 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.470
 well as 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.780
 Following with his corrupt government, he did not take Lopez, I'm not a Uribe 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.730
 neither then, I do not agree, it seems wrong, it's a solution 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.810
 for the problem of the increasing insecurity that this country has 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.870
 this country needs a lot of social investment 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.530
 a lot of employment 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.439
 many sports and cultural programs work the business micro 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.790
 with these spectator neighborhoods 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.319
 and it is not 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.429
 increasing the police state at this time we have 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.299
 it is not increasing the force 

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:18.769
 we have to avoid 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:19.989
 that the children 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.929
 get into these stories and especially the young 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:25.269
 because also the bands 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.339
 they are taken as victims 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:30.949
 and the problem stuck the landfill I do not agree it seems to me that it puts in 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:33.379
 risk to the boys to goal out there 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:37.230
 since israel put jealous informants is working now he pretends 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.010
 it's really taking ethics and morals away from people 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.419
 one can not be something that in principle corresponds to you for money 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:47.979
 cc astelena makes a statement gone there I saw of having a steal what can 

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:51.869
 to do as a person with one has to go well to demand money for doing something 

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:54.439
 that corresponds to him and that his duty as AIDS 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:58.159
 now extreme security is very high he can not put a 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:01.729
 child you have to train is not putting yourself at risk 

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:04.479
 It's going to kill students not only is it killing you 

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:07.010
 institutions with teachers with tables 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.590
 that there are no quotas nor do they seem to denote monarchs this agreement with 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.780
 what the proposal that the president does my young people deserve dignity 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.480
 they deserve respect and deserve education education is in the afternoon 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.519
 education that for freedom michael sheen 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.349
 That I enter 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.349
 the mission was to have a provisional government 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:35.459
 more than obvious that merchants before being good informants 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:39.169
 illegal decisions 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:43.129
 The trails and 3 en route of the government in Mexico is common 

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:47.649
 the most consistent and logical 

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:50.729
 running of course also the risk that 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:52.769
 ambivalent bean that is 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.989
 that was said before acclimated informed 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:56.989
 Something similar 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.059
 initially envisages 

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:02.219
 julien is a president who has given that goes out 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.089
 government 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:05.669
 totally authoritarian 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:09.359
 so now with this new proposal that they want to become totally 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.400
 government informants is like that certain way 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.539
 return the pupils to manipulate people in a certain way what 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:20.249
 be with him and the people who are found either olvera alba 

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:24.369
 well as the obscurantism sides the average in that people when not 

00:04:24.369 --> 00:04:27.779
 I wanted the religion, the ones that just swim then, we still support 

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:30.789
 this kind of policy type issues we're going to get to that last 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:33.789
 totally 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:38.039
 of one thing totally 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:39.499
 ao prisoner hour 

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:40.849
 I think that 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:44.209
 what I say here my partner we will be surrounded by soldiers no longer 

00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:48.169
 we would be in a free country there would no longer be democracy cecilia nothing but 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.180
 simply chile wants to speak a different thing to the government than if it is going to 

00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:55.569
 to extend to Córdoba something would have to know to find a good friend 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:57.349
 because if it is not found 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:00.349
 with a person who is an informant in quotation marks 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:03.870
 yes it was disappearing to 1 point 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.120
 so 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.629
 how difficult is that 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:11.119
 them highlighting democracy highlighting personal opinion the 

00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:13.710
 independent free will so harmful 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.499
 yes he did not like the idea well against evil 

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:18.120
 you have to think about what 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.120
 you have to reevaluate it is about what the government is raising 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.419
 I agree 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.949
 because it seems like a good method for dv 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:30.020
 of violence always today that found crime and I will always 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.949
 find everything that our president has to be 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:37.169
 certainly was to be a way to expand their democratic security and on that side 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.159
 well delayed because it has been shown that it has served in a certain way illa that 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:45.000
 kodak anyone is an informant regarding the group 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:50.090
 guerrilla armed revolutionaries per cent do not know how viable 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.059
 a dangerous that's why I can make them 

00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:55.729
 percent and what to expect to see what result can also pray new month 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:00.080
 weeks that she has always denied so much is Mr. President's policy 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.289
 of the aerial republic that this would be in practice with Murcian society 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.480
 What you do is to turn this audience into a battlefield between 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:13.470
 informants of the beautiful informant of the state and I think that it is not going to go to 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.690
 study at ten you have already been informed the letter I will try 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:22.070
 real to the students in terms of information that the guerrillas could 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:23.240
 hurt him 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.389
 on the other hand this year amounts to 4 percent 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:27.800
 it seems to me like a hawk 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.580
 since the students 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.260
 scenes of peace the seat of government to things to the government of sonora 

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:36.990
 but it seems that they have not been involved because 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.930
 disappears we know how to prepare for this kind of thing 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.990
 the biggest carlos cáceres of week his number 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.029
 I do not agree at all
