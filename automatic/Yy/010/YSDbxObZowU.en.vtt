00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
the next page and then these bronze

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.899 
the next page and then these bronze
players<00:01:34.530> start<00:01:34.920> coming<00:01:35.280> off<00:01:35.369> knowing<00:01:35.759> this

in that case what we do go and skip the
next<00:01:45.840> page<00:01:46.140> but<00:01:46.470> then<00:01:46.649> again<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:47.130> comes<00:01:47.490> up

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
next page but then again this comes up

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.440
