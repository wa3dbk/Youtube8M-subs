00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.929
 Hello guys 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:14.160
 everything good , this is a tv here 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:18.109
 21-inch flat panel gradient or 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:23.760
 her model is tf 21 40 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:26.580
 It's when she came to me she was 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.529
 no, it did not work at all 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.949
 b stands luzinha 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.280
 she was calling it was off and 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:39.329
 botafogo the socket and tighten the pauê and 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.090
 she did not give a signal, it 's good to see 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:53.280
 what was made for us to be able to 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:58.050
 to fix it well, let's go guys this one 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:03.059
 television here it has a defect that 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:07.100
 It is often happen that I sold 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:10.560
 I will explain explain where you are 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.680
 also on the a15 in the source part on the 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.170
 secondary transformer 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:20.880
 there is a glue they put of 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:24.030
 that glue that glue that 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.990
 according to the use of television 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.630
 the tendency of this glue is warm up for 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.360
 she works in an area that is the 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.479
 here from the source that 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.390
 enough that happens she warms up 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.390
 too much is a glue that the 500 images and 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.000
 finished is damaging these 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.540
 components that are here, 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.020
 components that they make 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:56.640
 part of the transformer secondary 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:59.700
 right or else it happens to warm up 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.479
 and if these components here are 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.130
 terminals has only one of the cold 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:09.239
 which is what happened with 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:24.340
 this television here show you 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:31.269
 I'll come here you see this area here is 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:33.250
 the area that over there is the tail 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.510
 As you can see here, I do not know if it will 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.019
 give it to you to see 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.609
 but all these points here are those 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.420
 components that are one that are 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:47.290
 under the glue on both sides of the 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.150
 from this other side of here understood then 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.730
 happened when I saw the chassis 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.849
 all those points here 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.730
 I was in the cold sun as they are 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:00.909
 precisely the exit of the linked trophy 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.639
 on the source output transformer the 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:05.889
 and transformer and means the 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:08.680
 which only gives cold in these components here 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:11.379
 certain components do not feed the 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.109
 rest of the television circuit understood 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:20.680
 So, what did I do? I'll answer. 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:26.590
 these components and I connected the TV comes 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:28.720
 when I turned on the television aa Luisinha 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.049
 distant red led bill she has 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.049
 ahead 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.010
 he lit 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:42.510
 only it turned on and blinked or 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:46.859
 TV still not working but 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:50.699
 now the led was on and flashing 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.699
 indicating that he still had some problem 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:58.449
 as I already know that this television has a 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:04:00.970
 vice of this defect here then that this 

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:03.840
 glue too hot here to damage 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.879
 this component that was what I did then 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.329
 I take a look at all these 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:14.319
 components that are under the glue 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:18.609
 all of them and found this enabled 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:21.669
 Here, a capacitor 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.450
 electrolytic which is the cinema 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.600
 18 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:30.250
 he is a thousand capacitor 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:33.100
 the 16 I when I took this enabled 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.740
 here of the circuit he under devon 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.780
 to realize that it was all leaked or 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.730
 be the electrolyte inside it 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.860
 had leaked 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.040
 ie a capacitor was not 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:48.430
 working as it should then 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:51.300
 What did I do, I got it? 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.280
 I put another enabled here 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:58.660
 understood what I had to say if 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:00.850
 was 1016 good has one thousand for 25 and e 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.970
 I took it and put it in the place 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.500
 I put it in place and the television 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.270
 operate normally by 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.270
 usually with secondary all 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:15.990
 secondary voltages but what 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:20.410
 what happened happened due to over 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:24.600
 the temperature was too high that 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:27.940
 that glue she makes here in this region 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:30.100
 ended up damaging 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:34.120
 he ended up leaking oil 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.920
 so the people I advise you 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.050
 every time you go fix this 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.490
 television 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.860
 first take a look at the components 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.840
 components here to see how 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.300
 are their terminals is loose have 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:51.070
 Pink passes the welds I think they 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:52.900
 may give a defect and according to this 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.840
 glue that is up here 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.900
 You must remove this glue all 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:02.350
 this glue leaves nothing 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:05.140
 glue here on top of the components remove 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:09.130
 this glue cleans the components understood 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:11.290
 because if you only fix it for example 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:14.020
 How are you? I fixed it, hit it. 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:16.920
 He trained in place and did the welding of the 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.540
 terminals of the components plus bag 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.410
 aquino dacta she'll continue 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.900
 heating up 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:26.530
 this means that these components 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:29.320
 can give problem in the future or 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.880
 this guy or what I changed, I can give 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.500
 problem or some other 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.360
 component of this region because 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.069
 regions 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.400
 much because of the glue you have here 

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:40.590
 who put it here I understood then I did not 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.550
 I removed the glue so I could show 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.819
 you 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:47.699
 where is it and how was this glue 

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:51.210
 hard glue but can be removed 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:55.199
 correct is to remove repair remove 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:57.120
 redo solder and remove all that glue 

00:06:55.199 --> 00:07:00.539
 which falls short because otherwise 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.129
 In the future, this TV will come back to you. 

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:03.719
 whether or not it is guaranteed by 

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:06.840
 Will you come back to you with some problem? 

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:11.430
 again in this region because this glue 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:14.639
 warm up then it's the 

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:18.569
 The problem with this television is that 

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:24.090
 and I'll make it available to you there 

00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:27.659
 in the description the scheme is to be able to see you 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:30.900
 You need to work with her. I 

00:07:27.659 --> 00:07:33.599
 I will also leave a special link to 

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:35.460
 you who are going through some 

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:38.849
 difficulty in any area of ​​your life 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:41.789
 step and wanting to solve this problem 

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:45.240
 It's a hug, guys. 

00:07:41.789 --> 00:07:47.870
 God bless you and your family 

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.870
 yours
