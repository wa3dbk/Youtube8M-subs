00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:07.359
 how are we friends here in the 

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:09.760
 instituto this can get art me here 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:14.050
 of this little 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:17.180
 art fear explosion of the theme 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:19.980
 a 150 meter mesh 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.830
 enough for what 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.279
 artemia cysts rather the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.279
 nuclei 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.520
 stay there 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.850
 there we go as 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.380
 the water is a bit orange from the rock 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.100
 what 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.100
 is falling 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:51.870
 this artery goes through a process of 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.920
 state 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:00.090
 with a chlorine solution and 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.100
 a born I do not remember with saw 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.739
 although only completed also 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.610
 can do the one of I felt state the 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.820
 to disengage or to take off the layers 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:16.010
 external to the brine egg 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:20.020
 and so in a shorter time it was achieved 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.020
 the eclosion of the cysts 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:32.110
 so we can ensure 95% of 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.110
 declaration 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:45.270
 here is with this right now 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.270
 because he still needs to get him out here 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:54.270
 what is a little bit of heat that we have 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.270
 cultivated alarte in adult 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.780
 quite warm we are 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.410
 43 degrees Celsius 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.340
 in here 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:16.700
 we try to strain the water that goes away 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.700
 the salt 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.390
 and now we rinse with 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.010
 a little water so that the salt that you 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.180
 stay 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.629
 it is the artery 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.930
 this does not affect the fish that is the 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.930
 Water 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.590
 all right 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.820
 this is all and I hope you liked it 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.820
 Thank you
