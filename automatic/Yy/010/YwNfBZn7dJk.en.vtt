00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:08.650
 hello I'm lukas handmade im 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:10.420
 a great easy peasy today 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.680
 Show summer project for you and indeed 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.660
 I handle you like you with a few 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.830
 your ballerinas aufhübschen and can 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.219
 Although we do that with a great show 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.219
 clips 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.030
 Now I'll show you what you all for 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.410
 this simple one needs it first 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.420
 needs a ironing board and iron 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.060
 but you certainly have to anyway 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.430
 home then you need a year a 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.300
 scissors two pieces of fabric approximately with the 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.610
 Measure 18 x 8 cm 2 drawstring show 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.290
 clips and a hot glue gun with 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.970
 hot glue as a first step would have 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.559
 just a moment your two pieces of cloth nice 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.800
 iron with no more folds to see 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.800
 are 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.090
 After ironing, I show you as you 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.680
 your pieces of cloth will fold that folds 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.300
 it will be a nice loop for you 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.620
 then your shoes could slip first 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.600
 it's best to cut one piece 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.280
 wall off with it you can afterwards the 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.170
 Wrap the loop together so that you 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.700
 you can get the beauty 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.860
 Of course sew also but we sew 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.239
 make now the simple variant with it 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.640
 everyone with simple means fast 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.440
 We can take over next 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.630
 now the edges and fold them 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.940
 middle so it's a bit here 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.220
 overlaps and then we take the two 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.259
 longer ends and fold them in too 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:23.210
 the middle so that you are in the middle of the 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:27.470
 loop on top of each other looks here 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.570
 overlapped piece of streams around that is 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.360
 now the front and the second 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.920
 we once both knew each other and 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.680
 then the upper edge again in the 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.840
 middle and the same we do on the 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.510
 back and times again the 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.549
 upper edge limite and thereby arises 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.439
 Now we hold the loop shape in 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:49.670
 the middle briefly and then choose the 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:54.040
 colors and fix everything around it 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.040
 wrap and find beautiful 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.450
 do 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.190
 does the same thing to her now easy with the 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.630
 second piece of fabric now are yours 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.009
 Finished small fabric grind and if 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.060
 You just want to be able to do that 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.860
 cut off a bit with that 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.510
 is shorter before the grind with the 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.490
 glue to the cutting sticks thoughtfully 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.900
 First of all, if he has the grind behind 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.220
 to the school or front turn 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.930
 because it depends on it 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.880
 a little bit april the festivals 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.740
 I would like to do that in the front now 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.510
 do my ballerinas and if I do 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.370
 afterwards the fast to work like that 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.970
 he would have to turn things around 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.970
 be attached 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.170
 briefly leave to dry and dry 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.640
 after the glue has dried you can 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.769
 you now grind your city ​​one already 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.519
 fix 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.519
 have fun imitating
