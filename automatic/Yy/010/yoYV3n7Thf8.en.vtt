introduction until now so this series is

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.169 
introduction until now so this series is
a<00:00:12.719> Swedish<00:00:13.170> stainless<00:00:13.679> steel<00:00:13.950> core<00:00:14.340> at<00:00:15.000> about

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
a Swedish stainless steel core at about

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.150 
a Swedish stainless steel core at about
60<00:00:15.570> on<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.719> Ralpha<00:00:16.049> hardness<00:00:16.410> scale<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.859> has

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
60 on the Ralpha hardness scale and has

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.370 
60 on the Ralpha hardness scale and has
cladding<00:00:17.699> that's<00:00:17.970> hammered<00:00:18.420> Damascus<00:00:19.050> steel

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
cladding that's hammered Damascus steel

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.220 
cladding that's hammered Damascus steel
this<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.250> not<00:00:20.400> lasered<00:00:21.060> on<00:00:21.300> Damascus<00:00:21.779> or

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
this is not lasered on Damascus or

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.439 
this is not lasered on Damascus or
etched<00:00:22.410> on<00:00:22.680> or<00:00:23.010> drawn<00:00:23.460> on<00:00:23.640> in<00:00:23.789> any<00:00:23.939> way<00:00:24.119> this<00:00:24.330> is

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
etched on or drawn on in any way this is

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.390 
etched on or drawn on in any way this is
actually<00:00:24.810> two<00:00:25.260> different<00:00:25.439> steels<00:00:25.859> folded

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
actually two different steels folded

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.670 
actually two different steels folded
together<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:27.510> create<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.779> Damascus<00:00:28.260> pattern

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
together to create a Damascus pattern

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.790 
together to create a Damascus pattern
however<00:00:29.310> in<00:00:30.179> Japan<00:00:30.420> most<00:00:30.960> Damascus<00:00:31.560> knives

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
however in Japan most Damascus knives

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.950 
however in Japan most Damascus knives
which<00:00:31.980> you'll<00:00:32.130> see<00:00:32.329> will<00:00:33.329> be<00:00:33.450> created<00:00:33.809> in<00:00:33.840> a

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
which you'll see will be created in a

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.889 
which you'll see will be created in a
way<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.770> allows<00:00:35.430> for<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.760> core<00:00:36.030> steel<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.510> be<00:00:36.630> a

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
way that allows for a core steel to be a

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.200 
way that allows for a core steel to be a
single<00:00:37.710> piece<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:37.920> hard<00:00:38.309> steel<00:00:38.550> like<00:00:38.969> in<00:00:39.120> this

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
single piece of hard steel like in this

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.580 
single piece of hard steel like in this
case<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.629> Swedish<00:00:39.960> stainless<00:00:40.290> steel<00:00:40.469> that's

case the Swedish stainless steel that's

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.770 
case the Swedish stainless steel that's
being<00:00:40.800> used<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.090> cladding<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.510> two

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
being used and the the cladding the two

size<00:01:22.110> will<00:01:22.350> work<00:01:22.470> just<00:01:22.500> fine<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.939> even<00:01:24.420> know<00:01:24.540> a

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
size will work just fine I even know a

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.179 
size will work just fine I even know a
few<00:01:24.780> people<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.049> use<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.500> size<00:01:25.740> as<00:01:26.040> their

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
few people that use this size as their

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.679 
few people that use this size as their
general<00:01:26.430> all-purpose<00:01:26.729> chef's<00:01:27.299> knife<00:01:27.479> and

general all-purpose chef's knife and

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:28.910 
general all-purpose chef's knife and
they<00:01:27.750> do<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:28.020> because<00:01:28.200> there's<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.770> little

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
they do that because there's a little

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.980 
they do that because there's a little
bit<00:01:29.040> less<00:01:29.280> blade<00:01:29.579> height<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.659> there's<00:01:30.810> less

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
bit less blade height so there's less

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.630 
bit less blade height so there's less
friction<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.680> less<00:01:31.799> sticking<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.369> occurs

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
friction and less sticking that occurs

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.149 
friction and less sticking that occurs
when<00:01:32.880> you're<00:01:33.000> cutting<00:01:33.180> potatoes<00:01:34.159> onions

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
as I was saying before you can see here

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.570 
as I was saying before you can see here
that<00:02:13.720> there's<00:02:13.900> hammered<00:02:14.680> Damascus<00:02:15.160> cladding

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
that there's hammered Damascus cladding

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.550 
that there's hammered Damascus cladding
and<00:02:15.700> then<00:02:16.000> a<00:02:16.030> horse<00:02:16.660> deal<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.050> solid<00:02:17.380> steel

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
and then a horse deal the solid steel

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.840 
and then a horse deal the solid steel
that<00:02:17.710> you<00:02:17.800> can<00:02:17.920> see<00:02:18.100> here<00:02:18.340> along<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.730> edge

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
that you can see here along the edge

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.000 
that you can see here along the edge
it's<00:02:19.690> about<00:02:19.870> 60<00:02:20.290> on<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.500> rockwell<00:02:20.800> hardness

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
it's about 60 on the rockwell hardness

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.490 
it's about 60 on the rockwell hardness
scale<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.610> it's<00:02:22.210> a<00:02:22.300> Swedish<00:02:22.750> stainless<00:02:23.230> steel

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
scale and it's a Swedish stainless steel

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.170 
scale and it's a Swedish stainless steel
so<00:02:24.340> this<00:02:24.430> is<00:02:24.490> the<00:02:24.580> 240<00:02:25.270> millimeter<00:02:25.660> Zhu<00:02:25.990> GE<00:02:26.140> key

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
so this is the 240 millimeter Zhu GE key

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.640 
so this is the 240 millimeter Zhu GE key
next<00:02:28.180> up<00:02:28.360> is<00:02:28.540> our<00:02:29.140> 240<00:02:29.830> millimeter<00:02:30.190> while<00:02:30.760> Guto
