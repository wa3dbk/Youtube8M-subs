actually it's the display size so will

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.140 
actually it's the display size so will
be<00:00:18.330> X<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.380> X<00:00:19.560> plus<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:20.070> get<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.250> 4<00:00:20.580> inch<00:00:20.699> display

with a resolution of 800 x 480 pixels

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.089 
with a resolution of 800 x 480 pixels
will<00:00:26.849> be<00:00:27.000> nokia<00:00:27.599> XL<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.260> get<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.470> 5-inch

will be nokia XL you get a 5-inch
display<00:00:29.189> but<00:00:30.119> actually<00:00:30.539> were<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.720> same

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
display but actually were the same

resolution of 800 x 480 pixels so

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.090 
resolution of 800 x 480 pixels so
definitely<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:36.300> display<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.290> we<00:00:37.559> excel<00:00:37.860> is

definitely the display of we excel is
more<00:00:38.399> grainy<00:00:39.829> but<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:41.579> get<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.790> lot<00:00:41.940> more

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
more grainy but you get a lot more

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.970 
more grainy but you get a lot more
screen<00:00:44.219> real<00:00:44.250> estate<00:00:44.780> but<00:00:45.780> also<00:00:46.500> as<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.770> can

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
screen real estate but also as you can

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.900 
screen real estate but also as you can
see<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.700> icons<00:00:48.120> just<00:00:48.780> get<00:00:49.230> bigger<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:50.399> you

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
see the icons just get bigger and so you

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.139 
see the icons just get bigger and so you
can't<00:00:51.210> really<00:00:51.420> use<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.379> screen<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:53.399> see<00:00:53.670> more

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
can't really use the screen to see more

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.630 
can't really use the screen to see more
information<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:55.770> don't<00:00:56.190> know<00:00:56.280> if<00:00:56.399> it's<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
information I don't know if it's the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.599 
information I don't know if it's the
same<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.210> new<00:00:57.420> browser<00:00:57.719> but<00:00:58.530> right<00:00:59.039> now<00:00:59.100> as<00:00:59.489> you

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
same a new browser but right now as you

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.819 
same a new browser but right now as you
can<00:00:59.760> see<00:00:59.820> here<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:00.809> three<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> half

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
can see here we have three and a half

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.910 
can see here we have three and a half
lines<00:01:02.219> on<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.090> excel<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.170> three<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> half

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
lines on the x plus so in my opinion VX

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.640 
lines on the x plus so in my opinion VX
plus<00:01:09.479> n<00:01:10.470> VX<00:01:10.890> have<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.490> more<00:01:12.090> beautiful<00:01:12.650> crispier

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.170 
plus n VX have a more beautiful crispier
and<00:01:13.920> nicer<00:01:14.369> display<00:01:16.340> size<00:01:17.340> wise<00:01:17.640> as<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.000> can

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
and nicer display size wise as you can

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.999 
and nicer display size wise as you can
see<00:01:18.390> where<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.689> pretty<00:01:19.020> much<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.259> difference<00:01:19.740> be

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
see where is pretty much a difference be

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.820 
see where is pretty much a difference be
x<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.210> about<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.840> size<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.439> display<00:01:22.590> of

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
x is about the size of the display of

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.899 
x is about the size of the display of
the<00:01:23.009> XL<00:01:24.500> also<00:01:25.500> there<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:25.950> no<00:01:26.280> difference<00:01:26.729> in

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
the XL also there is no difference in

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.810 
the XL also there is no difference in
thickness<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:28.350> when<00:01:29.009> we<00:01:29.159> look<00:01:29.280> at<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.549> back

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
thickness and when we look at the back

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.510 
thickness and when we look at the back
of<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.600> speaker<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.140> excel<00:01:31.590> seems<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.400> be

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
of the speaker of the excel seems to be

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.149 
of the speaker of the excel seems to be
a<00:01:32.549> little<00:01:32.700> bit<00:01:32.850> roll<00:01:33.119> larger<00:01:33.710> but<00:01:34.710> also<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
a little bit roll larger but also the

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.179 
a little bit roll larger but also the
camera<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:36.049> another<00:01:37.049> big<00:01:37.290> difference<00:01:37.740> we've

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
camera is another big difference we've

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.700 
camera is another big difference we've
got<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.460> 3<00:01:38.820> megapixel<00:01:38.970> camera<00:01:39.780> where<00:01:40.290> fixed

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
got a 3 megapixel camera where fixed

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.780 
got a 3 megapixel camera where fixed
focus<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.310> my<00:01:41.490> nokia

okay thanks plus and we have a 5
megapixel<00:01:46.060> camera<00:01:46.840> with<00:01:47.020> an<00:01:47.350> LED<00:01:47.500> flash<00:01:48.010> and

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
megapixel camera with an LED flash and

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.980 
megapixel camera with an LED flash and
autofocus<00:01:48.670> on<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:50.530> Nokia<00:01:51.070> itself<00:01:51.580> so<00:01:52.240> for

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
autofocus on the Nokia itself so for

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.720 
autofocus on the Nokia itself so for
taking<00:01:53.320> pictures<00:01:53.470> when<00:01:53.890> Nokia<00:01:54.190> Excel<00:01:54.520> is

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
taking pictures when Nokia Excel is

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.430 
taking pictures when Nokia Excel is
definitely<00:01:55.450> better<00:01:55.600> than<00:01:55.750> inside<00:01:56.140> Adele's

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
definitely better than inside Adele's

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.790 
definitely better than inside Adele's
already<00:01:57.180> for<00:01:58.180> example<00:01:58.630> with<00:01:58.960> close-up<00:01:59.530> shots

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
already for example with close-up shots

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.480 
already for example with close-up shots
the<00:02:00.430> nokia<00:02:01.000> X<00:02:01.270> and<00:02:01.570> nokia<00:02:01.870> X<00:02:02.080> plus<00:02:02.410> just<00:02:03.040> don't

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
the nokia X and nokia X plus just don't

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.070 
the nokia X and nokia X plus just don't
do<00:02:03.790> so<00:02:04.060> well<00:02:04.090> as<00:02:05.130> as<00:02:06.130> well<00:02:06.190> as<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.810> okay<00:02:07.810> Excel

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
do so well as as well as the okay Excel

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.730 
do so well as as well as the okay Excel
which<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:09.600> definitely<00:02:10.600> better<00:02:10.750> for<00:02:11.110> taking

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
which is definitely better for taking

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.010 
which is definitely better for taking
quicker<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:12.550> nicer<00:02:13.090> pictures<00:02:13.540> due<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:13.900> its

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
quicker and nicer pictures due to its

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.510 
quicker and nicer pictures due to its
autofocus<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:14.890> also<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.459> LED<00:02:15.790> flash<00:02:17.520> also

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
autofocus and also the LED flash also

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.290 
autofocus and also the LED flash also
another<00:02:18.670> difference<00:02:19.360> is<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:20.740> battery<00:02:21.280> so<00:02:21.910> we

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
another difference is the battery so we

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.710 
another difference is the battery so we
have<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.830> 1500<00:02:23.830> milliamp<00:02:24.220> hour<00:02:24.490> battery<00:02:25.290> in<00:02:26.290> the

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
have a 1500 milliamp hour battery in the

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.430 
have a 1500 milliamp hour battery in the
nokia<00:02:28.720> X<00:02:29.530> and<00:02:29.980> nokia<00:02:30.520> X<00:02:30.850> plus<00:02:31.270> and<00:02:31.570> we<00:02:32.260> have<00:02:32.410> a

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
nokia X and nokia X plus and we have a

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.220 
nokia X and nokia X plus and we have a
2000<00:02:33.160> milliamp<00:02:33.490> hour<00:02:33.700> battery<00:02:33.850> on<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.840> Nokia

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
2000 milliamp hour battery on the Nokia

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.820 
2000 milliamp hour battery on the Nokia
excel<00:02:35.739> so<00:02:36.540> if<00:02:37.540> no<00:02:38.160> you<00:02:39.160> won't<00:02:40.380> realize<00:02:41.380> it<00:02:41.590> in

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
excel so if no you won't realize it in

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.620 
excel so if no you won't realize it in
the<00:02:42.070> battery<00:02:42.459> life<00:02:42.610> because<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.150> screen<00:02:43.450> on

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
the battery life because the screen on

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.590 
the battery life because the screen on
the<00:02:43.750> XL<00:02:44.080> is<00:02:44.230> bigger<00:02:44.470> so<00:02:44.739> it<00:02:44.860> needs<00:02:45.070> more<00:02:45.250> power

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
the XL is bigger so it needs more power

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.570 
the XL is bigger so it needs more power
battery<00:02:46.600> life<00:02:46.900> will<00:02:47.230> be<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.530> same<00:02:47.769> but<00:02:48.340> still

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
battery life will be the same but still

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.190 
battery life will be the same but still
you<00:02:48.730> should<00:02:48.910> know<00:02:49.060> is<00:02:49.330> that<00:02:49.360> a<00:02:49.570> battery<00:02:49.810> is

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
you should know is that a battery is

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.310 
you should know is that a battery is
bigger<00:02:50.560> on<00:02:50.860> this<00:02:51.430> phone<00:02:51.610> so<00:02:51.820> stand<00:02:52.239> by<00:02:52.390> x<00:02:52.750> will

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
bigger on this phone so stand by x will

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.030 
bigger on this phone so stand by x will
be<00:02:53.530> longer<00:02:54.280> but<00:02:55.030> use<00:02:55.959> time<00:02:56.230> will<00:02:56.440> be<00:02:56.590> probably

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
be longer but use time will be probably

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.430 
be longer but use time will be probably
more<00:02:57.489> or<00:02:57.580> less<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:57.880> same<00:02:57.910> so<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:58.900> interface

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
more or less the same so the interface

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.380 
more or less the same so the interface
is<00:02:59.470> also<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.430> same<00:03:00.640> you've<00:03:00.820> got<00:03:01.000> android

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
is also the same you've got android

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.940 
is also the same you've got android
right<00:03:01.720> here<00:03:02.280> but<00:03:03.280> another<00:03:03.489> difference<00:03:03.940> is

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
right here but another difference is

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.060 
right here but another difference is
inside<00:03:05.950> this<00:03:06.220> phone<00:03:06.459> so<00:03:06.850> we<00:03:07.150> have<00:03:08.070> 768

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
inside this phone so we have 768

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.380 
inside this phone so we have 768
megabytes<00:03:09.700> of<00:03:10.230> RAM

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
megabytes of RAM

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.480 
megabytes of RAM
of<00:03:12.930> from<00:03:13.350> memory<00:03:13.680> NB<00:03:14.220> XL<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:15.690> X<00:03:15.930> has<00:03:16.500> just<00:03:17.160> up

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
of from memory NB XL the X has just up

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.170 
of from memory NB XL the X has just up
to<00:03:18.200> 512<00:03:19.200> MB<00:03:19.800> and<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:21.060> x<00:03:21.480> plus<00:03:21.840> has<00:03:22.140> also<00:03:22.680> said

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
to 512 MB and the x plus has also said

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.440 
to 512 MB and the x plus has also said
168<00:03:24.180> likely<00:03:25.050> nokia<00:03:25.440> XL<00:03:25.860> so<00:03:26.400> if<00:03:26.970> you<00:03:27.270> are

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450

considering to buy an X just go for the
X<00:03:31.260> plus<00:03:31.590> because<00:03:31.980> 10<00:03:32.280> euros<00:03:32.640> is<00:03:32.850> definitely

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
X plus because 10 euros is definitely

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.570 
X plus because 10 euros is definitely
worth<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:34.380> memory<00:03:34.680> upgrade<00:03:35.190> and<00:03:35.340> you<00:03:35.430> also

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
worth the memory upgrade and you also

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.949 
worth the memory upgrade and you also
get<00:03:35.850> a<00:03:35.910> free<00:03:36.090> for<00:03:36.870> gigabyte<00:03:37.760> microSD<00:03:38.760> card<00:03:39.239> so

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
difference also of course the size and

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.920 
difference also of course the size and
the<00:03:45.900> weight<00:03:45.930> is<00:03:46.410> a<00:03:46.440> difference<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:48.120> excel<00:03:48.720> is

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.190 
the weight is a difference the excel is
a<00:03:48.959> little<00:03:49.260> bit<00:03:49.380> heavier<00:03:50.600> due<00:03:51.600> to<00:03:51.750> its<00:03:51.870> larger

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200
