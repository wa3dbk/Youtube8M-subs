00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.590 
you still do see the blood kind of leave
your<00:02:53.700> body<00:02:53.880> like<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.360> little

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
your body like the little

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.940 
your body like the little
particle<00:02:54.960> effect<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.410> little<00:02:55.590> bit<00:02:55.710> and<00:02:55.860> then

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
particle effect a little bit and then

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.110 
particle effect a little bit and then
you<00:02:56.040> could<00:02:56.160> see<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:56.370> on<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.550> floor<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:57.000> the

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
you could see it on the floor and the

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.760 
you could see it on the floor and the
bloods<00:02:57.390> like<00:02:57.480> darker<00:02:58.080> I<00:02:58.110> guess<00:02:58.380> because<00:02:58.680> they

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
bloods like darker I guess because they

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.590 
bloods like darker I guess because they
hit<00:02:58.890> oxygen<00:02:59.430> that's<00:02:59.610> what<00:02:59.700> I'm<00:02:59.790> assuming<00:03:00.060> but

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
hit oxygen that's what I'm assuming but

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.000 
hit oxygen that's what I'm assuming but
you<00:03:00.810> can<00:03:00.930> see<00:03:01.020> that<00:03:01.140> looks<00:03:01.320> pretty<00:03:01.770> dang

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
you can see that looks pretty dang

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.800 
you can see that looks pretty dang
realistic<00:03:02.580> that<00:03:02.730> is<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:02.970> very<00:03:03.240> gory<00:03:03.570> right

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
realistic that is a very gory right

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.120 
realistic that is a very gory right
there<00:03:04.020> and<00:03:04.380> on<00:03:04.530> our<00:03:04.710> screen<00:03:04.950> it<00:03:05.070> looks

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
there and on our screen it looks

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.130 
there and on our screen it looks
ridiculously<00:03:06.090> cool<00:03:06.330> as<00:03:06.510> well<00:03:06.690> you<00:03:06.780> can<00:03:06.900> see<00:03:07.020> we

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
ridiculously cool as well you can see we

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.250 
ridiculously cool as well you can see we
have<00:03:07.290> different<00:03:08.060> blood<00:03:09.060> splatters<00:03:09.570> in<00:03:09.810> our

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
have different blood splatters in our

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.050 
have different blood splatters in our
view<00:03:10.440> year<00:03:10.680> but<00:03:10.860> as<00:03:10.950> you<00:03:11.070> can<00:03:11.190> see<00:03:11.340> I<00:03:11.580> look<00:03:11.940> the

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
view year but as you can see I look the

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.340 
view year but as you can see I look the
same<00:03:12.090> so<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.600> doesn't<00:03:12.840> affect<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:13.170> in<00:03:13.230> that

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
same so it doesn't affect you in that

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.480 
same so it doesn't affect you in that
it's<00:03:13.530> just<00:03:13.740> you<00:03:13.920> know<00:03:14.010> something<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.400> be<00:03:14.430> a

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
it's just you know something to be a

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.190 
it's just you know something to be a
little<00:03:14.670> bit<00:03:14.820> more<00:03:14.970> immersive<00:03:15.360> in<00:03:16.080> your

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
little bit more immersive in your

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.270 
little bit more immersive in your
first-person<00:03:16.650> view<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:16.890> you'll<00:03:17.010> see<00:03:17.160> that

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
first-person view and you'll see that

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.740 
first-person view and you'll see that
after<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.640> while<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:18.090> blood<00:03:18.300> will<00:03:18.510> go<00:03:18.540> away

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
after a while the blood will go away

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.480 
after a while the blood will go away

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
you can see it's really realistic

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.950 
you can see it's really realistic
because<00:04:32.490> an<00:04:32.880> explosion<00:04:33.360> just<00:04:33.390> went<00:04:33.660> off<00:04:33.750> and

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
because an explosion just went off and

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.540 
because an explosion just went off and
all<00:04:34.200> the<00:04:34.320> dirt<00:04:34.530> in<00:04:34.740> the<00:04:34.860> mud<00:04:35.040> and<00:04:35.220> everything

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
all the dirt in the mud and everything

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.510 
all the dirt in the mud and everything
just<00:04:36.000> like<00:04:36.150> came<00:04:37.140> up<00:04:37.290> into<00:04:37.440> my<00:04:37.590> face<00:04:37.830> so<00:04:38.070> that's

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
just like came up into my face so that's

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.770 
just like came up into my face so that's
from<00:04:38.760> a<00:04:38.850> creeper<00:04:39.120> explosion<00:04:39.450> I<00:04:39.480> believe<00:04:39.690> would

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
from a creeper explosion I believe would

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.870 
from a creeper explosion I believe would
be<00:04:39.840> the<00:04:39.930> same<00:04:40.170> thing<00:04:40.350> from<00:04:40.470> TNT<00:04:40.880> hopefully

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
be the same thing from TNT hopefully

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.010 
be the same thing from TNT hopefully

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.660 
thought was really cool and this is just
it<00:05:25.690> goes<00:05:25.870> great<00:05:26.080> with<00:05:26.140> mob<00:05:26.440> it's<00:05:27.160> member<00:05:27.490> Minh

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.180 
it goes great with mob it's member Minh
or<00:05:28.030> mob<00:05:28.180> amputation<00:05:28.780> because<00:05:29.140> this<00:05:29.980> mod

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
or mob amputation because this mod

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.250 
or mob amputation because this mod
actually<00:05:30.520> adds<00:05:30.850> an<00:05:31.120> its<00:05:31.270> own<00:05:31.480> particle<00:05:32.020> blood

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
actually adds an its own particle blood

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.320 
actually adds an its own particle blood
effects<00:05:32.590> and<00:05:32.770> stuff<00:05:32.980> like<00:05:33.130> that<00:05:33.310> so<00:05:33.340> if<00:05:33.550> I<00:05:33.700> go

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
effects and stuff like that so if I go

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.720 
effects and stuff like that so if I go
ahead<00:05:34.510> and<00:05:35.040> okay<00:05:36.040> it's<00:05:36.160> probably<00:05:36.400> best<00:05:36.490> if<00:05:36.610> I

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 
ahead and okay it's probably best if I

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.120 
ahead and okay it's probably best if I
show<00:05:36.880> this<00:05:36.970> is<00:05:37.030> creative<00:05:37.830> cuz<00:05:38.830> they<00:05:38.920> get<00:05:39.100> a

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
show this is creative cuz they get a

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.060 
show this is creative cuz they get a
little<00:05:39.280> mad<00:05:39.580> so<00:05:40.450> if<00:05:40.600> I<00:05:40.690> go<00:05:40.840> ahead<00:05:40.930> and<00:05:41.080> I<00:05:41.410> chop

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
little mad so if I go ahead and I chop

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.010 
little mad so if I go ahead and I chop
them<00:05:42.220> up<00:05:42.340> there<00:05:42.580> you<00:05:42.820> can<00:05:42.940> see<00:05:43.090> the<00:05:43.840> blood

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.960 
I feel like Dexter clearly no signs of a
struggle<00:05:55.570> but<00:05:56.140> yeah<00:05:57.010> so<00:05:57.340> go<00:05:57.520> ahead<00:05:57.610> will<00:05:57.820> spawn

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970

stuff because it's not a lot pretty much

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.370 
stuff because it's not a lot pretty much
you<00:06:06.730> could<00:06:06.820> just<00:06:07.000> chop<00:06:07.180> off<00:06:07.330> mob<00:06:07.930> limbs<00:06:08.260> like

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
head and without his head he's going to

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.320 
head and without his head he's going to
die<00:06:11.470> in<00:06:11.650> a<00:06:11.710> few<00:06:11.830> seconds<00:06:12.220> blood<00:06:12.790> squirts<00:06:13.210> out
