00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
for a second it was just a matter of

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:31.890 
for a second it was just a matter of
time<00:03:30.790> until<00:03:30.819> he<00:03:31.030> cut<00:03:31.239> this<00:03:31.329> motherfucker<00:03:31.810> now

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
what I liked it to be a little bit

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.349 
what I liked it to be a little bit
different<00:03:33.459> a<00:03:33.519> little<00:03:33.549> bit<00:03:33.730> more<00:03:33.940> interesting

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
different a little bit more interesting

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.180 
different a little bit more interesting
and<00:03:34.449> exciting<00:03:34.690> but<00:03:35.169> nonetheless<00:03:35.319> is<00:03:35.650> oral<00:03:36.010> so

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190
