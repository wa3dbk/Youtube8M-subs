00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.150 
have a not very late and that little
early<00:02:14.570> pan<00:02:14.840> of<00:02:14.989> oil<00:02:15.140> pump<00:02:15.440> so<00:02:15.830> this<00:02:15.920> is<00:02:16.070> the

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
early pan of oil pump so this is the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.850 
early pan of oil pump so this is the
early<00:02:16.370> 60s<00:02:16.880> late<00:02:17.810> 50s<00:02:18.230> oil<00:02:18.380> pump<00:02:18.620> which<00:02:18.739> is

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
early 60s late 50s oil pump which is

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.580 
early 60s late 50s oil pump which is
what<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.130> heads<00:02:19.310> were<00:02:19.430> from<00:02:20.320> you<00:02:21.320> can<00:02:21.410> tell

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
what the heads were from you can tell

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.110 
what the heads were from you can tell
that<00:02:21.709> just<00:02:21.769> by<00:02:21.950> looking<00:02:22.040> at<00:02:22.459> with<00:02:22.580> big<00:02:22.850> fins

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
that just by looking at with big fins

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.979 
that just by looking at with big fins
but<00:02:23.330> they're<00:02:23.480> not<00:02:23.600> outside<00:02:23.780> or<00:02:24.050> older<00:02:24.200> heads

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
but they're not outside or older heads

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.410 
but they're not outside or older heads
so<00:02:27.190> nothing<00:02:28.190> wrong<00:02:28.310> with<00:02:28.459> it<00:02:28.580> this<00:02:28.730> is<00:02:28.940> how<00:02:29.120> it

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
so nothing wrong with it this is how it

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.860 
so nothing wrong with it this is how it
was<00:02:29.570> done

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
was done

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.910 
was done
it's<00:02:30.769> absolutely<00:02:31.280> totally<00:02:31.459> illegal

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
it's absolutely totally illegal

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.490 
it's absolutely totally illegal

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.800 
freeway about as smart as that guy
so<00:03:17.040> am<00:03:17.579> i<00:03:17.790> beckon<00:03:18.239> if<00:03:18.359> you<00:03:18.450> want<00:03:18.569> to<00:03:18.629> do<00:03:18.689> the

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.550 

so<00:03:35.480> each<00:03:35.599> bike<00:03:35.840> has<00:03:36.019> its<00:03:36.230> own<00:03:36.379> little

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
so each bike has its own little

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.050 
so each bike has its own little
technique<00:03:36.950> so<00:03:37.129> it<00:03:37.159> might<00:03:37.340> fire<00:03:37.640> up<00:03:37.790> right<00:03:37.969> away

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
technique so it might fire up right away

00:03:38.060 --> 00:04:20.629 
technique so it might fire up right away
and<00:03:38.180> we<00:03:38.569> might<00:03:38.750> kick<00:03:38.930> a<00:03:38.959> little<00:03:39.140> bit

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.760 

I<00:04:20.840> don't<00:04:21.840> know<00:04:21.900> if<00:04:21.959> any<00:04:22.139> of<00:04:22.259> you<00:04:22.349> notice<00:04:22.650> that

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
I don't know if any of you notice that

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.610 
I don't know if any of you notice that

but he shifted first up which makes

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.320 
but he shifted first up which makes
three<00:04:25.919> down<00:04:26.069> which<00:04:26.520> makes<00:04:26.759> it<00:04:26.909> an<00:04:26.999> FX

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
three down which makes it an FX

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.010 
three down which makes it an FX
transmission<00:04:27.960> lid<00:04:28.139> on<00:04:28.379> the<00:04:28.800> bike<00:04:29.099> so<00:04:30.020> what

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
transmission lid on the bike so what

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.899 
transmission lid on the bike so what
happened<00:04:31.439> is<00:04:31.560> somebody<00:04:31.800> had<00:04:32.099> a<00:04:32.129> tank<00:04:32.610> shift

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:32.909 
happened is somebody had a tank shift

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:35.209 
happened is somebody had a tank shift
bike<00:04:33.210> with<00:04:33.990> that<00:04:34.139> transmission<00:04:34.499> against<00:04:35.129> an

00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:35.219 
bike with that transmission against an

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:37.580 
bike with that transmission against an
early<00:04:35.490> training<00:04:35.729> case<00:04:36.029> well<00:04:36.870> those<00:04:37.259> early

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
early training case well those early

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.309 
early training case well those early
training<00:04:37.830> cases<00:04:38.129> only<00:04:38.580> two<00:04:38.879> years<00:04:39.240> came<00:04:40.169> with

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:40.319 
training cases only two years came with

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:41.749 
training cases only two years came with
a<00:04:40.349> hand<00:04:40.590> clutch<00:04:40.830> most<00:04:41.099> of<00:04:41.279> them<00:04:41.400> were<00:04:41.520> tank

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 
a hand clutch most of them were tank

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:43.760 
a hand clutch most of them were tank
shift<00:04:41.999> so<00:04:42.870> somebody<00:04:43.169> went<00:04:43.259> to<00:04:43.379> a<00:04:43.439> swap<00:04:43.740> meet

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
shift so somebody went to a swap meet

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.429 
shift so somebody went to a swap meet
run<00:04:44.520> himself<00:04:44.669> or<00:04:44.969> a<00:04:45.029> chelator<00:04:45.419> operate<00:04:46.020> most

00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:46.439 
run himself or a chelator operate most

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:48.619 
run himself or a chelator operate most
likely<00:04:46.800> he<00:04:46.860> stolen<00:04:47.129> fxe<00:04:47.729> trouble<00:04:48.419> hits<00:04:48.539> were

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:48.629 
likely he stolen fxe trouble hits were

00:04:48.629 --> 00:05:03.080 
likely he stolen fxe trouble hits were
new<00:04:48.779> and<00:04:48.900> commonly<00:04:49.289> stolen<00:04:49.620> back<00:04:49.770> in<00:04:49.919> there

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.629 

but<00:05:03.720> if<00:05:03.930> any<00:05:04.230> of<00:05:04.320> you<00:05:04.380> boys<00:05:04.590> wonder<00:05:04.950> why<00:05:05.100> all

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
but if any of you boys wonder why all

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.430 
but if any of you boys wonder why all
these<00:05:05.850> pan<00:05:06.090> hits<00:05:06.360> have<00:05:06.510> shovel<00:05:06.810> top<00:05:06.990> ends<00:05:07.260> over

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
these pan hits have shovel top ends over

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.620 
these pan hits have shovel top ends over
where<00:05:07.650> do<00:05:07.710> you<00:05:07.830> think<00:05:07.980> that<00:05:08.220> came<00:05:08.400> from<00:05:08.630> it

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
where do you think that came from it
