answered and now we get to have that but
I<00:00:37.710> do<00:00:37.829> think<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.730> will<00:00:39.210> only<00:00:39.450> be<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:40.350> one-time

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
I do think it will only be a one-time

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.260 
I do think it will only be a one-time
thing<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:41.280> won't<00:00:41.489> be<00:00:41.610> able<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.820> change<00:00:42.059> your

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
thing you won't be able to change your

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.830 
thing you won't be able to change your
name<00:00:42.420> every<00:00:42.960> 10<00:00:43.680> free<00:00:43.890> chance<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.370> can<00:00:44.489> get

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
name every 10 free chance you can get

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.959 
name every 10 free chance you can get
that's<00:00:45.840> just<00:00:46.020> my<00:00:46.500> guess<00:00:46.800> I'm<00:00:47.370> not<00:00:47.550> pretty<00:00:47.760> sure

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
that's just my guess I'm not pretty sure

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.610 
that's just my guess I'm not pretty sure
on<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.120> but<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.600> would<00:00:48.719> think<00:00:49.079> that's<00:00:49.379> how

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
on that but I would think that's how

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.290 
on that but I would think that's how
it's<00:00:49.800> gonna<00:00:49.860> be<00:00:49.980> played<00:00:50.250> out<00:00:50.370> just<00:00:50.399> because<00:00:51.000> of

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
it's gonna be played out just because of

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.209 
it's gonna be played out just because of
you<00:00:51.750> know<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:52.320> don't<00:00:52.500> want<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.770> have

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
whatever for security reasons and for

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.119 
whatever for security reasons and for
fraud<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.840> know<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:58.020> can<00:00:58.320> have<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:58.890> many

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
fraud you know you can have so many

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.920

for those players that are getting that
high<00:01:24.720> just<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.200> show<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.979> know<00:01:26.009> they've

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
high just to show that you know they've

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.219 
high just to show that you know they've
earned<00:01:26.640> something<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.750> think<00:01:27.810> it's<00:01:28.140> a

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
earned something and I think it's a

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.749 
earned something and I think it's a
possibility<00:01:28.829> we<00:01:28.950> could<00:01:29.130> probably<00:01:29.310> have

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
possibility we could probably have

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.380 
possibility we could probably have
something<00:01:30.030> like<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.229> future<00:01:31.590> and

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
something like that in the future and

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.539 
something like that in the future and
