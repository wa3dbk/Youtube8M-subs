marzipan and cake decorating this is how

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.609 
marzipan and cake decorating this is how
to<00:00:17.279> make<00:00:17.400> marzipan<00:00:17.880> leaves<00:00:18.359> you<00:00:19.260> need<00:00:19.470> to

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
to make marzipan leaves you need to

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.980 
to make marzipan leaves you need to
color<00:00:19.859> some<00:00:20.130> marzipan<00:00:20.490> green<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.510> can't<00:00:21.750> use

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
color some marzipan green you can't use

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.599 
color some marzipan green you can't use
a<00:00:22.020> liquid<00:00:22.260> colors<00:00:22.859> because<00:00:23.070> they<00:00:23.220> affect<00:00:23.460> the

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
a liquid colors because they affect the

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.910 
a liquid colors because they affect the
consistency<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.539> marzipan<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:25.619> becomes

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
consistency of a marzipan it becomes

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.710 
consistency of a marzipan it becomes
very<00:00:26.130> sticky<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.330> need<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.599> use

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
very sticky so you need to use

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.109 
very sticky so you need to use
concentrated<00:00:28.230> paste<00:00:28.710> color<00:00:29.160> add<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.029> with

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
concentrated paste color add it with

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.060 
concentrated paste color add it with
cocktail<00:00:30.599> stick<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.140> made<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.740> through<00:00:31.949> your

marzipan stop your multipe and sticking

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.970 
marzipan stop your multipe and sticking
to<00:00:35.160> your<00:00:35.280> work<00:00:35.460> surface<00:00:35.870> just<00:00:36.870> with<00:00:37.590> icing

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
to your work surface just with icing

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.860 
to your work surface just with icing
sugar<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.700> then<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.329> want<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.570> roll<00:00:39.840> your

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
sugar and then you want to roll your

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.779 
sugar and then you want to roll your
marzipan<00:00:40.489> fairly<00:00:41.489> thinly<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:44.550> most

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
marzipan fairly thinly the most

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.049 
marzipan fairly thinly the most
effective<00:00:45.420> cutters<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.440> use<00:00:46.680> are<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.579> plunger

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
effective cutters to use are the plunger

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.930 
effective cutters to use are the plunger
cutters<00:00:48.450> which<00:00:49.020> also<00:00:49.350> act<00:00:49.800> as<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.370> vein<00:00:50.640> there

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
cutters which also act as a vein there

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.779 
cutters which also act as a vein there
so<00:00:51.420> they<00:00:51.570> put<00:00:51.780> realistic<00:00:52.410> detail<00:00:52.980> onto<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
so they put realistic detail onto the

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:54.410 
so they put realistic detail onto the
leaves

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
leaves

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.139 
leaves
once<00:00:55.170> you've<00:00:55.410> rolled<00:00:55.590> your<00:00:56.160> marzipan<00:00:56.579> fairly

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
once you've rolled your marzipan fairly

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.220 
once you've rolled your marzipan fairly
thinly<00:00:57.949> you<00:00:58.949> have<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.340> cut<00:00:59.640> the<00:01:00.629> leaf<00:01:00.840> first

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
thinly you have to cut the leaf first

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.950 
thinly you have to cut the leaf first
once<00:01:02.100> you've<00:01:02.370> cut<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.820> leaf<00:01:02.969> out<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.690> then

needs these work well in conjunction

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.020 
needs these work well in conjunction
with<00:01:15.750> marzipan<00:01:16.200> flowers<00:01:16.560> or<00:01:17.040> multi<00:01:17.310> pan<00:01:17.490> roses

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
veining detail and then bend the leaf

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.260 
veining detail and then bend the leaf
into<00:01:49.680> nice<00:01:50.250> shape

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
into nice shape
