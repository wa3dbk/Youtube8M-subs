00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.300
 hello everyone in this video we are going to 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.240
 talk a little about the 2 x 2 x cube 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.599
 4 of the rubik brand 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.980
 this as you see very interesting I already had 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.930
 the two by two by three the four by 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.879
 four times five and three times two times 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.500
 four I did not have it so I had to 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:20.930
 buy there was only he had to enter 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.930
 in the collection because here we have it 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.030
 Here we can see the brand logo 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.710
 rubik 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.750
 It's a combo and very interesting 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.940
 quite big the truth if you compare 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.610
 here we have a rubik's cube 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.260
 normal standard 3 x 3 x 3 set in the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.640
 size of the squares are much more 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.620
 large in 2 x 2 x 4 to the being of being 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.460
 the ruby brand and you can imagine that 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.460
 turn a little 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.740
 a little bit hard 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.570
 the transitions from one movement to another 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.890
 They are not are not smooth fluid must 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.360
 make enough force if it is not 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.310
 perfectly aligned have 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.820
 difficulties to turn for example if 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.280
 I have this 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.140
 and you want to do a turn down 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.860
 no longer can not you have to be 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.860
 perfectly 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.390
 but good 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.930
 I do not care either, I just wanted it 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.370
 to have 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.620
 I just wanted to have it in the 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.150
 collection to be able to solve it and 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.980
 have fun with him and he's very entertaining 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.210
 the truth what I do not like is with the 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.200
 stickers what they have done that is that 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.510
 they have put on the yellow and the white 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.430
 together and the blue the green also the 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.350
 orange and red have left the 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.020
 left posts that's pretty good 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.430
 well and then bring a little you do not have 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.560
 the typical references of the colors 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.840
 but it's not a problem either 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.430
 tremendous would simply prefer that 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.570
 We were going to see how 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.570
 turn while I undo it 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.330
 You'll see that it touches harder but turns 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.890
 well I do not pretend so that 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.810
 solve it high speed simply 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.310
 entertain me with him and this cube has 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.880
 something very interesting like some of 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.040
 you 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.410
 he will have noticed and is that being 2 x 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.630
 2 x 4 we can make 90 degree turns 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:04.710
 of the lateral faces 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.450
 and the cube is deformed I have it like that 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.819
 now I make this turn has already been deformed 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.430
 and now I keep deforming it and it becomes 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.200
 automatically in a two by two 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.500
 the cubes that are deformed are always 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.480
 very interesting because 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.020
 Dublin in Dublin to pay more attention 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.210
 at the time of solving them and at sight 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.490
 they are very interesting, not this 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.990
 baffles baffles a lot seems 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.890
 that it will be impossible to solve it 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.890
 taking advantage of that 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.800
 I have not been long, we are going to solve it and 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.690
 so I comment a little bit about 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.830
 over how do I solve the first thing 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.310
 we must return to the original form 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.310
 I had 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.570
 ignoring completely 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.570
 the 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.250
 colors simply returns it to the 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.690
 way and now I resolve it as 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.430
 I usually solve the Kuwaitis that is 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.940
 first the intermediate levels and then 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.940
 the external 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.800
 so 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.010
 I'm going to make a block 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.690
 as I have this green orange we are going to 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.690
 bring a red green 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:23.080
 here 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.710
 and now I need a red yellow red 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.400
 orange 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:30.680
 OK 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.870
 fix as I already have practically the 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.019
 intermediate levels completed now a 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.090
 Corners permutation algorithm is 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.330
 a little bit long and it's not very effective but 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.700
 good 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.910
 that is, works works only that is not 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.670
 It is not fast and now I have resolved 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.810
 the two intermediate levels and now 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.670
 I repeat the same thing for the 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.010
 external levels 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.760
 This is going to be my blue level as everything 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.989
 blue here first 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.989
 I have this blue here 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.370
 and now the study that is who we are 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.370
 to swap 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.099
 I have to ask these 2 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.470
 and here I have to ask enough 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.450
 down 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.990
 because everything solves directly 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.990
 doing so 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.810
 this is a simple coffee 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.780
 I already have the external levels 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.600
 completed 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.100
 and now I have turned around here this is 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.500
 but the three solutions will not pass 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.810
 relatively and we already have the cube 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.240
 completed you see that it is not very complicated 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.350
 but it's entertaining because it's how 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.370
 solve somehow 2 2 x 2 and 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.980
 we can go back as if it were a cube and 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.510
 of also part is in the parts 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.770
 internally so solve it from many 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.780
 ways I like to solve it so the 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.550
 first return it to the form and then 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.460
 over these inner layers and then the 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.040
 externally in the same way you can see that 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.510
 It was a little hard but it's very good 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.580
 entertaining do not throw any type 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.980
 of lubricant nor did I try to modify it 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.150
 not at all when buying that if it's 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.640
 a little bit expensive I do not remember exactly 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.849
 at the price I will put the description but 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:11.240
 it was a bit expensive 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:13.189
 to see if they get the 2 for 2 for not being for 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.030
 5 for 6 7 that could also be very 

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:18.480
 interesting 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:20.760
 I recommend it if the two times two 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.210
 three is fine but if it is deformed and 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.430
 that is one 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.750
 this makes it in maybe more 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.240
 interesting is again that the two by 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.650
 two times three but good if you want 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.509
 start in the world of cubes and des 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.190
 it is better to start with a three by three 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:34.509
 by two for one like these and then already 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.819
 then spend four by four by 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:40.210
 five etcetera good I do not roll more 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:42.069
 this has been the review go and resolution 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.270
 cube two by two by four brand 

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:46.770
 rubik I hope you liked it and we 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.770
 we see in another video and greet everyone
