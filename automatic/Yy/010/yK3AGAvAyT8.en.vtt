 you can follow them without much effort 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.619
 and that we will see completely difference 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.930
 in the day to day of your hair is 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.529
 talking a lot day by day and same hair 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.420
 phrase 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.760
 then 20 years will I speak more 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.550
 these two words 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.710
 The first tip first of all is no 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.210
 wash your hair every day 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.040
 that you have very oily hair is 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.110
 depending on the weather if you take from three to 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.960
 four times a week your hair 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.600
 He will adjust and wash the hair is 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.400
 for a while how she goes every day he 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.500
 began to become more valuable 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.040
 I stopped starting one day, yes two days. 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.200
 not 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.070
 and from there he adjusted it now there a 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.320
 every other day 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.600
 usually I know I had to leave 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.909
 one more day without washing your hair will not 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.799
 will be proud because today has 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.109
 hair feel as if you program your 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.060
 hair did not want to innovate it every day 

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:17.340
 because if you do it every day you 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.350
 You can end up taking everything. Look what 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.420
 ends up protecting your hair and that is not 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.490
 A little oil is always healthy 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.069
 for the hair stays very very much 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.920
 oily cabin really really 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:31.289
 proud to try to wash it with a guy 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.909
 dry it has this shampoo that can 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:38.579
 buy in cosmetics stores and everything 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:41.009
 I used this and when you wash and wash 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.350
 with little cooler water than that 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.630
 hot is to help combat this 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.549
 hair make it very soft and healthy is 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.369
 that your hair carefully then 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.299
 you wash your hair cold wing is 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:57.149
 that one with a towel and simply 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:59.969
 so he squeezes it to take the excess and 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:04.310
 tightens when it's time to do so or 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.310
 so he's got going with a 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.990
 for him and for brushing his impeachment 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.760
 one thing you have is three lakes 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.830
 in that way it will never end 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.470
 very hair then especially his 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.020
 hair was one day quite our equal 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.730
 now if you really want to 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.470
 those hair with dryers you do not 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.870
 Has time will always have a place you? 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:32.070
 need to get your hair done by 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:35.880
 dryer a configuration of more air 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.860
 hot and cold noc What is this here in 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.620
 My case is a jumpy in the grip 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.510
 and century usually now if you 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.530
 It really is very very much that you are 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.300
 deliquescent 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.630
 nothing to leave too close to letting 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.520
 at least as good a distance and 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.950
 I still try to use a protector 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.200
 as if it were a protector is that 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.120
 will not let your hair burn and be 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.120
 affected by the temperature of the 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.610
 dryer avoid clear chemistry of the 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.770
 name says chemistry does not do well for having a 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.630
 healthy hair for sure most 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.820
 of products is that the market is fulfilled 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.670
 information in places so shampoo 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.610
 conditioner cream anything they 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.100
 come with lots of chemistry in them and this 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.360
 chemistry may even show your hair 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.580
 It gets good 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.620
 a short period but over period 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.230
 use of these products 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.880
 it will stay dry and everything else so 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.590
 sometimes you really need a 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.150
 product that you like very slightly 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.090
 for a little bit for a little 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.709
 largest cosmetics store see the product 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.870
 without preference that do not contain salt 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.450
 them and use products as low as 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.510
 chemistry the best for your hair and 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.880

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.500
 something like more different instead 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.790
 to buy a product soon to see people 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.909

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.159
 myself is easy one with olive oil and 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:56.319
 Egg that looks great, I stay a lot. 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:58.569

 chemistry and your hair will thank you 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:04.060

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:07.629
 moisturizing cell phones that can be 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:10.030

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.599
 this mainly in meats no fish 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.099
 nor for example the hand olive oil 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:56.110
 these things will help the hair stay 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:59.139
 more shiny and soft 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.599
 drink at least eight glasses per 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.849
 day of water that gives so much your body goes 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:06.250

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:08.080
 clear that water has no against 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.389
 indication does well for anything to 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.570
 any time then try to drink enough 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:16.150
 water and avoid drinks that can tell the 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.370
 Do you have your hair? 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.260
 stay at home was not leaving, maybe a 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.289
 day by day to let your hair down 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:27.099
 because hair stuck is very 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:29.770
 hair also if you are 86 cocaine a 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:32.229
 side because it's up you stay 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.539
 always pulling and very strong even place 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:36.580
 that will end up falling and care can 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:39.220
 end up getting bald here in that part 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:42.070
 so be careful with this do not pull well 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:45.130
 in training, the hair was always good 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.220
 loose and try to stay with him the most 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.110
 over sometimes it's difficult because 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.970
 Opened, people only learn to leave. 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.100
 running but have to do a hairstyle 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:56.700
 that does not pull your hair and video that 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.530
 become brittle and worsens in the case 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.570
 to be bald so I'm sure that 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:03.240
 no woman wants to stay but the management 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.880
 the body then whole hair three times 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.610
 per week it does a good massage and 10 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.770
 minutes in your hair more or less than 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.630
 this will cause blood to flow 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.640
 better this part and will increase the 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.320
 knowledge your hair do not say 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.610
 increase the amount but it will 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.160
 grow faster 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.630
 then do a massage yourself want 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.350
 for me to do if we go with too much 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.410
 will 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:27.870
 What is your hair, there, you have to cut it? 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:29.820
 22 months are things like that. 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:33.330
 A little finger of your hair. 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:35.580
 because only she cut because she goes 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.950
 get shorter hair but I believe 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.470
 that cut his hair to grow more 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:43.830
 however contradictory it may seem it is 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:45.450
 then truth is hair cuts - should 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.490
 get healthier because they are tea 

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:49.020
 These double things mean that we 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.570
 You know you have 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:54.450
