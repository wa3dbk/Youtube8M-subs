00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.949
 Hmm 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:26.840
 life was normal 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:30.949
 everything was in balance 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:34.309
 the days were calm and things seemed 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.680
 fit perfectly into your 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.410
 places 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:44.360
 when I least expected a small 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:48.940
 flame if it lights up for the first time 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:52.670
 sometimes in life a different sensation 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:56.799
 I tried to understand what was happening and saw 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:00.500
 that little flame is growing 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:01.309
 I thought it might be another phase of 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.630
 life 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:07.280
 I did not call but one day when I was 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.540
 near to you 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:15.080
 I could not believe I noticed the flame. 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.040
 then the lion increased to his 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.070
 eyes 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:24.410
 I tried to say something, my voice did not come out 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:29.510
 I thought to divert my gaze 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:33.310
 but I could not by and large 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:36.860
 heart started beating faster 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:40.330
 I thought it was all just a dream 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:43.510
 wonderful sign 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:47.050
 I saw you again 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:51.830
 I confess that the flame no longer existed 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:56.110
 had given way to a bonfire that each 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:59.210
 there is more that if it is my heart 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:03.680
 I thought of a lot of people say it all 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:07.479
 but I hesitated I was afraid to risk 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:12.110
 I preferred to dream in broad daylight. 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:15.370
 feel this emotion every minute and 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.180
 simply looking 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:22.920
 I think in life 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:26.790
 nothing happens you happened to 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:31.950
 my way enlightened me and ascended to the 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:36.329
 first flame and now what to do with this 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.370
 Please, let me know that as much as I 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:41.459
 keep your cool 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:45.599
 my heart beats stronger and 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:48.049
 It is sincerely difficult to avoid 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.049
 explosion
