00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 all right 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.850
 hello good afternoon friends again with 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.850
 you a more delighted Tuesday of 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.790
 to be here and to keep us company 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.600
 from their homes one comment and to what 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.500
 such 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.270
 you come from outside has been in galicia and 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.739
 trying to find the cool of 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.360
 galicia but nevertheless it's hot 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.370
 tremendous there was also hot in 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.559
 galicia of generalized in everything is not 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.420
 nice green galicia as always yes 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.340
 well I am available to you in accounts 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.660
 you know that this space that we dedicate 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.519
 at the beginning of each program 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.140
 we talk about cosmetic surgery we have 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.670
 created a qualitative leap perhaps the 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.270
 last week when we went to the 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.550
 facial surgery against the face that 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.979
 maybe it's like the one that's most at 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.710
 view of the whole world and today we are going to 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.020
 talk about rhinoplasty of the operation 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.270
 of cosmetic surgery of the nose and I 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.500
 then would you begin to start 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.780
 comment a little about this operation 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.560
 which is perhaps the most frequent is not 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.000
 so good is one of the most frequent 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.340
 we have two interventions 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.229
 stars of one is the mom and another the 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.729
 nose I think the nose of course 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.610
 is the most frequent of all those 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.290
 we make 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.420
 Y 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.030
 We talked about the car last week 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.950
 plasty of the ears of children who 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.680
 they had problems a bit of adaptation 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.330
 for his protruding ears or as 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.390
 we could be maybe we started 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.730
 too much with really young children to 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.780
 operate as for the nose too 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:59.540
 always start in cut in a 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.060
 age a little more more advanced because 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.070
 really the nose we try to wait 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.229
 to have made a growth almost 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.899
 before you told me you too 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.550
 out of set that if it was really big 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.970
 and it kept growing throughout all the 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:17.030
 life and ears good is relaxing 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.860
 so it may seem that I grow 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.140
 really the growth usually ends 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.020
 in today's kids because today they are very 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.120
 advanced and girls over 14 years 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.220
 more or less and it's from that age 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.930
 when we already indicated the intervention of 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.000
 nose because one thing is growth 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.250
 of the bones and something else is what it is 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.830
 the cartilage the skin and so on not because 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.690
 that means the aging 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.500
 severity and other circumstances if 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.000
 forever 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.040
 if one thing the growth the cartilage 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.410
 of the bone that is the structure of the 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.590
 organism that stops a certain 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.330
 age one cartilage bone and another is the 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.280
 relaxation that all the 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.060
 tissues normally soft tissues 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.770
 and in 'tell me' the truth is that what 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.959
 the nose seems like a plan although 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.360
 be the most frequent of the most 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.220
 complicated as you said because as 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.940
 it's a part of the face that really 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.210
 define the personality 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.100
 When it comes to your query, I suppose 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.860
 they were a little lost something they do not like 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.960
 of your nose something you want to change I guess 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.600
 that you have a huge 27 in a crowd of 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.730
 possibilities of nose changes 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.680
 as oriented to the good patient the most 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.360
 important is to analyze that the patient 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.390
 have an important motivation for 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.700
 look nose see you do not stop 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.730
 nose the people who have the big law or 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.370
 ugly but those people who do not 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.350
 he likes his nose and that normally 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.990
 they face an entire society that does not 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.640
 understands for nothing that they have so much 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.960
 interest in changing your image as to 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.720
 go through an operating room with a 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.700
 surgery then if a 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.160
 once then if the motivation is clear 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.010
 that is, this person wants to change his 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.260
 nose then you have to do a very 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.380
 very detailed very detailed very detailed 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.360
 of what the nose is inside a 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.890
 face and inside a person is not 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.660
 can do two noses the same do not 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.340
 you will know the whole world the same there is 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.530
 do according to the nose according to the 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.810
 person who carries it according to the structure 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.220
 you have to design and then be 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.329
 able to do an operating theater 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:19.070
 nose for each the forms 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.590
 different for each person 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.880
 we are going back to the subject of what 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.640
 important that is the nose at the time of 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.100
 define a face I guess success 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.710
 of an operation will be the imperceptible 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.870
 of herself or that someone when 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:36.440
 Well , the nose has been operated 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:39.280
 that is not something that does not look at your nose 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.900
 is one of the most discreet in terms of 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.370
 brands can be most of the 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.930
 interventions to the intervention very 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.970
 complex, most of them are all 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.980
 through the nostrils internally 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.020
 I place spur and there is none left and 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.390
 of course I always want a 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.000
 patient 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:58.570
 Say you find her very beautiful do not tell me 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.700
 He wants anyone so pretty and that 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.350
 it means that it shows and a nose does not 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.030
 it should be noticed with some ears or like the 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.790
 lip there must be a harmonic whole 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.800
 beautiful aesthetic and that's when it 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.990
 achieves the perfect result of the 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.490
 beauty that the patient intends first 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.740
 which is the first one that should feel good 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.690
 and forget and not see if the nose of the 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.800
 Patients see her once in the nose 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.990
 after a month you no longer have to 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.450
 do not see a complete set 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.950
 that is to say this is me but that it is integrated 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.080
 perfectly inside your own face 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.150
 now totally and I'm worried about the subject 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.820
 it is already general issues within the 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.280
 surgery in this case also as what 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.860
 are trends not in fashion and others not 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.380
 in surgery because sometimes it seems that it can 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.560
 to fall is in those terms not because before 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.260
 the plump women were carrying weapons 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.110
 almost anorexic skinny up times 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:49.210
 in the nose there is a tendency there 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.700
 trends if yes look there are trends in 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.280
 times but also trends in the 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:57.370
 races you know in a country like in usa 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.300
 that there are so many races the nose is a 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:02.080
 intervention that 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:04.539
 them ethnic is to say for example you to 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:08.229
 a Jew you can not make a nose 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:10.330
 just like a Latino for example for the 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:12.639
 fact that in the Jewish environment that the 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.050
 noses are very large a nose that 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:16.060
 it may seem normal for them to 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.460
 it may seem small then you have to 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:21.970
 adapt fashion more than fashion adapt 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.810
 the volumes and forms to the charm 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.090
 cultural 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.889
 because they are all the Mediterranean but you 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.389
 you may have also noticed that 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:30.250
 really the Mediterranean nose is 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:32.110
 different in the central European nose is 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.479
 tell the Germans to analyze a lot 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.860
 smaller and more funnier by 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:38.319
 call her more pertly 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.870
 cillas that ours is to say maybe 

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:42.340
 a German woman with a short nose 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.020
 Upscale is doing well while a 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.810
 Spanish does not have to have another 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:50.050
 character then more than fashions are 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:52.000
 of course modern ethnic traits there are 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.340
 if you see throughout history what 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.500
 that he was liking in everything that is 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.460
 the human body has been varying and 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.319
 then the nose 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.449
 nowadays what is the nose that is 

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:02.550
 it takes to say it in some way then 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:06.830
 in the nose 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:09.750
 the carry feel happy with it and 

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:11.580
 now if you think that after a few videos 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.140
 of one of the interventions how many 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.630
 interventions he has made of analyzing 

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.040
 until today of nose if they are the most 

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:19.790
 frequent I guess they have organized 

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.590
 many around two or three thousand yes 

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:25.050
 I've been doing it for thirty years 

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:27.780
 nose then add up is that way 

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:30.140
 traumatic as a reconstructive because they are 

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.140
 these
