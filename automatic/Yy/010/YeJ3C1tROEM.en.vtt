00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:08.370
 so people now very short video me 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.210
 do not even know what to call it 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.210
 so football 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:20.430
 you need is here simply from the account 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:26.300
 So it's a shadow on the soko 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:31.170
 ham slices so without cheese sorry yes 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:45.390
 to education recites thus to quadrangle 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:48.050
 of course, that's what I'm pushing now 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.050
 so flat 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.980
 because you can also find so 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.860
 so that a trough stands 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:29.400
 exactly what are you doing in the hollow saying something 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.450
 Exactly if it is at all this clock 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:39.590
 send 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:39.590
 so now it's all coming in 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:12.190
 exactly on these rub cheese made the 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.190
 even from a novel rand 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.390
 I have preheated the oven now 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.180
 time to 200 degrees 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:35.920
 have there still have with with aluminum foil 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:37.810
 designed to come here now they have 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.670
 except you best take clothes 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.170
 So I made this big sandwich jab 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.170
 of course here for the first time 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.400
 this is how it happens in a baking oven 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.510
 shows how it works together with aluminum foil 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.320
 interpret 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:03.400
 but then it's up to me, as you like 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:08.040
 so far have the parts for just at 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.040
 my one hell of a night what's going on 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.150
 and after that I did not know how long 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.359
 I'm scary with each other 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:25.969
 until today it is through the two 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:31.379
 Share how horny really crispy 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:37.200
 people so that something arose group 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:40.650
 now out of somewhere hooked there 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.909
 later people theoretically ponies them 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.909
 again I lick my ass 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:54.769
 So we were here write cheese 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:55.919
 sorry 20 grams 52 accounts and rubber 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:04:02.629
 Washington 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:02.629
 that is, so second had 360 calories 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:17.070
 16 23 28h protein that's not what we mean 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:18.599
 a child is completely free at 8 it's just 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.500
 a fraction of of what eaten from 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:25.409
 and still comes to just 50 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.870
 gram fat people it was really cool 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:30.979
 so new spices therefore clever 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:34.280
 Cheese stand beautifully crunchy the ice 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.280
 willless people
