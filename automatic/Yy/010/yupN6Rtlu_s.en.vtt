I've kind of moved away from that a
little<00:01:10.860> bit<00:01:11.100> I'm<00:01:11.460> realizing<00:01:11.970> that's<00:01:12.120> more<00:01:12.540> of

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.660 
little bit I'm realizing that's more of

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.090 
little bit I'm realizing that's more of
where<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.870> want<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.110> go<00:01:13.230> with<00:01:13.320> my<00:01:13.470> life<00:01:13.650> back

where I want to go with my life back
into<00:01:14.550> that<00:01:14.730> kind<00:01:14.940> of<00:01:14.970> area<00:01:15.240> with<00:01:15.480> just<00:01:15.660> with

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
into that kind of area with just with

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.200 
into that kind of area with just with
people<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.590> connections<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.940> know<00:01:18.060> that

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
people and connections and you know that

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.390 
people and connections and you know that
can<00:01:18.330> also<00:01:18.480> be<00:01:18.600> bigger<00:01:19.160> for<00:01:20.160> a<00:01:20.220> broader

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
can also be bigger for a broader

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.920 
can also be bigger for a broader
audience<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:21.030> know<00:01:21.150> when<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.420> when<00:01:21.690> you<00:01:21.780> have

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
audience you know when you when you have

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.960 
audience you know when you when you have
an<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.320> project<00:01:23.070> or<00:01:23.190> an<00:01:23.280> idea<00:01:23.580> it's<00:01:23.760> a<00:01:23.820> lot

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
an a project or an idea it's a lot

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.030 
an a project or an idea it's a lot
bigger<00:01:24.120> than<00:01:24.540> yourself<00:01:25.230> or<00:01:25.380> your<00:01:25.500> own<00:01:25.590> family

bigger than yourself or your own family
probably<00:01:26.550> the<00:01:26.730> thing<00:01:26.910> that<00:01:26.940> gets<00:01:27.390> me<00:01:27.860> started

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
probably the thing that gets me started

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.470 
probably the thing that gets me started
brewing<00:01:29.250> over<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.640> most<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.030> when<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.240> start<00:01:30.450> to

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.480 
brewing over the most is when I start to

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.660 
brewing over the most is when I start to
design<00:01:30.900> boards<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.500> fins<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.100> look<00:01:32.550> at

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
design boards and fins and look at

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.280 
design boards and fins and look at
materials<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.420> shapes<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.020> kind<00:01:34.260> of

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
materials and shapes and that kind of

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.020 
materials and shapes and that kind of
thing<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.800> mean<00:01:35.280> that's<00:01:35.430> where<00:01:35.610> my<00:01:35.790> brain

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
thing I mean that's where my brain

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.670 
thing I mean that's where my brain
really<00:01:36.240> starts<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.600> take<00:01:36.840> over<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.590> get

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
really starts to take over and you get

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.360 
really starts to take over and you get
excited<00:01:38.190> and<00:01:38.370> get<00:01:39.000> really<00:01:39.840> inspired<00:01:40.410> I<00:01:40.770> know

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
excited and get really inspired I know

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.010 
excited and get really inspired I know
at<00:01:41.580> some<00:01:41.700> point<00:01:41.910> I'll<00:01:42.000> stop<00:01:42.150> competing<00:01:42.480> of

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
at some point I'll stop competing of

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.050 
at some point I'll stop competing of
course<00:01:43.290> but<00:01:43.620> I<00:01:43.980> don't<00:01:44.550> think<00:01:44.670> I'll<00:01:44.820> ever<00:01:44.850> stop

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060
