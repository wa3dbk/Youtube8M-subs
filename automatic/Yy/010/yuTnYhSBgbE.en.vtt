multi gyaku as the punch comes in I
already<00:00:09.990> have<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.380> be<00:00:10.500> moving<00:00:10.950> while<00:00:11.160> that

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
already have to be moving while that

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.220 
already have to be moving while that
hand<00:00:11.759> is<00:00:11.910> coming<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.420> I'm<00:00:12.540> not<00:00:12.750> trying<00:00:13.139> to

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
I've got to kind of ko it to take that

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.700 
I've got to kind of ko it to take that
entire<00:00:19.859> arm<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:21.150> get<00:00:21.270> this<00:00:21.539> block<00:00:21.960> or<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.560> be

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
entire arm to get this block or to be

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.439 
entire arm to get this block or to be
already<00:00:23.039> coming<00:00:23.400> in<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.699> doing<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:24.000> hit<00:00:24.240> with

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
already coming in and doing a hit with

already coming in and doing a hit with
this<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.990> so<00:00:25.650> as<00:00:25.890> I'm<00:00:26.130> here<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.400> might<00:00:26.609> even<00:00:26.760> be

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
this and so as I'm here I might even be

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.179 
this and so as I'm here I might even be
stepping<00:00:27.420> back<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.840> get<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.170> block<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:29.070> I'm

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
stepping back to get that block and I'm

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.950 
stepping back to get that block and I'm
just<00:00:29.369> gonna<00:00:29.490> have<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:29.970> whole<00:00:30.210> arm<00:00:30.510> once<00:00:30.810> it

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
just gonna have that whole arm once it

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.260 
just gonna have that whole arm once it
has<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.380> touch<00:00:31.769> come<00:00:32.160> down<00:00:32.369> on<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.759> arm<00:00:32.969> and

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
has that touch come down on the arm and

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.630 
has that touch come down on the arm and
then<00:00:33.600> I'm<00:00:33.780> going<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:33.989> step<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.680> try<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.040> see

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
then I'm going to step in and try to see

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.639 
then I'm going to step in and try to see
if<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.880> can<00:00:36.120> capture<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:37.140> arm<00:00:37.410> with<00:00:37.620> both

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
if I can capture this arm with both

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.850 
if I can capture this arm with both
hands<00:00:38.309> if<00:00:38.520> possible<00:00:39.410> doesn't<00:00:40.410> always<00:00:40.530> happen

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
hands if possible doesn't always happen

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.360 
hands if possible doesn't always happen
and<00:00:41.300> push<00:00:42.300> in<00:00:42.570> his<00:00:42.930> elbow<00:00:43.200> at<00:00:43.590> this<00:00:43.829> angle<00:00:44.070> and

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
and push in his elbow at this angle and

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.250 
and push in his elbow at this angle and
I've<00:00:44.550> also<00:00:44.730> got<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> little<00:00:45.239> light<00:00:45.660> touch<00:00:45.989> on

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
I've also got a little light touch on

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.410 
I've also got a little light touch on
the<00:00:46.379> knee<00:00:46.559> here<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.100> then<00:00:47.550> take<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.090> down

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
the knee here and then take this down

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.330 
the knee here and then take this down
and<00:00:48.780> then<00:00:49.110> we<00:00:49.289> get<00:00:49.410> him<00:00:49.530> on<00:00:49.620> his<00:00:49.770> side<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.250> we

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
and then we get him on his side and we

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.160 
and then we get him on his side and we
do<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> finish<00:00:50.969> whatever<00:00:51.270> you'd<00:00:51.690> like<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.899> do

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
do a finish whatever you'd like to do

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.799 
do a finish whatever you'd like to do
for<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.469> technique<00:00:53.210> so<00:00:54.210> how<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.629> would<00:00:54.780> look

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
for that technique so how it would look

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.080 
for that technique so how it would look
here<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.530> where<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.890> here<00:00:56.190> I'm<00:00:56.640> out<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
here is where it here I'm out to the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.810 
here is where it here I'm out to the
side<00:00:57.329> get<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.920> then<00:00:59.010> do<00:00:59.280> some<00:00:59.550> type<00:00:59.789> of

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
side get it in and then do some type of

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.470 
side get it in and then do some type of
other<00:01:00.180> take<00:01:00.800> it's<00:01:01.800> interesting<00:01:02.340> what<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.329> get

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
other take it's interesting what to get

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.780 
other take it's interesting what to get
that<00:01:03.690> bend<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.379> arm<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.920> get<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.430> break

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
that bend in that arm to get that break

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.640 
that bend in that arm to get that break
to<00:01:06.030> happen<00:01:06.420> cuz<00:01:06.570> then<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:06.869> could<00:01:07.020> just<00:01:07.200> turn<00:01:07.409> and

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
to happen cuz then I could just turn and

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.190 
to happen cuz then I could just turn and
come<00:01:07.979> down<00:01:08.220> straight<00:01:08.640> inside<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.900> do<00:01:10.049> all

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
come down straight inside and do all

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.320 
come down straight inside and do all
sorts<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.619> different<00:01:10.799> moves<00:01:11.189> from<00:01:11.430> there<00:01:11.640> so

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
sorts of different moves from there so

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.870 
sorts of different moves from there so
this<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.570> one<00:01:12.840> version<00:01:13.340> another<00:01:14.340> really<00:01:14.729> good

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
this is one version another really good

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.149 
this is one version another really good
version<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.450> I'm<00:01:15.689> out<00:01:15.810> here<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.740> just<00:01:16.770> come

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
version is I'm out here and I just come

version is I'm out here and I just come
in<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.490> do<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:17.880> take<00:01:18.210> coming<00:01:18.600> straight<00:01:18.960> down

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
in to do this take coming straight down

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.249 
in to do this take coming straight down
put<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.280> up<00:01:20.490> inside<00:01:20.670> my<00:01:21.119> armpit<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:22.170> I've
