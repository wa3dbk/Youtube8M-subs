00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
right now is a 1 by 12 speaker cabinet

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.679 
right now is a 1 by 12 speaker cabinet
and<00:00:23.310> I'm<00:00:23.850> just<00:00:24.060> gonna<00:00:24.150> do<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.840> little<00:00:25.050> bit<00:00:25.289> here

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
and I'm just gonna do a little bit here

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.169 
and I'm just gonna do a little bit here
without<00:00:27.689> any<00:00:28.019> pedals<00:00:28.439> just<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.189> amp<00:00:29.670> itself

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
without any pedals just the amp itself

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.900 
without any pedals just the amp itself
and<00:00:30.599> it's<00:00:30.960> about<00:00:31.199> halfway<00:00:31.410> up<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:32.130> gain<00:00:32.700> is

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
and it's about halfway up the gain is

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.190 
and it's about halfway up the gain is
maxed<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:34.399> volumes<00:00:35.399> about<00:00:35.550> halfway<00:00:35.940> up

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
maxed and the volumes about halfway up

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.270

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
that sounds like humbucker single coils

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.220 
that sounds like humbucker single coils
and<00:00:41.309> then<00:00:41.520> then<00:00:42.360> I'll<00:00:42.480> had<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.660> tube<00:00:42.960> screamer

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230

and then then I'll had a tube screamer
in<00:00:43.620> front<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.640> show<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.850> how<00:00:45.030> well<00:00:45.239> it

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
in front of it to show you how well it

00:00:45.390 --> 00:01:23.639 
in front of it to show you how well it
takes<00:00:45.600> pedals

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.980 

now<00:01:24.649> that<00:01:24.920> was<00:01:25.009> a<00:01:25.040> humbucker<00:01:25.479> let's<00:01:26.479> let's

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
now that was a humbucker let's let's

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:53.080 
now that was a humbucker let's let's
just<00:01:27.680> put<00:01:28.130> neck<00:01:28.340> in<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:28.580> middle<00:01:28.820> here<00:01:52.090> so

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
let's go back to the humbucker and then

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:33.860 
let's go back to the humbucker and then
let's<00:01:55.159> switch<00:01:55.880> in<00:01:56.119> a<00:01:56.240> tube<00:01:57.080> screamer
