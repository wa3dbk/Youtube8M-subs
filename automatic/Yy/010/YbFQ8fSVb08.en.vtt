00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
problem is the way they did it they just

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.889 
problem is the way they did it they just
drug<00:01:45.619> it<00:01:45.979> out<00:01:46.219> forever<00:01:46.759> and<00:01:47.479> just<00:01:47.659> kept

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
drug it out forever and just kept

indie<00:01:53.749> games<00:01:53.990> I've<00:01:54.289> said<00:01:54.770> that<00:01:54.950> in<00:01:55.070> the<00:01:55.130> past

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.580 
indie games I've said that in the past
but<00:01:55.939> they<00:01:56.119> really<00:01:56.450> took<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.659> time<00:01:56.810> to<00:01:57.289> talk

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
but they really took the time to talk

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.309 
but they really took the time to talk
about<00:01:57.829> the<00:01:58.310> good<00:01:58.609> ones<00:01:58.909> and<00:01:59.210> just<00:01:59.990> show<00:02:00.289> a

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
about the good ones and just show a

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.139 
about the good ones and just show a
montage<00:02:01.009> of<00:02:01.039> the<00:02:01.460> ones<00:02:01.789> that<00:02:01.939> are

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
montage of the ones that are

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.319 
montage of the ones that are
uninteresting<00:02:03.109> so<00:02:03.350> they<00:02:03.469> handled<00:02:03.890> it<00:02:04.009> okay<00:02:04.609> so

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
uninteresting so they handled it okay so

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:06.760 
uninteresting so they handled it okay so
they<00:02:05.479> started<00:02:05.869> with<00:02:06.020> a<00:02:06.079> bang<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:06.649> they

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
they started with a bang and they

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.100 
they started with a bang and they
definitely<00:02:07.219> went<00:02:07.640> out<00:02:07.880> with<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.300> bang<00:02:08.510> also

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
definitely went out with the bang also

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.080 
definitely went out with the bang also

mention<00:05:47.810> earlier<00:05:47.990> uncharted<00:05:48.830> 4<00:05:49.070> was<00:05:49.250> amazing

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:49.790 
mention earlier uncharted 4 was amazing

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.090 
mention earlier uncharted 4 was amazing
even<00:05:50.150> though<00:05:50.240> it<00:05:50.360> wasn't<00:05:50.570> a<00:05:50.900> gameplay<00:05:51.590> trailer

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
even though it wasn't a gameplay trailer

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.400 
even though it wasn't a gameplay trailer
it<00:05:52.670> looked<00:05:53.120> really<00:05:53.420> really<00:05:53.750> good<00:05:53.870> and<00:05:54.320> they

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410 
it looked really really good and they

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.230 
it looked really really good and they
said<00:05:54.620> all<00:05:54.800> the<00:05:54.920> footage<00:05:55.250> was<00:05:55.430> captured<00:05:55.670> from<00:05:56.150> a

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
said all the footage was captured from a

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.690 
said all the footage was captured from a
PlayStation<00:05:56.990> 4<00:05:57.260> so<00:05:57.740> coming<00:05:58.130> in<00:05:58.250> with<00:05:58.400> a<00:05:58.430> bang

00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:58.700 
PlayStation 4 so coming in with a bang

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.250 
PlayStation 4 so coming in with a bang
and<00:05:58.910> going<00:05:59.150> out<00:05:59.300> with<00:05:59.450> a<00:05:59.480> bang<00:05:59.690> i<00:05:59.900> think<00:06:00.110> it<00:06:00.170> was

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
and going out with a bang i think it was

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.200 
and going out with a bang i think it was
something<00:06:00.620> that<00:06:00.650> Sony<00:06:00.980> did<00:06:01.220> well<00:06:01.460> and<00:06:01.760> I<00:06:02.180> think

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
something that Sony did well and I think

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.240 
something that Sony did well and I think
it<00:06:02.570> was<00:06:02.690> something<00:06:03.140> that<00:06:03.170> I<00:06:03.290> wish<00:06:03.560> Microsoft

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
even keel all throughout but there's

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.480
