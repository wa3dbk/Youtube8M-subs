00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
other seat and you don't have to take

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.639 
other seat and you don't have to take
the<00:00:35.850> seat<00:00:36.059> unit<00:00:36.210> off<00:00:36.480> which<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.050> why<00:00:37.230> this<00:00:37.290> one

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
the seat unit off which is why this one

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.000 
the seat unit off which is why this one
so<00:00:37.829> special<00:00:38.329> all<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.690> need<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.899> do<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.700> push

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
so special all you need to do is push

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.260 
so special all you need to do is push
say<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.070> either<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:46.520> push<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:47.700> clip<00:00:48.030> in

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
say it either it is push this clip in

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.990 
say it either it is push this clip in
and<00:00:48.719> then<00:00:48.899> put<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.200> back<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:50.309> clip<00:00:50.489> also<00:00:50.640> acts

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
and then put it back the clip also acts

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.270 
and then put it back the clip also acts
as<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.329> recline<00:00:51.660> feature<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.530> incline<00:00:52.949> so

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
as a recline feature in the incline so

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.240 
as a recline feature in the incline so
if<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.149> want<00:00:54.329> baby<00:00:54.539> sit<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> bit<00:00:54.989> more<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:56.100> can

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
if you want baby sit a bit more you can

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.479 
if you want baby sit a bit more you can
just<00:00:56.430> do<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.390> but<00:00:58.109> there<00:00:58.289> we<00:00:58.410> go<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:59.160> it

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
just do that but there we go and it

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.180 
just do that but there we go and it

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
comes with a head hugger so you can

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.130

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
how the hood now goes in you don't have

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.350 
how the hood now goes in you don't have
to<00:01:27.330> take<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.600> hood<00:01:27.720> off<00:01:27.780> at<00:01:27.960> all<00:01:28.850> it<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:29.970> just<00:01:30.270> a

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
to take the hood off at all it is just a

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.510 
to take the hood off at all it is just a
case<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.810> reversing<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.650> like<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.930> then<00:01:34.520> at

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
case of reversing it like so and then at

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.319 
case of reversing it like so and then at
the<00:01:35.670> back<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:37.680> seat<00:01:37.920> goes<00:01:38.130> up<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.060> can

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
the back the seat goes up so you can

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.600 
the back the seat goes up so you can
completely<00:01:39.689> hide<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.680> no<00:01:40.920> one<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.430> the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
completely hide that and no one is the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.819 
completely hide that and no one is the
wiser<00:01:42.409> as<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.470> what's<00:01:43.890> going<00:01:44.009> on<00:01:44.369> at<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.549> back

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
wiser as to what's going on at the back

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.249 
wiser as to what's going on at the back
