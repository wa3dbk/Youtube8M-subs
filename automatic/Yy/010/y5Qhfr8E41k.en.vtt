00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.510
 hi people today in sk game we bring you 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.630
 the gimmicks for the gifted video game 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:31.360
 but we warn that these tricks are 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.600
 for a way rather agree to 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.500
 practice plus multiplayer 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.180
 then to apply these tricks 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.769
 let's say it like that we have to go to what is 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.769
 call play play option 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.270
 and we are going to create a room in many 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.280
 parts is said that we have to go to 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.530
 practices but not clear or is confused already 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.600
 that we have chat with bots or possible 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.910
 training that would be like to 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.879
 we synonyms if they tell us that 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.440
 kind of things generalized then for 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.790
 to be able to try these tricks you have to enter 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.910
 to create room 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.040
 to create a room here in the room if 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.680
 you can observe they appear also 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.990
 some options here at the bottom 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.140
 where it tells us 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.880
 this point tricks 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.010
 in most people it will seem 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.360
 A not like I have already changed it 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.110
 it looks like a if we only give it 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.040
 modify and here we verify that this 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.040
 small box 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.930
 in activating good tricks 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.190
 have the chulito already here we guard 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.460
 changes 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:43.369
 it's worth here right now 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.960
 we can already use the tricks during 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.270
 the practice game 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:53.119
 let's select for example that 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.119
 we want to play against a few bots 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.390
 let's select the team where 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.450
 we want our character to be in 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.450
 the 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.539
 well I also have to specify that 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.939
 it's all good many people will say that these 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.849
 tricks do not work but really these 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:13.310
 tricks are mainly contributed to the 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.769
 people that start as it gives the 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.980
 opportunity for us to raise the character 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:21.379
 to a higher level quickly and power 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.170
 try each of the items we have 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:26.569
 it's more at the beginning I was 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.390
 selecting items that good 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.489
 they contributed but there were some who had the 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.030
 same value but they gave me much better 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.580
 statistics 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.800
 then this serves more than anything to 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.780
 those people do as tests try 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.650
 this but in the other 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.640
 and they can see how they manage to get one hundred 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.260
 hundred of the character he chooses 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.260
 well let's start a game 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:04.469
 choose this character that I have here 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.860
 let's tell him to play 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.069
 well here we are going to put into practice 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.200
 couple of tricks nothing more 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.989
 since they are enough 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.940
 to write the tricks only 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.060
 we must enter what is the 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.730
 chat window that press enter and 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.140
 they are already activated to start the trick 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.599
 you have to take into account one thing that 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.300
 always have to go by the symbol of 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:36.440
 less or as they want to say Indian 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.270
 well this trick what you are going to do is 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.370
 take the character to the level that 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.890
 we said it then 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.280
 example I want my character blood 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:50.900
 reach level 25 then then 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:54.050
 I write him with the command trick and 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.750
 digit 25 people 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:00.250
 can see I already have 5 logically I have 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.250
 to start distributing what they are 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.410
 and those that we have left are going to be added 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.410
 the analysts 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.660
 okay then one of the 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.389
 tricks that I think can be from the 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:26.729
 most striking this trick is based 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.729
 practically in what it is to acquire gold 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.490
 I 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.490
 [Music] 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:39.860
 and I think that here in endow does not allow to have 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:42.590
 more than 200 or something 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.990
 not to complicate I'm going to place 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.510
 16,000 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.540
 as you can see here is already current 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.190
 updated 16 thousand euros then good 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.380
 let's select the objects here is 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.300
 where 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.340
 at the beginning he made the mistake 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.750
 for example, almost always in the games 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:04.650
 in what it acquired was this object 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.479
 acquired what was this 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.100
 that is here in the improvements this with its 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:10.100
 respective improvement than the respective 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:14.130
 double 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.680
 how good logically it gives me a 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.610
 statistics but here where I 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.590
 I was wrong 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.840
 in the games many times I bought what 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.669
 what was this man assault armor 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.659
 he really gave me a quantity 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:30.099
 attack speed good a amount of 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:33.139
 pretty interesting statistics but 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:35.030
 this object made me 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:37.699
 let's say it makes it immortal is 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:40.969
 for you to take blood from this character 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:43.449
 with this object once purchased is a 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:43.449
 problem 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.300
 then as I realized everything 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.990
 that practically through these 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.700
 practicing tricks by choosing looking 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.850
 this object how was this going? 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:59.940
 the other and so in this way was that 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:05.030
 I really did what I wanted to do 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:05.030
 good guys, it's practically turn 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:11.569
 and that already ended these tricks 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.130
 I hope it really is enough for them 

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:16.069
 utility mainly to people 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:18.680
 that start in the endowment and that after 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:23.110
 be those who are always at the head of 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.110
 your group good and until a next
