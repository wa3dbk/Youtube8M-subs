this<00:00:18.020> is<00:00:18.260> the<00:00:18.380> package<00:00:18.740> size<00:00:18.920> it<00:00:19.250> is<00:00:19.310> in

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:19.700 
this is the package size it is in

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.350 
this is the package size it is in
centimeters<00:00:20.620> and<00:00:21.620> it's<00:00:21.830> about<00:00:22.010> 23<00:00:22.670> pounds<00:00:22.880> so

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.360 
centimeters and it's about 23 pounds so

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.440 
centimeters and it's about 23 pounds so
it<00:00:23.660> came<00:00:24.530> today<00:00:24.710> as<00:00:25.460> you<00:00:25.640> can<00:00:25.820> see<00:00:26.030> I<00:00:26.060> am

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.450 
it came today as you can see I am

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
opening the box and the whole assembly

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.830 
opening the box and the whole assembly
probably<00:00:30.140> took<00:00:30.440> me<00:00:30.500> about<00:00:31.029> half<00:00:32.029> an<00:00:32.180> hour<00:00:32.329> it

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
probably took me about half an hour it

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.580 
probably took me about half an hour it
might<00:00:33.440> be<00:00:33.740> faster<00:00:33.980> for<00:00:34.430> some<00:00:34.580> of<00:00:34.730> you<00:00:35.530> but<00:00:36.530> I

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
might be faster for some of you but I

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.640 
might be faster for some of you but I
did<00:00:37.220> took<00:00:37.430> my<00:00:37.610> time<00:00:37.850> and<00:00:38.350> it<00:00:39.350> came<00:00:39.590> with

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
did took my time and it came with

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
I am simply on taking off one of the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.929 
I am simply on taking off one of the
wheels<00:01:14.090> unwrapping<00:01:14.990> it<00:01:15.229> and<00:01:15.549> it<00:01:16.549> didn't<00:01:16.819> take

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
wheels unwrapping it and it didn't take

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.840 
wheels unwrapping it and it didn't take
much<00:01:17.179> now<00:01:17.509> the<00:01:17.539> first<00:01:18.139> thing<00:01:18.439> that<00:01:18.469> I<00:01:18.649> did<00:01:19.039> is<00:01:19.459> I

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
much now the first thing that I did is I

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.699 
much now the first thing that I did is I
actually<00:01:20.350> try<00:01:21.350> to<00:01:21.380> install<00:01:21.920> a<00:01:22.549> pedals<00:01:23.709> here

00:01:24.699 --> 00:01:24.709 
actually try to install a pedals here

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:28.539 
actually try to install a pedals here
I'm<00:01:24.859> still<00:01:25.130> on<00:01:25.819> assembling<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.929> bike<00:01:27.170> and<00:01:27.549> now

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
I'm still on assembling the bike and now

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.699 
I'm still on assembling the bike and now
we<00:01:28.609> actually<00:01:28.909> went<00:01:29.479> ahead<00:01:29.569> and<00:01:29.899> ordered<00:01:30.079> two

00:01:30.699 --> 00:01:30.709 
we actually went ahead and ordered two

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:32.590 
we actually went ahead and ordered two
different<00:01:31.039> handlebars<00:01:31.520> my<00:01:32.119> son<00:01:32.389> did<00:01:32.569> not

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
different handlebars my son did not

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.349 
different handlebars my son did not
wanted<00:01:33.079> a<00:01:33.229> straight<00:01:33.590> bar<00:01:33.859> he<00:01:34.069> wanted<00:01:34.399> a<00:01:34.549> lower

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:35.359 
wanted a straight bar he wanted a lower

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:38.050 
wanted a straight bar he wanted a lower
bar<00:01:35.749> different<00:01:36.259> one<00:01:36.409> and<00:01:36.859> so<00:01:37.579> that's<00:01:37.759> what<00:01:37.939> we

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
bar different one and so that's what we

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.859 
bar different one and so that's what we
did<00:01:38.209> now<00:01:38.389> as<00:01:38.630> far<00:01:38.929> as<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.729> pedals<00:01:40.729> in<00:01:41.389> order<00:01:41.719> to

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
did now as far as the pedals in order to

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.449 
did now as far as the pedals in order to
put<00:01:42.049> them<00:01:42.139> on<00:01:42.319> you<00:01:42.619> have<00:01:42.829> to<00:01:43.159> churn

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:43.459 
put them on you have to churn

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:46.300 
put them on you have to churn
counterclockwise<00:01:44.709> again<00:01:45.709> it<00:01:45.859> took<00:01:45.950> me<00:01:46.099> some

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
counterclockwise again it took me some

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.389 
counterclockwise again it took me some
time<00:01:46.340> because<00:01:46.729> I<00:01:46.909> try<00:01:47.209> to<00:01:48.099> work<00:01:49.099> with<00:01:49.279> them

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
time because I try to work with them

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.849 
time because I try to work with them
clockwise<00:01:49.670> but<00:01:50.209> it<00:01:50.329> actually<00:01:50.590> counter<00:01:51.590> clocks

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:51.859 
clockwise but it actually counter clocks

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:54.760 
clockwise but it actually counter clocks
to<00:01:52.099> to<00:01:52.399> put<00:01:52.969> the<00:01:53.060> pedals<00:01:53.420> on<00:01:53.659> the<00:01:54.289> front<00:01:54.560> wheel

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
to to put the pedals on the front wheel

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.609 
to to put the pedals on the front wheel
was<00:01:54.889> very<00:01:55.159> easy<00:01:55.399> to<00:01:55.639> assemble<00:01:55.759> and<00:01:56.119> so<00:01:56.569> was<00:01:56.929> the

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
was very easy to assemble and so was the

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.029 
was very easy to assemble and so was the
wheel<00:01:57.829> as<00:01:57.979> you<00:01:58.130> can<00:01:58.279> see<00:01:58.459> you<00:01:58.579> just<00:01:58.759> need<00:01:58.999> a

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
wheel as you can see you just need a

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.440 
wheel as you can see you just need a
screw<00:02:01.039> set<00:02:01.249> the<00:02:01.639> way<00:02:01.759> I<00:02:01.789> have<00:02:02.149> it

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
screw set the way I have it

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.569 
screw set the way I have it
over<00:02:02.630> here<00:02:02.869> I<00:02:03.049> purchased<00:02:03.979> the<00:02:04.069> set<00:02:04.279> in<00:02:04.399> Home

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
over here I purchased the set in Home

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.740 
over here I purchased the set in Home
Depot<00:02:04.609> and<00:02:05.319> here<00:02:06.319> I<00:02:06.349> have<00:02:06.619> two<00:02:06.829> wheels<00:02:07.069> on<00:02:07.750> the

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750
