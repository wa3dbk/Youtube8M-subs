00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.100
 how are you are welcome to a new 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.540
 Channel 8 chapter today a very chapter 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.430
 entertaining we have a sunny day 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.349
 spectacular to go out and listen 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.210
 music however suddenly it is 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.519
 uncomfortable to carry a music equipment load 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.720
 the batteries remember to carry all the 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.279
 pieces you do not need to do it 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.060
 work so today we are going to present 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.919
 this little mini x speaker that can 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.080
 work with any implement that 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.850
 have a mini plane 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.720
 very good here we have the little 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:34.060
 speaker extende 6 the sound beyond 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.430
 of the size inside the box we can 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.420
 find different elements first 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.309
 let's get out here we have the 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.050
 instructions a cable that serves us 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.150
 for different things later on be 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.730
 sing a plastic cover of course 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.739
 that we also have the speaker other 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.600
 plastic collector and a small bag of 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.030
 fabric that helps us to take it from a 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920
 place to place instructions for 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.170
 Of course you will not have to read it because I 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.120
 I already dealt with that and basically they say 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.339
 that within the things that there are that 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.260
 take care is not turn on the speaker 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:05.260
 while it's closed because that could 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.060
 break it immediately we have a 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.560
 small cloth bag with a zipper 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.659
 plastic that allows us to carry the 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.790
 talking from one side to the other avoiding that 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.190
 enter dust or you miss any of 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.540
 the other elements here we have the 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.729
 cable that has three connectors 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.159
 other than a small closure of 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.380
 velcro that is very useful to move it 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.189
 in a neat way a mini plan connector 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.439
 that goes directly connected directly to 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.360
 speaker a mini usb that helps us to 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.700
 charge the power speaker 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.590
 Approximate duration of 12 hours and a USB 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.110
 normal size that connects 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.940
 directly to our pc or our 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.910
 mac book or any computer that we 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.590
 allow to load the small speaker here 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.350
 we have the speaker that besides being 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.660
 aesthetically very beautiful sounds very good 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.400
 and with a very good volume we turn it and 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.110
 it opens immediately we have the 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.990
 plan connector that we connect to 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.000
 any sound source there we are 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.040
 seeing how to work a kind of 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.900
 spring one tightens it closes and 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.100
 It exists ready to move and turning it 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.470
 towards the other side it unfolds 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.679
 We immediately have control of 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.149
 volume the cable the plane a led that we 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.030
 indicates that in this case it is working 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.310
 with the charged battery 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.840
 the audio output so these 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.209
 speaker can be connected multiple 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.700
 each other and the mini usb connector for 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.060
 load it here we see in detail engraved 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.160
 with a macro lens as when turning it it 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.870
 unfolds like a kind of spring 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.600
 outwards and we can start 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.670
 use it then we will tell 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.590
 again and we turn it to do side for 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.350
 close it let's connect it in this case 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.480
 a sound source an iphone4 and let's 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.640
 to see how this small device works 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.170
 we turn it to the side it unfolds 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.180
 it is ready with the operation without 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.400
 danger of it breaking we raise the 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.050
 volume to the maximum we turn it on and there 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.920
 is the led that tells us that everything 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.920
 works perfectly 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.310
 that 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.830
 curtains turbines sit with 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.830
 nitroglycerine 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.159
 very well and we have the application how 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.530
 works this little speaker x mini a 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:27.840
 speaker of very small size however 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.730
 with a very good sound plus a very 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.379
 good quality a very good volume and what 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.930
 another one that has very interesting is that 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:35.760
 It lasts many hours charged is charged by 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.260
 usb therefore does not require batteries and 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.540
 you can take anywhere because 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.120
 It is very small and also comes with its 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.190
 bag to carry it anywhere we 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.930
 say goodbye to this episode of channel 8 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.000
 I hope you liked it, there's a guy 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.530
 quite entertaining too for all 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.150
 the audiovisual communicators and for 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.739
 all the people who look at us 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.209
 we have been listening a bit in this ex 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.209
 mini this is channel 8 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:09.890
 Now that you start to let look 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.890
 the piece that comes to mind follows 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.549
 the tip today is among the 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.920
 again we will use deliveries to a 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.780
 iphone 4 but you can use an ipod 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.750
 of any kind or an old iphone 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.460
 also and a mini dv tape any 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.230
 digital camera that you have in your 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.760
 house can use this type of tapes 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.160
 my baby and one always goes with the 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.320
 lost boxes out there we open the box 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.670
 we remove the tape and the paper that the 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.190
 it covers because we're not going to use it 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:40.010
 and simply turning the box 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.080
 We have a new support for our 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.610
 iphone 4 we can keep the calendar 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.710
 the agenda or any of the 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.080
 applications that we like so 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.600
 vertical without any problem and 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:54.010
 without spending a lot of money on a stand 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.010
 too expensive 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.090
 one
