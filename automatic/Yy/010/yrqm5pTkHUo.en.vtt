00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
time until I get my desired consistency

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.100 
time until I get my desired consistency
and<00:06:03.530> that<00:06:03.710> is<00:06:03.860> a<00:06:03.890> perfect<00:06:04.400> consistency<00:06:04.700> if<00:06:05.270> you

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
and that is a perfect consistency if you

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.110 
and that is a perfect consistency if you
use<00:06:06.410> up<00:06:06.440> your<00:06:06.650> whole<00:06:07.040> let<00:06:07.520> the<00:06:07.730> juice<00:06:07.880> of<00:06:08.000> the

don't<00:06:09.530> have<00:06:09.620> the<00:06:09.770> right<00:06:09.920> consistence<00:06:10.370> you

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
don't have the right consistence you

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:11.980 
don't have the right consistence you
start<00:06:10.760> adding<00:06:10.910> like<00:06:11.150> a<00:06:11.240> tablespoon<00:06:11.720> of<00:06:11.810> water

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.510 
start adding like a tablespoon of water
at<00:06:12.200> a<00:06:12.290> time<00:06:12.530> until<00:06:12.830> you<00:06:13.010> get<00:06:13.190> the<00:06:13.310> right<00:06:13.460> amount

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
at a time until you get the right amount

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.970 
at a time until you get the right amount
I<00:06:13.940> ended<00:06:14.300> up<00:06:14.360> adding<00:06:14.570> 1<00:06:15.170> tablespoon<00:06:15.650> of<00:06:15.680> water

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:15.980 
I ended up adding 1 tablespoon of water

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.560 
I ended up adding 1 tablespoon of water
just<00:06:16.220> to<00:06:16.340> get<00:06:16.520> the<00:06:16.640> right<00:06:16.790> consistency<00:06:16.910> and

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:17.570 
just to get the right consistency and

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.180 
just to get the right consistency and
it's<00:06:17.660> perfect<00:06:17.990> now<00:06:18.500> I'm<00:06:18.620> going<00:06:18.770> to<00:06:18.860> do<00:06:18.950> is<00:06:19.070> just

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:22.670 
don't have to do this perfect this is

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.330 
don't have to do this perfect this is
what<00:06:22.760> I'm<00:06:22.850> doing<00:06:23.090> I<00:06:23.210> like<00:06:23.510> to<00:06:23.690> just<00:06:24.100> go<00:06:25.100> on<00:06:25.220> the

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:36.140 
know if it ain't broke don't fix it so

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.770 
know if it ain't broke don't fix it so
I'm<00:06:36.440> just<00:06:36.620> going<00:06:36.740> to<00:06:36.830> continue<00:06:36.980> and<00:06:37.630> glaze<00:06:38.630> the

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:38.780 
I'm just going to continue and glaze the

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.570 
I'm just going to continue and glaze the
rest<00:06:38.960> of<00:06:39.080> them<00:06:40.090> last<00:06:41.090> one<00:06:41.600> you<00:06:41.990> can<00:06:42.200> see<00:06:42.580> that

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:43.580 
rest of them last one you can see that

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.900 
rest of them last one you can see that
it<00:06:43.760> just<00:06:44.680> drizzles<00:06:45.680> down<00:06:45.770> the<00:06:46.250> cookie<00:06:46.670> and

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:46.910 
it just drizzles down the cookie and

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.350 
it just drizzles down the cookie and
then<00:06:47.510> it<00:06:47.750> kind<00:06:48.020> of<00:06:48.140> I<00:06:48.880> don't<00:06:49.880> know<00:06:50.060> I<00:06:50.120> don't

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 
then it kind of I don't know I don't

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.940 
then it kind of I don't know I don't
know<00:06:50.420> how<00:06:50.510> to<00:06:50.570> explain<00:06:50.930> it<00:06:51.110> it<00:06:51.230> hardens<00:06:51.770> but

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:51.950 
know how to explain it it hardens but

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.040 
know how to explain it it hardens but
it's<00:06:52.070> not<00:06:52.220> too<00:06:52.460> thick<00:06:52.850> of<00:06:53.060> a<00:06:53.210> layer<00:06:53.240> of<00:06:53.780> icing

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.050 
it's not too thick of a layer of icing

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.690 
it's not too thick of a layer of icing
which<00:06:54.590> is<00:06:54.710> why<00:06:54.860> it's<00:06:55.040> really<00:06:55.100> important<00:06:55.610> to

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:55.700 
which is why it's really important to

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.310 
which is why it's really important to
get<00:06:55.820> the<00:06:55.910> right<00:06:55.940> runny<00:06:56.360> consistency<00:06:56.570> I'm

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:57.320 
get the right runny consistency I'm

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.630 
get the right runny consistency I'm
going<00:06:57.470> to<00:06:57.530> go<00:06:57.620> to<00:06:57.680> the<00:06:57.830> first<00:06:58.010> cookie<00:06:58.310> we<00:06:58.460> iced

00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:58.640 
going to go to the first cookie we iced

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.100 
going to go to the first cookie we iced
because<00:06:59.060> it's<00:06:59.210> hardened<00:06:59.510> up<00:06:59.600> just<00:06:59.780> a<00:06:59.840> little

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:00.110 
because it's hardened up just a little

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:07.140 
because it's hardened up just a little
tiny<00:07:00.260> bit<00:07:00.380> I'm<00:07:01.160> so<00:07:01.280> excited
