00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.990 
alright twelve
that's<00:07:05.639> the<00:07:05.880> ender<00:07:06.060> dragons<00:07:06.449> death<00:07:06.690> by<00:07:07.440> a<00:07:07.469> nuke

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 
that's the ender dragons death by a nuke

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.490 
that's the ender dragons death by a nuke
or<00:07:09.000> feather<00:07:09.210> was<00:07:09.419> more<00:07:09.690> to<00:07:09.870> the<00:07:09.960> nuke<00:07:10.169> but<00:07:10.469> I

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:10.500 
or feather was more to the nuke but I

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.800 
or feather was more to the nuke but I
guess<00:07:11.009> that's<00:07:11.159> all<00:07:11.370> the<00:07:11.430> new<00:07:11.669> cos<00:07:12.000> that<00:07:12.599> nuke

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:12.810 
guess that's all the new cos that nuke

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.589 
guess that's all the new cos that nuke
is<00:07:12.930> kind<00:07:13.229> of<00:07:13.349> similar<00:07:13.740> to<00:07:13.770> the<00:07:14.610> what<00:07:15.389> is<00:07:15.479> it

00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:15.599 
is kind of similar to the what is it

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:20.209 
is kind of similar to the what is it
called<00:07:15.810> the<00:07:17.719> the<00:07:18.719> TNT<00:07:19.259> reign<00:07:19.529> it's<00:07:19.770> very

00:07:20.209 --> 00:07:20.219 
called the the TNT reign it's very

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:22.399 
called the the TNT reign it's very
similar<00:07:20.639> to<00:07:20.940> the<00:07:21.150> TNT<00:07:21.419> ramp<00:07:21.750> but<00:07:21.900> I<00:07:21.960> think<00:07:22.229> the

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:22.409 
similar to the TNT ramp but I think the

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:24.230 
similar to the TNT ramp but I think the
nuke<00:07:22.710> is<00:07:22.860> very<00:07:23.190> effective<00:07:23.819> so<00:07:23.940> that's<00:07:24.090> why<00:07:24.210> I

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 
nuke is very effective so that's why I

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.089 
nuke is very effective so that's why I
was<00:07:24.389> kind<00:07:24.509> of<00:07:24.629> confused<00:07:24.810> at<00:07:25.199> first<00:07:25.229> but<00:07:25.919> guys

00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:26.099 
was kind of confused at first but guys

00:07:26.099 --> 00:07:27.950 
was kind of confused at first but guys
that<00:07:26.129> is<00:07:26.430> going<00:07:26.610> to<00:07:26.699> do<00:07:26.819> it<00:07:26.969> for<00:07:27.270> the<00:07:27.569> ender

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:27.960 
that is going to do it for the ender

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.010 
that is going to do it for the ender
dragon<00:07:27.990> versus<00:07:29.150> explosives<00:07:30.150> hopefully<00:07:30.930> you
