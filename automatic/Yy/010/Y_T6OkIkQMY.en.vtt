and<00:00:27.240> be<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.510> three<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:28.349> that<00:00:28.970> five<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.150> six<00:00:30.390> so

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
and be the three so that five to six so

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.450 
and be the three so that five to six so
so<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.380> what<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.650> was<00:00:31.800> showing<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.250> class

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
so the so what I was showing the class

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:40.010 
so the so what I was showing the class
was<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.960> my<00:00:37.670> but<00:00:38.670> old<00:00:39.239> school<00:00:39.420> West<00:00:39.750> Coast

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
was this is my but old school West Coast

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.540 
was this is my but old school West Coast
Swing<00:00:40.079> before<00:00:40.530> they<00:00:40.590> used<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.860> do<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.280> French

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
Swing before they used to do the French

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.920 
Swing before they used to do the French
across<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.059> girl<00:00:42.239> would<00:00:42.420> take<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.780> right

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
across the girl would take the right

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.389 
across the girl would take the right
foot<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.260> go<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> little<00:00:43.590> wider<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.280> then

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
foot and go a little wider and then

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.680 
foot and go a little wider and then
bring<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.700> foot<00:00:44.910> underneath<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.450> they<00:00:45.510> call

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
bring the foot underneath and they call

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.900 
bring the foot underneath and they call
out<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.840> pressure<00:00:46.200> step<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.219> then<00:00:47.340> stabbed<00:00:47.670> and

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
out a pressure step and then stabbed and

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.760 
out a pressure step and then stabbed and
then<00:00:47.969> anchor<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.420> out<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.530> pressure

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
then anchor it out and so that pressure

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.110 
then anchor it out and so that pressure
step<00:00:50.129> just<00:00:50.309> means<00:00:50.520> we<00:00:50.640> don't<00:00:50.730> put<00:00:50.940> any<00:00:51.090> weight

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
step just means we don't put any weight

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.549 
step just means we don't put any weight
on<00:00:51.300> we<00:00:51.870> did<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.199> video

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
on we did that video

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.920 
on we did that video
these<00:00:52.680> waltz<00:00:53.280> once<00:00:54.000> upon<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.210> time<00:00:54.270> it's<00:00:54.780> all

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
these waltz once upon a time it's all

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.840 
these waltz once upon a time it's all
changed<00:00:55.440> because<00:00:55.680> we<00:00:56.039> did<00:00:56.309> some<00:00:56.520> more<00:00:56.640> narrow

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
changed because we did some more narrow

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.170 
changed because we did some more narrow
spot<00:00:57.210> now<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.899> so<00:00:58.250> if<00:00:59.250> we're<00:00:59.489> counting<00:01:00.030> if

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
spot now and so if we're counting if

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.029 
spot now and so if we're counting if
we're<00:01:00.329> using<00:01:00.480> just<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.079> one<00:01:01.410> hand<00:01:01.710> beats

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
we're using just the one hand beats

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.090 
we're using just the one hand beats
afraid<00:01:02.670> we're<00:01:02.879> going<00:01:03.030> one<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.110> able<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.860> cook

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
afraid we're going one and able to cook

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.380 
afraid we're going one and able to cook
two<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.150> over<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.900> foot<00:01:07.110> three<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.390> is

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
two and over the foot three and is

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.240 
two and over the foot three and is
healing<00:01:10.040> four<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.930> five<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:12.960> six<00:01:13.250> oftentimes

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
healing four and five and six oftentimes

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.100 
healing four and five and six oftentimes
people<00:01:14.430> make<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.790> mistake<00:01:14.850> go<00:01:15.180> one<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.750> two

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
people make the mistake go one and two

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.499 
people make the mistake go one and two
and<00:01:16.560> three<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.400> they're<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.090> their<00:01:18.210> own<00:01:18.270> flow

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
and three and they're on their own flow

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.719 
and three and they're on their own flow
and<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.080> there<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.619> those<00:01:19.770> step<00:01:19.979> here<00:01:20.280> because

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
and so there so those step here because

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.420 
and so there so those step here because
they're<00:01:20.909> falling<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.540> way<00:01:21.720> right<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:23.220> fix

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
they're falling that way right so to fix

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.649 
they're falling that way right so to fix
that<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.939> we're<00:01:24.180> just<00:01:24.210> going<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.540> do<00:01:24.630> a

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
that is we're just going to do a

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.910 
that is we're just going to do a
pressure<00:01:24.900> step<00:01:25.229> even<00:01:25.409> though<00:01:25.530> it's<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.680> smaller

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
pressure step even though it's a smaller

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.100 
pressure step even though it's a smaller
step<00:01:26.189> we're<00:01:26.400> going<00:01:26.520> one<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.150> two<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.840> three

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
step we're going one and two and three

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.620 
step we're going one and two and three
and<00:01:28.729> okay<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.790> be<00:01:30.000> know<00:01:30.150> whether<00:01:30.360> there<00:01:30.540> should

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
and okay to be know whether there should

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.480 
and okay to be know whether there should
be<00:01:30.689> no<00:01:30.869> wider<00:01:31.049> than<00:01:31.110> my<00:01:31.290> hips<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:32.130> just<00:01:32.340> don't

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
be no wider than my hips and just don't

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.770 
be no wider than my hips and just don't
step<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.360> what's<00:01:33.540> underneath

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
step on it so this is what's underneath

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.590 
step on it so this is what's underneath
me<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.259> then<00:01:34.439> four<00:01:34.710> five<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.460> six<00:01:35.610> so<00:01:38.600> we've

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
me and then four five and six so we've

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.800 
me and then four five and six so we've
got<00:01:39.750> one<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.439> two<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.130> three<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.700> four<00:01:42.299> and

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
got one and two and three and four and

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.749 
got one and two and three and four and
five<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.500> six<00:01:43.619> then<00:01:44.340> when<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.549> talk<00:01:44.700> about

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
five and six then when you talk about

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.210 
five and six then when you talk about
the<00:01:45.000> rolling<00:01:45.329> count<00:01:45.570> if<00:01:46.020> we<00:01:46.170> add<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.829> beat

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
the rolling count if we add the and beat

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.569 
the rolling count if we add the and beat
I'm<00:01:47.579> sorry<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.090> upbeat<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.500> what<00:01:50.369> takes

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
I'm sorry the upbeat that is what takes
