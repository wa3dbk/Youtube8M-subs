hi I'm Clayton and today I'm going to

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.100 
hi I'm Clayton and today I'm going to
show<00:00:11.429> you<00:00:11.460> how<00:00:11.700> easy<00:00:11.940> it<00:00:12.150> is<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.480> install<00:00:12.570> alum

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
show you how easy it is to install alum

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:22.340 
show you how easy it is to install alum
anko<00:00:13.440> where<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.769> bird<00:00:13.950> turbine<00:00:14.400> bent<00:00:21.350> now

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
anko where the bird turbine bent now

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.109 
anko where the bird turbine bent now
remember<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.859> Lomonaco<00:00:23.279> where<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.580> bird<00:00:23.760> is

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
remember the Lomonaco where the bird is

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.439 
remember the Lomonaco where the bird is
an<00:00:24.330> exhaust<00:00:24.689> pin<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.670> as<00:00:26.670> an<00:00:26.820> exhaust<00:00:27.150> vent

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
an exhaust pin and as an exhaust vent

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.120 
an exhaust pin and as an exhaust vent
it's<00:00:27.660> only<00:00:27.869> half<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.439> your<00:00:28.619> ventilation

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
it's only half of your ventilation

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.779 
it's only half of your ventilation

the<00:00:30.269> other<00:00:30.420> half<00:00:30.689> consists<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.320> intake<00:00:31.800> and

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
the other half consists of intake and

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.790 
the other half consists of intake and
this<00:00:32.940> needs<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.270> be<00:00:33.329> balanced<00:00:33.750> 50/50<00:00:34.500> for<00:00:34.739> a

on the bottom of the straightedge we can

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.550 
on the bottom of the straightedge we can
see<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> 512<00:01:23.250> pitch<00:01:23.640> roof<00:01:24.560> next

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
see that this is a 512 pitch roof next

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.990 
see that this is a 512 pitch roof next
we're<00:01:25.650> going<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.830> lie<00:01:26.040> on<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.340> pitch<00:01:26.610> number

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
we're going to lie on that pitch number

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.440 
we're going to lie on that pitch number
on<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.720> horn<00:01:27.900> bird<00:01:28.110> elbow<00:01:28.470> with<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:31.500> mark<00:01:31.829> on

the base flashing

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.550 
the base flashing
now<00:01:36.270> we're<00:01:36.420> going<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.630> use<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.900> screws<00:01:37.230> to

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
now we're going to use the screws to

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.160 
now we're going to use the screws to
screw<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.980> elbow<00:01:38.310> under<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.270> base<00:01:39.480> while

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
screw the elbow under the base while

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.940 
screw the elbow under the base while
