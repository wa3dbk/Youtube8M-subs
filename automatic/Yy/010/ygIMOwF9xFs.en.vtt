00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.920
 Y 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.539
 thanks again for joining me in 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.540
 cooking with the gal field today we are going to 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:37.350
 prepare chimichurri to marinate 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.000
 meats to make the cheese that goes to 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.820
 skewers or churros as they call it in 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.699
 different countries mine is a little more 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.180
 aromatic than the traditional 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:50.430
 let's use long onion 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.880
 coriander 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.900
 the original uses parsley I like the 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:00.450
 Cilantro is more aromatic and use thyme 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:04.570
 how I do not get it on plants 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:06.750
 natural I use dry thyme 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.370
 oregano 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.880
 let's use garlic also about three 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:18.410
 garlic cloves two lemons oil 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.990
 olive a little bit of salt a little 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:25.410
 red pepper or it would be jalapeÃ±o like 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.210
 they want to call in black pepper and 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.090
 half a tablespoon of salt with these 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.250
 ingredients that were then placed there 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:38.700
 in the video we are going to prepare our 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:41.910
 Chimichurri pretty aromatic this 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.640
 when they start to roast the meat goes 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:48.090
 go crazy because people say goodbye 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.150
 incredible smells of the mixture between the 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:55.510
 thyme 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.510
 cilantro and long onion 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.330
 now in a processor we are going to add 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.330
 some olive oil 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.940
 I was to taste 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.940
 that have enough lyon oil 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.810
 after we have the oil of 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.510
 olive let's add the onion already 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.810
 cut 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.490
 and this long onion does not use the onion 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.810
 round 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.810
 It is more aromatic 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:39.220
 let's add the cilantro that already 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.220
 I have also cut 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.600
 and we are going to process a little 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.440
 now now that we have space 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.160
 we can go adding the others 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.800
 ingredients I will add a spoonful 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.210
 of salt 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:21.080
 a spoonful of black pepper and one 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.080
 spoonful of red pepper 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.680
 I'm going to add now two tablespoons of 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.680
 thyme 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.530
 three cloves of garlic and a spoonful of 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.930
 oregano 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.950
 I want to keep more the taste of 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.600
 thyme that of the area that is more 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.470
 quantity 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.430
 this less amount 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.430
 add 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:03.590
 and also the juice of two lemons 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.590
 let's squeeze the lemons 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.880
 to give it a little 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.880
 of the liquid 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.550
 and it also gives a bit of acidity now 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.419
 that we have added the juice of the two 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.460
 lemons 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.460
 we move the product a little 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.260
 i 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.860
 and then another little bit more oil 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.090
 olive 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.090
 it will not go wrong 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.280
 I use extra virgin olive oil but 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.660
 if they have him 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.660
 regular no problem 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.380
 let's process again 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:17.249
 well we have now the chimichurri 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:22.490
 ready to apply it on meats 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:22.490
 we are now extremely delicious 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:32.449
 we do not remove them and we will recycle them 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:32.449
 in a glass container 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:42.830
 and we have it ready to use if 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:46.070
 they want if they have boiled potatoes or yucca 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.980
 cooked they ask the chimichurri 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.580
 over and it's a delight of your mouthful of 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:56.000
 Queen 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:56.000
 so this is my personal recipe 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:03.190
 I've done it in other restaurants that I've 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:09.120
 worked and disliked very much liked 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:09.120
 so I hope you too
