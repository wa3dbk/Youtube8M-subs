00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.260
 hey people here is bayer coach sincerely 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.289
 welcome 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:21.380
 today with the video on the subject over 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.970
 trophy muscle growth a topic which 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.890
 I am very interested in a lot of men 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.930
 but now many too 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.820
 smart women who simply 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.369
 Right turns to the right one 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.280
 I would like to have the 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:38.149
 Muscle on growth specific 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:43.390
 I can train growth so much 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:46.430
 set that the muscle gets bigger no 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.520
 or indirectly what I do 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.739
 is the two muscle fibers one to the 2nd 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.719
 the perennial muscle fibers and the 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.910
 strong muscle fibers now I can 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.030
 These muscle fiber types have a stress 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.440
 expose myself to my body 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.690
 adapted to this stress and the 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.280
 perennial muscle fibers even more 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.740
 have endurance and the states 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.469
 Muscle fiber become even stronger so me 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.319
 can train in training that 

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:13.999
 I with the same with the same 

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:17.840
 resistance will repeat more and more 

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:19.789
 create or more resistance on it 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.889
 and the same as repetitions 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:24.079
 So that would be stronger so it is so 

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:26.689
 that the muscle fibers or or the 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:29.840
 Energy supply to be optimized 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:32.419
 must and as a side effect it is that way 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.609
 the muscle grows depends 

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:36.340
 muscle growth of three factors that 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:38.119
 these are stress related 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.789
 metabolism by-products such as 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.939
 testosterone igf1 and growth hormones 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:47.090
 the other is the muscle fibers which the 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.829
 to accept harm , to suffer the trauma 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.929
 that is if you take them under 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.909
 would look at microscope then they are 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:55.159
 easily hurt and these injuries 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.599
 need to be repaired with the muscle 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.679
 protein synthesis and this repair 

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:02.299
 causes causes our muscles 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.419
 to get a little bit fatter, too 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.770
 The last point is I need the muscle 

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:07.720
 put a stress on one and that 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.030
 mechanical 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.430
 from the outside either a trade 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.100
 was the machine and feel the 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.500
 Exercise the muscle after that 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.860
 but now I have a burden 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.290
 expose the muscle and thus it is so 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.090
 that I love the three factors 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.780
 put our body to adapt 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.880
 can 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.710
 we are adoption machine because of that 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.020
 we are also after one million 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:35.560
 years because we are on 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:39.010
 environmental conditions on hunger for everything 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.350
 have adapted and we are in 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.870
 we are still able to adapt and 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.510
 Training the stress we have 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.310
 Training now has exactly where 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.310
 the body also has to adapt 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.490
 Therefore, endurance and strength accordingly 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.410
 the muscle fibers get bigger too 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:01.360
 Just take care that we do not have each one 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.640
 sometimes goes to the limits or about these 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.260
 borders 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.870
 many are very motivated and that 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.870
 but a good thing to be over-motivated 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.790
 and every now and then about the muscle 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.070
 fail to go that if you 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.670
 every time one goes to a cliff and 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:21.280
 it's okay to go down and it's okay 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.540
 if you go beyond this limit of 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.340
 Muscle fail 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.380
 that is if you no longer repeat 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.800
 there the training partner comes 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.800
 and helps you a little that you the 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.989
 Last repetition still likes this 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.450
 a delight who a bit more now 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.190
 extreme now and then that's okay but 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.080
 if you have a training partner who 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.870
 just as much as motivating us today 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.360
 just kilt each time and every time 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.970
 any set of muscle failure then goes 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.350
 is that very destructive then it is like that 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.630
 that you go to the cliff every time 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.209
 and down spix and jump down and 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.820
 not that the muscle is harming now 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.049
 Every muscle will accept it 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.480
 actually gets pretty good 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:04.060
 The problem is more central 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.950
 nervous system that gets cashed every time 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.840
 and the central nervous system that 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.269
 takes a little more time to move on 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.390
 regenerate the biceps you define 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:15.280
 twice a week but three times a week 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.890
 You are training the central nervous system 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.510
 every time you go out and workout 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.240
 that's why it needs the 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.729
 Regeneration makes the necessary and there 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.520
 also quite sensible maybe all four 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:30.130
 five weeks a week too easy 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.570
 train or basically one 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.490
 training break to do that 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.660
 central nervous system totally 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.360
 can regenerate 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.360
 so look for that 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.599
 points which also influence you 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.820
 Could the strength and endurance look on 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:48.250
 that we do not always feel sick 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:51.720
 trained and and about the muscle fiber 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.610
 muscle failure 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.020
 and do not look at your head 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.420
 how a trash can handled so 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.130
 Nowadays we have so many 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.530
 Information has especially by that 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.750
 bfr advises there are a lot of internet 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.880
 August copy the article and 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.160
 Write something new and new every time 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.800
 every time something better that was already 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:14.430
 always like that and will always stay that way 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.780
 is not the best exercise on the contrary 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.340
 basically takes the 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.070
 do basic exercises and you can 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.690
 more or less all your life 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.910
 Do the only thing you do 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.860
 now and then the intensity has to end 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.630
 maybe with intensity technology 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.690
 bring in or or the burden 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.740
 change because stimulus change and then enough 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.470
 also you have no 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:37.020
 tailor-made soups heck 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.710
 lucius medius program have that 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.460
 superfluous 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:43.110
 the muscle fibers that the last point 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.930
 What I also give you on the way 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:49.080
 would like the growth of the muscle fibers 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:52.380
 in the end, depending on your genetics 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.660
 where that is the upper limit is that 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.480
 our dna our release that the 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.730
 blueprints pretend how much we do 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.450
 assimilate so bring to growth 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.400
 can 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.700
 Does that mean that if he comes in now ? 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.229
 bad resp. worse 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.490
 I am replying to the training 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:12.240
 should not train 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.979
 no makes the best of you too 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.200
 you will probably make progress 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:18.000
 not as much as telling a different story 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.740
 a mister olympia but you have to 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.250
 Also do not care then have to 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.080
 measure up 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:25.260
 I crap on yourself go myself 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:28.410
 other potential i will mine 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.210
 post next video soon when i see 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.830
 that you shared this video 20 times 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:35.390
 I wish you a nice one 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:35.390
 weekend to bayer coach
