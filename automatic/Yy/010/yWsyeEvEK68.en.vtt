00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
difficult to understand any other

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.050 
difficult to understand any other
science<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.280> thought<00:01:26.490> if<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.640> make<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.820> into

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
science I thought if I make it into

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.580 
science I thought if I make it into
something<00:01:27.330> that's<00:01:27.479> almost<00:01:27.810> like<00:01:28.049> really<00:01:28.350> sock

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
something that's almost like really sock

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.649 
something that's almost like really sock
puppets<00:01:29.040> it's<00:01:29.250> really<00:01:29.579> easy<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.180> then<00:01:30.360> we<00:01:30.479> can

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
puppets it's really easy and then we can

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.510 
puppets it's really easy and then we can
relate<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.290> that's<00:01:31.799> why<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:31.950> set<00:01:32.159> out<00:01:32.340> to

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
relate to it and that's why I set out to

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.429 
relate to it and that's why I set out to
do<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.540> was<00:01:33.659> entertaining<00:01:34.290> way<00:01:34.380> of

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
do and so it was entertaining way of

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.080 
do and so it was entertaining way of
doing<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:34.950> thankfully<00:01:35.610> it's<00:01:35.729> worked<00:01:35.970> for

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
doing it and thankfully it's worked for

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.910 
doing it and thankfully it's worked for
quite<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.390> lot<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.570> people<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:37.229> has<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.409> lot<00:01:37.890> of

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
quite a lot of people it has a lot of

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.740 
quite a lot of people it has a lot of
people<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.030> inner<00:01:39.240> chimp<00:01:39.540> can

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
so you can't overcome the gym that's one

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.150 
so you can't overcome the gym that's one
of<00:02:36.900> your<00:02:37.020> big<00:02:37.140> things<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:37.500> can't<00:02:37.709> overcome

of your big things you can't overcome
the<00:02:38.280> gym<00:02:38.430> you've<00:02:38.580> got<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.790> learn<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:38.910> manage

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
the gym but the chimp is five times

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
stronger than this human within so how

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.910 
stronger than this human within so how
come<00:02:43.319> you've<00:02:43.470> come<00:02:43.620> up<00:02:43.650> with<00:02:43.770> those

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
come you've come up with those

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.550 
come you've come up with those
particular<00:02:44.280> figures<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:44.880> ratio<00:02:45.120> of<00:02:46.050> control

if you look at it that the first time I

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.810 
if you look at it that the first time I
looked<00:02:48.840> at<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.470> word<00:02:49.769> speed<00:02:50.160> of<00:02:50.310> reaction<00:02:50.730> of

looked at the word speed of reaction of

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.640 
looked at the word speed of reaction of

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
rest of the brain so if you look at that

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.400 
rest of the brain so if you look at that
and<00:03:02.550> look<00:03:02.760> at<00:03:02.819> an<00:03:02.970> actual<00:03:03.090> chimpanzee<00:03:03.870> a<00:03:03.900> real

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
and look at an actual chimpanzee a real

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.080 
and look at an actual chimpanzee a real
chump<00:03:04.680> Hansie<00:03:05.100> they<00:03:05.280> estimate<00:03:05.670> it's<00:03:05.880> five

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
chump Hansie they estimate it's five

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.570 
chump Hansie they estimate it's five
times<00:03:06.390> stronger<00:03:06.780> than<00:03:06.930> than<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:07.470> human<00:03:07.920> but<00:03:08.489> it

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
times stronger than than a human but it

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.250 
times stronger than than a human but it
seemed<00:03:08.819> quite<00:03:08.970> natural<00:03:09.239> to<00:03:09.630> say<00:03:09.780> that's<00:03:09.930> about

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
seemed quite natural to say that's about

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.410 
seemed quite natural to say that's about
the<00:03:10.470> speed<00:03:10.739> that<00:03:10.980> they<00:03:11.250> brain<00:03:11.459> moves<00:03:11.880> at<00:03:12.120> in

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
the speed that they brain moves at in

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.240 
the speed that they brain moves at in
comparison<00:03:13.170> to<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.380> rest<00:03:13.530> of<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:13.800> brain<00:03:14.010> when

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
comparison to the rest of the brain when

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.890 
comparison to the rest of the brain when
we're<00:03:14.370> looking<00:03:14.430> at<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.760> chimp<00:03:15.000> moving<00:03:15.420> so

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
we're looking at the chimp moving so

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.150 
we're looking at the chimp moving so
that's<00:03:16.080> why<00:03:16.230> I<00:03:16.260> came<00:03:16.350> up<00:03:16.530> with<00:03:16.680> it<00:03:16.890> but<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.100> think

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
that's why I came up with it but I think

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.190 
that's why I came up with it but I think
it<00:03:17.400> rings<00:03:17.610> true<00:03:17.700> in<00:03:18.030> life<00:03:18.239> and<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:19.049> city.the

it rings true in life and the city.the

it rings true in life and the city.the
model<00:03:19.890> it's<00:03:20.040> just<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.340> try<00:03:20.519> and<00:03:20.549> help<00:03:20.850> us

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
model it's just to try and help us

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.210 
model it's just to try and help us
understand<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.750> complex<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.769> chimp<00:03:22.980> can

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
understand the complex and the chimp can

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.680 
understand the complex and the chimp can
be<00:03:23.340> useful<00:03:23.700> you<00:03:23.730> know<00:03:23.850> the<00:03:24.000> chimps<00:03:24.150> not<00:03:24.390> always

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
be useful you know the chimps not always

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.539 
be useful you know the chimps not always
a<00:03:24.720> pain<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.230> chimp<00:03:25.440> is<00:03:25.530> their<00:03:25.739> therapist<00:03:26.430> of

a pain the chimp is their therapist of

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.370 
a pain the chimp is their therapist of
motivation<00:03:27.150> but<00:03:27.329> he<00:03:27.750> or<00:03:27.900> she<00:03:28.079> is<00:03:28.200> not<00:03:28.350> very

motivation but he or she is not very
good<00:03:28.709> when<00:03:29.010> it<00:03:29.100> comes<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.400> commitment<00:03:29.670> which

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
good when it comes to commitment which

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.770 
good when it comes to commitment which
is<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.329> key<00:03:30.570> to<00:03:30.870> success<00:03:31.880> exactly<00:03:32.880> exactly<00:03:33.299> I

is the key to success exactly exactly I
mean<00:03:33.870> our<00:03:34.110> chimps<00:03:34.410> are<00:03:34.530> actually<00:03:34.829> helpful

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
mean our chimps are actually helpful

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.440 
mean our chimps are actually helpful
they<00:03:35.220> give<00:03:35.370> us<00:03:35.489> a<00:03:35.549> color<00:03:35.730> in<00:03:35.880> life<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:36.299> you

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
they give us a color in life and you

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.210 
they give us a color in life and you
don't<00:03:36.600> want<00:03:36.720> to<00:03:36.780> lose<00:03:36.900> you<00:03:37.019> emotions<00:03:37.530> you<00:03:38.040> just

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
don't want to lose you emotions you just

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.979

because I'm obsessed with him at the

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.940 
because I'm obsessed with him at the
moment<00:03:51.480> like<00:03:51.900> I'm<00:03:52.049> driving<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.500> work<00:03:52.650> and<00:03:52.859> I'm

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
moment like I'm driving to work and I'm

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.710 
moment like I'm driving to work and I'm
thinking<00:03:53.280> if<00:03:53.640> I'm<00:03:53.760> driving<00:03:53.940> too<00:03:54.209> fast<00:03:54.239> I<00:03:54.600> mean

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
thinking if I'm driving too fast I mean

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.330 
thinking if I'm driving too fast I mean
is<00:03:54.989> that<00:03:55.049> me<00:03:55.320> always<00:03:55.470> that<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.739> chimp<00:03:55.950> driving

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
is that me always that the chimp driving

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.259 
is that me always that the chimp driving
I<00:03:56.519> think<00:03:57.359> is<00:03:58.100> saying<00:03:59.100> is<00:03:59.310> do<00:03:59.760> I<00:03:59.820> want<00:04:00.120> to<00:04:00.209> be

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
I think is saying is do I want to be

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.759 
I think is saying is do I want to be
doing<00:04:00.420> this<00:04:00.690> if<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:00.989> answer<00:04:01.290> is<00:04:01.350> yes<00:04:01.380> then

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
doing this if the answer is yes then

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.620 
doing this if the answer is yes then
it's<00:04:01.920> probably<00:04:02.310> you<00:04:02.489> but<00:04:03.120> if<00:04:03.209> you're<00:04:03.390> saying

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
it's probably you but if you're saying

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.789 
it's probably you but if you're saying
oh<00:04:03.720> sure<00:04:03.900> I<00:04:03.930> don't<00:04:04.109> want<00:04:04.230> to<00:04:04.290> be<00:04:04.350> driving<00:04:04.500> this

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
oh sure I don't want to be driving this

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.860 
oh sure I don't want to be driving this
fast<00:04:05.010> because<00:04:05.370> it's<00:04:05.730> not<00:04:05.880> sensible<00:04:06.420> it's

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
fast because it's not sensible it's

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.840 
fast because it's not sensible it's
quite<00:04:07.230> dangerous<00:04:07.440> then<00:04:07.980> you<00:04:08.400> can<00:04:08.549> recognize

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
quite dangerous then you can recognize

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.880 
quite dangerous then you can recognize
my<00:04:09.209> emotional<00:04:09.660> brains<00:04:09.870> taking<00:04:10.170> over<00:04:10.560> here<00:04:10.680> so

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
my emotional brains taking over here so

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.380 
my emotional brains taking over here so
I<00:04:10.950> need<00:04:11.100> to<00:04:11.220> just<00:04:11.400> slow<00:04:11.579> it<00:04:11.640> down<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:12.090> decide

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
I need to just slow it down and decide

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.330 
I need to just slow it down and decide
what<00:04:12.540> I<00:04:12.570> want<00:04:12.870> to<00:04:12.959> do<00:04:13.109> and<00:04:13.650> when<00:04:13.799> when<00:04:14.070> people
