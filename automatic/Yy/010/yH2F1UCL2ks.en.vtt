00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
okay so today my quick tips are over

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.289 
okay so today my quick tips are over
inner<00:00:03.270> tie<00:00:03.600> rod<00:00:03.629> end<00:00:04.110> so<00:00:05.120> basically<00:00:06.120> I'm<00:00:06.270> just

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
inner tie rod end so basically I'm just

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.360 
inner tie rod end so basically I'm just
going<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.569> give<00:00:06.720> you<00:00:06.810> a<00:00:06.870> little<00:00:07.020> Justin<00:00:07.919> how<00:00:08.340> I

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
going to give you a little Justin how I

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.820 
going to give you a little Justin how I
replace<00:00:08.970> them<00:00:09.179> in<00:00:09.269> our<00:00:09.389> tie<00:00:09.570> rod<00:00:09.809> end<00:00:10.110> on

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
replace them in our tie rod end on

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.459 
replace them in our tie rod end on
vehicles<00:00:11.580> anymore<00:00:12.059> because<00:00:12.330> sometimes<00:00:13.290> it's

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
vehicles anymore because sometimes it's

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.650 
vehicles anymore because sometimes it's
discovering<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.160> get<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.309> wrench<00:00:14.580> up<00:00:14.880> into<00:00:15.480> the

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
discovering to get a wrench up into the

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.300 
discovering to get a wrench up into the
area<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.920> back<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.119> off<00:00:18.289> and<00:00:19.289> it's<00:00:19.740> it's<00:00:20.039> more

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
area to back it off and it's it's more

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.550 
area to back it off and it's it's more
easier<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:21.539> know<00:00:21.570> tighten<00:00:22.080> them<00:00:22.199> up<00:00:22.380> and

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
easier to you know tighten them up and

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.550 
easier to you know tighten them up and
then<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.310> loosen<00:00:24.119> them<00:00:24.269> up<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.320> I

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
then it is to loosen them up so and I

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.290 
then it is to loosen them up so and I
also<00:00:25.740> want<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.160> mention<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.580> don't<00:00:26.849> have<00:00:27.090> the

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
also want to mention I don't have the

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.019 
also want to mention I don't have the
actual<00:00:27.750> tool<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.830> replace<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.400> but<00:00:29.519> if<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.849> did

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
actual tool to replace it but if I did

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.580 
actual tool to replace it but if I did
have<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.300> tool<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:30.810> what<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.349> tool

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
have the tool this is what the tool

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.209 
have the tool this is what the tool
would<00:00:31.740> look<00:00:32.130> like<00:00:32.899> and<00:00:33.899> it's<00:00:34.170> very<00:00:34.440> easy<00:00:34.739> the

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
would look like and it's very easy the

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.869 
would look like and it's very easy the
little<00:00:36.120> pieces<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:38.070> are<00:00:38.250> separate<00:00:38.670> from

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
little pieces of that are separate from

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.150 
little pieces of that are separate from
that<00:00:39.149> long<00:00:39.450> tool<00:00:39.840> basically<00:00:40.469> slip<00:00:40.890> down<00:00:41.040> on

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
that long tool basically slip down on

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.709 
that long tool basically slip down on
the<00:00:41.280> tire<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.640> then<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:41.879> slip<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.300> over<00:00:42.360> the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
the tire and then you slip that over the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.470 
the tire and then you slip that over the
end<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.079> then<00:00:43.170> crank<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.950> loose<00:00:44.190> kind<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.180> cool

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
end and then crank it loose kind of cool

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.959 
end and then crank it loose kind of cool
so<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.559> why<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.739> basically<00:00:47.129> do<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.399> go<00:00:47.730> in

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
so this is why I basically do I go in

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.299 
so this is why I basically do I go in
and<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:49.649> will<00:00:50.390> back<00:00:51.390> off<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.870> nut<00:00:52.110> then<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.160> will

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
and I will back off this nut then I will

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.160 
and I will back off this nut then I will
count<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.640> turns<00:00:53.850> taking<00:00:54.329> off<00:00:54.570> my<00:00:54.719> tire<00:00:54.930> out

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
count the turns taking off my tire out

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.720 
count the turns taking off my tire out
in<00:00:55.350> then<00:00:55.800> I'll<00:00:55.890> take<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.219> nut<00:00:56.430> all<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.640> way

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
in then I'll take this nut all the way

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.400 
in then I'll take this nut all the way
off<00:00:56.879> then<00:00:57.329> I'll<00:00:57.480> remove<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:58.050> boot<00:00:58.730> and<00:01:00.410> then

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
off then I'll remove the boot and then

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.429 
off then I'll remove the boot and then
I'll<00:01:02.250> go<00:01:02.489> up<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.000> get<00:01:03.120> my<00:01:03.300> welder<00:01:03.719> but<00:01:04.290> the

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
I'll go up and get my welder but the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.899 
I'll go up and get my welder but the
first<00:01:04.650> thing<00:01:04.860> I'm<00:01:04.979> going<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.159> do<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.400> I'm<00:01:05.640> going

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.490 
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to<00:01:06.000> take<00:01:06.150> off<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.540> positive<00:01:07.020> negative

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
to take off the positive negative

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.140 
to take off the positive negative
leading<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:07.979> battery<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.850> we<00:01:08.970> don't

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
leading of this battery so that we don't

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.350 
leading of this battery so that we don't
not<00:01:09.450> try<00:01:10.290> anything<00:01:10.530> in<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.360> electronical

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
not try anything in the electronical

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.149 
not try anything in the electronical
system<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:13.020> car<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.560> then<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.400> weld<00:01:16.159> this

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
system of this car and then I weld this

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.429 
system of this car and then I weld this
piece<00:01:17.930> solid<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.110> had<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.040> cut<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.280> off<00:01:21.200> for<00:01:22.200> a

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
piece solid I had to cut it off for a

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.630 
piece solid I had to cut it off for a
reason<00:01:22.640> and<00:01:24.110> then<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.140> will<00:01:25.439> weld<00:01:25.650> put<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.369> nut

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
reason and then I will weld put the nut

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.179 
reason and then I will weld put the nut
back<00:01:26.670> on<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.330> then<00:01:27.509> weld<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.930> knows<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.860> this

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
back on and then weld it knows that this

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.850 
back on and then weld it knows that this
is<00:01:29.460> take<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.700> socket<00:01:29.970> my<00:01:30.299> breaker<00:01:30.540> bar<00:01:30.869> off<00:01:31.560> that

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
is take a socket my breaker bar off that

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.270 
is take a socket my breaker bar off that
thing<00:01:32.100> loose<00:01:32.479> so<00:01:33.680> it's<00:01:34.680> with<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.070> thing

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
thing loose so it's with this thing

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.700 
thing loose so it's with this thing
loose<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.759> can<00:01:35.909> turn<00:01:36.270> that's<00:01:36.869> why<00:01:37.140> well<00:01:37.439> this

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
loose it can turn that's why well this

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.550 
loose it can turn that's why well this
and<00:01:38.009> plus<00:01:38.189> it's<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.490> ball<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.909> socket<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:40.290> if

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
and plus it's a ball in the socket so if

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.649 
and plus it's a ball in the socket so if
you<00:01:40.710> have<00:01:40.950> access<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.640> welder<00:01:42.000> this<00:01:42.240> makes

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
you have access to a welder this makes

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.109 
you have access to a welder this makes
it<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.869> little<00:01:42.990> bit<00:01:43.229> easier<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.909> change<00:01:44.909> out

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
it a little bit easier to change out

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.870 
it a little bit easier to change out
your<00:01:45.149> inner<00:01:45.689> tie<00:01:46.200> rod<00:01:46.229> ends<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:48.200> but<00:01:49.200> yeah

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
your inner tie rod ends and but yeah

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.090 
your inner tie rod ends and but yeah
that's<00:01:50.880> basically<00:01:51.540> my<00:01:51.810> tip<00:01:52.079> use<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.710> at<00:01:52.860> your

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
that's basically my tip use it at your

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.149 
that's basically my tip use it at your
own<00:01:53.250> risk<00:01:54.170> because<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.380> do<00:01:55.710> have<00:01:55.979> the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
own risk because you do have the

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.740 
own risk because you do have the
potential<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.729> fry<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.149> your<00:01:57.329> electronic

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
potential to fry in your electronic

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.530 
potential to fry in your electronic
system<00:01:58.500> if<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.430> forget<00:01:59.790> to<00:02:00.060> turn<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.360> or

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540
