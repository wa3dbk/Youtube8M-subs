00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.000
 hello in this video only very briefly 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.709
 shown as the homegroup or 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.150
 the hoods group from their explorer 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:18.619
 can remove in case of cases 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.160
 that's what you see here 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.800
 becomes 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.330
 You only had to confirm that for a short time 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.029
 you can use this feature at all 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.739
 I'd like to pop that on completely 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.050
 regardless of whether we really do it 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.640
 do not use holidays at this 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.700
 calculator is not used as far as can 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.830
 the entry disappear 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.480
 I show that here under windows 7 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.250
 working under windows 8 is like that 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.840
 a bit different because of that 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.820
 Let's create our own for windows 8 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.800
 Just click on our channel search 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.600
 look for the windows 8 video if you like 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.520
 the whole under windows 8 perform 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.809
 want to start with it as we first 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.809
 open regedit 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.579
 and then we look for a whole 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.640
 certain class ii who they find 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.860
 in the description I have here now 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.980
 So we already clicked 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.150
 visit 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.230
 takes a moment after found 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.080
 If you click on it, we'll find it 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.790
 namely deer folder and here the 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.320
 attribute and we have to change that 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.300
 We can, however, currently under 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.880
 windows 7 not when i go out here 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.260
 the 8 make a new one that is the 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.730
 changes that need to be made 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.410
 exactly it again in the 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.570
 description then here is the whole 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.790
 can not be changed 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.880
 therefore right mouse button in the context menu 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.720
 to call the permissions 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.190
 and then we see here as 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.750
 We do not have enough administrator 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.280
 right 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.090
 let's go on it 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.200
 Click on OK now 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.690
 we change it here 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.460
 the eight-time new click on ok that 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.440
 It was the change went through 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.090
 Now I can unsubscribe here 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.170
 again before after homegroup 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.170
 is currently still there 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:09.430
 I sign off so and sign up again 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:21.819
 we open the explorer and here 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.819
 our homegroup is missing ok
