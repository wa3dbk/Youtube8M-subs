00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.609 
bit as to why they're important so
before<00:01:59.570> me<00:01:59.689> is<00:01:59.780> some<00:01:59.930> crested<00:02:00.290> wheat<00:02:00.409> grass

before me is some crested wheat grass

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.160 
before me is some crested wheat grass
and<00:02:00.950> you'll<00:02:01.100> see<00:02:01.280> that<00:02:01.430> it's<00:02:01.719> it's<00:02:02.719> critical

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
and you'll see that it's it's critical

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.080 
and you'll see that it's it's critical
it's<00:02:03.320> a<00:02:03.409> good<00:02:03.920> forage<00:02:04.219> for<00:02:04.369> wild<00:02:04.430> horses<00:02:04.939> and

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
it's a good forage for wild horses and

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.020 
it's a good forage for wild horses and
burros<00:02:05.210> it<00:02:05.930> also<00:02:06.229> serves<00:02:06.530> as<00:02:06.850> thermal<00:02:07.850> cover

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
burros it also serves as thermal cover

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.410 
burros it also serves as thermal cover
for<00:02:08.450> a<00:02:08.660> lot<00:02:08.869> of<00:02:08.989> the<00:02:09.110> smaller<00:02:10.030> species<00:02:11.030> that<00:02:11.300> we

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
for a lot of the smaller species that we

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.210 
for a lot of the smaller species that we
have<00:02:11.599> birds<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:12.500> lizards<00:02:12.650> and<00:02:12.950> things<00:02:13.099> like

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
have birds and lizards and things like

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.020 
have birds and lizards and things like
that

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
that

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.690 
that
it<00:02:14.990> serves<00:02:15.319> also<00:02:15.650> a<00:02:15.800> purpose<00:02:16.160> of<00:02:16.280> keeping<00:02:16.580> the

grasses that you see behind me are

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.330 
grasses that you see behind me are
plentiful<00:02:32.900> and<00:02:33.050> can<00:02:33.200> provide<00:02:33.500> more<00:02:33.860> forage

approximately 30 acres per one horse a
month<00:02:42.470> and<00:02:42.709> we'll<00:02:42.890> show<00:02:43.100> you<00:02:43.130> that<00:02:43.370> a<00:02:43.400> little

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
month and we'll show you that a little

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.770 
month and we'll show you that a little
later<00:02:43.910> when<00:02:44.090> we<00:02:44.180> get<00:02:44.300> to<00:02:44.390> one<00:02:44.480> of<00:02:44.540> those<00:02:44.630> spots

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
later when we get to one of those spots

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.479 
later when we get to one of those spots
so<00:02:47.780> here<00:02:48.019> we<00:02:48.110> are<00:02:48.260> in<00:02:48.380> a<00:02:48.440> lower<00:02:48.620> elevation<00:02:48.800> area

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489
