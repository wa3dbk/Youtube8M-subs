pen<00:03:04.250> a<00:03:04.280> lot<00:03:04.490> it's<00:03:05.120> pretty<00:03:05.390> solid<00:03:05.630> as<00:03:06.080> you<00:03:06.440> can

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
pen a lot it's pretty solid as you can

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.530 
pen a lot it's pretty solid as you can
see<00:03:06.980> it's<00:03:07.160> made<00:03:07.370> out<00:03:07.520> of<00:03:07.550> some<00:03:07.880> sort<00:03:07.910> of<00:03:08.210> metal

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
see it's made out of some sort of metal

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.730 
see it's made out of some sort of metal
so<00:03:08.870> it's<00:03:09.050> not<00:03:09.200> gonna<00:03:09.410> break<00:03:10.360> solid<00:03:11.360> all<00:03:11.600> around

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
so it's not gonna break solid all around

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.110 
so it's not gonna break solid all around
stylists<00:03:12.740> definitely<00:03:13.370> a<00:03:13.400> big<00:03:13.730> improvement

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
stylists definitely a big improvement

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.110 
stylists definitely a big improvement
over<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:15.170> original<00:03:15.200> stylus<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.880> third

styluses<00:03:27.740> just<00:03:28.520> like<00:03:28.700> the<00:03:28.880> metal<00:03:29.150> one<00:03:29.330> we

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
styluses just like the metal one we

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.900 
styluses just like the metal one we
looked<00:03:29.660> at<00:03:29.750> earlier<00:03:30.490> except<00:03:31.490> it's<00:03:31.610> made<00:03:31.760> out

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
looked at earlier except it's made out

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.090 
looked at earlier except it's made out
of<00:03:31.940> plastic<00:03:32.380> one<00:03:33.380> of<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.530> problems<00:03:33.980> with

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
of plastic one of the problems with

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.970 
of plastic one of the problems with
these<00:03:34.310> guys<00:03:35.180> is<00:03:35.720> that<00:03:36.020> they<00:03:36.170> tend<00:03:36.440> to<00:03:36.650> crack

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
these guys is that they tend to crack

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.250 
these guys is that they tend to crack
after<00:03:37.640> a<00:03:37.670> while<00:03:37.910> here's<00:03:38.270> an<00:03:38.390> older<00:03:38.690> one<00:03:38.870> I<00:03:38.900> had

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
after a while here's an older one I had

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.430 
after a while here's an older one I had
and<00:03:40.180> I<00:03:41.180> don't<00:03:41.300> know<00:03:41.600> if<00:03:41.750> you're<00:03:41.930> gonna<00:03:42.050> be<00:03:42.320> able

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
and I don't know if you're gonna be able

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.010 
and I don't know if you're gonna be able
to<00:03:42.560> see<00:03:43.130> yeah<00:03:43.790> you<00:03:43.820> can<00:03:44.150> see<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:44.510> crack<00:03:44.810> in<00:03:44.989> the

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
to see yeah you can see the crack in the

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.320 
to see yeah you can see the crack in the
plastic<00:03:45.590> there<00:03:45.830> doesn't<00:03:46.640> seem<00:03:46.700> to<00:03:47.150> really

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
plastic there doesn't seem to really

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.500 
plastic there doesn't seem to really
affect<00:03:48.020> the<00:03:48.170> stylus<00:03:48.709> I've<00:03:49.340> never<00:03:49.640> had<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.120> the

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
affect the stylus I've never had the the

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.870 
affect the stylus I've never had the the
head<00:03:50.720> come<00:03:51.020> out<00:03:51.170> while<00:03:51.410> I<00:03:51.440> was<00:03:51.709> using<00:03:51.950> it<00:03:52.280> but

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
head come out while I was using it but

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.880 
head come out while I was using it but
obviously<00:03:53.780> you'll<00:03:53.959> get<00:03:54.110> to<00:03:54.230> a<00:03:54.260> point<00:03:54.440> where<00:03:54.680> it

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
obviously you'll get to a point where it

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.600 
obviously you'll get to a point where it
could<00:03:55.100> just<00:03:55.370> break<00:03:56.440> now<00:03:57.440> but<00:03:58.040> my<00:03:58.190> favorite

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
could just break now but my favorite

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.260 
could just break now but my favorite
thing<00:03:58.640> about<00:03:58.820> this<00:03:59.209> is<00:03:59.390> that<00:03:59.480> it<00:03:59.630> comes<00:03:59.930> with

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
thing about this is that it comes with

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.840
