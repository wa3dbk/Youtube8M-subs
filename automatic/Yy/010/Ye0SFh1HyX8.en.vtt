looking eyeliner if you want something a

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.230 
looking eyeliner if you want something a
little<00:00:09.960> more<00:00:09.990> dramatic<00:00:10.320> you<00:00:10.860> can<00:00:11.010> use<00:00:11.309> liquid

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
little more dramatic you can use liquid

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.839

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
eyeliner or a pencil but I really like

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.630 
eyeliner or a pencil but I really like
the<00:00:15.030> way<00:00:15.120> that<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.870> eye<00:00:15.900> shadow<00:00:16.289> looks

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
the way that the the eye shadow looks

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.580 
the way that the the eye shadow looks
because<00:00:17.640> it's<00:00:17.820> just<00:00:18.000> softer<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.869> it<00:00:19.350> also

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
because it's just softer and it also

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.740 
because it's just softer and it also
holds<00:00:20.010> up<00:00:20.340> really<00:00:20.730> well<00:00:20.880> throughout<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.480> day

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750

and<00:01:20.100> just<00:01:20.460> really<00:01:20.760> work<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.510> to<00:01:22.170> the

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
and just really work it in to the

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.950 
and just really work it in to the
lashline<00:01:22.860> try<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.850> stay<00:01:24.150> as<00:01:24.300> close<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
lashline try to stay as close to the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.690 
lashline try to stay as close to the
lash<00:01:25.230> line<00:01:25.260> as<00:01:25.500> possible<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.340> don't<00:01:26.550> have

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
lash line as possible so you don't have

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.790 
lash line as possible so you don't have
any<00:01:26.880> space<00:01:27.300> and<00:01:27.630> it'll<00:01:28.260> give<00:01:28.410> you<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
any space and it'll give you the

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.070 
any space and it'll give you the
illusion<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.490> having<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.910> really<00:01:30.120> full<00:01:30.600> thick

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
illusion of having a really full thick

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:40.580 
illusion of having a really full thick
eyelashes<00:01:36.290> okay<00:01:38.330> and<00:01:39.330> look<00:01:39.690> up<00:01:39.870> in<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.140> way<00:01:40.290> I

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
eyelashes okay and look up in that way I

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.590 
eyelashes okay and look up in that way I
like<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.160> get<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.430> inner<00:01:41.610> corners<00:01:42.270> too

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
like to get the inner corners too

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.120 
like to get the inner corners too
because<00:01:42.900> I<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:43.050> the<00:01:43.560> way<00:01:43.650> that<00:01:43.800> it<00:01:43.920> just

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
because I like the way that it just

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.280 
because I like the way that it just
makes<00:01:44.820> your<00:01:45.600> eye<00:01:45.660> shape<00:01:46.110> just<00:01:46.350> really<00:01:46.800> pop<00:01:47.010> out

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
makes your eye shape just really pop out

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.950 
makes your eye shape just really pop out
and<00:01:49.290> look<00:01:49.470> up<00:01:49.590> in<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.830> way<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.340> just<00:01:51.180> look<00:01:51.720> up

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
and look up in that way so just look up

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.740 
and look up in that way so just look up
into<00:01:52.440> the<00:01:53.010> side<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.610> take<00:01:54.030> your<00:01:54.240> brush<00:01:54.510> and

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
into the side and take your brush and

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.010 
into the side and take your brush and
just<00:01:54.810> go<00:01:55.260> right<00:01:55.680> in<00:01:55.890> there<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.780> then<00:01:57.780> I'm

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
just go right in there and then I'm

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.190 
just go right in there and then I'm
gonna<00:01:58.229> lightly<00:01:58.710> go<00:01:58.890> back<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.450> with<00:02:00.450> that

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
gonna lightly go back in with that

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.600 
gonna lightly go back in with that
purple<00:02:01.650> color<00:02:01.760> underneath<00:02:02.760> her<00:02:03.030> eyes<00:02:03.240> look<00:02:03.780> up

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
purple color underneath her eyes look up

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.060 
purple color underneath her eyes look up
against<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.760> lashes<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.450> that's<00:02:06.690> gonna<00:02:07.070> give

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
against the lashes and that's gonna give

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.730 
against the lashes and that's gonna give
that<00:02:08.100> really<00:02:08.760> pretty<00:02:09.030> soft<00:02:09.630> liner<00:02:10.380> on<00:02:10.679> the
