00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
available anymore so I found these on a

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.510 
available anymore so I found these on a
different<00:00:40.379> website<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.010> got<00:00:41.160> them<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
different website and I got them in the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.130 
different website and I got them in the
white<00:00:41.820> just<00:00:42.059> because<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.420> really<00:00:42.719> like<00:00:42.899> white

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.819 
for the summer and I think it goes with
everything<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:45.510> does<00:00:45.750> come<00:00:45.989> with<00:00:46.020> pockets<00:00:46.590> and

everything it does come with pockets and

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.040 
everything it does come with pockets and
they<00:00:47.340> are<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.850> these<00:00:48.329> really<00:00:48.660> comfortable

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.240 
they are just these really comfortable
shorts<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.440> looks<00:00:49.649> like<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.800> skirt<00:00:50.070> because

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
shorts that looks like a skirt because

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.189 
shorts that looks like a skirt because
of<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.700> front<00:00:51.059> detailing<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.899> also<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.110> got

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
of this front detailing and also I got

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.260 
of this front detailing and also I got
this<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.620> size<00:00:52.800> medium<00:00:52.879> because<00:00:53.879> they

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
this in a size medium because they

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.790 
this in a size medium because they
didn't<00:00:54.600> have<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> small<00:00:55.079> left<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.590> just

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
didn't have a small left and I just

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.439 
didn't have a small left and I just
thought<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:55.980> would<00:00:56.250> be<00:00:56.399> able<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.760> alter<00:00:57.090> them

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
thought I would be able to alter them

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.689 
thought I would be able to alter them
but<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.199> medium<00:00:58.620> actually<00:00:59.010> fits<00:00:59.190> me<00:00:59.399> pretty

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
but the medium actually fits me pretty

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.630 
but the medium actually fits me pretty
well<00:00:59.789> I'm<00:01:00.270> usually<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.930> size<00:01:01.170> 24<00:01:01.590> waist<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.309> I

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
well I'm usually a size 24 waist and I

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.700 
well I'm usually a size 24 waist and I
would<00:01:02.820> say<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.120> fits<00:01:03.390> me<00:01:03.570> almost<00:01:03.809> like<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> 25

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
would say this fits me almost like a 25

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.010 
would say this fits me almost like a 25
which<00:01:05.070> isn't<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.610> bad<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.180> these<00:01:06.450> actually<00:01:06.510> fit

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020

black kind of chiffon like overalls on
shan't<00:02:05.160> I'd<00:02:05.370> common<00:02:05.970> thought<00:02:06.210> these<00:02:06.390> were

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
shan't I'd common thought these were

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.150 
shan't I'd common thought these were
really<00:02:07.050> cool-looking<00:02:07.410> the<00:02:07.920> really

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.620 
really cool-looking the really
lightweight<00:02:08.399> material<00:02:09.119> so<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.300> thought<00:02:09.479> this

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
lightweight material so I thought this

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.450 
lightweight material so I thought this
would<00:02:09.690> be<00:02:09.840> fun<00:02:10.140> for<00:02:10.200> this<00:02:10.530> summer<00:02:10.740> it's<00:02:11.070> more

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
would be fun for this summer it's more

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.760 
would be fun for this summer it's more
like<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.700> jumpsuit<00:02:12.420> than<00:02:12.690> anything<00:02:13.260> honestly

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
like a jumpsuit than anything honestly

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.370 
like a jumpsuit than anything honestly
but<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.190> just<00:02:14.370> crosses<00:02:14.880> in<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.120> back<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.660> it's

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
but it just crosses in the back and it's

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.890 
but it just crosses in the back and it's
um<00:02:16.650> ankle<00:02:17.550> length<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.060> stops<00:02:18.420> right<00:02:18.630> at<00:02:18.690> the

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
um ankle length so it stops right at the

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.960 
um ankle length so it stops right at the
ankle<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.470> don't<00:02:19.950> have<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.130> clip<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.550> me<00:02:20.610> wearing

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.060 
ankle I don't have a clip of me wearing
these<00:02:21.180> because<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.840> waist<00:02:22.140> is<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.500> little<00:02:22.950> bit

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
these because the waist is a little bit

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.370 
these because the waist is a little bit
too<00:02:23.280> wide<00:02:23.550> so<00:02:23.610> i<00:02:23.970> do<00:02:24.090> need<00:02:24.450> these<00:02:24.690> taken<00:02:25.050> in<00:02:25.350> a

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040

sale<00:02:32.280> online<00:02:32.520> and<00:02:33.030> in<00:02:33.209> store<00:02:33.480> right<00:02:33.690> now<00:02:33.840> so<00:02:34.320> i

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
sale online and in store right now so i

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.630 
sale online and in store right now so i
picked<00:02:34.620> up<00:02:34.740> this<00:02:34.950> little<00:02:35.250> lightweight

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
picked up this little lightweight

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.340 
picked up this little lightweight
cardigan<00:02:36.360> which<00:02:36.630> i<00:02:36.750> thought<00:02:36.900> would<00:02:37.050> be<00:02:37.110> nice

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
cardigan which i thought would be nice

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.110 
cardigan which i thought would be nice
to<00:02:37.560> throw<00:02:37.770> on<00:02:37.980> when<00:02:38.220> it<00:02:38.310> gets<00:02:38.459> colder<00:02:38.880> during

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
to throw on when it gets colder during

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.720 
to throw on when it gets colder during
the<00:02:39.390> night<00:02:39.630> or<00:02:39.900> when<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.500> AC<00:02:40.650> is<00:02:41.040> blasting

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
the night or when the AC is blasting

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.400 
the night or when the AC is blasting
because<00:02:42.180> it's<00:02:42.360> super<00:02:42.540> lightweight<00:02:42.930> but<00:02:43.290> it's

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
because it's super lightweight but it's

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.230 
because it's super lightweight but it's
nice<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.650> just<00:02:43.830> have<00:02:44.040> something<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:44.940> throw<00:02:45.120> on

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
nice to just have something to throw on

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.240 
nice to just have something to throw on

like<00:05:41.720> four<00:05:41.960> inches<00:05:42.140> but<00:05:42.500> i<00:05:42.560> just<00:05:42.800> thought<00:05:42.920> they

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 
like four inches but i just thought they

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.070 
like four inches but i just thought they
were<00:05:43.160> perfect<00:05:43.550> the<00:05:44.330> only<00:05:44.570> thing<00:05:44.720> I'm<00:05:44.840> worried

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
were perfect the only thing I'm worried

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.140 
were perfect the only thing I'm worried
about<00:05:45.140> is<00:05:45.290> keeping<00:05:45.680> this<00:05:46.040> white<00:05:46.430> nice<00:05:46.880> and

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 
the shoes and then I picked up these

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.610 
the shoes and then I picked up these
black<00:06:01.520> heels<00:06:01.820> from<00:06:02.000> hmm<00:06:02.570> i<00:06:02.780> love<00:06:03.050> the<00:06:03.260> ankle
