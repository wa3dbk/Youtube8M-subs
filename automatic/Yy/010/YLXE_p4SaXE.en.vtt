about<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.610> seats<00:02:15.820> while<00:02:15.970> they<00:02:16.120> are<00:02:16.239> nice<00:02:16.540> and

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
about the seats while they are nice and

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.410 
about the seats while they are nice and
comfortable<00:02:17.160> they're<00:02:18.160> just<00:02:18.400> very<00:02:18.520> short<00:02:18.970> like

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
comfortable they're just very short like

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.840 
comfortable they're just very short like
I<00:02:19.510> feel<00:02:19.690> like<00:02:19.750> you<00:02:20.080> know<00:02:20.170> I<00:02:20.230> have<00:02:20.320> a<00:02:20.380> lot<00:02:20.620> of<00:02:20.850> leg

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
I feel like you know I have a lot of leg

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.820 
I feel like you know I have a lot of leg
hanging<00:02:22.209> off<00:02:22.480> my<00:02:22.690> seat<00:02:22.930> I<00:02:23.200> just<00:02:23.500> feel<00:02:23.650> like<00:02:23.709> I

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
hanging off my seat I just feel like I

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:24.979 
hanging off my seat I just feel like I
wish<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:24.040> was<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:24.250> little<00:02:24.430> bit<00:02:24.550> bigger

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
wish it was a little bit bigger

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.360 
wish it was a little bit bigger
other<00:02:25.989> than<00:02:26.260> that<00:02:26.320> with<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:26.800> seats<00:02:27.040> up<00:02:27.220> you

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
other than that with the seats up you

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.490 
other than that with the seats up you
have<00:02:27.459> 25<00:02:27.970> cubic<00:02:28.510> feet<00:02:28.720> of<00:02:28.840> space<00:02:28.900> in<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.380> trunk

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
have 25 cubic feet of space in the trunk

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.080 
have 25 cubic feet of space in the trunk
and<00:02:29.860> if<00:02:29.950> you<00:02:30.010> put<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.280> seats<00:02:30.489> down<00:02:30.640> is<00:02:30.880> about

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
and if you put the seats down is about

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.660 
and if you put the seats down is about
53<00:02:31.510> cubic<00:02:31.900> feet<00:02:32.080> which<00:02:32.620> is<00:02:32.739> not<00:02:32.890> bad<00:02:33.100> in<00:02:33.400> this

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
53 cubic feet which is not bad in this

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.050 
53 cubic feet which is not bad in this
class<00:02:33.910> compared<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.540> competitor

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.110 

another<00:02:39.060> thing<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.900> don't<00:02:40.410> really<00:02:40.709> enjoy<00:02:41.120> and

this my Ford touch my Lincoln touch

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.040 
this my Ford touch my Lincoln touch
system<00:02:47.010> well<00:02:47.670> they<00:02:47.849> have<00:02:48.030> improved<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.780> it's

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
system well they have improved it it's

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.809 
system well they have improved it it's
still<00:02:49.349> a<00:02:49.380> little<00:02:49.590> bit<00:02:49.739> glitchy<00:02:50.069> it<00:02:50.310> takes<00:02:50.520> the

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
still a little bit glitchy it takes the

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.850 
still a little bit glitchy it takes the
slow<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:51.270> respond<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:52.020> interface<00:02:52.440> isn't

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
slow to respond the interface isn't

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.850 
slow to respond the interface isn't
really<00:02:53.810> 2015<00:02:54.810> for<00:02:55.050> me<00:02:55.140> if<00:02:55.230> so<00:02:55.380> feel<00:02:55.560> like<00:02:55.709> it's

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
really 2015 for me if so feel like it's

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.900 
really 2015 for me if so feel like it's
stuck<00:02:56.069> in<00:02:56.250> 2010<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.770> the<00:02:58.910> voice-activated

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
stuck in 2010 and the voice-activated

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.809 
stuck in 2010 and the voice-activated
system<00:03:00.300> so<00:03:00.750> if<00:03:00.810> I'd<00:03:00.989> you<00:03:01.260> know<00:03:01.350> asked<00:03:02.100> her<00:03:02.430> to

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
system so if I'd you know asked her to

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.070 
system so if I'd you know asked her to
take<00:03:03.000> me<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.270> a<00:03:03.300> certain<00:03:03.510> destination<00:03:03.630> she

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
take me to a certain destination she

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.570 
take me to a certain destination she
never<00:03:04.290> understands<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.890> correct<00:03:05.130> Idris<00:03:05.489> I

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
think I speak pretty clearly you can let

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.890 
think I speak pretty clearly you can let
me<00:03:08.580> know<00:03:08.700> otherwise<00:03:09.000> in<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.360> comments<00:03:09.750> if<00:03:09.840> you

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
me know otherwise in the comments if you

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.509 
me know otherwise in the comments if you
don't<00:03:10.110> think<00:03:10.290> that's<00:03:10.410> me<00:03:10.530> clearly<00:03:10.769> but<00:03:11.069> you

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
don't think that's me clearly but you

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:12.530 
don't think that's me clearly but you
know<00:03:11.580> what's<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.880> point<00:03:12.000> of<00:03:12.150> having<00:03:12.300> a

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
know what's the point of having a

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.660 
know what's the point of having a
voice-activated<00:03:13.200> system<00:03:14.010> if<00:03:14.280> it<00:03:14.400> doesn't

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
voice-activated system if it doesn't

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.840 
voice-activated system if it doesn't

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
kind of slow to respond at times but I

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.229
