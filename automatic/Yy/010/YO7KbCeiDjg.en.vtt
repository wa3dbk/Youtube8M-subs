okay<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:53.969> if<00:00:54.090> we<00:00:54.180> get<00:00:54.300> started<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.050> on<00:00:56.039> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
okay so if we get started in the on the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.700 
okay so if we get started in the on the
information<00:00:56.670> here<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.079> car<00:00:58.350> costs

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
information here so this car costs

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.599 
information here so this car costs
roughly<00:00:58.890> about<00:01:00.530> 25-30<00:01:01.530> dollars<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.160> believe

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
roughly about 25-30 dollars I believe

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.340 
roughly about 25-30 dollars I believe
from<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.239> last<00:01:03.570> time<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.989> definitely

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
from the last time it definitely

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.070 
from the last time it definitely
shouldn't<00:01:04.710> be<00:01:04.799> over<00:01:05.070> $30.00<00:01:05.900> this<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.049> a

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
shouldn't be over $30.00 this is a

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.800 
shouldn't be over $30.00 this is a
budget<00:01:07.439> car<00:01:07.650> as<00:01:08.520> most<00:01:08.790> wellies<00:01:09.119> are<00:01:09.330> except

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
budget car as most wellies are except

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.170 
budget car as most wellies are except
for<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.049> newer<00:01:10.200> ones<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.770> comes<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.700> black<00:01:11.909> as

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
for the newer ones I comes in black as

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.480 
for the newer ones I comes in black as
well<00:01:12.210> as<00:01:12.540> an<00:01:12.689> orange<00:01:13.140> color<00:01:13.439> which<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.250> pretty

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
well as an orange color which is pretty

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.399 
well as an orange color which is pretty
nice<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.970> was<00:01:15.090> my<00:01:15.479> decision<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.960> go<00:01:16.170> with<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
nice it was my decision to go with the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.230 
nice it was my decision to go with the
black<00:01:16.590> I'm<00:01:17.040> very<00:01:17.460> happy<00:01:17.850> with<00:01:17.970> it

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
black I'm very happy with it

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.880 
black I'm very happy with it
and<00:01:20.630> this<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.780> very<00:01:22.020> similar<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.610> the<00:01:23.610> welly

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
and this is very similar to the welly

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.300 
and this is very similar to the welly
Chevelle<00:01:25.890> which<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.909> can<00:01:27.180> also<00:01:27.360> get<00:01:28.040> so<00:01:29.040> as

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
Chevelle which you can also get so as

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.920 
Chevelle which you can also get so as
far<00:01:29.490> as<00:01:29.549> features<00:01:30.090> goes<00:01:30.360> there<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.780> no

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
far as features goes there is no

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.100 
far as features goes there is no
suspension<00:01:31.560> but<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.189> wheels<00:01:32.369> do<00:01:32.579> turn<00:01:33.110> with

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
suspension but the wheels do turn with

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.300 
suspension but the wheels do turn with
the<00:01:34.259> steering<00:01:34.530> wheel<00:01:36.020> typical<00:01:37.020> welly<00:01:38.180> outside

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
the steering wheel typical welly outside

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.280 
the steering wheel typical welly outside
we<00:01:41.310> do<00:01:41.729> have<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.939> very<00:01:42.060> small<00:01:42.210> peg<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:42.930> in

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
we do have a very small peg in the in

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.539 
we do have a very small peg in the in
the<00:01:43.500> headlight<00:01:43.829> but<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.159> doesn't<00:01:44.430> really

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
the headlight but it doesn't really

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.999 
the headlight but it doesn't really
matter<00:01:44.790> because<00:01:45.299> it's<00:01:46.170> kind<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.500> right<00:01:46.710> in<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
matter because it's kind of right in the

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.149 
matter because it's kind of right in the
point<00:01:47.310> where<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:49.020> halogen<00:01:49.770> bulb<00:01:50.009> would

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
point where the the halogen bulb would

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.889 
point where the the halogen bulb would
be<00:01:50.310> anywhere<00:01:50.640> not<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.909> halogen<00:01:51.270> um<00:01:51.390> just<00:01:51.780> the

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
be anywhere not the halogen um just the

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.700 
be anywhere not the halogen um just the
regular<00:01:52.020> old<00:01:52.320> bulb<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.860> would<00:01:53.399> be<00:01:53.549> in<00:01:53.670> their

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
regular old bulb I would be in their

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.410 
regular old bulb I would be in their
front<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:56.189> can't<00:01:56.369> really<00:01:56.520> see<00:01:56.759> through<00:01:57.090> it

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
front you can't really see through it

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.120 
front you can't really see through it
but<00:01:57.840> it's<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.320> pretty<00:01:58.829> nicely<00:02:00.049> well-done<00:02:01.130> grill

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
but it's a pretty nicely well-done grill

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.679 
but it's a pretty nicely well-done grill
even<00:02:02.729> though<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:02.939> can't<00:02:03.360> go<00:02:03.450> all<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.659> way

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
even though you can't go all the way

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.660 
even though you can't go all the way
through<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.469> looks<00:02:04.680> like<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:05.040> can<00:02:05.280> has

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
through it it looks like you can has

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.809 
through it it looks like you can has
