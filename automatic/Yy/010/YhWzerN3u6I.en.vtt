00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
frame by frame in flash um I don't know

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.910 
frame by frame in flash um I don't know
if<00:00:12.030> you<00:00:12.150> consider<00:00:12.570> this<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.750> tutorial<00:00:13.230> or<00:00:13.799> if

ask<00:00:23.960> like<00:00:24.960> what's<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:25.980> difference<00:00:26.340> between

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
ask like what's the difference between

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.169 
ask like what's the difference between
frame<00:00:26.939> by<00:00:27.090> frame<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.720> tweening<00:00:27.960> well<00:00:29.179> there's

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
frame by frame and tweening well there's

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.939 
frame by frame and tweening well there's
a<00:00:30.240> big<00:00:30.570> difference<00:00:30.810> ran<00:00:31.140> by<00:00:31.289> frame<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.679> your

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
a big difference ran by frame is your

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.660 
a big difference ran by frame is your
drawing<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.369> single<00:00:32.880> image<00:00:33.270> for<00:00:33.809> every<00:00:33.840> frame

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
drawing a single image for every frame

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.150 
drawing a single image for every frame
that<00:00:35.670> may<00:00:35.880> sound<00:00:36.300> ridiculous<00:00:36.960> or<00:00:37.680> time

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
that may sound ridiculous or time

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.450 
that may sound ridiculous or time
consuming<00:00:38.460> which<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.469> but<00:00:40.469> it's<00:00:41.040> much

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
consuming which it is but it's much

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.170 
consuming which it is but it's much
better<00:00:41.640> than<00:00:41.850> tweening<00:00:42.180> um<00:00:43.730> basically<00:00:44.730> all<00:00:45.120> I

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
better than tweening um basically all I

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.299 
better than tweening um basically all I
ever<00:00:45.539> used<00:00:45.870> tweening<00:00:46.140> for<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.770> if<00:00:46.980> I'm<00:00:47.160> going

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
ever used tweening for is if I'm going

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.220 
ever used tweening for is if I'm going
to<00:00:47.399> make<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.579> landscape<00:00:48.120> bigger<00:00:48.420> or<00:00:48.809> if<00:00:49.050> I'm

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
to make a landscape bigger or if I'm

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.100 
to make a landscape bigger or if I'm
going<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.620> keep<00:00:50.059> depth<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.239> field<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.719> without

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
going to keep depth of field in without

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.279 
going to keep depth of field in without
having<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.500> change<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.860> background<00:00:53.010> um<00:00:54.289> and

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
having to change the background um and

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.860 
having to change the background um and
if<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:55.980> mix<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.370> two<00:00:56.550> they're<00:00:57.149> very<00:00:57.570> good

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
if you mix the two they're very good

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.720 
if you mix the two they're very good
together<00:00:58.070> right<00:00:59.070> now<00:00:59.190> what<00:00:59.370> I'm<00:00:59.399> going<00:00:59.670> to

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
together right now what I'm going to

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.910 
together right now what I'm going to
show<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.390> scene<00:01:00.960> from<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.350> flash<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.859> am

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
show you is a scene from a flash I am

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.210 
show you is a scene from a flash I am
currently<00:01:02.309> working<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:03.140> I<00:01:04.140> don't<00:01:04.920> know<00:01:05.010> if<00:01:05.100> we

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
currently working on I don't know if we

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.160 
currently working on I don't know if we
get<00:01:05.309> finished<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.760> never<00:01:06.000> finish<00:01:06.330> any<00:01:06.479> flash<00:01:06.810> I

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
get finished I never finish any flash I

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.870 
get finished I never finish any flash I
haven't<00:01:07.590> finished<00:01:07.860> any<00:01:07.979> flash<00:01:08.280> since<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.610> last

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
haven't finished any flash since I last

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.490 
haven't finished any flash since I last
did<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:10.320> Sun<00:01:10.530> akutsu<00:01:10.950> trailer<00:01:12.260> don't<00:01:13.260> go<00:01:13.380> and

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
did the Sun akutsu trailer don't go and

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.080 
did the Sun akutsu trailer don't go and
look<00:01:13.590> at<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.770> though<00:01:13.979> it's<00:01:14.130> be<00:01:14.280> scrapped<00:01:17.090> right

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
look at it though it's be scrapped right

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.719 
look at it though it's be scrapped right
here<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.420> drew<00:01:19.200> some<00:01:19.439> fairy<00:01:20.189> things<00:01:20.490> they're

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
here I drew some fairy things they're

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.240 
here I drew some fairy things they're
coming<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.270> as<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:22.290> can<00:01:22.439> see<00:01:22.650> when<00:01:22.860> they<00:01:23.009> come

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
coming in as you can see when they come

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.810 
coming in as you can see when they come
in<00:01:23.430> they<00:01:24.390> have<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:25.250> slowdown<00:01:26.250> but<00:01:26.460> when<00:01:26.700> they

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
in they have a slowdown but when they

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.550 
in they have a slowdown but when they
slow<00:01:27.119> down<00:01:27.150> they<00:01:27.630> don't<00:01:27.840> come<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.170> complete

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
slow down they don't come to a complete

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.429 
slow down they don't come to a complete
stop<00:01:28.710> until<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> couple<00:01:29.729> frames<00:01:30.060> later<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
stop until a couple frames later and the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.410 
stop until a couple frames later and the
reason<00:01:31.560> for<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.250> try<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.520> add<00:01:32.759> physics

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
reason for that is I try to add physics

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.950 
reason for that is I try to add physics
and<00:01:33.630> inertia<00:01:33.900> into<00:01:34.320> my<00:01:34.770> flash<00:01:35.750> same<00:01:36.750> thing

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
and inertia into my flash same thing

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.249 
and inertia into my flash same thing
here<00:01:37.170> with<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.409> build-up<00:01:38.119> they<00:01:39.119> back<00:01:39.930> up<00:01:40.140> a

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
here with the build-up they back up a

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.719 
here with the build-up they back up a
little<00:01:40.409> then<00:01:40.680> go<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.070> gives<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.430> little<00:01:41.579> bit

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
little then go it gives it a little bit

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.330 
little then go it gives it a little bit
of<00:01:41.820> power<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:44.240> forced<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.600> animation

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
of power and forced to the animation

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.069 
of power and forced to the animation
like<00:01:47.340> right<00:01:47.700> here<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:50.119> same<00:01:51.119> physics<00:01:51.689> added

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
like right here I same physics added

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.130 
like right here I same physics added
down<00:01:52.259> there<00:01:52.850> see<00:01:53.850> if<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.030> can<00:01:54.240> get<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.750> closed

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
down there see if I can get you a closed

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.709 
down there see if I can get you a closed
event<00:01:55.439> rewind<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:57.950> yeah<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.939> I<00:01:59.969> think<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.570> can

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
event rewind it yeah so I think you can

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.249 
event rewind it yeah so I think you can
understand<00:02:01.140> what<00:02:01.229> I'm<00:02:01.320> talking<00:02:01.710> about<00:02:01.799> here

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
understand what I'm talking about here

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.380 
understand what I'm talking about here
also<00:02:04.259> when<00:02:04.439> using<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.799> flash<00:02:05.070> camera<00:02:05.460> as<00:02:06.180> I

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
also when using the flash camera as I

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.210 
also when using the flash camera as I
said<00:02:06.630> tweening<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.290> only<00:02:07.500> good<00:02:07.829> for<00:02:07.860> when

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
said tweening is only good for when

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.119 
said tweening is only good for when
you're<00:02:08.369> moving<00:02:08.520> us<00:02:08.970> like<00:02:09.869> solid<00:02:10.800> objects

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
you're moving us like solid objects

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:11.880 
you're moving us like solid objects
around

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
around

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.980 
around
it<00:02:12.130> can't<00:02:12.400> be<00:02:12.460> something<00:02:12.819> that's<00:02:12.910> going<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:13.870> be

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
it can't be something that's going to be

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.540 
it can't be something that's going to be
completely<00:02:14.500> moving<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.190> frame<00:02:15.370> by<00:02:15.520> frame<00:02:15.630> so

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
completely moving and frame by frame so

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.210 
completely moving and frame by frame so
with<00:02:18.550> this<00:02:18.670> camera<00:02:19.000> here<00:02:19.450> aight<00:02:20.350> wind<00:02:20.709> it<00:02:20.890> up<00:02:20.920> a

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
with this camera here aight wind it up a

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.570 
with this camera here aight wind it up a
bit<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:22.380> here<00:02:23.380> actually<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:23.950> add<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.459> the

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
bit and here actually to add to the

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.320 
bit and here actually to add to the
power<00:02:24.910> of<00:02:25.090> those<00:02:25.600> dots<00:02:26.319> there<00:02:26.650> I<00:02:27.580> pulled<00:02:28.240> it

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
power of those dots there I pulled it

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.030 
power of those dots there I pulled it
back<00:02:28.390> for<00:02:28.959> when<00:02:29.140> they're<00:02:29.410> getting<00:02:29.770> ready<00:02:29.920> to

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
back for when they're getting ready to

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.100 
back for when they're getting ready to
power<00:02:30.280> up<00:02:30.459> and<00:02:30.550> move<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:31.090> then<00:02:31.690> I<00:02:31.720> moved<00:02:31.990> it

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
power up and move and then I moved it

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.130 
power up and move and then I moved it
with<00:02:32.260> them<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:33.209> as<00:02:34.209> you<00:02:34.570> can<00:02:34.690> see<00:02:34.720> there's<00:02:35.050> a

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
with them and as you can see there's a

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.890 
with them and as you can see there's a
transition<00:02:35.650> here<00:02:36.130> and<00:02:36.430> I<00:02:36.580> tried<00:02:36.850> to<00:02:37.000> not<00:02:37.570> make

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
transition here and I tried to not make

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.280 
transition here and I tried to not make
it<00:02:38.080> so<00:02:38.560> much<00:02:38.800> that<00:02:38.860> it<00:02:39.400> would<00:02:40.140> lose<00:02:41.140> the

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
it so much that it would lose the

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.949 
it so much that it would lose the
essence<00:02:41.560> of<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.920> actual<00:02:42.640> scene<00:02:43.000> um<00:02:45.810> see<00:02:46.810> if<00:02:46.840> I

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
essence of the actual scene um see if I

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.110 
essence of the actual scene um see if I
can<00:02:47.110> give<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:47.380> another<00:02:47.470> example<00:02:47.800> of<00:02:48.430> what<00:02:49.000> I'm

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
can give you another example of what I'm

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.600 
can give you another example of what I'm
talking<00:02:49.570> about<00:02:49.660> oh<00:02:50.230> here<00:02:51.010> we<00:02:51.040> are<00:02:51.160> all<00:02:53.340> this<00:02:54.340> is

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
talking about oh here we are all this is

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.340 
talking about oh here we are all this is
nothing<00:02:55.239> but<00:02:55.390> that<00:02:55.570> camera<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:58.080> as<00:02:59.080> you<00:02:59.260> can

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
nothing but that camera and as you can

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.660 
nothing but that camera and as you can
see<00:02:59.380> almost<00:02:59.920> all<00:03:00.190> these<00:03:00.340> images<00:03:00.790> are<00:03:01.060> static

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
see almost all these images are static

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.090 
see almost all these images are static
so<00:03:03.810> moving<00:03:04.810> them<00:03:05.110> around<00:03:05.140> with<00:03:05.560> a<00:03:05.590> tween<00:03:05.890> is

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
so moving them around with a tween is

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.340 
so moving them around with a tween is
great<00:03:06.400> but<00:03:07.030> if<00:03:07.180> they<00:03:07.209> were<00:03:07.360> moving<00:03:07.690> I<00:03:08.019> would

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
great but if they were moving I would

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.900 
great but if they were moving I would
just<00:03:08.530> use<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:08.800> camera<00:03:09.040> instead<00:03:11.670> see<00:03:12.670> if<00:03:12.730> I<00:03:12.790> can

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
just use the camera instead see if I can

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.400 
just use the camera instead see if I can
show<00:03:13.030> you<00:03:13.090> what<00:03:13.269> I<00:03:13.300> mean<00:03:13.390> let's<00:03:13.959> get<00:03:14.200> rid<00:03:14.380> of

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
show you what I mean let's get rid of

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.560 
show you what I mean let's get rid of
the<00:03:14.560> camera<00:03:14.950> here<00:03:15.280> because<00:03:16.150> I<00:03:16.209> don't<00:03:16.360> want<00:03:16.420> to

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
the camera here because I don't want to

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.360 
the camera here because I don't want to
confuse<00:03:16.720> you<00:03:16.989> and<00:03:17.170> have<00:03:17.380> you<00:03:17.410> say<00:03:17.680> hey<00:03:18.010> you're

confuse you and have you say hey you're

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.460 
confuse you and have you say hey you're
using<00:03:18.610> the<00:03:18.790> camera<00:03:19.000> know<00:03:19.959> what<00:03:20.200> I'm<00:03:20.290> talking

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.860 
using the camera know what I'm talking
about<00:03:20.680> here<00:03:21.070> is<00:03:21.120> you<00:03:22.120> see<00:03:22.299> I'm<00:03:22.480> moving<00:03:22.780> the

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
about here is you see I'm moving the

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.430 
about here is you see I'm moving the
background<00:03:24.959> let's<00:03:25.959> see<00:03:26.079> if<00:03:26.140> i<00:03:26.200> can<00:03:26.290> give<00:03:26.410> you

another<00:03:26.769> scene<00:03:27.130> you're<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.150> camera<00:03:28.769> see<00:03:29.769> i'm

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
another scene you're the camera see i'm

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.699 
another scene you're the camera see i'm
moving<00:03:30.820> the<00:03:30.940> background<00:03:31.390> a<00:03:31.510> bit<00:03:31.690> and<00:03:32.530> when<00:03:32.620> you

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
moving the background a bit and when you

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.490 
moving the background a bit and when you
add<00:03:32.829> the<00:03:32.950> camera<00:03:33.340> in<00:03:33.519> and<00:03:34.110> move<00:03:35.110> the<00:03:35.260> camera

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
add the camera in and move the camera

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.229 
add the camera in and move the camera
with<00:03:35.829> it<00:03:37.320> it<00:03:38.320> adds<00:03:38.799> a<00:03:38.980> bit<00:03:39.190> of<00:03:39.220> depth<00:03:39.700> of<00:03:39.850> field

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
with it it adds a bit of depth of field

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.720 
with it it adds a bit of depth of field
see<00:03:41.170> test<00:03:42.100> scene<00:03:43.650> it<00:03:44.650> doesn't<00:03:45.010> have<00:03:45.100> to<00:03:45.160> be<00:03:45.340> any

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
see test scene it doesn't have to be any

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.880 
see test scene it doesn't have to be any
kind<00:03:46.030> of<00:03:46.090> big<00:03:46.360> animation<00:03:46.810> or<00:03:47.470> anything<00:03:47.860> like

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
kind of big animation or anything like

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.250 
kind of big animation or anything like
that<00:03:48.150> by<00:03:49.150> the<00:03:49.209> way<00:03:49.329> that<00:03:49.510> moon<00:03:49.690> i<00:03:49.870> made<00:03:50.049> myself

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
that by the way that moon i made myself

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.750 
that by the way that moon i made myself
and<00:03:50.680> i<00:03:50.739> love<00:03:51.010> it<00:03:51.329> um<00:03:54.480> what<00:03:55.480> else<00:03:55.630> is<00:03:55.810> in<00:03:55.989> here<00:03:56.019> oh

and i love it um what else is in here oh
here's<00:03:57.760> another<00:03:58.000> thing<00:03:58.360> close-ups<00:03:59.200> extreme

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
here's another thing close-ups extreme

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.310 
here's another thing close-ups extreme
close-ups<00:04:00.640> you<00:04:01.510> have<00:04:01.630> to<00:04:01.750> be<00:04:01.840> very<00:04:01.870> careful

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
close-ups you have to be very careful

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.930 
close-ups you have to be very careful
with<00:04:02.590> these<00:04:02.709> and<00:04:02.980> actually<00:04:03.250> this<00:04:03.370> is<00:04:03.579> not<00:04:03.910> a

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
with these and actually this is not a

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.960 
with these and actually this is not a
good<00:04:04.120> example<00:04:04.630> of<00:04:04.720> that<00:04:05.130> but<00:04:06.130> as<00:04:06.579> you<00:04:06.700> can<00:04:06.790> see

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
good example of that but as you can see

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.580 
good example of that but as you can see
he<00:04:07.180> lifts<00:04:07.480> the<00:04:07.540> pig<00:04:07.840> it<00:04:08.049> puts<00:04:08.260> it<00:04:08.380> down<00:04:08.410> and

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
he lifts the pig it puts it down and

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.340 
he lifts the pig it puts it down and
smiles<00:04:09.160> this<00:04:09.700> is<00:04:09.850> a<00:04:09.880> bit<00:04:10.329> too<00:04:10.600> fast<00:04:10.900> i'm<00:04:11.230> going

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
smiles this is a bit too fast i'm going

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.449 
smiles this is a bit too fast i'm going
to<00:04:11.440> have<00:04:11.530> to<00:04:11.560> fix<00:04:11.799> it<00:04:11.950> sooner<00:04:12.220> or<00:04:12.250> later<00:04:14.459> though

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
to have to fix it sooner or later though

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.430 
to have to fix it sooner or later though
it<00:04:15.850> probably<00:04:16.090> won't<00:04:16.539> be<00:04:16.630> that<00:04:16.930> bad<00:04:17.109> when<00:04:17.410> i

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
it probably won't be that bad when i

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.690
