confused<00:00:17.619> by<00:00:17.860> this<00:00:17.920> issue<00:00:18.279> but<00:00:18.670> actually<00:00:19.090> it's

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
confused by this issue but actually it's

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.720 
confused by this issue but actually it's
less<00:00:19.480> complex<00:00:19.960> than<00:00:20.140> it<00:00:20.320> sounds<00:00:20.830> and<00:00:21.039> once<00:00:21.640> you

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:21.730 
less complex than it sounds and once you

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.020 
less complex than it sounds and once you
understand<00:00:22.300> it<00:00:22.539> you're<00:00:23.110> well<00:00:23.440> on<00:00:23.470> the<00:00:23.650> way<00:00:23.770> to

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:24.030 
understand it you're well on the way to

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.110 
understand it you're well on the way to
analyzing<00:00:25.030> companies<00:00:25.750> successfully<00:00:27.120> so

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:28.120 
analyzing companies successfully so

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.730 
analyzing companies successfully so
probably<00:00:28.390> the<00:00:28.510> easiest<00:00:28.870> way<00:00:29.050> to<00:00:29.110> explain<00:00:29.560> this

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 
probably the easiest way to explain this

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.490 
probably the easiest way to explain this
is<00:00:29.800> to<00:00:29.950> start<00:00:30.310> looking<00:00:30.520> at<00:00:30.880> an<00:00:30.970> example<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:32.320> I'm

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
is to start looking at an example so I'm

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.200 
is to start looking at an example so I'm
going<00:00:32.710> to<00:00:32.770> look<00:00:32.920> at<00:00:33.010> an<00:00:33.160> imaginary<00:00:33.520> business

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
at the end of the month and you might

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.910 
at the end of the month and you might
think<00:01:19.899> you<00:01:20.020> might<00:01:20.229> think<00:01:20.439> well<00:01:20.560> that's<00:01:20.710> easy

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
think you might think well that's easy

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.889 
think you might think well that's easy
then<00:01:21.189> the<00:01:21.549> restaurant<00:01:21.969> made<00:01:22.060> a<00:01:22.090> profit<00:01:22.479> of<00:01:22.600> ten

thousand<00:01:23.380> pounds<00:01:23.710> in<00:01:23.829> August<00:01:24.280> but<00:01:25.060> actually

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
thousand pounds in August but actually

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.889 
thousand pounds in August but actually
you'd<00:01:25.719> be<00:01:25.899> wrong<00:01:26.229> this<00:01:27.130> figure<00:01:27.430> is<00:01:27.789> cash<00:01:28.539> flow

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
you'd be wrong this figure is cash flow

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.380 
you'd be wrong this figure is cash flow
that's<00:01:29.229> how<00:01:29.560> much<00:01:29.770> cash<00:01:30.250> the<00:01:30.969> business

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
that's how much cash the business

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.319 
that's how much cash the business
generated<00:01:32.140> in<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.530> month<00:01:32.770> of<00:01:32.979> August<00:01:33.670> but

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
generated in the month of August but

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:36.690 
generated in the month of August but
profit<00:01:34.840> is<00:01:35.020> a<00:01:35.049> different<00:01:35.679> figure<00:01:35.920> and<00:01:36.280> it's

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
profit is a different figure and it's

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.330 
profit is a different figure and it's
drawn<00:01:37.060> up<00:01:37.299> under<00:01:37.479> calculations<00:01:38.469> approved<00:01:39.100> by

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
drawn up under calculations approved by

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.660 
drawn up under calculations approved by
accountants<00:01:40.000> and<00:01:40.210> financial<00:01:40.439> regulators<00:01:41.670> so

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
accountants and financial regulators so

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.580 
accountants and financial regulators so
let's<00:01:42.909> look<00:01:43.149> at<00:01:43.270> let's<00:01:43.509> look<00:01:43.719> at<00:01:43.840> September

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
let's look at let's look at September

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.590 
let's look at let's look at September
for<00:01:45.039> this<00:01:45.159> business<00:01:45.399> and<00:01:45.759> see<00:01:46.240> how<00:01:46.390> things

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
for this business and see how things

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.929 
for this business and see how things
went<00:01:46.840> then<00:01:47.170> and<00:01:47.409> we<00:01:47.979> can<00:01:48.159> then<00:01:48.369> it'll<00:01:48.880> be

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
went then and we can then it'll be

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.149 
went then and we can then it'll be
easier<00:01:49.509> with<00:01:49.659> these<00:01:49.810> numbers<00:01:50.380> to<00:01:50.530> explain<00:01:50.979> the

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
easier with these numbers to explain the

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.050 
easier with these numbers to explain the
difference<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.780> once<00:01:52.960> again<00:01:53.350> a<00:01:54.060> hundred

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
difference so once again a hundred

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.120 
difference so once again a hundred
thousand<00:01:55.479> pounds<00:01:55.630> came<00:01:56.320> into<00:01:56.560> the

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
thousand pounds came into the

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.940 
thousand pounds came into the
restaurants<00:01:57.579> bank<00:01:57.759> account<00:01:58.090> in<00:01:58.240> September

restaurants bank account in September

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.249 
restaurants bank account in September
but<00:01:59.950> this<00:02:00.609> figure<00:02:00.999> is<00:02:01.179> very<00:02:01.210> different<00:02:02.020> but

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
but this figure is very different but

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.440 
but this figure is very different but
all<00:02:02.409> the<00:02:02.560> normal<00:02:02.950> costs<00:02:03.399> the<00:02:03.579> wages<00:02:04.119> and<00:02:04.359> the

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
all the normal costs the wages and the

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.179 
all the normal costs the wages and the
rent<00:02:04.689> and<00:02:04.899> all<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:05.140> rest<00:02:05.319> of<00:02:05.469> it<00:02:05.590> but<00:02:06.069> there

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
rent and all the rest of it but there

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.850 
rent and all the rest of it but there
was<00:02:06.280> also<00:02:06.429> one<00:02:06.819> big<00:02:07.210> one-off<00:02:07.689> cost<00:02:07.960> which<00:02:08.710> was

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
was also one big one-off cost which was

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.100 
was also one big one-off cost which was
a<00:02:08.920> new<00:02:09.250> oven<00:02:09.550> that<00:02:10.179> the<00:02:10.270> business<00:02:10.630> needed<00:02:11.020> or

some<00:02:11.260> new<00:02:11.470> ovens<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:11.950> business<00:02:12.310> needed<00:02:12.520> and

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
some new ovens the business needed and

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.110 
some new ovens the business needed and
they<00:02:13.600> cost<00:02:14.160> fifty<00:02:15.160> thousand<00:02:15.670> pounds<00:02:15.820> they

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
they cost fifty thousand pounds they

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.240 
they cost fifty thousand pounds they
cost<00:02:16.330> sixty<00:02:16.750> thousand<00:02:17.170> pounds<00:02:17.650> so<00:02:18.070> we've<00:02:18.160> got

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
cost sixty thousand pounds so we've got

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.220 
cost sixty thousand pounds so we've got
ninety<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.850> normal<00:02:19.180> cost

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
ninety the normal cost

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.630 
ninety the normal cost
last<00:02:20.379> sixty<00:02:20.830> thousand<00:02:21.280> pounds<00:02:21.610> for<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.849> oven

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
last sixty thousand pounds for the oven

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.550 
last sixty thousand pounds for the oven
that's<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:25.030> hundred<00:02:25.360> and<00:02:25.599> fifty<00:02:26.049> thousand

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
that's a hundred and fifty thousand

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.369 
that's a hundred and fifty thousand
pounds<00:02:27.069> so<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:29.590> difference<00:02:30.040> is<00:02:30.480> minus<00:02:31.480> fifty

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
pounds so the difference is minus fifty

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:35.180 
pounds so the difference is minus fifty
thousand<00:02:32.890> pounds<00:02:33.400> so<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.269> business<00:02:34.690> burned

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
thousand pounds so the business burned

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.990 
thousand pounds so the business burned
50,000<00:02:36.190> pounds<00:02:36.519> of<00:02:36.610> cash<00:02:36.879> in<00:02:37.090> September<00:02:37.750> but

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
50,000 pounds of cash in September but

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.610 
50,000 pounds of cash in September but
using<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.120> accounting<00:02:40.750> conventions<00:02:40.989> the

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
using the accounting conventions the

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.100 
using the accounting conventions the
accounting<00:02:42.069> rules<00:02:42.340> it<00:02:42.760> did<00:02:43.180> not<00:02:43.360> make<00:02:43.569> a<00:02:43.629> loss

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
accounting rules it did not make a loss

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.280 
accounting rules it did not make a loss
of<00:02:44.440> fifty<00:02:44.950> thousand<00:02:45.400> pounds<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:45.970> loss<00:02:46.660> or<00:02:46.989> the

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
of fifty thousand pounds the loss or the

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.160 
of fifty thousand pounds the loss or the
profit<00:02:47.739> was<00:02:48.220> actually<00:02:48.790> very<00:02:49.209> different<00:02:49.659> so

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
profit was actually very different so

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.780 
profit was actually very different so
let's<00:02:50.440> look<00:02:52.379> at<00:02:53.379> the<00:02:53.560> profit<00:02:53.950> in<00:02:54.099> loss<00:02:54.340> figure

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
let's look at the profit in loss figure

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.520 
let's look at the profit in loss figure
for<00:02:55.180> September<00:02:55.890> once<00:02:56.890> again<00:02:57.989> we've<00:02:58.989> got<00:02:59.019> a

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
for September once again we've got a

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.190 
for September once again we've got a
hundred<00:03:00.069> thousand<00:03:00.579> coming<00:03:01.180> in<00:03:01.359> and<00:03:01.660> we've<00:03:02.170> got

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
hundred thousand coming in and we've got

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.849 
hundred thousand coming in and we've got
those<00:03:02.470> normal<00:03:03.010> costs<00:03:03.519> of<00:03:03.670> ninety<00:03:04.599> but<00:03:05.560> what<00:03:05.769> do

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
those normal costs of ninety but what do

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:08.550 
those normal costs of ninety but what do
we<00:03:05.920> do<00:03:06.220> with<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:06.790> cost<00:03:07.060> of<00:03:07.239> the<00:03:07.359> ovens<00:03:07.750> well<00:03:08.410> we

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
we do with the cost of the ovens well we

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.640 
we do with the cost of the ovens well we
do<00:03:08.739> what's<00:03:08.980> known<00:03:09.190> as<00:03:09.450> depreciation<00:03:10.470> and<00:03:11.470> so

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
do what's known as depreciation and so

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.440 
do what's known as depreciation and so
roughly<00:03:12.069> speaking<00:03:12.340> I<00:03:12.760> probably<00:03:13.000> won't<00:03:13.209> need

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
roughly speaking I probably won't need

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.500 
roughly speaking I probably won't need
to<00:03:13.569> buy<00:03:13.750> new<00:03:13.780> ovens<00:03:14.319> for<00:03:14.560> at<00:03:14.680> least<00:03:14.829> five<00:03:15.220> years

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
to buy new ovens for at least five years

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.180 
to buy new ovens for at least five years
so<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:16.690> accounting<00:03:17.140> rules<00:03:17.410> say<00:03:17.650> we'll<00:03:17.829> find

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
so the accounting rules say we'll find

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.509 
so the accounting rules say we'll find
we<00:03:18.459> depreciate<00:03:19.299> that<00:03:19.329> cost<00:03:20.010> so<00:03:21.010> this<00:03:21.310> is<00:03:21.489> a

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
we depreciate that cost so this is a

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.190 
we depreciate that cost so this is a
cost<00:03:21.849> that's<00:03:22.060> effectively<00:03:22.690> going<00:03:23.019> to<00:03:23.109> be

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
cost that's effectively going to be

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.839 
cost that's effectively going to be
affecting<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.799> business<00:03:23.920> for<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.370> next<00:03:24.609> five

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
affecting the business for the next five

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.240 
affecting the business for the next five
years<00:03:25.180> that's<00:03:25.450> sixty<00:03:26.049> months<00:03:26.230> the<00:03:26.980> one-off

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
years that's sixty months the one-off

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.240 
years that's sixty months the one-off
cost<00:03:27.639> was<00:03:27.910> sixty<00:03:28.329> thousand<00:03:28.780> pounds<00:03:29.319> so<00:03:29.919> we<00:03:30.099> can

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
cost was sixty thousand pounds so we can

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.559 
cost was sixty thousand pounds so we can
depreciate<00:03:30.760> this<00:03:31.450> cost<00:03:31.810> at<00:03:32.760> 1,000<00:03:33.760> pounds<00:03:34.120> a

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
depreciate this cost at 1,000 pounds a

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.379 
depreciate this cost at 1,000 pounds a
month<00:03:35.010> so<00:03:36.010> suddenly<00:03:36.549> the<00:03:36.790> costs<00:03:37.180> for<00:03:37.329> the

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
month so suddenly the costs for the

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:40.199 
month so suddenly the costs for the
business<00:03:37.900> and<00:03:38.109> ninety<00:03:38.590> thousand<00:03:39.069> pounds<00:03:39.489> plus

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
business and ninety thousand pounds plus

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.970 
business and ninety thousand pounds plus
one<00:03:40.569> thousand<00:03:41.109> pounds<00:03:41.760> which<00:03:42.760> is<00:03:42.870> 91<00:03:43.980> thousand

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
one thousand pounds which is 91 thousand

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.430 
one thousand pounds which is 91 thousand
pounds<00:03:45.609> for<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.060> month<00:03:46.359> and<00:03:46.780> that's<00:03:47.049> because

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
pounds for the month and that's because

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.379 
pounds for the month and that's because
we're<00:03:47.560> doing<00:03:47.709> this<00:03:47.880> depreciation<00:03:48.910> we're

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
we're doing this depreciation we're

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.870 
we're doing this depreciation we're
depreciating<00:03:50.290> the<00:03:50.319> value<00:03:50.799> of<00:03:50.889> the<00:03:51.010> ovens<00:03:51.340> over

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
depreciating the value of the ovens over

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.809 
depreciating the value of the ovens over
a<00:03:51.910> period<00:03:52.239> of<00:03:52.510> five<00:03:52.810> years<00:03:53.260> and<00:03:53.530> so<00:03:54.519> suddenly

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
a period of five years and so suddenly

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.740 
a period of five years and so suddenly
the<00:03:55.389> profit<00:03:56.169> in<00:03:56.709> the<00:03:57.310> month<00:03:57.549> of<00:03:57.790> September<00:03:58.090> is

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
the profit in the month of September is

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.259 
the profit in the month of September is
nine<00:03:59.139> thousand<00:03:59.859> pounds<00:04:00.280> remember<00:04:01.030> in

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
nine thousand pounds remember in

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.229 
nine thousand pounds remember in
September<00:04:01.930> we<00:04:02.109> burned<00:04:02.590> in<00:04:03.489> terms<00:04:03.790> of<00:04:03.940> cash

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
September we burned in terms of cash

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.289 
September we burned in terms of cash
flow<00:04:04.269> we<00:04:05.230> burned<00:04:05.530> fifty<00:04:06.160> thousand<00:04:06.669> pounds<00:04:07.150> but

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
flow we burned fifty thousand pounds but

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.150 
flow we burned fifty thousand pounds but
that's<00:04:07.900> not<00:04:08.139> a<00:04:08.169> good<00:04:08.379> figure<00:04:08.680> to<00:04:08.799> look<00:04:08.980> at

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
that's not a good figure to look at

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.030 
that's not a good figure to look at
because<00:04:09.700> that<00:04:10.030> was<00:04:10.150> a<00:04:10.180> one-off<00:04:10.569> cost<00:04:11.109> this<00:04:11.980> is

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
because that was a one-off cost this is

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.830 
because that was a one-off cost this is
a<00:04:12.250> much<00:04:12.519> more<00:04:12.730> realistic<00:04:13.209> figure

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
a much more realistic figure

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.529 
a much more realistic figure
this<00:04:14.169> nine<00:04:14.500> thousand<00:04:15.099> pounds<00:04:15.459> profit<00:04:15.790> and<00:04:16.180> it

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
this nine thousand pounds profit and it

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:18.060 
this nine thousand pounds profit and it
gives<00:04:16.720> you<00:04:16.840> a<00:04:16.870> better<00:04:17.139> idea<00:04:17.530> of<00:04:17.799> the

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
gives you a better idea of the

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.640 
gives you a better idea of the
underlying<00:04:18.609> health<00:04:18.940> of<00:04:19.239> the<00:04:19.389> business<00:04:19.650> now

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
underlying health of the business now

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.050 
underlying health of the business now
depreciation<00:04:21.549> that's<00:04:21.729> not<00:04:21.910> the<00:04:22.030> only

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
depreciation that's not the only

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.850 
depreciation that's not the only
difference<00:04:22.389> between<00:04:22.720> profit<00:04:23.110> and<00:04:23.410> loss<00:04:23.590> and

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
difference between profit and loss and

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.700

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
the cash goes out of the bank account so

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.380 
the cash goes out of the bank account so
that's<00:05:15.010> a<00:05:15.130> very<00:05:15.310> quick<00:05:15.640> overview<00:05:15.670> at<00:05:16.300> how

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
that's a very quick overview at how

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.870 
that's a very quick overview at how
profit<00:05:16.900> and<00:05:17.020> loss<00:05:17.200> works<00:05:17.590> and<00:05:18.340> since<00:05:18.730> I've

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
profit and loss works and since I've

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.300 
profit and loss works and since I've
said<00:05:19.030> profit<00:05:19.480> and<00:05:19.600> loss<00:05:19.840> gives<00:05:20.740> you<00:05:20.860> a<00:05:20.890> really

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
said profit and loss gives you a really

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.060 
said profit and loss gives you a really
good<00:05:21.460> idea<00:05:21.520> of<00:05:21.910> the<00:05:22.030> underlying<00:05:22.810> how<00:05:23.740> aren't

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
good idea of the underlying how aren't

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.710 
good idea of the underlying how aren't
the<00:05:24.280> underlying<00:05:24.730> performance<00:05:25.000> of<00:05:25.630> the

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
the underlying performance of the

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.110 
the underlying performance of the
business<00:05:25.900> you<00:05:26.890> might<00:05:27.130> think<00:05:27.400> that<00:05:27.460> profit<00:05:28.000> and

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
business you might think that profit and

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.690 
business you might think that profit and
loss<00:05:28.360> is<00:05:28.690> the<00:05:28.870> best<00:05:29.170> thing<00:05:29.500> to<00:05:29.530> focus<00:05:29.890> on<00:05:30.280> and

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
loss is the best thing to focus on and

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.240 
loss is the best thing to focus on and
you<00:05:31.270> certainly<00:05:31.660> do<00:05:31.930> need<00:05:32.170> to<00:05:32.290> focus<00:05:32.500> on<00:05:32.860> profit

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
you certainly do need to focus on profit

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.670 
you certainly do need to focus on profit
and<00:05:33.400> loss<00:05:33.550> but<00:05:34.360> it's<00:05:34.600> a<00:05:34.660> bit<00:05:34.810> of<00:05:34.840> a<00:05:34.990> cop-out<00:05:35.380> you

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
and loss but it's a bit of a cop-out you

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.630 
and loss but it's a bit of a cop-out you
also<00:05:36.010> need<00:05:36.490> to<00:05:36.520> focus<00:05:36.850> on<00:05:37.240> cash<00:05:37.540> flow<00:05:37.840> as<00:05:38.110> well

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:38.640 
also need to focus on cash flow as well

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.850 
also need to focus on cash flow as well
and<00:05:39.640> that's<00:05:39.820> because<00:05:40.350> profit<00:05:41.350> and<00:05:41.470> loss<00:05:41.620> can

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
and that's because profit and loss can

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.610 
and that's because profit and loss can
easily<00:05:42.550> be<00:05:42.730> massaged<00:05:43.360> by<00:05:43.410> accountants<00:05:44.410> and

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
easily be massaged by accountants and

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.010 
easily be massaged by accountants and
Finance<00:05:45.130> directors<00:05:45.700> to<00:05:46.180> make<00:05:46.420> the<00:05:46.600> numbers

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
Finance directors to make the numbers

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.780 
Finance directors to make the numbers
look<00:05:47.260> good<00:05:47.500> there's<00:05:47.770> quite<00:05:48.040> a<00:05:48.070> lot<00:05:48.670> of

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790 
look good there's quite a lot of

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.540 
look good there's quite a lot of
flexibility<00:05:49.630> in<00:05:49.960> the<00:05:50.440> figures<00:05:50.800> of<00:05:51.010> profit<00:05:51.400> and

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
flexibility in the figures of profit and

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.240 
flexibility in the figures of profit and
loss<00:05:51.900> there's<00:05:52.900> also<00:05:53.050> some<00:05:53.440> flexibility<00:05:54.220> in

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
loss there's also some flexibility in

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.820 
loss there's also some flexibility in
cash<00:05:54.550> as<00:05:54.760> well<00:05:54.940> but<00:05:55.150> it's<00:05:55.300> harder<00:05:55.900> to<00:05:55.930> massage

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
cash as well but it's harder to massage

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.980 
cash as well but it's harder to massage
the<00:05:57.070> cash<00:05:57.310> figures<00:05:57.790> so<00:05:58.300> you<00:05:58.360> really<00:05:58.750> need<00:05:58.900> to

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
the cash figures so you really need to

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.660 
the cash figures so you really need to
look<00:05:59.110> at<00:05:59.260> cash<00:05:59.470> as<00:05:59.650> well<00:05:59.830> as<00:05:59.980> profit<00:06:00.340> and<00:06:00.490> loss

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:00.670 
look at cash as well as profit and loss

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:03.660 
look at cash as well as profit and loss
and<00:06:01.180> all<00:06:01.600> say<00:06:02.110> cash<00:06:02.650> can<00:06:02.950> give<00:06:03.130> you<00:06:03.250> a<00:06:03.310> really

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:03.670 
and all say cash can give you a really

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.030 
and all say cash can give you a really
big<00:06:03.700> sort<00:06:04.060> of<00:06:04.120> warning<00:06:04.660> signal<00:06:05.200> that<00:06:05.860> there

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.040 
big sort of warning signal that there

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.460 
big sort of warning signal that there
are<00:06:06.070> problems<00:06:06.700> with<00:06:06.820> a<00:06:06.970> business<00:06:07.480> if<00:06:07.750> you're

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
are problems with a business if you're

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.140 
are problems with a business if you're
seeing<00:06:08.830> that<00:06:08.950> cash<00:06:09.280> isn't<00:06:09.580> just<00:06:09.730> being<00:06:09.880> burnt

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
seeing that cash isn't just being burnt

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.270 
seeing that cash isn't just being burnt
in<00:06:10.330> one<00:06:10.570> month<00:06:10.900> well<00:06:11.500> like<00:06:11.650> when<00:06:11.830> the<00:06:11.950> new<00:06:12.100> oven

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 
in one month well like when the new oven
