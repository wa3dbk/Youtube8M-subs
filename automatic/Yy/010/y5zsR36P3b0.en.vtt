they come to this situation they'll

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.700 
they come to this situation they'll
actually<00:00:18.990> sit<00:00:19.230> down

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
actually sit down

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.650 
actually sit down
steer<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.279> through<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.640> trees<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.210> then

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
steer it through the trees and then

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.599 
steer it through the trees and then
stand<00:00:21.930> back<00:00:22.109> up<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.439> proceed<00:00:22.740> on<00:00:22.859> in<00:00:23.130> my

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
stand back up and proceed on in my

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.580 
stand back up and proceed on in my
opinion<00:00:24.150> okay<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.900> can<00:00:25.170> get<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.380> done<00:00:25.529> that

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
opinion okay you can get it done that

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.390 
opinion okay you can get it done that
way<00:00:25.890> yes

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
way yes

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.300 
way yes
but<00:00:26.820> it's<00:00:27.090> actually<00:00:27.810> easier<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.590> quicker<00:00:29.099> to

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
but it's actually easier and quicker to

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.640 
but it's actually easier and quicker to
stand<00:00:29.699> now<00:00:30.300> only<00:00:30.480> maybe<00:00:30.810> only<00:00:31.109> be<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.230> quarter

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
stand now only maybe only be a quarter

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.920 
stand now only maybe only be a quarter
to<00:00:31.890> an<00:00:31.980> eighth<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.369> second<00:00:32.669> faster<00:00:33.090> but<00:00:33.780> it

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
to an eighth of a second faster but it

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.569 
to an eighth of a second faster but it
is<00:00:34.079> faster<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.860> reason<00:00:35.280> being<00:00:35.399> is

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
is faster and the reason being is

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.950 
is faster and the reason being is
because<00:00:35.730> when<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.030> stand<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.600> can<00:00:36.719> utilize

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
because when you stand you can utilize

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.979 
because when you stand you can utilize
more<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.829> your<00:00:38.010> leg<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.640> it's<00:00:39.570> like<00:00:39.690> he's<00:00:39.870> gonna

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
more of your leg so it's like he's gonna

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.360 
more of your leg so it's like he's gonna
wrench<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.469> long<00:00:40.680> versus<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.160> wrench<00:00:41.340> that

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
wrench this long versus a wrench that

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.770 
wrench this long versus a wrench that
long<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.820> have<00:00:41.940> more<00:00:42.120> leverage<00:00:42.360> because<00:00:42.690> you

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
long you have more leverage because you

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.500 
long you have more leverage because you
put<00:00:42.960> your<00:00:43.110> legs<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:43.800> play<00:00:44.040> now<00:00:44.879> coming<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.329> here

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
put your legs in play now coming in here

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.990 
put your legs in play now coming in here
standing<00:00:46.110> my<00:00:46.890> front<00:00:47.219> wheel<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.610> going<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.820> stay

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
standing my front wheel is going to stay

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.080 
standing my front wheel is going to stay
centered<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.809> center<00:00:49.110> rut<00:00:49.640> I'm<00:00:50.640> going<00:00:50.969> to

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
centered in the center rut I'm going to

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.700 
centered in the center rut I'm going to
avoid<00:00:51.300> contact<00:00:51.750> with<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.960> first<00:00:52.170> tree<00:00:52.410> here

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
avoid contact with the first tree here

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.040 
avoid contact with the first tree here
just<00:00:53.250> by<00:00:53.399> mostly<00:00:53.879> doing<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.420> motion<00:00:54.809> with<00:00:54.930> my

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
just by mostly doing this motion with my

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.200 
just by mostly doing this motion with my
legs<00:00:55.260> just<00:00:55.710> pushing<00:00:56.010> my<00:00:56.129> bike<00:00:56.280> over<00:00:56.489> there<00:00:56.969> for

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
legs just pushing my bike over there for

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.610 
legs just pushing my bike over there for
my<00:00:57.420> hand<00:00:57.660> guard<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:57.960> gonna<00:00:58.079> void<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.320> tree

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
my hand guard is gonna void the tree

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.010 
my hand guard is gonna void the tree
with<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.829> wheel<00:00:59.070> still<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.520> main<00:00:59.670> rut

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
with the wheel still in the main rut

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.360 
with the wheel still in the main rut
then<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.170> avoid<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.559> next<00:01:01.829> tree<00:01:02.010> I'm<00:01:02.160> gonna<00:01:02.219> do

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
then to avoid the next tree I'm gonna do

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.619 
then to avoid the next tree I'm gonna do
the<00:01:02.460> same<00:01:02.609> thing<00:01:02.670> it's<00:01:03.030> still<00:01:03.239> gonna<00:01:03.359> be<00:01:03.449> lined

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
the same thing it's still gonna be lined

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.090 
the same thing it's still gonna be lined
up<00:01:03.809> with<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.229> I'm<00:01:04.290> just<00:01:04.320> leaning<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.070> bike

utilizing<00:01:11.700> more<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.939> my<00:01:12.030> leg<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.420> might<00:01:12.750> have<00:01:13.080> to

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
utilizing more of my leg I might have to

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.929 
utilizing more of my leg I might have to
put<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> slight<00:01:13.770> steer<00:01:14.159> into<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.490> but<00:01:14.610> not<00:01:14.670> as

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
put a slight steer into it but not as

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.429

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
sitting okay let's uh still it becomes a

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.570 
sitting okay let's uh still it becomes a
lot<00:01:22.350> about<00:01:22.530> wheel<00:01:22.740> placement<00:01:23.189> which<00:01:23.369> we

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
lot about wheel placement which we

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.789 
lot about wheel placement which we
already<00:01:23.850> discussed<00:01:24.320> wheel<00:01:25.320> placement

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
already discussed wheel placement

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.320 
already discussed wheel placement
sitting<00:01:26.250> you'll<00:01:26.490> have<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.820> actually<00:01:27.119> steer

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
sitting you'll have to actually steer

sitting you'll have to actually steer
the<00:01:27.420> front<00:01:27.630> wheel<00:01:27.750> here<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.500> avoid<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.799> tree

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
the front wheel here to avoid the tree

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.069 
the front wheel here to avoid the tree
here<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.490> then<00:01:29.759> steer<00:01:30.030> back<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.600> lot<00:01:30.840> more

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
here and then steer back so a lot more

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.960 
here and then steer back so a lot more
steering<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.740> going<00:01:32.040> on<00:01:32.189> wheel<00:01:32.430> placement<00:01:32.880> to

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
steering is going on wheel placement to

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.649 
steering is going on wheel placement to
avoid<00:01:33.180> contact<00:01:33.750> with<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.140> tree<00:01:35.030> okay<00:01:36.030> in<00:01:36.240> my

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
avoid contact with the tree okay in my

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.020 
avoid contact with the tree okay in my
opinion<00:01:37.110> what<00:01:37.439> I'm<00:01:37.530> getting<00:01:37.799> at<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.030> sitting

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
opinion what I'm getting at is sitting

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.649 
opinion what I'm getting at is sitting
versus<00:01:39.329> standing<00:01:40.009> sitting<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.479> you<00:01:42.479> know<00:01:42.600> you

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
versus standing sitting is you know you

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.630 
versus standing sitting is you know you
can<00:01:42.869> get<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.110> done<00:01:43.320> but<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:43.860> my<00:01:44.009> opinion<00:01:44.430> it's<00:01:44.579> a

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
can get it done but in my opinion it's a

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.580 
can get it done but in my opinion it's a
lot<00:01:44.790> faster<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.329> stand<00:01:45.780> when<00:01:46.110> trails<00:01:46.350> get

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
lot faster to stand when trails get

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.160 
lot faster to stand when trails get
tight<00:01:47.090> when<00:01:48.090> you're<00:01:48.210> standing<00:01:48.450> but<00:01:48.869> there<00:01:49.049> is

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
tight when you're standing but there is

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.899 
tight when you're standing but there is
an<00:01:49.290> exception<00:01:49.619> because<00:01:49.860> I've<00:01:50.430> grown<00:01:50.610> up<00:01:50.700> in

through<00:01:57.540> tight<00:01:57.780> trees<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.229> would<00:01:58.350> stand<00:01:58.640> South
