was a little bit better I would feel a

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.570 
was a little bit better I would feel a
little<00:03:16.709> more<00:03:16.800> comfortable<00:03:17.130> maybe<00:03:17.310> even

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
little more comfortable maybe even

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.580 
little more comfortable maybe even

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
in Division one and one more victory and

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.580 
in Division one and one more victory and
I<00:03:45.209> would<00:03:45.450> have<00:03:45.570> actually<00:03:45.690> won<00:03:46.110> the<00:03:46.230> division

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
I would have actually won the division

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.080 
I would have actually won the division
and<00:03:46.770> they<00:03:47.160> didn't<00:03:47.370> give<00:03:47.459> me<00:03:47.550> that<00:03:47.640> game<00:03:47.850> so<00:03:48.060> I

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
and they didn't give me that game so I

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.699 
and they didn't give me that game so I
don't<00:03:48.270> know<00:03:48.330> what<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.660> deal<00:03:48.810> was<00:03:48.840> I<00:03:49.200> only

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
don't know what the deal was I only

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.400 
don't know what the deal was I only
scored<00:03:50.040> 13<00:03:50.370> goals<00:03:50.400> but<00:03:50.910> as<00:03:51.540> a<00:03:51.570> plus<00:03:51.959> I<00:03:52.200> only

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410

scored 13 goals but as a plus I only
conceded<00:03:52.920> seven<00:03:53.310> so<00:03:54.150> I<00:03:54.540> might<00:03:54.720> have<00:03:54.870> just<00:03:54.959> had

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
conceded seven so I might have just had

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.320
