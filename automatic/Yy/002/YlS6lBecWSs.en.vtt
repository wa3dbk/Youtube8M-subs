it's the factory replacement part you

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:32.860 
it's the factory replacement part you
can<00:00:31.400> also<00:00:31.490> get<00:00:31.759> a<00:00:31.789> generic<00:00:32.119> one<00:00:32.360> and<00:00:32.509> online

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
can also get a generic one and online

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.780

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.439 

I<00:00:40.620> basically<00:00:41.550> just<00:00:41.640> slide<00:00:41.969> right<00:00:42.149> over<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
I basically just slide right over the

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.689 
I basically just slide right over the
footpad<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:44.039> just<00:00:44.250> have<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.519> kind<00:00:44.670> of

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
footpad and you just have to kind of

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.139 
footpad and you just have to kind of
work<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.030> out<00:00:46.250> and<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.460> comes<00:00:47.610> right<00:00:47.699> off<00:00:47.820> when

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
work it out and it comes right off when

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.660 
work it out and it comes right off when
you<00:00:48.239> get<00:00:48.329> over<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.750> lip<00:00:50.960> it<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.019> marked<00:00:52.379> top

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
you get over that lip it is marked top

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.889 
you get over that lip it is marked top
to<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.760> bottom<00:00:53.909> and<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.329> can<00:00:54.390> tell<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.690> time

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
to the bottom and you can tell the time

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.759 
to the bottom and you can tell the time
could<00:00:55.079> ask<00:00:55.379> me<00:00:56.600> fins<00:00:57.600> on<00:00:57.870> top<00:00:58.140> here<00:00:58.469> I'm<00:00:58.649> gonna

yeah same concept you just slip it over
the<00:01:01.979> lip<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.519> work<00:01:02.670> your<00:01:02.820> way<00:01:02.850> around<00:01:03.259> and

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
the lip and you work your way around and

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:05.570 
the lip and you work your way around and
she's<00:01:04.409> gone<00:01:04.559> fairly<00:01:04.890> easy<00:01:05.190> all<00:01:05.399> the<00:01:05.489> way

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
she's gone fairly easy all the way

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.960 
she's gone fairly easy all the way
around<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:06.930> cleaners<00:01:07.380> foot<00:01:07.710> pad<00:01:07.950> takes<00:01:08.789> a

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
around the cleaners foot pad takes a

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.190 
around the cleaners foot pad takes a
little<00:01:09.210> bit<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.360> effort<00:01:09.450> but<00:01:09.780> it's<00:01:09.930> really

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
little bit of effort but it's really

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.249 
little bit of effort but it's really
easy<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:11.070> was<00:01:11.190> ready<00:01:11.399> to<00:01:11.430> go<00:01:11.580> back<00:01:11.759> in<00:01:12.259> and

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
easy that was ready to go back in and

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:14.450 
easy that was ready to go back in and
now<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.409> cleaner<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.800> as<00:01:13.890> good<00:01:14.009> as<00:01:14.159> new<00:01:14.190> and

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
now the cleaner is as good as new and

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.740 
now the cleaner is as good as new and
it's<00:01:14.610> moving<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.909> actually<00:01:15.240> worth<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.570> clean

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
it's moving it actually worth to clean

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:23.720 
it's moving it actually worth to clean
the<00:01:15.869> pool<00:01:16.050> really<00:01:16.200> well<00:01:16.440> now

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.690 

this<00:01:24.510> is<00:01:24.690> a<00:01:24.720> generic<00:01:25.140> thin<00:01:25.500> disc<00:01:26.600> cell<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:28.700> it

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
this is a generic thin disc cell and it

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.360 
this is a generic thin disc cell and it
feels<00:01:29.940> about<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.240> same<00:01:30.390> as<00:01:30.660> the<00:01:31.370> zodiac

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
feels about the same as the zodiac

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.660 
feels about the same as the zodiac
there's<00:01:33.210> an<00:01:33.330> actual<00:01:33.540> g4<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.770> distance<00:01:35.370> almost

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
there's an actual g4 in distance almost

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.400 
there's an actual g4 in distance almost
the<00:01:35.730> same<00:01:35.910> dimensions<00:01:37.670> and<00:01:38.670> here's<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.060> g2<00:01:39.540> g3

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
the same dimensions and here's the g2 g3

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.380 
the same dimensions and here's the g2 g3
fin<00:01:40.920> disc<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.640> again<00:01:41.910> has<00:01:42.000> similar

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
fin disc and again has similar

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.080 
fin disc and again has similar
dimensions<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.700> first<00:01:44.910> thing<00:01:45.000> you'll

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
dimensions and the first thing you'll

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.400 
dimensions and the first thing you'll
notice<00:01:45.210> about<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:45.660> generic<00:01:45.990> when<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.260> is

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
notice about this generic when it is

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.660 
notice about this generic when it is
pretty<00:01:46.650> thick<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:47.130> I'm<00:01:47.190> gonna<00:01:47.280> see<00:01:47.430> how<00:01:47.550> it

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
pretty thick so I'm gonna see how it

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.120 
pretty thick so I'm gonna see how it
works<00:01:47.910> on<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.330> cleaner<00:01:48.800> it<00:01:49.800> was<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.950> little

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
works on the cleaner it was a little

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.380 
works on the cleaner it was a little
harder<00:01:50.370> to<00:01:50.430> get<00:01:50.550> on<00:01:50.670> because<00:01:50.760> it<00:01:50.940> is<00:01:50.970> stiffer

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
harder to get on because it is stiffer

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.140 
harder to get on because it is stiffer
but<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.770> pretty<00:01:53.010> thick<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.760> let's<00:01:53.940> see<00:01:54.030> how

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
but it is pretty thick so let's see how

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.080 
but it is pretty thick so let's see how
it<00:01:54.270> works<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:54.540> us<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.810> pool<00:01:55.940> moving<00:01:56.940> really

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
it works on us in the pool moving really

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.700 
it works on us in the pool moving really
well<00:01:57.210> as<00:01:57.540> if<00:01:57.660> it<00:01:57.810> was<00:01:57.960> just<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.350> genuine

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
well as if it was just a genuine

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.820 
well as if it was just a genuine
replacement<00:01:59.280> part

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
replacement part

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.890 
replacement part
you
