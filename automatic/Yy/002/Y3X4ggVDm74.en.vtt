kind<00:01:51.010> of<00:01:51.070> sensible<00:01:51.580> work<00:01:51.820> but<00:01:52.690> she<00:01:52.810> talked

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
kind of sensible work but she talked

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.810 
kind of sensible work but she talked
about<00:01:53.230> Katya<00:01:53.560> persona<00:01:54.010> and<00:01:54.310> when<00:01:54.400> I<00:01:54.430> was<00:01:54.640> young

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
I was very very influenced by what

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.620 
I was very very influenced by what

beautiful classic sense their bailiwick

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.680 
beautiful classic sense their bailiwick
and<00:01:58.870> so<00:01:59.050> on<00:01:59.170> so<00:01:59.200> we<00:01:59.800> would<00:02:00.700> look<00:02:00.820> at<00:02:00.910> his<00:02:01.060> vast
