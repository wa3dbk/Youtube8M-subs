well held up by that sherry so my take

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.629 
well held up by that sherry so my take
on<00:03:25.150> this<00:03:25.209> is<00:03:25.359> that<00:03:25.569> it's<00:03:25.930> it's<00:03:26.319> the<00:03:26.680> flavors

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
on this is that it's it's the flavors

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.479 
on this is that it's it's the flavors
that<00:03:27.670> they<00:03:27.879> have<00:03:28.180> are<00:03:28.599> quite<00:03:29.319> good<00:03:29.349> but<00:03:30.250> there

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
can think about all the other things I

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.130 
can think about all the other things I
could<00:04:45.830> get<00:04:46.130> at<00:04:46.310> this<00:04:46.430> price<00:04:46.760> it's<00:04:47.720> hard<00:04:48.020> to

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
could get at this price it's hard to

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.370 
could get at this price it's hard to
give<00:04:48.289> it<00:04:48.410> much<00:04:48.560> higher<00:04:48.800> than<00:04:48.979> 85<00:04:49.450> basically<00:04:50.450> um

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380
