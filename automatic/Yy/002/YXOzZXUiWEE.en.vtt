gonna use the impact remove the nut this
whole<00:00:29.820> assembly<00:00:30.090> comes<00:00:30.570> right<00:00:30.840> off<00:00:31.940> so<00:00:32.940> here's

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
whole assembly comes right off so here's

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.990 
whole assembly comes right off so here's
our<00:00:33.270> flywheel<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.140> what<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.410> can<00:00:34.559> see<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:35.040> if

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
our flywheel and what you can see is if

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.760 
our flywheel and what you can see is if
you<00:00:36.149> look<00:00:36.360> real<00:00:36.570> closely<00:00:36.840> this<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.530> your

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
you look real closely this is your

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.450 
you look real closely this is your
flywheel<00:00:38.700> key<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.649> if<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.800> ever<00:00:40.920> go<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.160> start

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
flywheel key and if you ever go to start

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.270 
flywheel key and if you ever go to start
a<00:00:41.610> lawnmower<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:43.379> pull<00:00:43.590> rope<00:00:43.829> Yanks

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
a lawnmower and the pull rope Yanks

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.650 
a lawnmower and the pull rope Yanks
right<00:00:44.430> out<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.730> your<00:00:44.820> hand<00:00:45.030> it's<00:00:45.270> because<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
right out of your hand it's because the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.040 
right out of your hand it's because the
timings<00:00:46.140> off<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:47.059> this<00:00:48.059> particular<00:00:48.450> key<00:00:48.989> is

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
timings off and this particular key is

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.020 
timings off and this particular key is
made<00:00:49.410> out<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.710> aluminum<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.520> it's<00:00:50.730> made<00:00:51.000> to

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
made out of aluminum and it's made to

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.709 
made out of aluminum and it's made to
shear<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:53.100> can<00:00:53.309> break<00:00:53.550> or<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.059> can<00:00:54.210> bend<00:00:54.449> and

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
shear so it can break or it can bend and

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.569 
shear so it can break or it can bend and
that'll<00:00:54.960> screw<00:00:55.199> up<00:00:55.379> your<00:00:55.559> timing<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.280> that's

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
that'll screw up your timing and that's

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.520 
that'll screw up your timing and that's
why<00:00:56.879> when<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.270> pull<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.570> rope<00:00:57.780> it'll<00:00:58.050> snap<00:00:58.289> it

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
why when you pull the rope it'll snap it

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.369 
why when you pull the rope it'll snap it
out<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.800> your<00:00:58.859> hand<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.109> usually<00:01:01.109> just

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
out of your hand so you usually just

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.009 
out of your hand so you usually just
have<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.680> replace<00:01:02.070> this<00:01:02.550> flywheel<00:01:02.940> key<00:01:03.660> in

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
have to replace this flywheel key in

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.160 
have to replace this flywheel key in
order<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.769> fix<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.220> problem<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:06.119> now<00:01:06.720> I'm

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
order to fix that problem so now I'm

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.359 
order to fix that problem so now I'm
going<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.409> show<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.590> how<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.799> pull<00:01:08.040> off<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
going to show you how to pull off the

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.490 
going to show you how to pull off the
flywheel<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.450> flywheel<00:01:09.990> needs<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.409> be

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
flywheel the flywheel needs to be

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.130 
flywheel the flywheel needs to be
removed<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.130> replace<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.939> key<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.479> lot<00:01:13.020> of

removed to replace that key a lot of

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.679 
removed to replace that key a lot of
times<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.619> can<00:01:13.799> just<00:01:13.860> pop<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.729> Cup<00:01:15.270> off<00:01:15.509> the

great so here's what we have basically a

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.889 
great so here's what we have basically a
crowbar<00:01:50.280> wedged<00:01:50.700> under<00:01:51.149> there<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.689> I'm<00:01:51.780> going

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
crowbar wedged under there and I'm going

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.190 
crowbar wedged under there and I'm going
to<00:01:51.930> be<00:01:52.079> using<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.829> pneumatic<00:01:53.640> impact<00:01:54.540> hammer<00:01:54.869> to

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
to be using a pneumatic impact hammer to

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.260 
to be using a pneumatic impact hammer to
pop<00:01:55.409> up<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.890> flywheel<00:01:58.040> so<00:01:59.040> here<00:01:59.280> we<00:01:59.399> go<00:01:59.610> give

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
pop up the flywheel so here we go give

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.740 
pop up the flywheel so here we go give
it<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.390> shot

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
it a shot
