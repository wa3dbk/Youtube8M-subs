00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
branch out as much as possible and since

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.230 
branch out as much as possible and since
I've<00:01:04.710> just<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.070> only<00:01:05.309> opened<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.730> few<00:01:05.880> months<00:01:06.090> ago

waters<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.060> see<00:01:09.120> what's<00:01:09.510> out<00:01:09.690> there<00:01:09.860> so<00:01:10.860> I

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
waters and see what's out there so I

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.300 
waters and see what's out there so I
started<00:01:11.670> out<00:01:11.820> with<00:01:12.030> gig<00:01:12.330> posters<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:13.140> now

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
started out with gig posters and now

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.190 
started out with gig posters and now
finding<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.430> people<00:01:14.610> are<00:01:14.880> doing<00:01:15.200> screen

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
finding that people are doing screen

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.620 
finding that people are doing screen
printed<00:01:16.530> movie<00:01:16.830> posters<00:01:17.250> again<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.970> then

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
printed movie posters again and then

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.350 
printed movie posters again and then
there's<00:01:18.840> just<00:01:19.350> straight-up<00:01:19.650> art<00:01:20.070> prints<00:01:21.060> and

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
so the sign-in number where that comes

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.600 
so the sign-in number where that comes
in<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.960> know<00:01:25.080> when<00:01:25.290> when<00:01:25.620> you<00:01:26.280> do<00:01:26.430> in

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.900 
perfect fit because the rock posters and
records<00:02:17.560> store<00:02:17.830> everything<00:02:18.400> kind<00:02:18.700> of<00:02:18.760> goes

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
records store everything kind of goes

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.729 
records store everything kind of goes
together<00:02:19.120> so<00:02:19.690> kind<00:02:19.930> of<00:02:19.959> felt<00:02:20.170> like<00:02:20.230> it<00:02:20.350> was

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
together so kind of felt like it was

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:28.160 
together so kind of felt like it was
like<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.280> perfect<00:02:21.550> match

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.370 

I<00:02:28.459> get<00:02:29.459> a<00:02:29.490> lot<00:02:29.670> of<00:02:29.790> positive<00:02:29.940> a<00:02:30.540> positive

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
I get a lot of positive a positive

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.740 
I get a lot of positive a positive
reaction<00:02:32.250> from<00:02:32.640> people<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.300> it's<00:02:33.630> really

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
reaction from people and it's really

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.510 
reaction from people and it's really
nice<00:02:34.050> like<00:02:34.380> they<00:02:34.709> say<00:02:34.890> there's<00:02:35.160> nothing<00:02:35.340> like

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
nice like they say there's nothing like

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.490 
nice like they say there's nothing like
it<00:02:35.700> which<00:02:36.000> is<00:02:36.180> nice<00:02:36.450> like<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:36.959> don't<00:02:37.020> want<00:02:37.319> to<00:02:37.349> be

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
it which is nice like I don't want to be

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.710 
it which is nice like I don't want to be
competing<00:02:37.950> with<00:02:38.130> someone<00:02:38.970> else<00:02:39.150> or<00:02:39.450> or

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
competing with someone else or or

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.870 
competing with someone else or or
getting<00:02:40.680> into<00:02:40.860> their<00:02:41.040> territory<00:02:41.250> or<00:02:41.670> anything

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
getting into their territory or anything

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.960 
getting into their territory or anything
so<00:02:42.300> it<00:02:42.690> is<00:02:42.900> quite<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:43.650> bit<00:02:43.950> like<00:02:44.190> specialize

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
so it is quite a bit like specialize

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.350 
so it is quite a bit like specialize
like<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:45.780> know<00:02:45.900> it's<00:02:46.230> pretty<00:02:46.440> specific

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
like you know it's pretty specific

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.790
