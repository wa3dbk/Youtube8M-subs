00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.320
 much with the note of a factor that animates 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.350
 but as camion has this authority 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.630

 at the hotel you sleep two hours and pay half 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.460
 of the daily rate so the guests stay 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.510

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.630
