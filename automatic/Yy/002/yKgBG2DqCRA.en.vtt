around saying that there's a big

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.279 
around saying that there's a big
possibility<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.460> Intel<00:00:54.449> are<00:00:54.719> actually

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
possibility that Intel are actually

going to now be able to release the

going to now be able to release the
Sandy<00:00:58.020> Bridge<00:00:58.109> processors<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.190> machines

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
Sandy Bridge processors to the machines

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.330 
Sandy Bridge processors to the machines
which<00:01:00.180> didn't<00:01:00.629> actually<00:01:01.010> affect<00:01:02.010> them<00:01:02.190> and

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
which didn't actually affect them and

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.820 
which didn't actually affect them and
apparently<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.300> macbook<00:01:03.899> pro<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.350> one<00:01:04.710> of

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
apparently the macbook pro is one of

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.440 
apparently the macbook pro is one of
those<00:01:04.949> machines<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:06.030> that's<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.299> first

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
those machines so that's the first

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.350 
those machines so that's the first
indication<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.560> macbook<00:01:08.310> pro<00:01:08.580> refresh

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
indication that the macbook pro refresh

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.030 
indication that the macbook pro refresh
that<00:01:09.390> we<00:01:09.689> anticipated<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.560> be<00:01:10.590> around<00:01:10.890> this

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
that we anticipated to be around this

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.000 
that we anticipated to be around this
time<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.430> year<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.939> now<00:01:12.540> again<00:01:12.900> quite<00:01:13.560> possibly

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
time of year is now again quite possibly

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.100 
time of year is now again quite possibly
going<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.340> happen<00:01:14.640> fairly<00:01:14.820> soon<00:01:15.210> there's

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
going to happen fairly soon there's

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.020 
going to happen fairly soon there's
another<00:01:16.350> few<00:01:16.680> reasons<00:01:16.890> as<00:01:17.280> well<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.820> are

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
another few reasons as well that are

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.940 
another few reasons as well that are
kind<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.450> pushing<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.229> theory<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
kind of pushing this theory that the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.910 
kind of pushing this theory that the
macbook<00:01:20.700> pro<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.299> going<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.080> be<00:01:22.200> due<00:01:22.650> for<00:01:22.860> a

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
macbook pro is going to be due for a

macbook pro is going to be due for a
refresh<00:01:23.310> very<00:01:23.549> soon<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.840> first<00:01:25.080> one<00:01:25.350> is

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
refresh very soon and the first one is

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.109 
refresh very soon and the first one is
that<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.990> apple<00:01:27.990> website<00:01:28.520> states<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.880> the

that the apple website states that the

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.690 
what do we think is going to be in the
new<00:02:17.750> macbook<00:02:18.200> pro<00:02:18.440> me<00:02:19.040> personally<00:02:19.580> I<00:02:19.610> think

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
new macbook pro me personally I think

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.970 
new macbook pro me personally I think
they're<00:02:20.120> going<00:02:20.240> to<00:02:20.360> drop<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:21.020> 13<00:02:21.410> inch<00:02:21.440> I

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
they're going to drop the 13 inch I

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.380 
they're going to drop the 13 inch I
think<00:02:22.310> they're<00:02:22.430> just<00:02:22.580> going<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:22.760> have<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.090> 11

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
think they're just going to have the 11

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.780 
think they're just going to have the 11
inch<00:02:23.510> and<00:02:23.750> 13-inch<00:02:24.290> MacBook<00:02:24.770> Air<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:25.190> think<00:02:25.670> the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
inch and 13-inch MacBook Air I think the

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.000 
inch and 13-inch MacBook Air I think the
macbook<00:02:26.240> pro<00:02:26.270> is<00:02:26.660> only<00:02:26.780> going<00:02:26.960> to<00:02:27.050> be<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.170> 15

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
macbook pro is only going to be a 15

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.100 
macbook pro is only going to be a 15
inch<00:02:28.190> and<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.400> 17<00:02:28.850> inch<00:02:29.030> I'd<00:02:29.420> say<00:02:29.720> there's<00:02:30.020> a

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
inch and a 17 inch I'd say there's a

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.450 
inch and a 17 inch I'd say there's a
very<00:02:30.350> very<00:02:30.590> good<00:02:30.770> chance<00:02:31.010> that<00:02:31.190> they're<00:02:31.430> all

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
very very good chance that they're all

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.130 
very very good chance that they're all
going<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.730> be<00:02:31.850> based<00:02:32.090> around<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.540> flash

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
going to be based around the flash

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.380 
going to be based around the flash
storage<00:02:33.440> that<00:02:33.740> we've<00:02:33.830> already<00:02:33.980> seen<00:02:34.400> in<00:02:34.910> the

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
storage that we've already seen in the

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.300 
storage that we've already seen in the
macbook<00:02:35.810> air<00:02:36.140> range<00:02:36.440> and<00:02:36.800> obviously<00:02:37.100> they're

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
macbook air range and obviously they're

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.100 
macbook air range and obviously they're
going<00:02:37.490> to<00:02:37.550> be<00:02:37.640> using<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:38.060> new<00:02:38.210> Sandy<00:02:38.990> Bridge

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
going to be using the new Sandy Bridge

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.650 
going to be using the new Sandy Bridge
processors<00:02:39.440> as<00:02:40.070> well<00:02:40.300> it's<00:02:41.300> highly<00:02:41.630> likely

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
processors as well it's highly likely

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.180 
processors as well it's highly likely
that<00:02:42.080> maybe<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.160> lower<00:02:43.400> end<00:02:43.730> of<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.170> macbook

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
that maybe the lower end of the macbook

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.780 
that maybe the lower end of the macbook
pro<00:02:46.190> range<00:02:46.760> are<00:02:47.120> going<00:02:47.300> to<00:02:47.390> use<00:02:47.570> the<00:02:47.810> in<00:02:48.350> bill

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
pro range are going to use the in bill

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.550 
pro range are going to use the in bill
processing<00:02:49.790> power<00:02:50.480> for<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:50.930> graphics<00:02:51.380> that

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
processing power for the graphics that

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.620 
processing power for the graphics that
comes<00:02:51.860> on<00:02:52.160> board<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:52.820> ship<00:02:53.060> and<00:02:53.300> then

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
comes on board the ship and then

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.560 
comes on board the ship and then
obviously<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:54.260> AMD<00:02:55.160> graphics<00:02:55.700> cards<00:02:56.330> or

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
obviously the AMD graphics cards or

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.570 
obviously the AMD graphics cards or
maybe<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.080> slightly<00:02:57.770> higher<00:02:58.070> spec<00:02:58.459> to

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
maybe the slightly higher spec to

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.850 
maybe the slightly higher spec to
machines<00:02:58.910> and<00:02:59.120> i'll<00:02:59.870> see<00:03:00.530> you<00:03:00.620> in<00:03:00.740> the<00:03:00.770> next

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
machines and i'll see you in the next
