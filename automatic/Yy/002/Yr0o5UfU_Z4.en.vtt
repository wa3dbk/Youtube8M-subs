00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
know it's about this before but I think

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.130 
know it's about this before but I think
that<00:02:44.090> creative<00:02:44.720> use<00:02:44.989> of<00:02:45.820> vanilla<00:02:47.140> resources

that creative use of vanilla resources
is<00:02:48.440> more<00:02:48.680> interesting<00:02:49.340> than<00:02:49.370> just<00:02:49.700> oh<00:02:49.910> no<00:02:49.970> flat

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
is more interesting than just oh no flat

i<00:04:07.370> want<00:04:07.640> to<00:04:07.730> go<00:04:07.790> i<00:04:07.909> have<00:04:08.269> no<00:04:08.510> idea<00:04:08.840> i<00:04:09.049> am<00:04:09.560> now<00:04:09.769> in

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
i want to go i have no idea i am now in

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:12.940 
i want to go i have no idea i am now in
a<00:04:10.159> place<00:04:10.430> that<00:04:10.459> is<00:04:10.790> very<00:04:11.090> great<00:04:11.629> also<00:04:11.870> it's<00:04:12.470> an

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
a place that is very great also it's an

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.220 
a place that is very great also it's an
exit<00:04:13.370> so<00:04:13.760> i<00:04:13.819> guess<00:04:14.030> that<00:04:14.180> was<00:04:14.390> a<00:04:14.420> secret<00:04:14.840> exit

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
exit so i guess that was a secret exit

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.659 
exit so i guess that was a secret exit
of<00:04:15.319> some<00:04:15.530> kind<00:04:15.799> and<00:04:15.980> I<00:04:16.070> are<00:04:16.280> kind<00:04:16.609> of

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
of some kind and I are kind of

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.490 
of some kind and I are kind of
accidentally<00:04:17.329> open<00:04:17.690> up<00:04:17.840> I<00:04:17.930> don't<00:04:18.169> know<00:04:18.260> I

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
accidentally open up I don't know I

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.140 
accidentally open up I don't know I
guess<00:04:18.889> it<00:04:19.130> could<00:04:19.280> have<00:04:19.310> been<00:04:19.489> better<00:04:19.699> hidden

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
guess it could have been better hidden

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.560 
guess it could have been better hidden
is<00:04:20.359> what<00:04:20.570> I<00:04:20.600> might<00:04:20.989> be<00:04:21.169> wanting<00:04:21.350> to<00:04:21.650> say<00:04:21.859> there

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
is what I might be wanting to say there

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.320 
is what I might be wanting to say there
maybe<00:04:23.570> it's<00:04:23.900> a<00:04:24.020> possibility<00:04:24.440> and<00:04:25.250> it<00:04:25.850> leads<00:04:26.090> up

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
maybe it's a possibility and it leads up

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.290 
maybe it's a possibility and it leads up
a<00:04:26.479> path<00:04:26.720> all<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.080> way<00:04:27.470> to<00:04:27.710> a<00:04:27.919> little<00:04:28.580> extra

a path all the way to a little extra

four paths let you know when because I

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.740 
four paths let you know when because I

to justify all this I want to keep a

to justify all this I want to keep a

oh man my power ups utilize it for me
long<00:05:23.650> okay<00:05:24.650> well<00:05:24.949> since<00:05:25.220> right<00:05:25.520> here<00:05:25.789> now

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060

long okay well since right here now
let's<00:05:26.120> see<00:05:26.660> what's<00:05:26.990> down<00:05:27.260> this<00:05:27.620> pathway<00:05:27.979> if

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
let's see what's down this pathway if

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.580 
let's see what's down this pathway if
you<00:05:28.430> don't<00:05:28.610> like<00:05:29.180> I'm<00:05:29.389> assuming<00:05:30.110> that<00:05:30.289> if<00:05:30.440> I

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
you don't like I'm assuming that if I

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.830 
you don't like I'm assuming that if I
don't<00:05:30.830> take<00:05:31.099> the<00:05:31.430> passage<00:05:32.030> and<00:05:32.360> the<00:05:32.419> pipe<00:05:32.630> it

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
don't take the passage and the pipe it

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.570 
don't take the passage and the pipe it
just<00:05:32.990> needs<00:05:33.169> us<00:05:33.320> to<00:05:33.470> the<00:05:33.590> same<00:05:33.830> place<00:05:34.039> yeah

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
just needs us to the same place yeah

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.330 
just needs us to the same place yeah
exactly<00:05:34.760> but<00:05:35.330> without<00:05:35.510> the<00:05:35.660> piece<00:05:36.050> which<00:05:36.340> of

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
exactly but without the piece which of

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.790 
exactly but without the piece which of
course<00:05:37.400> that<00:05:38.240> is<00:05:38.510> what<00:05:38.810> makes<00:05:39.020> sense<00:05:39.320> so<00:05:39.560> the

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
course that is what makes sense so the

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.339 
course that is what makes sense so the
good<00:05:40.010> gift<00:05:40.310> here<00:05:40.699> would<00:05:41.030> be<00:05:41.060> a<00:05:41.479> flower<00:05:41.780> which<00:05:42.169> I

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:42.349 
good gift here would be a flower which I

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:44.219 
good gift here would be a flower which I
suppose<00:05:42.620> is<00:05:42.680> alright<00:05:43.190> but<00:05:43.220> it's<00:05:43.550> not<00:05:43.789> like

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:44.229 
suppose is alright but it's not like

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.200 
suppose is alright but it's not like
maybe<00:05:45.229> perhaps<00:05:45.680> I<00:05:46.160> deal<00:05:46.580> with<00:05:46.639> the<00:05:47.150> type<00:05:47.419> of

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
maybe perhaps I deal with the type of

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.809 
maybe perhaps I deal with the type of
activity<00:05:48.810> we<00:05:49.050> are<00:05:49.350> engaging<00:05:49.979> ourselves

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:50.819 
activity we are engaging ourselves

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:53.270 
activity we are engaging ourselves
inside<00:05:51.240> here<00:05:51.569> but<00:05:51.840> at<00:05:52.560> the<00:05:52.680> same<00:05:52.919> time<00:05:53.220> I

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
inside here but at the same time I

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.430 
inside here but at the same time I
suppose<00:05:53.850> it's<00:05:54.030> not<00:05:54.270> that<00:05:54.479> man<00:05:54.930> we<00:05:55.139> gotta<00:05:55.350> be

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
suppose it's not that man we gotta be

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.540 
suppose it's not that man we gotta be
careful<00:05:55.620> though<00:05:56.039> I<00:05:56.069> know<00:05:56.280> there-there's

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
careful though I know there-there's

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.230 
careful though I know there-there's
toxic<00:05:57.330> and<00:05:57.630> there<00:05:57.930> is<00:05:58.139> other<00:05:58.880> objects<00:05:59.880> of

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
toxic and there is other objects of

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.499 
toxic and there is other objects of
perhaps<00:06:01.130> negativity<00:06:02.130> and<00:06:02.310> no<00:06:02.490> more<00:06:02.789> far<00:06:03.210> to

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:03.509 
perhaps negativity and no more far to
