00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 I am very happy to see the 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.560
 diversity a little bit of video games 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.359
 represents and that is to say close 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.250
 only the consoles even if it's a 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.750
 big share of the video game market but 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.550
 the pc and it's very difficult to 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.380
 come back machines like that that does not 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.900
 are more expensive than consoles but that 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.520
 allows multiple communities to be 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.619
 present and I think about the community 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.510
 starcraft 2 which is a strategy game 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.820
 league of legend standards to good 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.460
 other old lots of modern warfare 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.140
 2 is a shooting game has been specially 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.170
 as far as I'm concerned minecraft is a 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.000
 independent cooperation game there you 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.460
 see 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.890
 I will be able to do with 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.980
 pleased with this initiative that requires 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.530
 a lot of work to come back 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.150
 this material is that night because the 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.880
 gainers are not people to social 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.400
 they ask us to be reunited 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:51.000
 to share their passion we wait for your 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.590
 precisely this tone of predilection 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.870
 what exactly is this a little 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.920
 so how was he already 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.570
 game then quickly looks like a 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.090
 planet as a normal world with 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.129
 market price 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.290
 fresh forest linen snow 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.000
 in the end of the desert is actually everything is in 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.640
 small pubs and cubes 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.620
 whichever member and stand as 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.440
 lego and the six teams we can 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.900
 edit to make you tools of 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.310
 weapons but also circuits 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.630
 electric not things a little 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.360
 little is actually pushing it's a world 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.050
 that you can give me in cooperation 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.450
 this live from other players 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:32.190
 and so like that is downright a 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.660
 universe according to your desires it can be so 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.930
 do you like the castle the castle of 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.060
 disney you can do the leader of the smer 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.740
 also you m 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.450
 and I do not have a nice house 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.979
 architectural or so I'm going to do a 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.570
 city ​​under the sea we could do it 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.310
 finally it's a game that is limitless 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.570
 if not the player's imagination 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.100
 this is called a tray game at 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.390
 sand it's a little independent is 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.850
 really cheap we can play on pc 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.080
 mac and a half today we are we have to 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.600
 roughly 10 million players 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.000
 the world and about 400 miles in France 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.920
 I am bitch and the meeting at the 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.750
 meeting I think there is more than 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.520
 players little in law but I could 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.020
 not evaluate it I think there is little 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.409
 near 5000 and the guy does find 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.409
 currently 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.319
 is the random 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.770
 in this community has been relatively 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.730
 known crazy even better known 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.800
 here we go I do not know how to do it 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.290
 now then in five or seven slits 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.500
 album sees his fantasies and I 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.660
 suspicious is only in the meantime the guide 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.340
 dahmane draw a tutorial in mind in 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.780
 doing a practice explains everything 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.490
 we must do in order to survive 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.590
 of a present on manga the relocating 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.030
 story is what started me 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.610
 today the first video to 3 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.260
 million euros and 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.380
 and in fact we keep having fun we get 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.820
 serves as man 2 is a sandbox game 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.340
 to make a few characters 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.730
 cartoons with his ghosts 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.730
 noble 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.320
 really to 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.810
 the two quadras 2 it's really 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.430
 people who share things 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.310
 together who build in form a 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.440
 little like what the elegant of the proposed 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.640
 in their wake this activity r yeah I 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.959
 say that this activity because I have 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.130
 a sufficient hearing in this is not 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.130
 given all aware 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.360
 and with him 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.370
 views per month 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.840
 with my friend paul 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.900
 sharing we come to live every 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.310
 sofas an employee of the game 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.870
 how 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.310
 do not young people spend too much 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.580
 slope 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.940
 in front of these games and ranks the 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.160
 from the idea we come 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.770
 myself I spent a lot of time there 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.090
 must know for example minecraft me 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.420
 helped me out of a game where I spend 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.740
 is really too much after it's 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.210
 a history of moderation is a 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.220
 education star it's up to the parents of 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:46.580
 unsuspected limits would fix 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.250
 no confidence and that's not easy to 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.620
 moderate there is a desire there is a desire 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.550
 a universe a little better by point 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.710
 that avoid them 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.880
 it can be a form of loophole 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.800
 gentleman 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.230
 of expression here we can not throw the 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.790
 baby with bath water there are a lot 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.990
 to draw positive from it particularly in 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.300
 meetings I have met many 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.460
 friends 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.900
 I am much enriched and their 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:15.510
 contacts so spent time it's when 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:19.910
 we said here we learn to manage 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.910
 it's awful to see noon at his door
