00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:02:01.060 

you

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.550 

then<00:02:02.070> right<00:02:02.490> after<00:02:02.520> this

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.559 

we<00:02:07.190> just<00:02:07.369> have<00:02:07.520> this<00:02:07.640> little<00:02:07.700> pattern

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.330 

d

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:21.740 

later

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.560 

to<00:02:22.650> an<00:02:22.770> e<00:02:23.240> so<00:02:24.680> I'll<00:02:25.680> play<00:02:26.090> just<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:27.300> part

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
to an e so I'll play just that part

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:38.059 
to an e so I'll play just that part
broke<00:02:28.050> down<00:02:28.320> so<00:02:28.590> it's

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.800 

and<00:02:38.370> then<00:02:38.549> to<00:02:38.700> an<00:02:38.819> E

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.970 

then<00:02:43.810> we<00:02:43.900> have<00:02:44.050> that<00:02:44.140> little<00:02:44.350> breakdown<00:02:44.560> right

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
then we have that little breakdown right

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.950

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:29.100 
and that is an a I'll just play at first
and<00:04:16.320> then<00:04:16.410> we'll<00:04:16.500> break<00:04:16.620> it<00:04:16.739> down

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.170 

okay<00:04:30.139> so<00:04:30.410> they're<00:04:31.100> all<00:04:31.220> in<00:04:31.430> this<00:04:31.580> pattern<00:04:31.940> the

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
okay so they're all in this pattern the

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.670 
okay so they're all in this pattern the
same<00:04:32.330> pattern<00:04:32.720> is<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:33.020> beginning<00:04:33.290> it's<00:04:33.500> a

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
same pattern is the beginning it's a

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.129 
same pattern is the beginning it's a
just<00:04:34.639> a<00:04:34.730> broken<00:04:35.060> chord<00:04:35.270> like<00:04:35.420> this<00:04:37.240> okay<00:04:38.240> so<00:04:39.020> we

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
just a broken chord like this okay so we

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:49.750 
just a broken chord like this okay so we
have<00:04:39.350> an<00:04:39.680> a<00:04:39.919> a<00:04:41.860> in<00:04:42.860> the<00:04:42.980> left<00:04:43.160> hand<00:04:44.139> then<00:04:45.139> E

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:55.910 

P<00:04:50.760> minor

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.910 

Toodee

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.830 

then<00:05:02.920> after<00:05:03.190> this<00:05:03.310> we<00:05:03.940> are<00:05:03.970> into<00:05:04.390> the<00:05:04.480> chorus

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
then after this we are into the chorus

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.530 
then after this we are into the chorus
and<00:05:05.110> the<00:05:05.350> chorus<00:05:05.710> is<00:05:05.950> just<00:05:06.610> like<00:05:06.880> the

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
and the chorus is just like the

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.120 
and the chorus is just like the
beginning<00:05:07.720> of<00:05:07.930> the<00:05:07.990> song<00:05:08.260> so<00:05:08.830> we're<00:05:08.980> back<00:05:09.070> to

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
beginning of the song so we're back to

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:22.279 
beginning of the song so we're back to
this

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:22.289 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:30.709 

okay<00:05:23.289> so<00:05:23.349> the<00:05:23.560> bridge<00:05:23.800> the<00:05:24.400> bridge<00:05:24.430> is<00:05:24.789> just<00:05:25.919> D

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:30.719 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:34.409 

sharp<00:05:31.719> minor<00:05:32.610> these<00:05:33.610> two<00:05:33.759> chords<00:05:34.090> I<00:05:34.210> play

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
sharp minor these two chords I play

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:39.480 
sharp minor these two chords I play
octaves<00:05:34.599> on<00:05:34.840> the<00:05:34.900> left<00:05:35.080> hand<00:05:38.159> so<00:05:39.159> we<00:05:39.249> just<00:05:39.370> do

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
octaves on the left hand so we just do

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:46.330 
octaves on the left hand so we just do
this<00:05:39.639> pattern<00:05:39.999> again

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.170 

that's<00:05:46.850> one<00:05:47.120> unique<00:05:47.420> change<00:05:47.720> Reggie

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.860 

goes<00:05:51.180> to<00:05:51.330> a<00:05:51.360> d-minor<00:05:51.810> at<00:05:52.260> the<00:05:52.380> end<00:05:52.500> of<00:05:52.590> it

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.990 

then<00:05:55.680> we<00:05:55.920> are<00:05:55.980> in<00:05:56.480> the<00:05:58.460> breakdown<00:05:59.460> before<00:05:59.670> the

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
then we are in the breakdown before the

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.410 
then we are in the breakdown before the
pre-chorus<00:06:00.630> and<00:06:01.820> that's<00:06:02.820> this<00:06:03.000> again<00:06:03.270> it's<00:06:03.390> a

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:03.420 
pre-chorus and that's this again it's a

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.820 
pre-chorus and that's this again it's a
little<00:06:03.690> different<00:06:03.870> than<00:06:04.110> the<00:06:04.200> first<00:06:04.230> time

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830
