forty five thousand and has worked for
35<00:01:51.240> days<00:01:51.600> his<00:01:52.380> gradually<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:54.170> 29<00:01:55.170> lakhs

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
35 days his gradually is 29 lakhs

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:03.859 
35 days his gradually is 29 lakhs
27,000<00:01:57.170> 885<00:01:58.170> but<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.520> graduted<00:02:00.060> limit<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:02.869> n

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
27,000 885 but the graduted limit is n

so<00:02:06.140> for<00:02:06.740> this<00:02:07.010> employee<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:08.060> gravity<00:02:08.600> would

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
so for this employee the gravity would

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:15.460 
so for this employee the gravity would
