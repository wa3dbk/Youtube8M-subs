we<00:00:12.120> have<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.269> lot<00:00:12.480> of<00:00:12.599> races<00:00:12.960> they<00:00:13.139> start<00:00:13.440> the

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
we have a lot of races they start the

we have a lot of races they start the
races<00:00:13.830> inside<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.309> gulch<00:00:14.519> sometimes<00:00:15.030> so<00:00:15.650> we

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
races inside the gulch sometimes so we

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.470 
races inside the gulch sometimes so we
decided<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.250> turn<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.580> corner<00:00:17.850> quick<00:00:18.119> on<00:00:18.330> this

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480

decided to turn the corner quick on this
one<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.869> check<00:00:19.260> out<00:00:19.500> that<00:00:19.680> inside<00:00:20.070> line<00:00:20.340> and

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
one and check out that inside line and

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.800 
one and check out that inside line and
see<00:00:21.689> how<00:00:21.810> fast<00:00:22.109> we<00:00:22.350> could<00:00:22.470> work<00:00:22.650> ourselves<00:00:22.830> out

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
see how fast we could work ourselves out

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.920 
see how fast we could work ourselves out
this<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:25.080> just<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.580> training<00:00:26.580> run<00:00:26.880> we're<00:00:27.390> taking

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
this is just a training run we're taking

this is just a training run we're taking
our<00:00:28.050> time<00:00:28.730> try<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:30.140> see<00:00:31.140> what<00:00:31.289> these<00:00:31.470> bumps<00:00:31.800> are

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
our time try to see what these bumps are

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.440 
our time try to see what these bumps are
doing<00:00:32.189> on<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.430> inside<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.090> see<00:00:33.239> how<00:00:33.390> the

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
doing on the inside and see how the

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.220 
doing on the inside and see how the
backwash<00:00:34.050> affects<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.390> you<00:00:36.390> know<00:00:36.510> check

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
backwash affects it and you know check

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.260 
backwash affects it and you know check
out<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.590> reefs<00:00:37.800> along<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.309> way<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.730> make

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
out the reefs along the way and make

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.500 
out the reefs along the way and make
sure<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:40.010> we<00:00:41.010> know<00:00:41.280> where<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.879> shallow

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
sure that we know where the shallow

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.840 
sure that we know where the shallow
reefs<00:00:42.809> are<00:00:42.989> at<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:44.250> we<00:00:44.370> stay<00:00:44.579> away<00:00:44.789> from

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
reefs are at and that we stay away from

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.430 
reefs are at and that we stay away from
them<00:00:47.450> the<00:00:48.450> big<00:00:48.629> difference<00:00:49.020> here<00:00:49.079> on<00:00:49.289> this

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440

them the big difference here on this
inside<00:00:49.800> line<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.340> backwash<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.090> would

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
inside line is the backwash that would

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.459 
inside line is the backwash that would
come<00:00:51.420> across<00:00:52.760> once<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.850> catch<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.149> bump<00:00:54.440> if<00:00:55.440> you

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
come across once you catch a bump if you

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.529 
come across once you catch a bump if you
keep<00:00:55.800> paddling

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
keep paddling

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:58.939 
keep paddling
once<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.690> bump<00:00:57.960> looks<00:00:58.170> like<00:00:58.379> it's<00:00:58.590> kind<00:00:58.920> of

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
once that bump looks like it's kind of

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.770 
once that bump looks like it's kind of
disappearing<00:00:59.550> chances<00:01:00.300> are<00:01:00.449> you're<00:01:00.629> gonna

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
disappearing chances are you're gonna

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.139 
disappearing chances are you're gonna
stay<00:01:01.109> in<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> trough<00:01:01.760> keep<00:01:02.760> your<00:01:02.940> momentum

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
stay in the trough keep your momentum

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.810 
stay in the trough keep your momentum
going<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.110> be<00:01:04.589> able<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.979> connect<00:01:05.369> with<00:01:05.610> that

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
going and be able to connect with that

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.890 
going and be able to connect with that
same<00:01:06.240> swell

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
same swell

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.890 
same swell
once<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.680> backwash<00:01:08.130> disappears<00:01:08.900> there's

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
once that backwash disappears there's

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.230 
once that backwash disappears there's
Travis<00:01:10.409> going<00:01:11.280> for<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.610> he's<00:01:11.729> in<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.030> trough

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
Travis going for it he's in the trough

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.940 
Travis going for it he's in the trough
but<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.689> can't<00:01:12.900> really<00:01:13.080> see<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> wave<00:01:13.650> there

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
but you can't really see a wave there

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.950 
but you can't really see a wave there
but<00:01:14.189> he's<00:01:14.790> just<00:01:15.030> keeping<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.450> momentum

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
but he's just keeping this momentum

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.480 
but he's just keeping this momentum
going<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.409> here's<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.770> wavy<00:01:17.130> just<00:01:17.369> it

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
going and here's that wavy just it

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:25.240 
going and here's that wavy just it
easily<00:01:18.060> catches<00:01:18.390> it

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250

twelve six and you can see our strokes

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.520 
twelve six and you can see our strokes
are<00:01:33.450> most<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.840> them<00:01:33.960> who<00:01:34.080> are<00:01:34.110> going<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.380> be

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
Travis and I did this drill we would do

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.380 
Travis and I did this drill we would do
five<00:02:19.319> strokes<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:19.950> that's<00:02:20.700> how<00:02:20.819> you<00:02:20.879> get<00:02:21.120> see

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
five strokes and that's how you get see

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.050 
five strokes and that's how you get see
how<00:02:21.510> far<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:21.900> can<00:02:22.049> go<00:02:22.200> with<00:02:22.230> five<00:02:22.650> strokes<00:02:23.060> how

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
how far you can go with five strokes how

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.670 
how far you can go with five strokes how
much<00:02:24.239> how<00:02:24.660> far<00:02:24.870> can<00:02:25.019> you<00:02:25.110> serve<00:02:25.290> how<00:02:25.500> much

much how far can you serve how much
ground<00:02:25.920> can<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.250> cover<00:02:26.430> all<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.090> mean<00:02:27.269> using

ground can you cover all I mean using
five<00:02:27.750> strokes<00:02:28.079> seemed<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:29.010> work<00:02:29.129> out<00:02:29.340> pretty

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
five strokes seemed to work out pretty

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.740 
five strokes seemed to work out pretty
well<00:02:29.849> you<00:02:30.090> know<00:02:30.180> trying<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.860> figure<00:02:31.860> out<00:02:32.750> which

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
well you know trying to figure out which

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.059 
well you know trying to figure out which
way<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:33.959> go<00:02:34.230> with<00:02:34.379> the<00:02:34.530> bumps<00:02:34.799> and<00:02:34.890> how<00:02:35.010> to

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
way to go with the bumps and how to

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.209 
way to go with the bumps and how to
maximize<00:02:35.400> those<00:02:35.970> glides

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:40.219 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:43.640 

on<00:02:41.219> a<00:02:41.280> downwind<00:02:41.849> run<00:02:42.030> like<00:02:42.269> this<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:43.140> goal<00:02:43.379> is

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
on a downwind run like this the goal is

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.699 
on a downwind run like this the goal is
to<00:02:43.950> paddle<00:02:44.430> less<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.090> surf<00:02:45.810> more<00:02:46.079> you're

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
to paddle less and surf more you're

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.339 
to paddle less and surf more you're
gonna<00:02:46.799> be<00:02:47.010> much<00:02:47.310> faster<00:02:47.639> and<00:02:48.180> more<00:02:48.810> efficient

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
gonna be much faster and more efficient

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.949 
gonna be much faster and more efficient

muscle yourself into swells one way to

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.190 
muscle yourself into swells one way to
pick<00:02:59.099> up<00:02:59.250> on<00:02:59.430> some<00:02:59.670> of<00:02:59.700> these<00:02:59.849> things<00:03:00.150> is<00:03:00.959> just

with the bumps when you catch one just

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.259 
with the bumps when you catch one just
do<00:03:07.109> a<00:03:07.139> big<00:03:07.439> bottom<00:03:07.769> turn<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.250> head<00:03:08.849> down<00:03:09.090> the

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
do a big bottom turn and head down the

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.119

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
I can but I'm not catching their bumps I

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.819 
I can but I'm not catching their bumps I
usually<00:03:48.780> catch

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
usually catch

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.330 
usually catch
that's<00:03:50.579> just<00:03:50.879> it<00:03:51.090> seems<00:03:51.359> like<00:03:51.680> bad<00:03:52.680> timing<00:03:53.009> you

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340
