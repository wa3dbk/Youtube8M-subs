00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.929 
transmitter as shown on the box there
let's<00:01:29.880> see<00:01:30.030> channel<00:01:30.450> 17<00:01:31.400> it<00:01:32.400> has<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.579> battery

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
let's see channel 17 it has the battery

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.270 
let's see channel 17 it has the battery
the<00:01:33.299> lipo<00:01:33.659> battery<00:01:33.990> included<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.770> has<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.950> lipo

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
the lipo battery included it has a lipo

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.850 
the lipo battery included it has a lipo
battery<00:01:35.579> charger<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.869> believe<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.619> has<00:01:37.650> some

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
battery charger I believe it has some

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.469 
battery charger I believe it has some
spare<00:01:38.100> blades<00:01:38.369> in<00:01:38.579> there<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
simulator on a CD inside the box as I

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.020 
simulator on a CD inside the box as I
didn't<00:01:47.100> mention<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.579> brand<00:01:47.850> new<00:01:47.909> never

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
than just our hobby to do the RC stuff

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.900 
than just our hobby to do the RC stuff
but<00:03:25.709> basically<00:03:25.980> this<00:03:26.190> is<00:03:26.250> a<00:03:26.340> real<00:03:26.519> quick<00:03:26.730> look

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
at some of the stuff I got coming up

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.599 
at some of the stuff I got coming up
real<00:03:28.769> soon<00:03:28.829> in<00:03:29.190> some<00:03:29.760> of<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:29.940> videos<00:03:31.609> alright

real soon in some of the videos alright

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.090 
real soon in some of the videos alright
first<00:03:32.820> is<00:03:33.030> an<00:03:33.150> update<00:03:33.480> on<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.930> FF<00:03:34.380> bird<00:03:35.010> of

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
first is an update on the FF bird of

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.849 
first is an update on the FF bird of
prey<00:03:35.600> so<00:03:36.600> far<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:36.900> first<00:03:37.320> prototype<00:03:37.530> I've

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
prey so far the first prototype I've

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:41.449 
prey so far the first prototype I've
built<00:03:38.010> here<00:03:38.400> flew<00:03:39.120> very<00:03:39.359> well<00:03:40.220> other<00:03:41.220> than

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
built here flew very well other than

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:42.890 
built here flew very well other than
maybe<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:41.910> roles<00:03:42.120> were<00:03:42.329> a<00:03:42.359> little<00:03:42.480> bit<00:03:42.660> kind

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
maybe the roles were a little bit kind

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
coming up this is a real small prototype

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.250 
coming up this is a real small prototype
this<00:04:28.110> is<00:04:28.350> based<00:04:28.710> on<00:04:28.950> the<00:04:29.220> Lockheed<00:04:29.760> MP<00:04:30.390> UAV<00:04:30.990> or

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
this is based on the Lockheed MP UAV or

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.660 
this is based on the Lockheed MP UAV or
quorum<00:04:32.130> on<00:04:32.280> it's<00:04:32.640> a<00:04:32.880> basically<00:04:33.270> a<00:04:33.600> design<00:04:34.320> that

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
quorum on it's a basically a design that

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.070 
quorum on it's a basically a design that
Lockheed<00:04:35.670> was<00:04:35.790> working<00:04:36.090> on<00:04:36.180> that's<00:04:36.810> going<00:04:36.960> to

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
Lockheed was working on that's going to

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.490 
Lockheed was working on that's going to
be<00:04:37.140> a<00:04:37.170> UAV<00:04:37.530> that<00:04:37.980> can<00:04:38.130> be<00:04:38.220> launched<00:04:38.760> out<00:04:38.880> of<00:04:39.180> a

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
be a UAV that can be launched out of a

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.260 
be a UAV that can be launched out of a
missile<00:04:40.500> tube<00:04:40.710> from<00:04:41.010> a<00:04:41.130> submarine<00:04:41.400> basically

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
missile tube from a submarine basically

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.030 
missile tube from a submarine basically
it<00:04:42.420> launches<00:04:42.720> up<00:04:42.870> through<00:04:43.050> the<00:04:43.140> water<00:04:43.350> the

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
it launches up through the water the

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.490 
it launches up through the water the
wings<00:04:44.220> unfold<00:04:44.640> the<00:04:44.850> flies<00:04:45.060> away<00:04:45.290> my<00:04:46.290> phone

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
wings unfold the flies away my phone

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.530 
wings unfold the flies away my phone
board<00:04:46.740> one<00:04:46.920> won't<00:04:47.130> help<00:04:47.310> moving<00:04:47.580> wings<00:04:47.820> but

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
board one won't help moving wings but

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.390 
board one won't help moving wings but
I'm<00:04:48.660> working<00:04:48.840> on<00:04:49.080> trying<00:04:49.470> to<00:04:49.560> make<00:04:49.740> it<00:04:49.890> look<00:04:50.160> at

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
I'm working on trying to make it look at

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.710 
I'm working on trying to make it look at
similar<00:04:51.000> to<00:04:51.420> the<00:04:51.720> core<00:04:51.930> Mont<00:04:52.140> as<00:04:52.290> I<00:04:52.950> can<00:04:53.270> or<00:04:54.270> the

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
similar to the core Mont as I can or the

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.710 
similar to the core Mont as I can or the
MP<00:04:54.960> UAV<00:04:55.440> so<00:04:56.340> look<00:04:56.910> forward<00:04:57.120> to<00:04:57.240> this<00:04:57.330> coming<00:04:57.570> up

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.060 
fairly soon I've got kind of the
prototype<00:04:59.910> model<00:05:00.390> here<00:05:00.570> laid<00:05:01.440> out<00:05:01.590> like<00:05:01.620> I

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
prototype model here laid out like I

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.410 
prototype model here laid out like I
mentioned<00:05:02.250> here<00:05:02.550> there<00:05:02.820> is<00:05:02.970> going<00:05:03.090> to<00:05:03.180> be<00:05:03.210> some

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
mentioned here there is going to be some

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.730 
mentioned here there is going to be some
changes<00:05:03.750> when<00:05:03.930> I<00:05:03.960> do<00:05:04.110> start<00:05:04.350> building<00:05:04.710> it

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
changes when I do start building it

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.220 
changes when I do start building it
there<00:05:04.920> will<00:05:05.100> be<00:05:05.130> another<00:05:05.460> piece<00:05:05.760> that<00:05:06.030> fits<00:05:06.900> on

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
there will be another piece that fits on

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.730 
there will be another piece that fits on
top<00:05:07.290> of<00:05:07.980> the<00:05:08.880> fuselage<00:05:09.510> here<00:05:09.780> that's<00:05:10.530> going<00:05:10.650> to

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
top of the fuselage here that's going to

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.500 
top of the fuselage here that's going to
be<00:05:10.800> kind<00:05:11.070> of<00:05:11.190> a<00:05:11.340> angled<00:05:11.820> up<00:05:11.940> so<00:05:12.240> it<00:05:12.300> won't<00:05:12.420> be

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
be kind of a angled up so it won't be

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.500 
be kind of a angled up so it won't be
just<00:05:12.540> be<00:05:12.810> flat<00:05:13.370> and<00:05:14.370> there'll<00:05:15.090> be<00:05:15.120> some<00:05:15.360> other

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
just be flat and there'll be some other

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:16.970 
just be flat and there'll be some other
minor<00:05:15.690> modifications<00:05:16.410> that<00:05:16.440> I<00:05:16.560> found<00:05:16.800> out

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
minor modifications that I found out

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.670 
minor modifications that I found out
with<00:05:17.130> building<00:05:17.460> the<00:05:17.490> smaller<00:05:17.820> prototype<00:05:18.090> here

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
with building the smaller prototype here

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.800 
with building the smaller prototype here
but<00:05:19.680> the<00:05:19.850> wings<00:05:20.850> will<00:05:20.970> be<00:05:21.090> angled<00:05:21.450> up<00:05:21.540> a<00:05:21.600> little

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
but the wings will be angled up a little

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.690 
but the wings will be angled up a little
higher<00:05:21.990> on<00:05:22.230> the<00:05:22.500> real<00:05:22.920> foam<00:05:23.160> board<00:05:23.340> version

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
higher on the real foam board version

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.250 
higher on the real foam board version
then<00:05:24.240> I'm<00:05:24.330> going<00:05:24.480> to<00:05:24.540> be<00:05:24.630> building<00:05:24.840> and<00:05:25.170> make

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
then I'm going to be building and make

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.790 
then I'm going to be building and make
an<00:05:25.350> RC<00:05:25.680> plane<00:05:25.710> so<00:05:26.670> hopefully<00:05:26.940> it<00:05:27.030> works<00:05:27.150> out

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
an RC plane so hopefully it works out

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.260 
an RC plane so hopefully it works out
this<00:05:28.800> one<00:05:29.010> the<00:05:29.160> test<00:05:29.400> glide<00:05:29.610> kind<00:05:29.940> of<00:05:30.030> went<00:05:30.210> a

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
this one the test glide kind of went a

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.880 
this one the test glide kind of went a
little<00:05:30.390> bit<00:05:30.540> funny<00:05:30.780> because<00:05:30.960> the<00:05:31.140> wing<00:05:31.320> area<00:05:31.530> I

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
little bit funny because the wing area I

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.350 
little bit funny because the wing area I
mean<00:05:32.370> not<00:05:32.460> the<00:05:32.610> wing<00:05:32.730> area<00:05:32.880> but<00:05:33.060> the<00:05:33.150> front

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
mean not the wing area but the front

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.090 
mean not the wing area but the front
fuselage<00:05:33.780> area<00:05:34.020> was<00:05:34.140> pretty<00:05:34.440> wide<00:05:34.710> so<00:05:34.980> i<00:05:35.040> think

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
fuselage area was pretty wide so i think

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.970 
fuselage area was pretty wide so i think
it<00:05:35.310> made<00:05:35.520> a<00:05:35.550> little<00:05:35.760> wobbly<00:05:36.170> so<00:05:37.170> i<00:05:37.200> may<00:05:37.530> extend

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
it made a little wobbly so i may extend

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.580 
it made a little wobbly so i may extend
the<00:05:38.250> bottom<00:05:38.700> vertical<00:05:39.090> stabilizer<00:05:39.600> down<00:05:40.320> just

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
the bottom vertical stabilizer down just

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
the bottom vertical stabilizer down just
a<00:05:40.650> little<00:05:40.770> bit<00:05:40.890> because<00:05:41.220> i<00:05:41.430> actually

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
a little bit because i actually

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.760 
a little bit because i actually
shortened<00:05:42.210> it<00:05:42.300> from<00:05:42.960> what<00:05:43.110> the<00:05:43.200> real<00:05:43.380> one<00:05:43.590> was

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
shortened it from what the real one was

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.620 
shortened it from what the real one was
but<00:05:44.490> i<00:05:44.520> might<00:05:44.730> bring<00:05:45.000> it<00:05:45.120> back<00:05:45.240> down<00:05:45.420> to

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
but i might bring it back down to

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.230 
but i might bring it back down to
hopefully<00:05:45.780> stabilize<00:05:46.410> it<00:05:46.620> and<00:05:46.740> a<00:05:47.670> glide<00:05:48.210> a

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
hopefully stabilize it and a glide a

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.300 
hopefully stabilize it and a glide a
little<00:05:48.510> bit<00:05:48.600> better<00:05:48.780> i<00:05:49.050> think<00:05:49.590> also<00:05:49.920> once<00:05:50.220> i

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
little bit better i think also once i

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:51.770 
little bit better i think also once i
get<00:05:50.460> to<00:05:50.490> wait<00:05:50.790> in<00:05:50.970> there<00:05:51.090> on<00:05:51.240> the<00:05:51.330> real<00:05:51.480> plane

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
get to wait in there on the real plane

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.470 
get to wait in there on the real plane
it'll<00:05:52.020> help<00:05:52.230> stabilize<00:05:52.770> it<00:05:52.980> but<00:05:53.670> look<00:05:54.240> forward

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:54.480 
it'll help stabilize it but look forward

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.920 
it'll help stabilize it but look forward
to<00:05:54.540> this<00:05:54.630> coming<00:05:54.930> out<00:05:55.130> the<00:05:56.130> the<00:05:56.690> first<00:05:57.690> one<00:05:57.840> on

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
to this coming out the the first one on

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.180 
to this coming out the the first one on
every<00:05:58.050> building<00:05:58.440> is<00:05:58.530> going<00:05:58.620> to<00:05:58.710> just<00:05:59.010> have<00:05:59.160> a

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
every building is going to just have a

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.700 
every building is going to just have a
pusher<00:05:59.640> motor<00:05:59.820> prop<00:06:00.120> on<00:06:00.330> the<00:06:00.450> back<00:06:00.630> I<00:06:00.930> may

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
pusher motor prop on the back I may

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.410 
pusher motor prop on the back I may
eventually<00:06:01.980> put<00:06:02.280> an<00:06:02.370> actual<00:06:02.670> duck<00:06:02.910> band<00:06:03.150> in<00:06:03.330> it

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:03.420 
eventually put an actual duck band in it

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.420 
eventually put an actual duck band in it
we'll<00:06:03.990> see<00:06:04.140> how<00:06:04.230> it<00:06:04.260> works<00:06:04.440> with<00:06:05.130> the<00:06:05.250> pusher

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
we'll see how it works with the pusher

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.970 
we'll see how it works with the pusher
motor<00:06:05.640> first<00:06:05.910> though<00:06:06.120> and<00:06:06.620> if<00:06:07.620> it<00:06:07.740> works<00:06:07.890> out

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:07.980 
motor first though and if it works out

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.500 
motor first though and if it works out
good<00:06:08.220> look<00:06:08.610> forward<00:06:08.820> to<00:06:08.940> plans<00:06:09.240> for<00:06:09.420> this

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510 
good look forward to plans for this

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.830 
good look forward to plans for this
coming<00:06:09.750> out<00:06:09.960> in<00:06:10.110> the<00:06:10.320> future<00:06:11.450> all<00:06:12.450> right<00:06:12.660> guys

nova<00:06:16.050> extreme<00:06:16.880> basically<00:06:17.880> I<00:06:17.910> was<00:06:18.030> doing<00:06:18.240> some

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.390 
nova extreme basically I was doing some

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.970 
nova extreme basically I was doing some
work<00:06:18.510> on<00:06:18.630> it<00:06:18.780> this<00:06:18.810> weekend<00:06:19.320> it<00:06:19.530> has<00:06:19.770> been

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:19.980 
work on it this weekend it has been

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.340 
work on it this weekend it has been
caught<00:06:20.190> on<00:06:20.220> the<00:06:20.400> back<00:06:20.640> burner<00:06:20.880> because<00:06:21.210> we<00:06:22.110> did

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:22.350 
caught on the back burner because we did

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:23.720 
caught on the back burner because we did
have<00:06:22.530> a<00:06:22.560> heat<00:06:22.830> wave<00:06:22.980> through<00:06:23.340> the<00:06:23.430> whole<00:06:23.550> month

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:23.730 
have a heat wave through the whole month

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.760 
have a heat wave through the whole month
of<00:06:23.790> July<00:06:24.120> and<00:06:24.870> I<00:06:24.960> just<00:06:25.170> really<00:06:25.410> didn't<00:06:25.590> want<00:06:25.740> to

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
of July and I just really didn't want to

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.140 
of July and I just really didn't want to
finish<00:06:25.950> it<00:06:26.130> and<00:06:26.190> fly<00:06:26.370> it<00:06:26.400> in<00:06:26.580> that<00:06:26.700> hot<00:06:26.910> weather

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
finish it and fly it in that hot weather

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.910 
finish it and fly it in that hot weather
the<00:06:28.020> weather<00:06:28.140> is<00:06:28.320> fine<00:06:28.500> i<00:06:28.530> starting<00:06:28.770> to<00:06:28.830> cool

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:28.920 
the weather is fine i starting to cool

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.120 
the weather is fine i starting to cool
down<00:06:28.980> so<00:06:29.430> i'm<00:06:29.520> starting<00:06:29.760> to<00:06:29.790> work<00:06:29.940> on<00:06:30.060> it<00:06:30.330> again

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130 
down so i'm starting to work on it again

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.350 
down so i'm starting to work on it again
i'm<00:06:32.130> hoping<00:06:32.460> to<00:06:32.490> get<00:06:32.580> the<00:06:32.700> plane<00:06:32.850> finished<00:06:33.180> up

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
i'm hoping to get the plane finished up

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.840 
i'm hoping to get the plane finished up
this<00:06:33.720> week<00:06:33.990> and<00:06:34.260> then<00:06:34.860> fly<00:06:35.190> it<00:06:35.250> on<00:06:35.460> next

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:35.850 
this week and then fly it on next

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.270 
this week and then fly it on next
weekend<00:06:36.240> at<00:06:36.479> hermann<00:06:37.020> airport<00:06:37.380> and<00:06:38.040> see<00:06:38.190> how

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 
weekend at hermann airport and see how

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.010 
weekend at hermann airport and see how
the<00:06:38.340> same<00:06:38.580> performs<00:06:39.120> there's<00:06:39.690> not<00:06:39.780> a<00:06:39.810> whole

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 
the same performs there's not a whole

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.910 
the same performs there's not a whole
lot<00:06:40.169> left<00:06:40.410> to<00:06:40.530> really

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:40.920 
lot left to really

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.310 
lot left to really
do<00:06:41.040> I<00:06:41.700> just<00:06:42.270> got<00:06:42.390> to<00:06:42.510> create<00:06:42.780> the<00:06:42.900> elephant's

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:43.320

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.040 
do I just got to create the elephant's
and<00:06:43.680> the<00:06:43.890> vertical<00:06:44.040> stabilizers<00:06:44.790> then<00:06:45.750> I<00:06:45.780> got

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.050 
and the vertical stabilizers then I got

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.130 
and the vertical stabilizers then I got
a<00:06:46.310> pretty<00:06:47.310> much<00:06:47.460> covered<00:06:47.820> with<00:06:48.300> I'm<00:06:48.960> going<00:06:49.080> to

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:49.140 
a pretty much covered with I'm going to

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.750 
a pretty much covered with I'm going to
be<00:06:49.200> using<00:06:49.260> trim<00:06:49.560> coat<00:06:49.710> and<00:06:49.950> ultra<00:06:50.370> coat<00:06:50.550> and

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:50.760 
be using trim coat and ultra coat and

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.750 
be using trim coat and ultra coat and
then<00:06:51.630> put<00:06:52.350> it<00:06:52.440> all<00:06:52.560> together<00:06:52.680> get<00:06:53.220> the<00:06:53.340> bad

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:53.760 
then put it all together get the bad

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.290 
then put it all together get the bad
replaced<00:06:54.290> the<00:06:55.290> ESC<00:06:55.830> and<00:06:56.070> the<00:06:56.340> receiver<00:06:56.730> and<00:06:57.210> I

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 
replaced the ESC and the receiver and I

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.240 
replaced the ESC and the receiver and I
think<00:06:57.480> I'll<00:06:57.540> be<00:06:57.630> ready<00:06:57.810> to<00:06:57.840> go<00:06:57.980> but<00:06:58.980> I<00:06:59.010> did

00:06:59.240 --> 00:06:59.250 
think I'll be ready to go but I did

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:03.140

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.150 
decide to go with the t600 1100 kv motor

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:04.790 
decide to go with the t600 1100 kv motor
that<00:07:03.600> i<00:07:03.660> didn't<00:07:03.840> mention<00:07:03.930> i'm<00:07:04.380> probably<00:07:04.620> going

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 
that i didn't mention i'm probably going

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.860 
that i didn't mention i'm probably going
to<00:07:04.890> be<00:07:04.950> running<00:07:05.160> it<00:07:05.510> initially<00:07:06.510> maybe<00:07:06.690> on<00:07:06.840> a

to be running it initially maybe on a
five<00:07:07.110> cell<00:07:07.410> but<00:07:07.740> my<00:07:07.860> goal<00:07:08.340> is<00:07:08.520> to<00:07:08.610> run<00:07:08.730> on<00:07:08.880> the

six cell lipo battery that calculated
out<00:07:12.060> to<00:07:12.210> roughly<00:07:12.390> about<00:07:12.570> 220<00:07:13.260> miles<00:07:13.380> an<00:07:13.500> hour
