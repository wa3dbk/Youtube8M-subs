robotics facility now and army wise well
not<00:00:22.470> much<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.920> difference<00:00:23.279> 69<00:00:23.820> 79<00:00:24.300> I<00:00:24.480> mean

not much of a difference 69 79 I mean
it's<00:00:24.840> 10<00:00:25.140> it's<00:00:25.619> not<00:00:25.769> like<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.130> big<00:00:26.310> difference

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
it's 10 it's not like the big difference

and still going only for the really
early<00:00:39.239> units<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:39.899> mean<00:00:40.079> tier<00:00:40.350> 1<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.800> such<00:00:41.010> they

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
early units I mean tier 1 and such they

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.630 
early units I mean tier 1 and such they
still<00:00:42.120> didn't<00:00:42.390> evolve<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.899> anything<00:00:43.260> else

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
still didn't evolve to anything else

still didn't evolve to anything else
finally<00:00:44.690> we<00:00:45.690> see<00:00:45.870> Fox<00:00:46.110> are<00:00:46.350> establishing<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.280> a

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
finally we see Fox are establishing is a

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.520 
finally we see Fox are establishing is a
mineral<00:00:48.059> line<00:00:48.450> here<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.840> he<00:00:48.899> has<00:00:49.020> plenty<00:00:49.320> of

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
mineral line here and he has plenty of

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.830 
mineral line here and he has plenty of
SUVs<00:00:50.010> they're<00:00:50.219> getting<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.940> gas<00:00:51.120> instantly

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
SUVs they're getting the gas instantly

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.869 
SUVs they're getting the gas instantly
up<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.350> meanwhile<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.190> his<00:00:53.370> vice<00:00:53.610> that's

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
up and meanwhile on his vice that's

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.639 
up and meanwhile on his vice that's
already<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.300> starport<00:00:54.750> with<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.140> factory

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
already the starport with that factory

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.459 
already the starport with that factory
and<00:00:56.010> he's<00:00:56.520> getting<00:00:56.699> built<00:00:57.059> now<00:00:57.300> more<00:00:57.690> racks<00:00:58.079> to

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
and he's getting built now more racks to

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.889 
and he's getting built now more racks to
more<00:00:58.680> XO<00:00:59.070> five<00:00:59.579> racks<00:00:59.850> playing<00:01:00.270> coming<00:01:00.690> pretty

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
more XO five racks playing coming pretty

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.770 
more XO five racks playing coming pretty
soon<00:01:00.989> while<00:01:01.710> tested<00:01:02.250> apparently<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.210> placing

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
soon while tested apparently is placing

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.440 
soon while tested apparently is placing
himself<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.920> location<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.729> think<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.240> just

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
himself on this location I think is just

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.600 
himself on this location I think is just
strategically<00:01:06.689> placing<00:01:07.560> himself<00:01:07.860> here<00:01:08.250> to

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
strategically placing himself here to

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.730 
strategically placing himself here to
intercept<00:01:09.090> any<00:01:09.360> kind<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.900> wave<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.470> folks

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
intercept any kind of wave that folks

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.399 
intercept any kind of wave that folks
that<00:01:10.890> might<00:01:11.040> try<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.400> go<00:01:11.610> on<00:01:12.000> his<00:01:12.479> face<00:01:12.689> keep<00:01:13.260> in

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
this one and meanwhile on Fox's base

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.359 
this one and meanwhile on Fox's base
there's<00:01:22.080> already<00:01:22.259> mortals<00:01:22.979> coming<00:01:23.220> out<00:01:23.340> of

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
there's already mortals coming out of

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.670 
there's already mortals coming out of
that<00:01:23.490> robotics<00:01:24.119> facility<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.990> meanwhile<00:01:25.560> on

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
that robotics facility and meanwhile on

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.080 
that robotics facility and meanwhile on
his<00:01:25.830> main<00:01:26.100> base<00:01:26.310> what<00:01:26.490> else<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.759> he<00:01:26.880> building

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
his main base what else is he building

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.660 
his main base what else is he building
robotics<00:01:28.049> by<00:01:28.229> for<00:01:28.470> some<00:01:28.590> colossi<00:01:29.130> play<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.490> the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
robotics by for some colossi play in the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.700 
robotics by for some colossi play in the
future<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.600> twilight<00:01:30.990> council<00:01:31.560> as<00:01:31.680> well

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
future and the twilight council as well

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.730 
future and the twilight council as well
so<00:01:32.670> am<00:01:32.909> i<00:01:33.240> think<00:01:34.020> it's<00:01:34.170> just<00:01:34.350> starting<00:01:34.710> to

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
so am i think it's just starting to

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.190 
so am i think it's just starting to
divert<00:01:35.310> his<00:01:35.579> army<00:01:35.970> maybe<00:01:36.600> we<00:01:36.780> want<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.049> see

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
divert his army maybe we want to see

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.039 
divert his army maybe we want to see
some<00:01:37.520> templar<00:01:38.520> would<00:01:38.759> be<00:01:38.909> nice<00:01:39.119> high<00:01:39.570> templars

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
some templar would be nice high templars

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.660 
some templar would be nice high templars
against<00:01:40.530> this<00:01:40.619> marine<00:01:40.950> marauder<00:01:41.100> balls<00:01:41.520> with

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
against this marine marauder balls with

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.819 
against this marine marauder balls with
the<00:01:41.700> size<00:01:42.000> storm<00:01:42.299> are<00:01:42.479> very<00:01:43.020> very<00:01:43.290> effective

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
the size storm are very very effective

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.460 
the size storm are very very effective
and<00:01:44.340> from<00:01:44.880> what<00:01:45.060> i<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.210> see<00:01:45.390> foxer<00:01:46.049> doesn't

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
and from what i can see foxer doesn't

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.530 
and from what i can see foxer doesn't
like<00:01:46.619> mac<00:01:46.920> if<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.610> just<00:01:47.880> build<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.360> factory

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
like mac if you just build the factory

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.569 
like mac if you just build the factory
to<00:01:48.960> use<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.259> for<00:01:49.439> scouting<00:01:49.740> purposes<00:01:50.340> it's

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
to use it for scouting purposes it's

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
of the warp gates and i think this might

be<00:06:23.610> GG<00:06:24.060> for<00:06:24.539> them<00:06:24.780> for<00:06:25.530> tester<00:06:26.010> is<00:06:26.370> me<00:06:26.699> and

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
be GG for them for tester is me and

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.089 
be GG for them for tester is me and
