00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.280
 today probably meet the drivers 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.770
 who are not familiar with the system 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.310
 remote opening and 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.690
 door closing 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.160
 so-called central locking 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.450
 comes as standard 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.760
 most modern 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.239
 cars 

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:14.359
 the thing is generally reliable and almost 

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:16.800
 flawlessly but what if convenient 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.800
 the device suddenly begin to stubborn 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:22.819
 perhaps the most common 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:25.429
 the cause of the deterioration of the central 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:26.159
 the castle 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:28.349
 is the gradual extinction of me 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.169
 communicator which has keys installed 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.019
 Ignition or attached to it 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:33.320
 habits 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.240
 if the range of the system 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.220
 decreased for what you have to 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.969
 get close to the car 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.820
 Guarantor It's not time to change the mini batteries 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.810
 just in case it is useful to know where on 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.540
 your machine is and the larvae 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.090
 usually locks 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.040
 and how to get to the hidden in 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.719
 some electronic keys 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.510
 spare metal complaints 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.490
 from time to time at least twice a month 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.140
 useful to grease the larvae of the castle 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.229
 trunk 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:00.180
 and driver's door lock 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.350
 it's enough to put a pair of top three 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.400
 oil droplets on the work surface 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.350
 then 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.780
 submit several times and 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.330
 pull out the key at the same time checking the ease 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.200
 trigger mechanism 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.730
 I wonder what the metal part 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.780
 key which is located grooves 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.170
 usually made of 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.979
 softer material and than 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.160
 the insides of the ignition lock itself 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.080
 for this reason worn out 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.240
 key properly including instruments and 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.490
 start but at the right time and it will be impossible 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.070
 is open 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.080
 door lock and trunk 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.640
 if the biologist refused and the outer lock 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.050
 stubborn take advantage 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.940
 spare key or as already mentioned 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.040
 replace battery earlier 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.760
 handicraft system installed 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.060
 remote opening 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.009
 door closing occurs 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.429
 incorrect servo adjustment and not 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:47.920
 correct end setting 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.130
 circuit breakers 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.960
 if the installation was done carelessly 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.120
 carelessly 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.890
 then the castle will either bite or 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.670
 spontaneously open 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.460
 in order to reveal a marriage sometimes 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.900
 good enough 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.050
 hassle of water and politics 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.990
 poorly debugged mechanism right there 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.470
 will open 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.160
 I hope such basic knowledge 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.140
 help you calmly exploit 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.489
 car and enjoy it
