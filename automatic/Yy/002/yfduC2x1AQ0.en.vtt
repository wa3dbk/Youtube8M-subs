00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.690
 hello and welcome to this video one of 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.520
 Achilles Heels Wii As 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.160
 we know all have always been his 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.779
 online features many of the 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.110
 games in implementing the online options 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.509
 later and dragged and others despite 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.360
 have online options at this point in 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.190
 wii are totally dead in this 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.930
 I will show you video according to my own 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.520
 personal opinion the best games 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.399
 online for wii that follow completely 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.899
 operatives today there have been games 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.910
 best online of those that appear in 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:47.680
 this video but many of them by 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.180
 Unfortunately they have been totally empty 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.190
 of players so your options 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.180
 online are more of adornment than of 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.180
 real feature 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.850
 mario kart wii incombustible from his 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.160
 launch in the past 2008 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.629
 possibly the most used game 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.540
 in the servers of the wi-fi connection 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.850
 of nintendo in fact mario kart wii was 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.009
 the first game in wii to use its 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.320
 online platform and since then it has not 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.119
 stopped this mario that represents a 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.250
 sure bet in terms of fun and 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.380
 playability and like equally 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.479
 those who are both enthusiastic and 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.399
 not the speed games is a 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.680
 game that with a carefree online and 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.320
 fun, it will be difficult for us to get bored 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.789
 The only thing that can be explained in how many online is 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.070
 the fact of meeting people who 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.990
 use traps that try waters 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.060
 our games with their blue shells 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.060
 stars and other infinite objects 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.970
 goldeneye 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.650
 that remake that came to fulfill the 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.490
 expectations of the classic game for 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.049
 nintendo 64 with its same name today in 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.020
 day are line is still pretty 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:56.330
 full we found online modes for 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.399
 up to 8 players and a range system 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.200
 similar to what we can find in the 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.880
 call of duty where we will accumulate 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.880
 experience to unlock new 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.649
 weapons and skills in his time was 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.929
 considered as a mashup of the games 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.640
 multiplayer and still worth it 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.650
 take a look at it either by the 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.650
 nostalgia or for the good price that it has 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.510
 tatsunoko vs capcom 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.040
 the inclusion of online mode in this 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.799
 Traditional fighting game is the 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.209
 ideal complement to the arcade mode I have 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.610
 surprised the ease to find 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.680
 an adversary in this game because although 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.450
 the game is not very old has little more 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.640
 of two years in europe if badly I do not 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.680
 I'm wrong although your Japanese version I think 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.660
 that was released more than four that 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.209
 yes no online mode I expected it 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.040
 find much more desert in this 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.200
 capcom game if we have found a 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.329
 online mode very fluid without lag and 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.980
 quite balanced and that deserves 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.510
 sorry to have our library of games 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.470
 if we like fighting games 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.470
 traditional 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.650
 monster hunter tri a game with a level 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.660
 impressive technical and playability 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.880
 of film 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.650
 we can interact with others 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.410
 three players online through the 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.210
 nintendo wi-fi connection 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.980
 in this way we will combine our 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.540
 forces with other players of our 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.550
 list of friends or with hunters 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.290
 strangers that we will meet in the great 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.050
 city of the blacks to begin 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.030
 our missions monster hunter tri is 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.010
 possibly one of the best games 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.110
 that can offer a full experience 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.770
 online in the desktop console 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.660
 nintendo the only downside is its price that 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:38.250
 despite having his years is still 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.250
 almost at the same launch price 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.630
 call of duty modern warfare 3 remember 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.340
 that you can see the details in 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.430
 depth in the analysis that you 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.709
 dedicate to this game on this same channel 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.180
 together with mario kart is possibly the 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.730
 game where more people are 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.859
 playing online in wii we will find 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.599
 with games of up to 10 players with 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:05.430
 many game modes although it's more 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:08.159
 usual are usually the all against 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.629
 all the battles by teams the time 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:11.760
 invested in online translates into 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:14.219
 rewards with access to improvements and other 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.019
 weapons creating a very multiplayer game 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:17.850
 fun and addictive turning it 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.199
 possibly in the best game of his 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.199
 genre for the wii console 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.240
 pro evolution soccer with this game I 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.160
 I've taken a surprise because I 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.840
 I expected to find a lot more full of 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.940
 what I found it to be the only 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.340
 Decent online soccer game there 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.500
 currently in wii there are not so many people 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.660
 as in other games but if possible 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.870
 find people playing online and do not know 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.670
 makes it very difficult to find a game 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.260
 that if we should get used to it 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.230
 if we are better than our adversary 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.050
 these as a rule will be disconnected 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.070
 and they will leave us halfway 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.200
 remember that you can see the analysis 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:59.670
 complete as well as a comparison with 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.670
 fifa on this same channel 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.490
 As for Wiiware, it's not like there's 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.180
 many games with online possibilities 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.400
 but there are two to highlight if we want 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.380
 fast games and we do not want to spend 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.160
 a lot of money you have to have two games in 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:19.410
 Doctor Mario and the bomberman 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.690
 we like this type of games nowadays 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.759
 there are many wisin people playing online 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.220
 these titles and its a complement 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:28.110
 perfect for its low price and for that 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.370
 quick game to kill a little the 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.889
 weather 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.110
 online multiplayer games there were many 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:35.610
 better formerly but many of the 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.010
 that I have been testing were 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.620
 empty and that's why you can not consider 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.900
 that today they really have 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.190
 online possibilities still so always 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.990
 There may be some that I have 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.030
 escaped if so 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.470
 leave a comment in this video or leave 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.470
 a comment for anything else
