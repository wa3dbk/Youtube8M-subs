00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.270
 Piedmontese salad with apple salad 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.710
 of earth a real classic but what is 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.940
 what's good with a little trick 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.320
 to make it a little bit more 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.820
 light to those like a series that holds 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.500
 to the body what is good then 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.520
 we're going there we're accusing apples 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.080
 in field dress 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.710
 here for the peel and up there 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.240
 quickly I said delighted we will 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.410
 dice fairly thick anyway 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.820
 because we really need to be able to 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.710
 mix with the sauce so for fact 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.820
 to help more or less regular 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.890
 the interest is to have a little bit 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.420
 dropped different textures here we go 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.830
 go that's done because the manna years is 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.810
 super nice what we will put all 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.310
 ingredients in we have lots of people 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.360
 go because it's a little bit 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.710
 cheaper and then it ends on 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.790
 cubes a little bit thick we can 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.960
 take slices but there on the 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.090
 heel we're going to have a centimeter 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.150
 thick will have nice tubes to 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.550
 hard single cube clan devices 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.190
 and in the salad we mix everything 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.230
 so after we do it I go to 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.000
 my key in that way you will 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.550
 mixed as long as you 're not going 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.450
 not everything crushed then the tomatoes munched 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.079
 a little knife to a man who is 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.600
 really top 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.950
 for tomatoes it can be cut 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.120
 the skin without feeling any problem 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.460
 and the same I do Cubans little bit 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.470
 rude tomatoes and tomatoes and 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.000
 especially we keep juice because in fact 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.820
 it will be absorbed by the apples of 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.060
 Earth 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.680
 she is in December at war 2 in two 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.740
 years in I think we took to 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.150
 it's your stuff we're also dead 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.800
 or so we go with some 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.680
 pickles 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.880
 this is an admirable way 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.190
 conditions for trenches 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.270
 so it's done it's optional but 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.979
 I buy myself to deliver very 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.680
 raw onions from all this 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.300
 gives off pep freshness grants 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.590
 championship very well also a good 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.170
 Piedmontese is due either a little bit 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.630
 summertime it's going to happen in the sauce 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.210
 also antennas and here I add some 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.350
 platinum full my contract that's fine 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.580
 to dry and we will crush it 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.490
 really we see the facebook and the 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:54.830
 taste of the father if you went in May the 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.250
 herbs pickles and onions 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.259
 then the source 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.460
 the sotra for the noyonnaise in 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.690
 the agreement will add a little bit of 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.080
 vinegar what to keep two 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:08.880
 slightly acidic that you claim to 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.780
 mayo add a little water and 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.979
 blow you have like a thing 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.209
 salad dressing sure something 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.010
 really liquid then worry 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.600
 it's not going to be drunk by apples from 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.820
 earth that by cooling to absorb 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.620
 the water so we go we are on then 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.850
 we will put the sauce then the apples 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.980
 are doing really well 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.900
 absorbed under this company you will have 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.950
 a room is very connected and now we 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.579
 will rectify the seasoning 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.650
 then rectified only we will add 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:33.690
 mill pepper or a little bit of 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.299
 espelette pepper and espelette cocoa 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.860
 and then fleur de sel so proceso is 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.299
 made and potatoes have invested 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.850
 as you already have these areas is and 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.240
 to season tomatoes 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.460
 since the raid of network solutions 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.830
 and then you gently stir 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.090
 raise and we bring back you saw we have 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.950
 put a very liquid source yet is 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.910
 there is public and the potato 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.770
 start to absorb it 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.900
 the more you will not do it the 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.130
 vence more you can add two 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.380
 refrigerator hours to have a 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.040
 keynote is very cool and enjoy the 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.040
