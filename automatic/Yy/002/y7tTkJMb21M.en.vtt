I<00:00:03.360> think<00:00:04.360> one<00:00:04.510> of<00:00:04.540> the<00:00:04.690> reasons<00:00:04.870> people<00:00:05.170> don't

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:05.529 
I think one of the reasons people don't

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:09.730 
got a method that works really quickly

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.810 
got a method that works really quickly
it<00:00:10.480> just<00:00:10.810> takes<00:00:11.110> too<00:00:11.440> long<00:00:11.470> and<00:00:11.980> the<00:00:12.460> ones<00:00:12.640> at

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:12.820 
it just takes too long and the ones at

it just takes too long and the ones at
the<00:00:12.850> store<00:00:13.210> are<00:00:13.330> pretty<00:00:13.570> cheap<00:00:13.630> but<00:00:14.080> I'm<00:00:14.590> going

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
to show you a trick I picked up here um

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.259 
to show you a trick I picked up here um
you<00:00:17.710> know<00:00:17.830> I<00:00:18.039> always<00:00:18.550> believe<00:00:18.970> in<00:00:18.999> using

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:19.269 
you know I always believe in using

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.210 
you know I always believe in using
whatever<00:00:19.630> technique<00:00:20.230> does<00:00:20.470> it<00:00:20.619> the<00:00:20.740> best<00:00:20.919> and

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
whatever technique does it the best and

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.419 
whatever technique does it the best and
I<00:00:22.179> did<00:00:22.659> pick<00:00:22.900> up<00:00:23.050> this<00:00:23.320> tortilla<00:00:23.679> press<00:00:23.949> which

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:24.429 
I did pick up this tortilla press which

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:26.159 
I did pick up this tortilla press which
strangely<00:00:24.880> enough<00:00:25.239> works<00:00:25.539> amazingly<00:00:26.079> well

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:26.169 
strangely enough works amazingly well

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.439 
strangely enough works amazingly well
for<00:00:26.529> these<00:00:26.650> things<00:00:26.919> there<00:00:27.579> is<00:00:27.699> a<00:00:27.730> trick<00:00:28.089> for<00:00:28.329> it

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:28.449 
for these things there is a trick for it

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:30.839 
for these things there is a trick for it
this<00:00:28.929> dough<00:00:29.140> is<00:00:29.349> really<00:00:29.769> really<00:00:30.039> soft<00:00:30.310> so<00:00:30.640> what

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:30.849 
this dough is really really soft so what

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.030 
this dough is really really soft so what
you<00:00:30.999> do<00:00:31.239> is<00:00:31.449> just<00:00:32.230> pull<00:00:32.590> off<00:00:32.619> a<00:00:33.540> little<00:00:34.540> bit

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
you do is just pull off a little bit

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.480 
you do is just pull off a little bit
about<00:00:36.040> the<00:00:36.220> size<00:00:36.490> of<00:00:36.790> a<00:00:37.450> large<00:00:37.690> marble<00:00:38.220> drop<00:00:39.220> it

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:39.490 
about the size of a large marble drop it

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.320 
about the size of a large marble drop it
into<00:00:39.960> some<00:00:40.960> flour<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:42.340> coat<00:00:42.370> it<00:00:42.640> completely

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.330 
into some flour to coat it completely

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.880 
into some flour to coat it completely
because<00:00:43.600> if<00:00:43.840> you<00:00:43.960> don't<00:00:44.230> it's<00:00:44.470> going<00:00:44.620> to<00:00:44.680> gum

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
because if you don't it's going to gum

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.540 
because if you don't it's going to gum
up<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:45.040> tortilla<00:00:45.490> press<00:00:45.730> right<00:00:46.120> away<00:00:46.330> okay

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
up the tortilla press right away okay

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:55.340 
up the tortilla press right away okay
then<00:00:48.550> open<00:00:48.880> it<00:00:48.940> up<00:00:51.690> press<00:00:52.690> a<00:00:52.720> clot<00:00:53.910> there<00:00:54.910> is

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
then open it up press a clot there is

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.010 
then open it up press a clot there is
your<00:00:56.350> semi<00:00:56.680> prepared<00:00:57.280> skin<00:00:57.730> which<00:00:58.570> at<00:00:58.810> this

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
your semi prepared skin which at this

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.310 
your semi prepared skin which at this
point<00:00:59.170> just<00:01:00.040> use<00:01:00.340> your<00:01:00.370> fingers<00:01:00.760> to<00:01:01.079> pinch<00:01:02.079> it

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
point just use your fingers to pinch it

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.300 
point just use your fingers to pinch it
around<00:01:02.770> the<00:01:03.280> edges<00:01:03.460> and<00:01:03.970> stretch<00:01:04.900> it<00:01:04.930> and<00:01:05.379> I

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
around the edges and stretch it and I

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.570 
around the edges and stretch it and I
think<00:01:06.369> you<00:01:06.730> can<00:01:06.909> see<00:01:08.070> where<00:01:09.070> I'm<00:01:09.220> going<00:01:09.550> with

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
think you can see where I'm going with

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.830 
think you can see where I'm going with
this<00:01:09.760> it's<00:01:10.270> thinner<00:01:11.760> at<00:01:12.760> the<00:01:13.150> edges<00:01:13.360> than<00:01:13.690> it

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
this it's thinner at the edges than it

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.960 
this it's thinner at the edges than it
is<00:01:13.960> in<00:01:14.140> the<00:01:14.200> middle<00:01:14.470> and<00:01:14.730> you<00:01:15.730> can<00:01:15.850> get<00:01:15.940> a

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
is in the middle and you can get a

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.890 
is in the middle and you can get a
fairly<00:01:16.390> large<00:01:16.570> dumpling<00:01:17.170> out<00:01:17.590> of<00:01:17.770> this<00:01:17.890> okay

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
fairly large dumpling out of this okay

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.500 
fairly large dumpling out of this okay
so<00:01:19.900> once<00:01:20.110> you've<00:01:20.290> got<00:01:20.500> your<00:01:20.530> skin<00:01:20.979> ready<00:01:21.510> just

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
so once you've got your skin ready just

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.560 
so once you've got your skin ready just
grab<00:01:22.780> a<00:01:22.810> spoon<00:01:23.229> filling<00:01:26.940> that<00:01:27.940> might<00:01:28.180> be<00:01:28.390> a

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
grab a spoon filling that might be a

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.990 
grab a spoon filling that might be a
little<00:01:28.870> too<00:01:28.960> much<00:01:29.320> we'll<00:01:30.310> find<00:01:30.610> out<00:01:30.760> in<00:01:30.940> a

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
little too much we'll find out in a

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.500 
little too much we'll find out in a
minute<00:01:31.180> and<00:01:32.310> then<00:01:33.310> what<00:01:33.549> you<00:01:33.580> do<00:01:33.909> is<00:01:34.180> you<00:01:34.680> pull

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
minute and then what you do is you pull

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:44.460 
minute and then what you do is you pull
up<00:01:37.620> and<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:41.590> pinch<00:01:42.040> the<00:01:42.130> edges<00:01:43.140> if<00:01:44.140> it<00:01:44.260> gets

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
up and just pinch the edges if it gets

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.500 
up and just pinch the edges if it gets
out<00:01:44.620> of<00:01:44.680> hand<00:01:44.830> just<00:01:45.460> push<00:01:45.790> it<00:01:45.820> back<00:01:46.150> in<00:01:46.360> with

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
out of hand just push it back in with

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.770 
out of hand just push it back in with

them done and like i said if you don't

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.699 
them done and like i said if you don't
have<00:02:24.800> it<00:02:24.830> turn<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.190> your<00:02:25.310> press<00:02:26.349> just<00:02:27.349> start

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
have it turn to your press just start

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.229 
have it turn to your press just start
them<00:02:27.890> off<00:02:27.980> either<00:02:28.280> by<00:02:28.520> squeezing<00:02:28.880> them<00:02:29.090> by

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
them off either by squeezing them by

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.320 
them off either by squeezing them by
hand<00:02:29.510> use<00:02:30.410> a<00:02:30.500> little<00:02:30.739> rolling<00:02:31.040> pin<00:02:31.280> what<00:02:32.209> is

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
hand use a little rolling pin what is

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.350 
hand use a little rolling pin what is
important<00:02:32.930> i<00:02:33.140> think<00:02:33.560> is<00:02:34.069> that<00:02:34.130> you<00:02:35.030> squeeze

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
important i think is that you squeeze

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.840 
important i think is that you squeeze
them<00:02:35.720> and<00:02:35.959> turn<00:02:36.410> them<00:02:36.440> by<00:02:36.770> hand<00:02:37.040> which<00:02:37.700> is

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
them and turn them by hand which is

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.699 
them and turn them by hand which is
pretty<00:02:38.030> quick<00:02:38.390> once<00:02:38.810> you<00:02:38.989> get<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.230> document

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
pretty quick once you get the document

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.830 
pretty quick once you get the document
and<00:02:39.830> then<00:02:40.459> you<00:02:40.550> can<00:02:40.730> see<00:02:40.940> here<00:02:41.269> because<00:02:41.569> of<00:02:41.780> the

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
and then you can see here because of the

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.470 
and then you can see here because of the
time<00:02:42.050> of<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.230> day<00:02:42.470> you<00:02:43.340> can<00:02:43.550> see<00:02:43.850> against<00:02:44.360> the

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
time of the day you can see against the

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.850 
time of the day you can see against the
light<00:02:44.690> that<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.080> edges<00:02:45.410> are<00:02:45.530> actually

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
light that the edges are actually

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.400 
light that the edges are actually
thinner<00:02:46.069> than<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.300> middle<00:02:47.510> now<00:02:48.140> what<00:02:48.380> happens

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
thinner than the middle now what happens

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.740 
thinner than the middle now what happens
with<00:02:49.010> this<00:02:49.130> is<00:02:49.310> when<00:02:49.459> you<00:02:49.550> fold<00:02:49.790> them<00:02:49.970> up<00:02:50.120> so

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
with this is when you fold them up so

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.479 
with this is when you fold them up so
this<00:02:50.930> is<00:02:50.959> twice<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.319> thickness<00:02:51.620> of<00:02:51.950> here<00:02:52.310> and

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
this is twice the thickness of here and

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.940 
this is twice the thickness of here and
when<00:02:52.940> you<00:02:53.030> fold<00:02:53.209> it<00:02:53.360> up<00:02:53.510> then<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:54.560> thickness

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
when you fold it up then the thickness

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:05.620 
when you fold it up then the thickness
is<00:02:55.069> even<00:02:55.340> all<00:02:55.459> around<00:02:58.390> so<00:02:59.390> another<00:02:59.690> spin<00:03:04.630> pinch

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
is even all around so another spin pinch

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.460 
is even all around so another spin pinch
in<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:05.900> middle<00:03:07.630> pinch<00:03:08.630> it<00:03:08.780> down<00:03:08.989> to<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:09.290> end

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
in the middle pinch it down to the end

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.580 
in the middle pinch it down to the end
turn<00:03:09.980> around<00:03:10.480> push<00:03:11.480> back<00:03:11.750> any<00:03:12.080> filling<00:03:12.470> that

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
turn around push back any filling that

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:19.610 
turn around push back any filling that
comes<00:03:12.890> out

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.150 

and<00:03:19.950> then<00:03:20.489> make<00:03:20.670> your<00:03:20.819> please
