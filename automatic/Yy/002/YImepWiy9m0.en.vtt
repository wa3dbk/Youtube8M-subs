00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.380 
are quite simply it will not be coming
to<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.990> game<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.590> leaves<00:01:37.799> one<00:01:38.070> question

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
to the game so that leaves one question

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.090 
to the game so that leaves one question
what<00:01:39.390> could<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:39.810> score<00:01:40.140> streak<00:01:40.409> possibly

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
what could this score streak possibly

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.190 
what could this score streak possibly
bleah<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.520> think<00:01:42.180> personally<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.810> it's<00:01:43.079> going

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
bleah I think personally that it's going

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.719 
bleah I think personally that it's going
to<00:01:43.259> be<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.530> sentry<00:01:43.979> gun<00:01:44.130> we've<00:01:44.340> seen<00:01:44.579> the

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
to be the sentry gun we've seen the

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.910 
to be the sentry gun we've seen the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
modern warfare 2 it's been a very stable

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.950

call of duty title since that time and
quite<00:01:54.720> simply<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.380> do<00:01:55.439> believe<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.579> will

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
quite simply I do believe that it will

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.910 
quite simply I do believe that it will
be<00:01:56.850> coming<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.509> call<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.899> duty<00:01:58.170> black<00:01:58.350> ops<00:01:58.560> 3

be coming to call of duty black ops 3

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.740 
be coming to call of duty black ops 3
now<00:01:59.430> what<00:01:59.640> do<00:01:59.729> people<00:02:00.060> think<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.509> this<00:02:00.689> is

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
now what do people think that this is

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.480 
now what do people think that this is
higher<00:02:01.140> than<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.469> mothership<00:02:01.950> because<00:02:02.340> it's

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
higher than the mothership because it's

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.670 
higher than the mothership because it's
indeed<00:02:02.880> past<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.509> mother<00:02:03.689> ship<00:02:03.960> in<00:02:04.140> terms<00:02:04.469> of

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
indeed past the mother ship in terms of

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.170 
indeed past the mother ship in terms of

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060

the score streaks that was revealed at
e3<00:02:11.370> we<00:02:12.180> can<00:02:12.360> clearly<00:02:12.599> see<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:12.870> six

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
e3 we can clearly see that six

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.230 
e3 we can clearly see that six
the<00:02:13.650> killstreaks<00:02:14.160> was<00:02:14.340> indeed<00:02:14.670> hidden<00:02:15.060> and

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
the killstreaks was indeed hidden and

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.960 
the killstreaks was indeed hidden and
was<00:02:15.840> so-called<00:02:16.290> pasta<00:02:17.100> mothership<00:02:17.580> so<00:02:17.760> this

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
was so-called pasta mothership so this

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.090 
was so-called pasta mothership so this
means<00:02:18.180> nothing<00:02:18.780> in<00:02:18.900> terms<00:02:19.110> of<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.560> games<00:02:19.830> come
