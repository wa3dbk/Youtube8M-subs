are<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.810> same<00:02:34.989> throughout<00:02:35.409> you<00:02:35.709> just<00:02:35.890> go

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
are the same throughout you just go

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.199 
are the same throughout you just go
through<00:02:36.310> playing<00:02:36.549> through<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.909> career

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
through playing through the career

through playing through the career
unlocking<00:02:37.780> cars<00:02:38.019> and<00:02:38.650> what<00:02:39.129> there<00:02:39.280> is<00:02:39.370> there's

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
unlocking cars and what there is there's

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.630 
unlocking cars and what there is there's
three<00:02:39.909> ways<00:02:39.939> to<00:02:40.239> win<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.720> game<00:02:41.069> run<00:02:42.069> over<00:02:42.400> all

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
three ways to win the game run over all

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.240 
three ways to win the game run over all
the<00:02:42.790> pedestrians<00:02:43.349> waste<00:02:44.349> all<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.769> opponent

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
the pedestrians waste all the opponent

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.380 
the pedestrians waste all the opponent
or<00:02:45.459> get<00:02:46.180> through<00:02:46.390> all<00:02:46.480> checkpoints

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
or get through all checkpoints

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.300 
or get through all checkpoints
so<00:02:49.080> basically<00:02:49.350> it's<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.530> clean<00:02:49.740> buddy<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.250> way

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
so basically it's a clean buddy the way

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.160 
so basically it's a clean buddy the way

there<00:03:43.770> was<00:03:43.860> a<00:03:44.000> Kickstarter<00:03:45.000> for<00:03:45.030> that<00:03:45.270> project

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510
