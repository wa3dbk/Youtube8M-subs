down here I would have got the backs of

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.260 
down here I would have got the backs of
the<00:01:15.960> vessel<00:01:16.289> okay<00:01:16.560> great<00:01:17.210> now

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
the vessel okay great now

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.599 
the vessel okay great now
the<00:01:19.689> most<00:01:19.869> interesting<00:01:20.350> thing<00:01:20.500> I<00:01:20.560> think<00:01:20.619> is<00:01:20.950> if

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:21.609 
the most interesting thing I think is if

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:23.520 
the most interesting thing I think is if
you<00:01:21.820> have<00:01:21.850> it<00:01:22.179> pump<00:01:22.509> like<00:01:22.719> this<00:01:22.750> yeah<00:01:23.320> I<00:01:23.350> the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
you have it pump like this yeah I the

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.200 
you have it pump like this yeah I the
queen<00:01:23.740> here<00:01:24.130> in<00:01:24.159> the<00:01:24.310> Queen<00:01:24.520> year<00:01:24.759> yeah<00:01:25.000> you

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
queen here in the Queen year yeah you

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
get to Queen four vessels okay I guess

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.520

it<00:01:28.000> goes<00:01:28.360> through<00:01:28.689> that's<00:01:28.869> great<00:01:29.140> so<00:01:29.289> you<00:01:29.380> can

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
it goes through that's great so you can

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.590 
it goes through that's great so you can
hit<00:01:29.619> it<00:01:29.679> multiple<00:01:30.100> times<00:01:30.159> well<00:01:31.149> what's<00:01:31.509> the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
hit it multiple times well what's the

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.510 
hit it multiple times well what's the
most<00:01:31.840> that<00:01:32.350> you<00:01:32.380> commit<00:01:32.710> one<00:01:32.740> or<00:01:33.100> do<00:01:33.310> we<00:01:33.399> know
