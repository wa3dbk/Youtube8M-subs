00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
figures that i could collect i made up

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.270 
figures that i could collect i made up
my<00:01:41.810> mind<00:01:41.929> right<00:01:42.410> then<00:01:42.649> and<00:01:42.770> there<00:01:42.830> that<00:01:42.950> I<00:01:43.130> was

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
my mind right then and there that I was

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.710 
my mind right then and there that I was
going<00:01:43.399> to<00:01:43.459> try<00:01:43.670> and<00:01:43.700> get<00:01:43.880> them<00:01:44.000> all<00:01:44.119> the<00:01:44.569> one

that<00:01:46.429> with<00:01:47.179> these<00:01:47.420> Titans<00:01:47.959> they're<00:01:48.259> actually

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
that with these Titans they're actually

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.880

blind<00:01:49.130> box<00:01:49.670> figures<00:01:50.270> which<00:01:50.539> means<00:01:51.410> they<00:01:51.649> come

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
blind box figures which means they come

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.160 
blind box figures which means they come

in a sealed windowless box and that

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.440 
in a sealed windowless box and that
means<00:01:54.440> that<00:01:54.619> you<00:01:54.740> can't<00:01:55.039> actually<00:01:55.190> choose<00:01:56.119> the

Doctor Who fans I realized that I wasn't
the<00:02:20.660> only<00:02:20.690> one<00:02:20.959> you<00:02:21.590> see<00:02:21.770> with<00:02:22.010> theirs<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:23.120> think

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
the only one you see with theirs I think

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.730 
the only one you see with theirs I think
there's<00:02:24.079> 16<00:02:24.560> figures<00:02:24.980> in<00:02:25.219> each<00:02:25.610> set<00:02:26.090> if<00:02:26.299> you<00:02:26.510> in

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
there's 16 figures in each set if you in

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.590 
there's 16 figures in each set if you in
include<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.460> I<00:02:27.850> think<00:02:28.120> there's<00:02:28.270> four

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
include the I think there's four

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.830 
include the I think there's four
variants<00:02:29.470> so<00:02:30.340> unless<00:02:31.030> you<00:02:31.240> have<00:02:31.300> x-ray<00:02:31.810> vision

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
variants so unless you have x-ray vision

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.020 
variants so unless you have x-ray vision
then<00:02:32.320> you're<00:02:32.890> going<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.130> need<00:02:33.310> to<00:02:33.340> at<00:02:33.520> least<00:02:33.700> by

then you're going to need to at least by

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.870 
then you're going to need to at least by
i<00:02:34.390> would<00:02:34.780> say<00:02:34.990> 25<00:02:35.740> to<00:02:36.010> 30<00:02:36.310> of<00:02:36.490> them<00:02:36.670> from

i would say 25 to 30 of them from

each one so to me it seemed to be pretty

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.670 
each one so to me it seemed to be pretty
big<00:02:45.060> financial<00:02:46.060> gamble<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.840> go<00:02:46.870> into<00:02:47.530> these

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.290 
when you think about like each of these
little<00:03:01.720> boxes<00:03:02.560> here<00:03:03.010> in<00:03:03.280> australia<00:03:03.760> costs

fifteen dollars retail to buy and i

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.060 
fifteen dollars retail to buy and i
think<00:03:07.300> it's<00:03:07.420> something<00:03:07.600> like<00:03:08.070> something

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
think it's something like something

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.420 
think it's something like something
around<00:03:09.220> about<00:03:09.430> 88<00:03:10.390> pounds<00:03:10.750> in<00:03:11.050> the<00:03:11.140> UK<00:03:11.560> and<00:03:11.920> I

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
around about 88 pounds in the UK and I

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.360 
around about 88 pounds in the UK and I
think<00:03:12.700> it's<00:03:12.820> ten<00:03:13.360> dollars<00:03:13.870> in<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.170> US<00:03:14.650> so

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
think it's ten dollars in the US so

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.000 
think it's ten dollars in the US so
that's<00:03:15.550> a<00:03:15.670> that's<00:03:16.180> a<00:03:16.300> pretty<00:03:16.510> big<00:03:17.170> investment

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
that's a that's a pretty big investment

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.430 
that's a that's a pretty big investment

of these because I do love the designs
and<00:03:31.480> I<00:03:31.600> I<00:03:31.900> think<00:03:32.380> they're<00:03:32.530> great<00:03:32.770> and<00:03:32.980> I<00:03:33.100> I<00:03:33.370> know

exactly where I would put them in my
house<00:03:35.680> yeah<00:03:36.190> so<00:03:36.400> I<00:03:36.430> was<00:03:36.640> pretty<00:03:36.910> upset<00:03:37.000> because

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
know that's a massive risk to taste take

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.930 
know that's a massive risk to taste take
financially<00:03:43.510> speaking<00:03:43.750> so<00:03:44.620> I<00:03:44.950> sat<00:03:45.460> down<00:03:45.490> and<00:03:45.670> I

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
financially speaking so I sat down and I

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.340 
financially speaking so I sat down and I
started<00:03:46.330> to<00:03:46.420> think<00:03:46.450> of<00:03:46.720> ways<00:03:46.870> that<00:03:46.930> I<00:03:47.230> could

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
started to think of ways that I could

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.400 
started to think of ways that I could
reduce<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.700> chances<00:03:49.210> of<00:03:49.270> getting<00:03:49.840> duplicates

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
reduce the chances of getting duplicates

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.860 
reduce the chances of getting duplicates
and<00:03:50.620> I<00:03:51.310> wanted<00:03:51.640> to<00:03:51.760> find<00:03:51.970> out<00:03:52.090> if<00:03:52.270> there<00:03:52.600> was

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:40.569 
you want to buy that

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:42.929 
you want to buy that
that<00:04:40.749> large<00:04:41.080> quantity<00:04:41.619> so<00:04:41.800> that's<00:04:41.979> certainly

00:04:42.929 --> 00:04:42.939 
that large quantity so that's certainly

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:44.879 
that large quantity so that's certainly
something<00:04:43.029> to<00:04:43.360> consider<00:04:43.479> anyway<00:04:44.379> the<00:04:44.529> theory

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
something to consider anyway the theory

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:46.799 
something to consider anyway the theory
is<00:04:44.919> that<00:04:45.129> because<00:04:45.849> you're<00:04:46.210> getting<00:04:46.330> a<00:04:46.539> full

00:04:46.799 --> 00:04:46.809 
is that because you're getting a full

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:49.290 
is that because you're getting a full
case<00:04:47.110> that<00:04:47.949> hasn't<00:04:48.399> kind<00:04:48.669> of<00:04:48.789> had<00:04:48.939> pieces

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
case that hasn't kind of had pieces

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.329 
case that hasn't kind of had pieces
taken<00:04:49.749> out<00:04:50.020> of<00:04:50.169> it<00:04:50.289> by<00:04:50.469> different<00:04:50.830> customers

00:04:51.329 --> 00:04:51.339 
taken out of it by different customers

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:54.959 
taken out of it by different customers
in<00:04:51.550> in<00:04:52.240> a<00:04:52.389> retail<00:04:52.929> store<00:04:53.110> based<00:04:54.099> on<00:04:54.429> if<00:04:54.669> you<00:04:54.819> add

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:54.969 
in in a retail store based on if you add

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:57.389 
in in a retail store based on if you add
up<00:04:54.999> the<00:04:55.509> rarity<00:04:56.020> of<00:04:56.050> each<00:04:56.409> figure<00:04:56.860> as<00:04:57.069> you<00:04:57.279> can

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:57.399 
up the rarity of each figure as you can

00:04:57.399 --> 00:05:00.959 
up the rarity of each figure as you can
see<00:04:57.899> it's<00:04:58.899> actually<00:04:59.229> just<00:04:59.499> on<00:04:59.740> the<00:05:00.339> side<00:05:00.580> of

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:00.969 
see it's actually just on the side of

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:04.260 
see it's actually just on the side of
the<00:05:01.569> box<00:05:01.749> here<00:05:02.439> each<00:05:03.069> um<00:05:03.429> each<00:05:03.639> figure<00:05:03.939> has<00:05:03.969> its

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
the box here each um each figure has its

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.559 
the box here each um each figure has its
own<00:05:04.679> rarity<00:05:05.679> like<00:05:05.860> one<00:05:06.099> in<00:05:06.249> 20<00:05:06.610> and<00:05:06.969> the

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:07.569 
own rarity like one in 20 and the

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:09.659 
own rarity like one in 20 and the
variants<00:05:08.379> are<00:05:08.499> a<00:05:08.529> little<00:05:08.649> bit<00:05:08.800> higher<00:05:08.979> a

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
variants are a little bit higher a

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.029 
variants are a little bit higher a

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 
little bit harder define sorry so based

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:14.129 
little bit harder define sorry so based
on<00:05:12.219> that<00:05:12.279> rarity<00:05:12.909> you<00:05:13.059> should<00:05:13.419> in<00:05:13.659> theory<00:05:13.959> be

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
on that rarity you should in theory be

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:16.920 
on that rarity you should in theory be
able<00:05:14.469> to<00:05:14.559> pretty<00:05:14.860> much<00:05:15.069> be<00:05:15.909> guaranteed<00:05:16.629> to<00:05:16.809> get

the full base set of 12 figures and

the full base set of 12 figures and
maybe<00:05:20.740> a<00:05:21.219> variant<00:05:22.119> or<00:05:22.270> two<00:05:22.479> if<00:05:22.719> you<00:05:22.839> do<00:05:22.990> buy

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:23.259 
maybe a variant or two if you do buy

maybe a variant or two if you do buy
them<00:05:23.499> in<00:05:23.680> a<00:05:23.889> case<00:05:24.099> of<00:05:24.279> 20<00:05:24.550> then<00:05:25.029> if<00:05:25.240> you<00:05:25.330> want<00:05:25.509> to

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:25.569 
them in a case of 20 then if you want to

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:28.079 
them in a case of 20 then if you want to
go<00:05:25.689> and<00:05:26.020> and<00:05:26.379> pick<00:05:26.770> up<00:05:26.919> the<00:05:27.069> last<00:05:27.279> few<00:05:27.520> variants

00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:28.089 
go and and pick up the last few variants

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:30.119 
go and and pick up the last few variants
depending<00:05:28.569> on<00:05:28.689> how<00:05:29.199> serious<00:05:29.800> you<00:05:29.949> are<00:05:29.979> about

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:30.129 
depending on how serious you are about

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:31.859 
depending on how serious you are about
collecting<00:05:30.789> them<00:05:30.909> you<00:05:31.300> can<00:05:31.449> just<00:05:31.599> jump<00:05:31.749> on

00:05:31.859 --> 00:05:31.869 
collecting them you can just jump on

00:05:31.869 --> 00:05:33.989 
collecting them you can just jump on
ebay<00:05:32.259> and<00:05:32.469> grab<00:05:32.949> the<00:05:33.430> ones<00:05:33.610> that<00:05:33.819> are<00:05:33.879> missing

00:05:33.989 --> 00:05:33.999 
ebay and grab the ones that are missing

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:35.850 
ebay and grab the ones that are missing
usually<00:05:34.599> it<00:05:34.749> can<00:05:35.050> work<00:05:35.229> out<00:05:35.379> to<00:05:35.559> be<00:05:35.649> a<00:05:35.680> little

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
usually it can work out to be a little

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.499 
usually it can work out to be a little
bit<00:05:36.009> more<00:05:36.189> expensive<00:05:36.669> because<00:05:36.789> the<00:05:37.059> variants

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:37.509 
bit more expensive because the variants

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:40.439 
bit more expensive because the variants
are<00:05:38.229> harder<00:05:38.740> to<00:05:38.769> find<00:05:39.159> so<00:05:39.459> people<00:05:39.789> ask<00:05:39.969> for<00:05:40.240> a

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:40.449 
are harder to find so people ask for a

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:42.959 
are harder to find so people ask for a
bit<00:05:40.749> of<00:05:40.869> money<00:05:41.229> for<00:05:41.439> them<00:05:41.589> but<00:05:42.129> anyway<00:05:42.939> that

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:42.969 
bit of money for them but anyway that

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:44.879 
bit of money for them but anyway that
depends<00:05:43.749> on<00:05:43.839> how<00:05:43.959> serious<00:05:44.349> you<00:05:44.529> are<00:05:44.559> about

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889 
depends on how serious you are about

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:47.129 
depends on how serious you are about
collecting<00:05:45.729> them<00:05:45.849> but<00:05:46.419> anyway<00:05:46.719> yes<00:05:46.930> so<00:05:47.110> you

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:47.139 
collecting them but anyway yes so you

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:49.649 
collecting them but anyway yes so you
get<00:05:47.680> the<00:05:47.769> box<00:05:47.919> of<00:05:48.039> 20<00:05:48.339> and<00:05:48.369> therefore<00:05:48.939> you<00:05:49.119> the

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:49.659 
get the box of 20 and therefore you the

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:51.809 
get the box of 20 and therefore you the
theory<00:05:50.019> is<00:05:50.050> that<00:05:50.199> you<00:05:50.469> kind<00:05:50.709> of<00:05:50.819> almost

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:51.819 
theory is that you kind of almost

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:54.809 
theory is that you kind of almost
guaranteed<00:05:52.689> to<00:05:52.719> get<00:05:53.110> your<00:05:53.259> 12<00:05:53.589> base<00:05:54.369> figures

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:54.819 
guaranteed to get your 12 base figures

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:56.699 
guaranteed to get your 12 base figures
and<00:05:55.059> a<00:05:55.269> variant<00:05:55.689> or<00:05:55.749> two<00:05:55.959> and<00:05:56.110> that's<00:05:56.529> actually

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:56.709 
and a variant or two and that's actually

00:05:56.709 --> 00:06:00.569 
and a variant or two and that's actually
why<00:05:57.039> I'm<00:05:57.309> making<00:05:58.089> this<00:05:58.360> video<00:05:59.050> today<00:05:59.579> I've

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:00.579 
why I'm making this video today I've

00:06:00.579 --> 00:06:03.600 
why I'm making this video today I've
decided<00:06:00.639> to<00:06:01.509> take<00:06:01.719> the<00:06:01.930> gamble<00:06:02.159> as<00:06:03.159> you<00:06:03.519> can

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
decided to take the gamble as you can

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.159 
decided to take the gamble as you can
see<00:06:03.789> I've<00:06:03.879> bought<00:06:04.089> a<00:06:04.119> case<00:06:04.389> of<00:06:04.569> 20<00:06:04.869> figures

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169 
see I've bought a case of 20 figures

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:07.409 
see I've bought a case of 20 figures
online<00:06:05.499> and<00:06:05.740> I'm<00:06:06.129> going<00:06:06.399> to<00:06:06.459> test<00:06:06.819> the<00:06:07.029> theory

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
online and I'm going to test the theory

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:09.269 
online and I'm going to test the theory
that<00:06:07.449> buying<00:06:07.869> in<00:06:08.019> bulk<00:06:08.050> snot<00:06:08.589> only<00:06:08.860> cheaper

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:09.279 
that buying in bulk snot only cheaper

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:11.699 
that buying in bulk snot only cheaper
but<00:06:09.759> it's<00:06:09.879> also<00:06:10.059> the<00:06:10.329> smarter<00:06:11.019> way<00:06:11.229> to<00:06:11.259> build

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:11.709 
but it's also the smarter way to build

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:14.279 
but it's also the smarter way to build
your<00:06:11.800> collection<00:06:12.369> so<00:06:13.059> I<00:06:13.360> figured<00:06:13.899> that<00:06:14.019> even

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:14.289 
your collection so I figured that even

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:16.109 
your collection so I figured that even
if<00:06:14.379> it's<00:06:14.529> not<00:06:14.619> guaranteed<00:06:14.860> if<00:06:15.430> the<00:06:15.639> theory<00:06:15.939> is

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:16.119 
if it's not guaranteed if the theory is

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:18.569 
if it's not guaranteed if the theory is
true<00:06:16.439> then<00:06:17.439> I'm<00:06:17.589> going<00:06:17.829> to<00:06:17.919> save<00:06:18.099> a<00:06:18.129> bunch<00:06:18.459> of

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:18.579 
true then I'm going to save a bunch of

00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:20.909 
true then I'm going to save a bunch of
money<00:06:18.639> and<00:06:19.029> I'll<00:06:19.300> know<00:06:19.569> for<00:06:19.599> sure<00:06:19.869> what<00:06:20.800> the

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 
money and I'll know for sure what the

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:23.279 
money and I'll know for sure what the
best<00:06:21.159> way<00:06:21.279> to<00:06:21.999> go<00:06:22.180> about<00:06:22.209> buying<00:06:22.689> these<00:06:22.990> fees

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:23.289 
best way to go about buying these fees

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:25.679 
best way to go about buying these fees
is<00:06:23.559> if<00:06:23.860> they<00:06:24.219> are<00:06:24.399> to<00:06:24.579> release<00:06:24.849> more<00:06:25.089> series<00:06:25.569> in

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:25.689 
is if they are to release more series in

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:27.929 
is if they are to release more series in
the<00:06:25.749> future<00:06:26.110> so<00:06:26.379> if<00:06:26.769> I<00:06:27.069> figure<00:06:27.430> this<00:06:27.519> out<00:06:27.729> and

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:27.939 
the future so if I figure this out and

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:29.939 
the future so if I figure this out and
actually<00:06:28.119> works<00:06:28.479> now<00:06:28.689> I'll<00:06:28.959> know<00:06:29.259> how<00:06:29.589> to<00:06:29.619> buy

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:29.949 
actually works now I'll know how to buy

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:32.129 
actually works now I'll know how to buy
them<00:06:30.159> in<00:06:30.969> the<00:06:31.180> most<00:06:31.300> efficient<00:06:31.749> way<00:06:31.809> in<00:06:32.050> the

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:32.139 
them in the most efficient way in the

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:34.709 
them in the most efficient way in the
future<00:06:32.259> so<00:06:32.860> long<00:06:33.339> story<00:06:33.519> short<00:06:33.669> if<00:06:33.999> you<00:06:34.419> want

00:06:34.709 --> 00:06:34.719 
future so long story short if you want

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:36.540 
future so long story short if you want
to<00:06:34.809> follow<00:06:34.930> along<00:06:35.110> with<00:06:35.349> me<00:06:35.499> and<00:06:35.800> watch<00:06:36.039> as<00:06:36.309> I

to follow along with me and watch as I

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.209 
to follow along with me and watch as I
test<00:06:36.879> out<00:06:37.029> this<00:06:37.209> theory<00:06:37.629> and<00:06:37.779> I'm<00:06:37.869> box<00:06:38.229> all<00:06:38.619> of

00:06:39.209 --> 00:06:39.219 
test out this theory and I'm box all of

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:41.939 
test out this theory and I'm box all of
these<00:06:39.369> 20<00:06:39.729> figures<00:06:40.059> then<00:06:40.569> feel<00:06:40.869> free<00:06:40.899> to<00:06:41.409> UM<00:06:41.589> to

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:41.949 
these 20 figures then feel free to UM to

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:44.850 
these 20 figures then feel free to UM to
stay<00:06:42.159> tuned<00:06:42.490> I'm<00:06:43.059> going<00:06:43.479> to<00:06:43.599> UM<00:06:43.930> I<00:06:44.199> don't<00:06:44.680> like

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860 
stay tuned I'm going to UM I don't like

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.350 
stay tuned I'm going to UM I don't like
long<00:06:45.249> videos<00:06:45.639> I<00:06:45.789> know<00:06:45.849> this<00:06:46.059> has<00:06:46.180> been<00:06:46.300> a

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360 
long videos I know this has been a

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.939 
long videos I know this has been a
little<00:06:46.509> bit<00:06:46.719> too<00:06:46.839> long<00:06:47.019> this<00:06:47.199> one<00:06:47.409> but<00:06:47.889> I

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:47.949 
little bit too long this one but I

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:49.619 
little bit too long this one but I
wanted<00:06:48.219> to<00:06:48.309> explain<00:06:48.459> what<00:06:48.789> I<00:06:48.879> was<00:06:48.999> doing<00:06:49.300> I'm

00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:49.629 
wanted to explain what I was doing I'm

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:51.809 
wanted to explain what I was doing I'm
actually<00:06:49.990> going<00:06:50.229> to<00:06:50.289> open<00:06:50.559> five<00:06:50.979> Titan

of<00:06:56.010> all<00:06:56.160> of<00:06:56.190> this<00:06:56.310> I've<00:06:56.669> got<00:06:56.910> the<00:06:57.000> 12<00:06:57.270> figures

00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:57.419 
of all of this I've got the 12 figures

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:00.260 
of all of this I've got the 12 figures
and<00:06:57.750> maybe<00:06:58.320> a<00:06:58.410> variant<00:06:58.860> or<00:06:59.010> two<00:06:59.699> if<00:06:59.970> I'm<00:07:00.120> really

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:00.270 
and maybe a variant or two if I'm really

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.480 
and maybe a variant or two if I'm really

I'll let you guys know where i bought

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:12.090 
know of them the other two sites that

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.450 
know of them the other two sites that
I've<00:07:12.180> heard<00:07:12.389> of<00:07:12.570> that<00:07:12.750> I<00:07:13.169> know<00:07:13.290> give<00:07:13.979> a<00:07:14.010> pretty

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:14.460 
I've heard of that I know give a pretty
