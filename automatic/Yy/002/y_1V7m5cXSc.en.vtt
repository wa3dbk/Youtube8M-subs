not<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.850> these<00:00:48.390> universes<00:00:48.989> intertwined<00:00:49.469> at

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
not the these universes intertwined at

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.290 
not the these universes intertwined at
all<00:00:49.860> or<00:00:50.070> working<00:00:50.370> considering<00:00:50.760> them<00:00:50.879> separate

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
all or working considering them separate

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
something to do in a puzzle I don't want

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.130 
something to do in a puzzle I don't want
to<00:01:51.000> sit<00:01:51.149> around<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.479> watch<00:01:51.630> because<00:01:51.899> you're

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
to sit around and watch because you're

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.600 
to sit around and watch because you're
the<00:01:52.229> one<00:01:52.350> person<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.680> can't<00:01:52.920> do<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.250> sure

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
the one person you can't do that sure

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.670 
the one person you can't do that sure
and<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:54.780> was<00:01:54.899> very<00:01:54.990> important<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.530> us<00:01:55.649> to

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
and so that was very important to us to

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.620 
and so that was very important to us to
have<00:01:55.890> four<00:01:56.490> players<00:01:56.700> who<00:01:57.030> could<00:01:57.149> all<00:01:57.360> work

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
have four players who could all work

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.749 
have four players who could all work
together<00:01:58.009> and<00:01:59.009> try<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.159> solve<00:01:59.430> these<00:01:59.579> puzzles

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
together and try to solve these puzzles

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:00.380 
together and try to solve these puzzles
in

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
in

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.110 
in
so<00:02:01.320> I'm<00:02:01.620> just<00:02:02.250> explaining<00:02:02.610> for<00:02:02.850> people<00:02:03.030> who

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
so I'm just explaining for people who

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.310 
so I'm just explaining for people who
have<00:02:03.270> been<00:02:03.420> able<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.630> play<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.810> game<00:02:04.080> you've

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
have been able to play the game you've

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.700 
have been able to play the game you've
got<00:02:04.760> like<00:02:05.760> Lara<00:02:06.060> who<00:02:06.390> has<00:02:06.630> has<00:02:07.110> her<00:02:07.320> grappling

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
got like Lara who has has her grappling

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.050 
got like Lara who has has her grappling
hook<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.069> then<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.220> have<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.610> Egyptian

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
hook and then you have the Egyptian

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.990 
hook and then you have the Egyptian
characters<00:02:09.450> who<00:02:09.780> have<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.800> staff<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.459> Osiris

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
characters who have the staff of Osiris

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.330 
characters who have the staff of Osiris
so<00:02:12.330> instead<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.230> having<00:02:13.440> four<00:02:13.680> individuals

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
so instead of having four individuals

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.949 
so instead of having four individuals
all<00:02:14.580> with<00:02:14.910> different<00:02:14.940> abilities<00:02:15.270> you<00:02:15.750> just

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
all with different abilities you just

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.440 
all with different abilities you just
have<00:02:16.110> like<00:02:16.290> two<00:02:16.500> pairs<00:02:16.820> we<00:02:17.820> have<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.300> two

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
have like two pairs we have the two

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.360 
have like two pairs we have the two
Egyptian<00:02:18.870> gods<00:02:19.080> so<00:02:19.560> we<00:02:19.680> have<00:02:19.800> Isis<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.340> Horus

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
Egyptian gods so we have Isis and Horus

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.520 
Egyptian gods so we have Isis and Horus
and<00:02:20.640> they<00:02:20.910> both<00:02:21.420> have<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:21.690> version<00:02:22.410> of<00:02:22.470> that

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
and they both have a version of that

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.080 
and they both have a version of that
staff<00:02:23.070> and<00:02:23.459> so<00:02:23.550> they<00:02:23.640> have<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.850> staffs

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
staff and so they have the staffs

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.490 
staff and so they have the staffs
magical<00:02:24.540> abilities<00:02:24.930> they<00:02:25.080> can<00:02:25.200> shoot<00:02:25.350> its

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
magical abilities they can shoot its

magical abilities they can shoot its
beam<00:02:25.709> which<00:02:25.980> we<00:02:26.130> use<00:02:26.310> for<00:02:26.340> her<00:02:26.940> light<00:02:27.150> puzzles

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
beam which we use for her light puzzles

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.090 
beam which we use for her light puzzles
where<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:27.810> can<00:02:27.900> bounce<00:02:28.020> them<00:02:28.320> off<00:02:28.410> things<00:02:28.709> and

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
where you can bounce them off things and

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.620 
where you can bounce them off things and
they<00:02:29.250> have<00:02:29.400> its<00:02:29.580> magical<00:02:30.000> shield<00:02:30.239> that<00:02:30.510> it

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
generates and they can interact with

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.220 
generates and they can interact with
objects<00:02:33.180> that<00:02:33.300> are<00:02:33.420> sort<00:02:33.570> of<00:02:33.600> marked<00:02:33.959> with

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
objects that are sort of marked with

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.479

Osiris<00:02:34.680> is<00:02:34.860> special<00:02:36.950> hieroglyphs<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.190> so<00:02:38.400> you

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
Osiris is special hieroglyphs and so you

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:39.800 
Osiris is special hieroglyphs and so you
can<00:02:38.760> activate<00:02:39.150> those<00:02:39.300> are<00:02:39.480> slowed<00:02:39.660> them<00:02:39.780> down

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
can activate those are slowed them down

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.750 
can activate those are slowed them down
for<00:02:40.140> puzzles<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.680> then<00:02:41.160> on<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.400> other<00:02:41.430> side

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
for puzzles and then on the other side

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.940
