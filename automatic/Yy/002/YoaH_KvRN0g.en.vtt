00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
between your two water trenches and all

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.499 
between your two water trenches and all
the<00:01:34.710> best<00:01:34.890> ground<00:01:35.070> fear<00:01:35.400> will<00:01:35.579> be<00:01:35.759> hydrated

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
the best ground fear will be hydrated

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.410 
the best ground fear will be hydrated
for<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.170> whole<00:01:37.350> time<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:38.220> have<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.579> heard<00:01:39.240> or

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
for the whole time you have it heard or

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.480 
for the whole time you have it heard or
whatever<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.869> will<00:01:39.990> never<00:01:40.170> come<00:01:40.340> it<00:01:41.340> will

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
whatever it will never come it will

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.310 
whatever it will never come it will
never<00:01:41.610> dry<00:01:41.909> out<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.299> if<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.479> jump<00:01:42.750> on<00:01:42.899> top<00:01:43.110> of

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
never dry out and if you jump on top of

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.370 
never dry out and if you jump on top of
it<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.829> that's<00:01:44.670> because<00:01:44.850> water<00:01:45.270> hydrates<00:01:45.810> and

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
it and that's because water hydrates and

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.590 
it and that's because water hydrates and
four<00:01:46.890> blocks<00:01:47.189> in<00:01:47.430> any<00:01:47.700> direction<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.390> we<00:01:48.479> have

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
four blocks in any direction so we have

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.510 
four blocks in any direction so we have
four<00:01:48.840> here<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.380> four<00:01:49.740> here<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.159> eight<00:01:50.340> in

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
four here and four here and eight in

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.609 
four here and four here and eight in
between<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.600> all<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:51.930> land<00:01:52.229> will<00:01:52.439> be

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
between so all this land will be

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.999 
between so all this land will be
hydrated<00:01:54.140> alright<00:01:55.140> next<00:01:55.380> we're<00:01:55.649> going<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.860> go

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
hydrated alright next we're going to go

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.190 
hydrated alright next we're going to go
ahead<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.399> place<00:01:56.610> your<00:01:56.640> redstone<00:01:57.390> housing

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
ahead and place your redstone housing

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.469 
ahead and place your redstone housing
back<00:01:58.380> here<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:59.070> just<00:01:59.280> put<00:01:59.430> two<00:01:59.579> blocks<00:01:59.729> all<00:02:00.210> the

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
back here so just put two blocks all the

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.010 
back here so just put two blocks all the
way<00:02:00.570> across<00:02:00.780> like<00:02:01.170> this

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.010 

and<00:02:07.009> since<00:02:07.670> we're<00:02:07.850> here<00:02:08.000> we<00:02:08.179> can<00:02:08.209> go<00:02:08.450> ahead<00:02:08.539> and

and since we're here we can go ahead and

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.170 
and since we're here we can go ahead and
dig<00:02:09.319> out<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.649> water<00:02:09.860> channel<00:02:10.340> so<00:02:10.759> just<00:02:10.970> break

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
dig out the water channel so just break

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:19.330 
dig out the water channel so just break
this<00:02:11.360> block<00:02:11.630> here<00:02:17.709> you<00:02:18.709> need<00:02:18.800> to<00:02:18.950> go<00:02:19.040> ahead<00:02:19.130> and

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
this block here you need to go ahead and

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.190 
this block here you need to go ahead and
put<00:02:19.459> a<00:02:19.489> water<00:02:19.700> bucket<00:02:19.910> here<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:20.510> a<00:02:20.989> water

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
put a water bucket here and a water

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.259

go back and add some redstone stuff but
that<00:04:20.070> is<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.520> basis<00:04:20.940> for<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.209> farm<00:04:21.680> you<00:04:22.680> can

nine<00:04:33.870> lighting<00:04:34.410> or<00:04:34.590> higher<00:04:34.800> to<00:04:35.010> grow<00:04:35.190> and<00:04:35.550> if

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
nine lighting or higher to grow and if

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.130 
of lighting beside here and a good way
to<00:04:47.400> check<00:04:47.490> to<00:04:48.480> see<00:04:48.660> if<00:04:48.750> you<00:04:48.840> have<00:04:48.930> enough

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
to check to see if you have enough

right now our rear lift our real
lighting<00:05:00.630> is<00:05:00.750> 15<00:05:01.200> because<00:05:01.560> we're<00:05:01.740> outside<00:05:02.070> but

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
lighting is 15 because we're outside but

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.690 
lighting is 15 because we're outside but
you're<00:05:03.090> underground<00:05:03.600> that<00:05:03.840> will<00:05:04.020> be<00:05:04.700> anywhere

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
you're underground that will be anywhere

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.600 
you're underground that will be anywhere
from<00:05:05.760> 0<00:05:06.300> to<00:05:06.720> 15<00:05:07.140> depending<00:05:07.500> on<00:05:07.830> any<00:05:08.340> light

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
from 0 to 15 depending on any light

if we put on a what do we want the tiny
piece<00:05:16.920> of<00:05:16.950> glows<00:05:17.280> down<00:05:19.340> we<00:05:20.340> put<00:05:20.490> down<00:05:20.670> some

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
piece of glows down we put down some

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
glowstone you can see our block lighting

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.760 
glowstone you can see our block lighting
it's<00:05:23.670> now<00:05:23.850> like<00:05:24.060> 13<00:05:24.600> if<00:05:24.900> we<00:05:25.050> move<00:05:25.230> further<00:05:25.410> away

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
it's now like 13 if we move further away

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.770 
it's now like 13 if we move further away
it<00:05:25.830> goes<00:05:26.010> down<00:05:26.310> so<00:05:27.210> you<00:05:27.270> just<00:05:27.420> want<00:05:27.600> to<00:05:27.660> make

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.440 
it goes down so you just want to make
sure<00:05:27.810> it's<00:05:28.140> 9<00:05:28.410> or<00:05:28.650> higher<00:05:28.680> so<00:05:29.190> your<00:05:29.610> seeds<00:05:30.270> will

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
sure it's 9 or higher so your seeds will

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.000 
sure it's 9 or higher so your seeds will
grow<00:05:32.000> all<00:05:33.000> right<00:05:33.270> and<00:05:33.510> my<00:05:34.170> wheat<00:05:34.410> farm<00:05:34.710> video

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
grow all right and my wheat farm video

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.890 
grow all right and my wheat farm video
is<00:05:35.250> pretty<00:05:35.490> similar<00:05:35.760> to<00:05:35.940> this<00:05:36.210> and<00:05:36.540> a<00:05:36.750> couple

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:22.890 
why all you have to do is cut out a

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.250 
why all you have to do is cut out a
block<00:06:23.280> so<00:06:23.670> make<00:06:23.880> the<00:06:24.090> seven<00:06:24.540> blocks<00:06:24.780> long<00:06:25.050> so

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:25.260 
block so make the seven blocks long so

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.810 
block so make the seven blocks long so
the<00:06:25.380> water<00:06:25.590> will<00:06:25.770> keep<00:06:25.920> flowing<00:06:26.370> and<00:06:26.550> will

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
the water will keep flowing and will

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.300 
the water will keep flowing and will
drop<00:06:27.090> down<00:06:27.330> here<00:06:27.360> and<00:06:27.840> it<00:06:28.680> will<00:06:28.770> travel<00:06:29.040> eight

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
drop down here and it will travel eight

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.280 
drop down here and it will travel eight
blocks<00:06:29.610> so<00:06:29.970> just<00:06:30.180> subtract<00:06:30.690> one<00:06:30.960> layer<00:06:31.140> of

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:31.290 
blocks so just subtract one layer of

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:32.570 
blocks so just subtract one layer of
dirt<00:06:31.500> here<00:06:31.830> and<00:06:32.010> you<00:06:32.160> can<00:06:32.280> make<00:06:32.430> this

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 
dirt here and you can make this

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.090 
dirt here and you can make this
infinitely<00:06:33.240> long<00:06:33.480> so<00:06:34.470> you<00:06:34.530> can<00:06:34.710> have<00:06:34.920> this

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:35.100 
infinitely long so you can have this

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.520 
infinitely long so you can have this
like<00:06:35.340> a<00:06:35.580> hundred<00:06:36.150> tears<00:06:36.570> if<00:06:36.870> you<00:06:36.990> want<00:06:37.170> to<00:06:37.320> just

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:37.530 
like a hundred tears if you want to just

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.650 
like a hundred tears if you want to just
remember<00:06:37.920> the<00:06:38.040> last<00:06:38.280> ones<00:06:38.610> eight<00:06:38.910> and<00:06:39.120> all<00:06:39.510> the

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 
remember the last ones eight and all the

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.380 
remember the last ones eight and all the
other<00:06:39.810> ones<00:06:40.050> are<00:06:40.200> seven<00:06:40.560> blocks<00:06:40.770> long<00:06:41.390> and

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:42.390 
other ones are seven blocks long and

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.810 
other ones are seven blocks long and
also<00:06:42.780> the<00:06:42.900> reason<00:06:43.200> I<00:06:43.260> put<00:06:43.470> half<00:06:43.680> slabs<00:06:44.040> here<00:06:44.340> is

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:44.820 
also the reason I put half slabs here is

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.850 
also the reason I put half slabs here is
so<00:06:45.060> you<00:06:45.120> can<00:06:45.420> when<00:06:46.020> you're<00:06:46.110> planting<00:06:46.590> it<00:06:46.680> makes

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 
so you can when you're planting it makes

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.230 
so you can when you're planting it makes
it<00:06:47.040> much<00:06:47.130> easier<00:06:47.430> you<00:06:47.700> can<00:06:47.850> just<00:06:48.000> walk<00:06:48.210> right

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 
it much easier you can just walk right

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.460 
it much easier you can just walk right
over<00:06:49.040> if<00:06:50.060> you<00:06:51.060> have<00:06:51.090> a<00:06:51.270> full<00:06:51.630> block<00:06:51.870> which<00:06:52.320> a

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:52.470 
over if you have a full block which a

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.230 
over if you have a full block which a
lot<00:06:52.590> of<00:06:52.620> people<00:06:52.770> do<00:06:53.130> if<00:06:53.760> you<00:06:53.850> have<00:06:53.940> a<00:06:53.970> full

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 
lot of people do if you have a full

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.330 
lot of people do if you have a full
block<00:06:54.450> when<00:06:54.720> you<00:06:54.810> jump<00:06:55.050> onto<00:06:55.260> it<00:06:55.470> you'll<00:06:55.800> break

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340 
block when you jump onto it you'll break

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.330 
block when you jump onto it you'll break
the<00:06:56.520> dirt<00:06:56.730> most<00:06:57.330> times<00:06:57.740> see<00:06:58.740> if<00:06:58.800> we<00:06:58.890> can<00:06:59.040> get<00:06:59.190> it

00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340 
the dirt most times see if we can get it

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:05.690 
the dirt most times see if we can get it
of<00:06:59.460> course<00:06:59.640> it's<00:06:59.910> not<00:07:00.030> gonna<00:07:00.120> work<00:07:00.300> now<00:07:04.700> but

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:05.700 
of course it's not gonna work now but

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.460 
of course it's not gonna work now but
anyway<00:07:05.970> you<00:07:06.030> get<00:07:06.300> what<00:07:06.420> I'm<00:07:06.510> saying<00:07:06.570> the<00:07:07.290> Hat
