00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.469 
thing about the buses I'm going to tell
you<00:01:40.710> which<00:01:41.009> buses<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:41.729> run<00:01:41.970> for<00:01:42.240> and

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
you which buses you can run for and

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.749 
you which buses you can run for and
which<00:01:42.810> ones<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.049> can't<00:01:43.409> run<00:01:43.590> for<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:44.070> mean<00:01:44.549> for

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
which ones you can't run for I mean for

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.539 
which ones you can't run for I mean for
buses<00:01:44.939> really<00:01:45.810> like<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.290> kind<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.649> an<00:01:46.950> but

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
buses really like it's kind of an but

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.800 
buses really like it's kind of an but
like<00:01:47.729> there<00:01:48.000> are<00:01:48.090> times<00:01:48.240> where<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.479> really

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
like there are times where you really

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.300 
like there are times where you really
need<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.140> let's<00:01:49.439> say<00:01:49.530> like<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.799> have<00:01:49.890> an<00:01:49.979> exam

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
need to let's say like you have an exam

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.580 
need to let's say like you have an exam
or<00:01:50.640> it's<00:01:51.360> like<00:01:51.570> late<00:01:51.750> at<00:01:51.780> night<00:01:52.049> it's<00:01:52.320> like<00:01:52.470> one

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
or it's like late at night it's like one

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.469 
or it's like late at night it's like one
of<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.740> last<00:01:52.920> ones<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.729> then<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.000> can<00:01:54.149> run<00:01:54.270> for

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
of the last ones so then you can run for

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.289 
of the last ones so then you can run for
like<00:01:54.630> any<00:01:54.810> bus<00:01:55.049> but<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.770> general<00:01:56.340> buses<00:01:57.210> you

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
like any bus but in general buses you

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.020 
like any bus but in general buses you
can<00:01:57.630> run<00:01:57.869> for<00:01:58.189> anything<00:01:59.189> going<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.610> Douglass

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
can run for anything going to Douglass

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.580 
can run for anything going to Douglass
because<00:02:00.570> those<00:02:00.780> things<00:02:00.930> are<00:02:01.079> few<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.469> far

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
because those things are few and far

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.580 
because those things are few and far
between<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:02.130> not<00:02:02.549> very<00:02:02.759> loyal<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.590> actually

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
between and not very loyal and actually

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.270 
between and not very loyal and actually
that's<00:02:04.740> kind<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:04.950> it

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
that's kind of it

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.429 
that's kind of it
buses<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.850> cannot<00:02:06.240> run<00:02:06.450> for<00:02:06.689> anything<00:02:07.290> that

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
buses you cannot run for anything that

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.279 
buses you cannot run for anything that
goes<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.860> Livi<00:02:08.179> Livi<00:02:09.179> buses<00:02:09.750> are<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.050> most

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
goes to Livi Livi buses are the most

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.570 
goes to Livi Livi buses are the most
loyal<00:02:10.560> buses<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.220> will<00:02:11.340> ever

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
loyal buses that you will ever

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.610 
loyal buses that you will ever
experience<00:02:11.840> why<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:12.900> may

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
experience why you may

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.640 
experience why you may
