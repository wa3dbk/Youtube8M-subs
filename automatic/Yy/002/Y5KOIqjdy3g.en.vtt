00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
felt like softer it was a lot softer and

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.039 
felt like softer it was a lot softer and
I<00:01:53.840> don't<00:01:54.770> know<00:01:54.859> I<00:01:54.920> didn't<00:01:55.850> mean<00:01:56.420> I<00:01:56.569> had<00:01:56.780> a<00:01:56.810> lot

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
I don't know I didn't mean I had a lot

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.679 
I don't know I didn't mean I had a lot
healthier<00:01:57.289> and<00:01:57.979> what<00:01:58.490> this<00:01:58.639> actually<00:01:58.909> does<00:01:59.389> is

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
healthier and what this actually does is

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.919 
healthier and what this actually does is
that<00:02:00.049> it<00:02:00.350> gives<00:02:00.829> moisture<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:02.119> your<00:02:02.149> hair<00:02:02.630> and

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
that it gives moisture to your hair and

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:05.199 
that it gives moisture to your hair and
that's<00:02:03.499> pretty<00:02:03.889> much<00:02:04.009> exactly<00:02:04.340> what<00:02:04.909> I<00:02:04.939> need

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:05.209 
that's pretty much exactly what I need

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:09.219 
that's pretty much exactly what I need
when<00:02:05.569> that's<00:02:05.719> dry<00:02:06.009> so<00:02:07.600> this<00:02:08.600> smells<00:02:08.990> like

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
when that's dry so this smells like

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.180

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
different formula it's similar but it's

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.180

that<00:03:20.030> I<00:03:20.060> didn't<00:03:20.600> like<00:03:20.840> about<00:03:20.870> this<00:03:21.320> product<00:03:21.770> is

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
that I didn't like about this product is

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.330 
that I didn't like about this product is
that<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.850> shampoo<00:03:23.680> it's<00:03:24.680> not<00:03:24.890> really<00:03:25.040> very

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
that the shampoo it's not really very

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.940 
that the shampoo it's not really very
strong<00:03:25.730> like<00:03:25.970> I<00:03:26.230> you<00:03:27.230> know<00:03:27.320> I<00:03:27.350> do<00:03:27.500> me<00:03:27.739> very

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
strong like I you know I do me very

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.060 
strong like I you know I do me very
differently<00:03:28.370> a<00:03:28.670> lot<00:03:28.910> and<00:03:29.209> i<00:03:29.480> will<00:03:29.780> use<00:03:29.989> a<00:03:30.260> nice

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
differently a lot and i will use a nice

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.030 
differently a lot and i will use a nice
and<00:03:31.430> all<00:03:31.520> these<00:03:31.700> hairspray<00:03:32.360> and<00:03:32.630> the<00:03:33.590> shampoo

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
and all these hairspray and the shampoo

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.130 
and all these hairspray and the shampoo
i<00:03:34.310> have<00:03:34.520> to<00:03:34.670> love<00:03:34.850> them<00:03:34.940> I<00:03:35.120> hair<00:03:35.300> a<00:03:35.480> lot<00:03:35.690> just<00:03:35.989> to

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
i have to love them I hair a lot just to

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.199 
i have to love them I hair a lot just to
get<00:03:36.380> out<00:03:36.440> like<00:03:36.860> the<00:03:37.250> moves<00:03:37.489> in<00:03:37.700> the<00:03:37.760> hairspray

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
get out like the moves in the hairspray

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.740 
get out like the moves in the hairspray
so<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:39.290> shampoo<00:03:39.739> really<00:03:40.400> isn't<00:03:40.880> very<00:03:41.180> strong

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
so the shampoo really isn't very strong

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.930 
so the shampoo really isn't very strong
it's<00:03:42.320> not<00:03:42.590> as<00:03:42.860> strong<00:03:43.040> as<00:03:43.220> other<00:03:43.370> chances<00:03:43.790> are

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
it's not as strong as other chances are

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.300 
it's not as strong as other chances are
out<00:03:44.090> there<00:03:44.269> so<00:03:44.739> I'm<00:03:45.739> not<00:03:45.920> saying<00:03:46.130> that<00:03:46.280> I

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
doesn't work it's just that it's not

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.020 
doesn't work it's just that it's not
really<00:03:48.830> strong<00:03:49.070> shampoo<00:03:49.550> so<00:03:49.850> if<00:03:49.910> you're
