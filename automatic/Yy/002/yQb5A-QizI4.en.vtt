on<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.480> forest<00:02:29.440> is<00:02:29.530> much<00:02:29.710> better<00:02:29.890> looking<00:02:30.340> at

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
on the forest is much better looking at

on the forest is much better looking at
the<00:02:30.580> side<00:02:30.850> of<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.180> Asus<00:02:31.510> you<00:02:31.660> see<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:31.960> colours

the side of the Asus you see the colours

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.680 
the side of the Asus you see the colours
are<00:02:32.530> slightly<00:02:33.130> yellowish<00:02:33.550> and<00:02:33.700> lost<00:02:34.090> let's

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.990 
are slightly yellowish and lost let's
take<00:02:34.960> a<00:02:34.990> look<00:02:35.170> at<00:02:35.260> that<00:02:35.380> again<00:02:35.680> but<00:02:36.370> once<00:02:36.640> we<00:02:36.850> go

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
take a look at that again but once we go

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.970 
take a look at that again but once we go
back<00:02:37.210> to<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.540> forest<00:02:37.900> and<00:02:38.170> we<00:02:38.350> take<00:02:38.620> a<00:02:38.650> look<00:02:38.890> at

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
back to the forest and we take a look at

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.560 
back to the forest and we take a look at
the<00:02:39.100> side<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.670> colours<00:02:40.000> are<00:02:40.180> preserved

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
the side the colours are preserved

the side the colours are preserved
almost<00:02:40.960> 100%<00:02:41.410> accurate<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.760> same<00:02:43.000> goes<00:02:43.240> with

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
almost 100% accurate the same goes with

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.990 
almost 100% accurate the same goes with
a<00:02:43.570> top<00:02:43.840> view<00:02:44.140> we<00:02:44.350> start<00:02:45.040> noticing<00:02:45.310> that<00:02:45.610> the

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
a top view we start noticing that the

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.770 
a top view we start noticing that the
forest<00:02:46.690> it<00:02:46.870> keeps<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.320> colors<00:02:47.620> while<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:48.780> the

forest it keeps the colors while the the

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.720 
forest it keeps the colors while the the
whites<00:02:50.050> are<00:02:50.260> overexposed<00:02:51.010> with<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.220> ASIS<00:02:51.580> and

whites are overexposed with the ASIS and

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.240 
whites are overexposed with the ASIS and
from<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.600> bottom<00:02:52.990> you'll<00:02:53.350> see<00:02:53.620> that<00:02:53.800> before

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
from the bottom you'll see that before

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.490 
from the bottom you'll see that before
us<00:02:54.370> again<00:02:54.730> retains<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.300> colors<00:02:55.630> while<00:02:56.260> with

us again retains the colors while with

us again retains the colors while with
the<00:02:56.680> ASIS<00:02:57.520> the<00:02:57.730> blacks<00:02:58.090> are<00:02:58.420> just<00:02:58.690> crushed

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
the ASIS the blacks are just crushed

the ASIS the blacks are just crushed
over<00:02:59.440> here<00:02:59.740> and<00:02:59.920> you<00:02:59.980> can't<00:03:00.220> see<00:03:00.310> anything<00:03:00.610> in

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
the details of the picture so very good

the performance and the viewing angles

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.000 
the performance and the viewing angles
we<00:03:07.390> see<00:03:07.540> that<00:03:07.690> this<00:03:07.900> unit<00:03:08.260> does<00:03:08.500> have<00:03:08.740> some

we see that this unit does have some

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.830 
we see that this unit does have some
backlight<00:03:09.430> reading<00:03:09.880> when<00:03:10.090> we<00:03:10.270> turn<00:03:10.540> off<00:03:10.690> the

backlight reading when we turn off the

backlight reading when we turn off the

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.810

anymore<00:03:14.320> and<00:03:14.530> it's<00:03:14.890> not<00:03:15.010> so<00:03:15.310> bad

next<00:03:16.660> up<00:03:16.780> we<00:03:16.930> duplicated<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.680> PC<00:03:18.100> signal<00:03:18.520> so

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
next up we duplicated the PC signal so

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.550 
next up we duplicated the PC signal so
that<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:19.060> same<00:03:19.300> signal<00:03:19.989> would<00:03:20.050> be<00:03:20.110> on<00:03:20.350> both

the<00:03:40.690> asus<00:03:41.620> monitor<00:03:42.010> back<00:03:42.280> again

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
the asus monitor back again

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.290 
the asus monitor back again
they<00:03:43.630> seem<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:43.930> catch<00:03:44.230> up<00:03:44.440> but<00:03:44.680> then<00:03:44.890> the<00:03:45.300> asus

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
they seem to catch up but then the asus

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.229 
they seem to catch up but then the asus
monitor<00:03:46.690> lags<00:03:47.080> behind<00:03:47.380> the<00:03:48.250> easier<00:03:48.790> monitor

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
monitor lags behind the easier monitor

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.300 
monitor lags behind the easier monitor
so<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:50.020> easier<00:03:50.320> monitor<00:03:50.680> as<00:03:50.890> you<00:03:51.040> can<00:03:51.190> see

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
so the easier monitor as you can see

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.490 
so the easier monitor as you can see
again<00:03:51.520> over<00:03:51.790> here<00:03:51.820> is<00:03:52.150> a<00:03:52.810> much<00:03:53.290> better

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500
