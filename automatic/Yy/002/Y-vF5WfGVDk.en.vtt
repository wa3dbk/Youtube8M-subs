00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.550
 a lot of excitement on earth caused the reports 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.060
 Apollo 16 astronauts 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.770
 they reported what they saw on the slope 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.620
 lunar even some strange objects 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.319
 similar to machines 

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:12.699
 sent there a camera and center 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.299
 flight control responded well visible 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.949
 two objects continues the process 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:19.650
 a little more time has passed 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.110
 all astronaut charles duke told something 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.019
 incomprehensible 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.289
 but 90 percent cut by block meters 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.550
 up to 500 riverman they are pulled upwards 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.660
 in two directions 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.490
 the astronauts themselves are not 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.260
 but it seems like the heritage once 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
 activities 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.850
 this is zablotsky which is paved 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:43.930
 short 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.130
 no need again next year 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.470
 he came across soviet moon rovers 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.230
 by a strange find which he made 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.399
 February 14, 1973 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.900
 the day that readers 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.190
 Our news agency reported 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.920
 it was unusually hard and smooth 30 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.220
 linoleum about a meter 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.290
 similar to the hem of modern 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.410
 monolith obviously had nothing to do with 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.870
 scattered purchase of stones 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.280
 it became less but research 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.770
 chemical composition of hemoglobin properties 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.890
 once despite the artificial and 3 thousand 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.369
 and great interest in her is more about it 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.700
 why it was not published either 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.700
 lines 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.869
 in Soviet American 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.979
 spacecraft and made almost 3 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.730
 million photos in the lunar surface 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.790
 more detailed analysis honey many 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:37.480
 the years 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.140
 she is already in the pictures 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.220
 found a lot of mysterious 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.200
 take for example the unusual drunk 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.610
 found in different areas of london 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.170
 it is surprising that most of them 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.580
 has direct payments 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.280
 which means that this is not a meteorite crater 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.300
 and him conical theft 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.980
 the origin is completely incomprehensible 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.820
 another such appearance was 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.600
 photographed sports apollo 15 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.220
 its structure is somewhat like typing 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.220
 heel and moved smirnov 3 kilometers 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.829
 unusual studied in detail 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:12.119
 stereoscopic 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:14.269
 it turned out that because of its depth several 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:15.629
 tens of meters 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.819
 judging by the lack of craters bottom she 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.939
 more recent origin and 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:22.939
 surrounding sea of ​​frozen lava 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:23.680
 some researchers 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.040
 believe that a number of photos 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.469
 viewed the ruins of the ancient you and 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:29.509
 other activity details 

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:31.350
 reasonable creatures 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.999
 when did you visit him elephants 

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:35.769
 compare 2 7 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.289
 none made on earth 

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:39.019
 on it we see our 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.139
 in the ancient capital of Russia 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:43.589
 and here is a snapshot of the lunar surface 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:46.509
 In the area of ​​the city of Nago, the problem is very poor 

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:47.639
 look like 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:50.559
 moreover deserve respect 

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:52.439
 national bank can not look 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.430
 thank you for building a new one 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.500
 modern collapse 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.059
 same 

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:00.839
 so this is a photograph 

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:02.749
 falling apart already ready 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:04.339
 however American research 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:06.439
 the system noticed weird 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:09.569
 objects of size 4 by 4 kilometers in the area 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.449
 cradle of hydrangeas 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:13.219
 yes it is compact clusters 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:15.079
 rectangular parts 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.050
 but also by other ancient cities 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.589
 it was also called 

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:19.469
 Yerevan
