00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.180
 I am interested in the study course 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.680
 I decided 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.950
 school a little enthusiasm for the 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.490
 had mathematics and I think that with me 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.130
 the conclusion of a 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.940
 Economics later good 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:26.100
 job prospects will have 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.780
 the time for me to be there for 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.930
 this course of study had been decided 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:35.190
 actually one year before graduation 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.690
 I was there in Leipzig at that 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.600
 the day of the open door and have me 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.590
 just informed and so I came 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.199
 stop by this course of study 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.000
 requirement for one 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.860
 I will become an economist 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.870
 First, enthusiasm for the subject 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.550
 because it's pretty dry over time 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.380
 can be 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.600
 and of course a big helping of patience 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.190
 And there are some mathematical ones 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.730
 Tasks pretty happy 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.809
 are 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:07.450
 my first impression of my studies was 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.390
 something frightening because the mathematics 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.890
 we one in the study has nothing more 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.670
 with whom from the school has to do and 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.369
 you start from zero again 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.490
 Added to that was the economic 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.509
 actually the module in the subject 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.670
 economic mathematics should be in it 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.320
 only come from the second year of study 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.610
 and you first ask where the all go 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.220
 are 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.710
 I did not expect that in the beginning 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.650
 of the course of study so much mathematics 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.180
 module came to me and the economy 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.890
 a bit neglected at the beginning 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.810
 has been 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.700
 But then I can say that with 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.420
 later time the economy again 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.420
 was caught up 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.000
 especially good at studying 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.280
 I like that 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.440
 it is still a diploma course that 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.540
 So you do not study like that anymore 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.060
 has to rush as compared to the 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.920
 bachelor courses and the in 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.000
 leipzig for the condition stop well 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.770
 are with the professors and with the 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.970
 the one with the communication with the 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.970
 older semesters 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.410
 typical misconception for that 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.660
 study of economic mathematics 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.349
 that one assumes that it is four 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.569
 economy is a little dull, however 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.400
 it is exactly the other way the focus 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.580
 lies in mathematics and not in the 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.580
 economy 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.040
 I would advise beginning students 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.930
 one should always dare older ones 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.880
 semester so that the pure 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.550
 help those are yes at the university actually 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.140
 always nice and that you can 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.040
 tutorials and introductory events 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.740
 should visit there really looking for these 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.270
 already the basics for 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.270
 afford these individual modules 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.790
 after my studies, I would like only times 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.340
 travel through the world for a year 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:07.200
 then look for a job as a 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.200
 actuarial or risk mathematician
