today I'm going to do minecraft mania so

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.390 
today I'm going to do minecraft mania so
I've<00:00:15.780> just<00:00:15.809> found<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.650> it's<00:00:16.800> pretty<00:00:17.250> awesome

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
I've just found and it's pretty awesome

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.099 
I've just found and it's pretty awesome
and<00:00:17.670> I'll<00:00:17.789> hopefully<00:00:18.119> show<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:18.720> what<00:00:18.869> it<00:00:18.930> does

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
and I'll hopefully show you what it does

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.599 
and I'll hopefully show you what it does
and<00:00:19.470> how<00:00:20.460> good<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:22.130> what<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.580> a

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
and how good is and what it is is a

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.450 
and how good is and what it is is a
probably<00:00:24.449> info<00:00:24.689> page<00:00:24.840> mode<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.949> allows<00:00:26.099> you

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
probably info page mode that allows you

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.019 
probably info page mode that allows you
basically<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.930> have<00:00:28.140> more<00:00:28.500> control<00:00:28.769> on<00:00:29.070> mine

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
basically to have more control on mine

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.950 
basically to have more control on mine
cart<00:00:30.779> activities<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:32.099> stuff<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:33.300> first<00:00:33.840> of

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
cart activities and stuff so first of

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.810 
cart activities and stuff so first of
all<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.910> gold<00:00:35.910> blocked<00:00:36.300> or<00:00:37.309> act<00:00:38.309> as<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.520> booster

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
all a gold blocked or act as a booster

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.639 
all a gold blocked or act as a booster
so<00:00:39.360> instead<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.660> making<00:00:39.989> all<00:00:40.140> those<00:00:40.260> annoying

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
so instead of making all those annoying

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.229 
so instead of making all those annoying
ones<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:41.070> can<00:00:41.190> just<00:00:41.309> use<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> code<00:00:41.730> block<00:00:41.940> and

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
ones you can just use a code block and

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.229 
ones you can just use a code block and
I'll<00:00:42.600> show<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.809> how<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.079> works<00:00:43.579> so<00:00:44.579> place<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
I'll show you how it works so place the

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.459 
I'll show you how it works so place the
minecart<00:00:46.940> get<00:00:47.940> lucky<00:00:48.180> but<00:00:48.510> as<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.140> can<00:00:49.230> see<00:00:49.410> it

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
minecart get lucky but as you can see it

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.150 
minecart get lucky but as you can see it
boosts<00:00:49.969> now<00:00:51.289> get<00:00:52.289> rid<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.440> this

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.550 

right<00:00:55.880> if<00:00:56.390> it's<00:00:56.989> powered<00:00:58.570> so<00:00:59.570> it's<00:01:00.080> powered

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
right if it's powered so it's powered

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.680 
right if it's powered so it's powered
using<00:01:00.890> the<00:01:01.130> switch<00:01:03.729> he<00:01:04.729> won't<00:01:04.940> help<00:01:05.150> effect<00:01:05.479> so

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
using the switch he won't help effect so

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.660 
using the switch he won't help effect so
at<00:01:05.870> this<00:01:05.960> time<00:01:06.020> it<00:01:06.350> won't<00:01:06.440> boost<00:01:09.250> see<00:01:10.250> it

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
at this time it won't boost see it

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.040 
at this time it won't boost see it
didn't<00:01:10.970> boost<00:01:12.910> let's<00:01:13.910> leave<00:01:14.030> that<00:01:14.090> okay

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
didn't boost let's leave that okay

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.820 
didn't boost let's leave that okay
secondly<00:01:16.090> slow<00:01:17.090> sand<00:01:17.540> or<00:01:17.900> soul<00:01:18.260> sand<00:01:18.560> and

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
secondly slow sand or soul sand and

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.990 
secondly slow sand or soul sand and
gravel<00:01:19.810> slaves<00:01:20.810> cuts<00:01:21.080> down<00:01:21.320> so<00:01:22.220> you<00:01:22.790> should

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
gravel slaves cuts down so you should

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.480 
gravel slaves cuts down so you should
see<00:01:23.210> it<00:01:23.390> slowed<00:01:23.660> down<00:01:23.840> a<00:01:24.080> lot

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.539 

it's<00:01:27.490> so<00:01:27.729> slow<00:01:28.060> down<00:01:28.270> it<00:01:28.390> actually<00:01:28.539> stopped

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
it's so slow down it actually stopped

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.429 
it's so slow down it actually stopped
but<00:01:30.549> depending<00:01:31.329> on<00:01:31.420> how<00:01:31.600> fast<00:01:31.810> it's<00:01:32.049> going<00:01:32.109> it

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
but depending on how fast it's going it

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:34.080 
but depending on how fast it's going it
will<00:01:32.530> slow<00:01:32.770> it<00:01:32.799> down<00:01:32.950> and<00:01:33.369> not<00:01:33.490> to<00:01:33.670> stop<00:01:33.939> it

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
will slow it down and not to stop it

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.410 
will slow it down and not to stop it
grab<00:01:34.780> always<00:01:35.140> less<00:01:35.579> slowing<00:01:36.579> down<00:01:36.789> and<00:01:37.149> self

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
grab always less slowing down and self

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.510 
grab always less slowing down and self
set<00:01:37.630> and<00:01:38.350> again<00:01:38.679> like<00:01:38.829> gold<00:01:39.399> repower<00:01:41.399> you<00:01:42.399> go

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
set and again like gold repower you go

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.899 
set and again like gold repower you go
straight<00:01:42.789> paths<00:01:44.009> now<00:01:45.009> I<00:01:45.310> can't<00:01:45.579> really<00:01:45.670> show

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
straight paths now I can't really show

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.209 
straight paths now I can't really show
you<00:01:45.969> this<00:01:47.189> but<00:01:48.189> I'm<00:01:48.520> block<00:01:48.819> ejected<00:01:49.359> mobs<00:01:50.219> to

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
you this but I'm block ejected mobs to

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:54.620 
you this but I'm block ejected mobs to
try<00:01:51.429> and<00:01:51.520> get<00:01:51.609> mods<00:01:51.849> but<00:01:52.439> too<00:01:53.439> much<00:01:53.679> effort

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
try and get mods but too much effort

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.730 
try and get mods but too much effort
though<00:01:55.630> there<00:01:55.810> is<00:01:55.899> an<00:01:55.990> I've<00:01:56.079> got<00:01:56.319> there<00:01:56.530> and

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
though there is an I've got there and

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.139 
though there is an I've got there and
basically<00:01:58.409> yeah<00:01:59.409> he<00:02:00.069> was<00:02:00.250> just<00:02:00.369> inject<00:02:00.909> any

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
basically yeah he was just inject any

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:07.050 
basically yeah he was just inject any
modern<00:02:01.509> it<00:02:02.849> right<00:02:03.849> next<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:06.280> this<00:02:06.789> is<00:02:06.909> just

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
modern it right next this this is just

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.119 
modern it right next this this is just
to<00:02:07.179> show<00:02:07.209> you<00:02:07.509> these<00:02:08.319> gold<00:02:08.619> block<00:02:08.829> just<00:02:09.009> a

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
to show you these gold block just a

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:13.460 
to show you these gold block just a
booster<00:02:09.549> and<00:02:10.019> this<00:02:11.019> is<00:02:11.170> wool<00:02:11.440> wool<00:02:12.099> cloth

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
booster and this is wool wool cloth

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.289 
booster and this is wool wool cloth
basically<00:02:14.470> acts<00:02:14.620> as<00:02:14.739> a<00:02:14.769> bouncing<00:02:15.220> so<00:02:15.489> if<00:02:15.849> there

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
basically acts as a bouncing so if there

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:17.610 
basically acts as a bouncing so if there
might<00:02:16.540> not<00:02:16.599> tested<00:02:17.049> it<00:02:17.140> or<00:02:17.230> just<00:02:17.379> bounce

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
might not tested it or just bounce

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.360 
might not tested it or just bounce
opposite<00:02:17.980> direction<00:02:18.720> so<00:02:19.720> you'll<00:02:20.079> see<00:02:20.379> bounce

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
opposite direction so you'll see bounce

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.020 
opposite direction so you'll see bounce
right<00:02:21.970> if<00:02:22.450> its<00:02:23.019> power<00:02:23.260> however<00:02:23.579> it<00:02:24.579> won't<00:02:24.819> have

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
right if its power however it won't have

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.650 
right if its power however it won't have
this<00:02:25.120> effect<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:26.579> falls<00:02:27.579> into<00:02:27.730> lava

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
this effect and falls into lava

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.240 
this effect and falls into lava
right<00:02:30.370> game<00:02:32.530> pressure<00:02:33.530> plates<00:02:33.860> going<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.130> be

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
right game pressure plates going to be

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.360 
right game pressure plates going to be
used<00:02:34.550> as<00:02:34.730> a<00:02:34.760> full<00:02:35.090> way<00:02:35.410> so<00:02:36.410> before<00:02:36.710> it<00:02:37.160> just

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
used as a full way so before it just

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.910 
used as a full way so before it just
went<00:02:37.640> to<00:02:38.060> Western<00:02:39.020> North<00:02:39.230> I<00:02:39.440> believe<00:02:39.740> or

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
went to Western North I believe or

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.130 
went to Western North I believe or
something<00:02:40.310> like<00:02:40.580> that<00:02:40.840> however<00:02:41.840> this<00:02:42.020> will

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
something like that however this will

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.430 
something like that however this will
just<00:02:42.290> act<00:02:42.560> as<00:02:42.710> in<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:43.100> four-piece<00:02:43.750> my<00:02:44.750> track<00:02:45.020> it

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
just act as in a four-piece my track it

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.500 
just act as in a four-piece my track it
doesn't<00:02:45.770> look<00:02:45.890> like<00:02:45.950> it<00:02:46.280> but<00:02:47.030> it<00:02:47.150> worked<00:02:47.330> like

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
doesn't look like it but it worked like

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.270 
doesn't look like it but it worked like
that<00:02:47.570> so<00:02:49.870> there<00:02:50.870> we<00:02:50.960> up<00:02:51.050> it<00:02:51.800> does<00:02:52.100> however

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
that so there we up it does however

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.350 
that so there we up it does however
boost<00:02:52.760> I<00:02:53.090> believe<00:02:53.600> a<00:02:53.870> bit<00:02:54.820> they<00:02:55.820> might<00:02:56.000> just<00:02:56.150> be

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
boost I believe a bit they might just be

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.410 
boost I believe a bit they might just be

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
what will happen actually for power to

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.720 
what will happen actually for power to
pass<00:03:30.320> this<00:03:30.530> on<00:03:30.710> it<00:03:30.860> I<00:03:31.070> see<00:03:31.430> what<00:03:31.550> happen

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
pass this on it I see what happen

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.540 
pass this on it I see what happen

I see it applies to the direction of
course<00:03:42.300> if<00:03:43.300> however<00:03:43.720> we<00:03:43.990> put<00:03:44.580> assignment<00:03:45.720> and

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
course if however we put assignment and

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
seconds and now we place in my gut it

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.040

there are also some things like you can

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.880 
there are also some things like you can
boost<00:04:07.240> it<00:04:07.480> adjust<00:04:08.020> the<00:04:08.080> speed<00:04:08.380> and<00:04:08.620> whatever
