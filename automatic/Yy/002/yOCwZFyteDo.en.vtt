00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
situations you can get rather difficult

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.900 
situations you can get rather difficult
we<00:01:30.600> have<00:01:30.810> scenario<00:01:31.560> cards<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.310> something's

happening<00:01:33.360> parts<00:01:33.660> which<00:01:33.840> change<00:01:34.200> up<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
happening parts which change up the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.020 
happening parts which change up the
gameplay<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.100> every<00:01:35.460> single<00:01:35.790> time<00:01:36.000> that

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
you're playing it's a different game so

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.249 
you're playing it's a different game so
the<00:01:38.520> replayability<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.479> Zika<00:01:39.810> clips<00:01:40.110> is

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
the replayability of Zika clips is

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.980 
the replayability of Zika clips is
pretty<00:01:40.500> fantastic<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:41.310> our<00:01:41.460> opinion<00:01:41.960> one<00:01:42.960> of

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
pretty fantastic in our opinion one of

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.749 
pretty fantastic in our opinion one of
the<00:01:43.080> other<00:01:43.290> things<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.710> we<00:01:44.070> have<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.640> can

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
the other things is we have and can

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.749 
the other things is we have and can
build<00:01:45.000> walls<00:01:45.390> gates<00:01:46.080> and<00:01:46.470> traps<00:01:46.860> sandbags

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
build walls gates and traps sandbags

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.850 
build walls gates and traps sandbags
which<00:01:48.360> acts<00:01:48.600> like<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.840> tower<00:01:49.080> defense<00:01:49.200> type

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
which acts like a tower defense type

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.490 
which acts like a tower defense type
style<00:01:50.160> for<00:01:50.580> the<00:01:50.729> game<00:01:50.940> to<00:01:51.450> slow<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.080> zombies

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
style for the game to slow the zombies

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.840 
style for the game to slow the zombies
will<00:01:52.710> prevent<00:01:52.979> them<00:01:53.220> from<00:01:53.250> actually<00:01:53.640> getting

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
will prevent them from actually getting

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.780 
will prevent them from actually getting
