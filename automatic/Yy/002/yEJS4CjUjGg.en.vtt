good news david bentley feeling

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.870 
good news david bentley feeling
optimistic<00:01:39.630> lately<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:41.070> feel<00:01:41.460> relatively

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
optimistic lately I I feel relatively

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.969 
optimistic lately I I feel relatively
bad<00:01:42.210> for<00:01:42.479> David<00:01:42.780> Bentley<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.110> think<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.649> he

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
bad for David Bentley I think that he

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.530 
bad for David Bentley I think that he
was<00:01:44.100> treated<00:01:44.520> quite<00:01:44.700> shabbily<00:01:45.119> by<00:01:45.299> Harry

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
was treated quite shabbily by Harry

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.179 
was treated quite shabbily by Harry
Redknapp<00:01:45.960> who<00:01:46.140> wouldn't<00:01:46.770> get<00:01:46.860> him<00:01:46.979> leave

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
Redknapp who wouldn't get him leave

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.160 
Redknapp who wouldn't get him leave
because<00:01:47.610> I'm<00:01:48.420> not<00:01:48.540> sure<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.659> was<00:01:48.810> just<00:01:48.869> Harry

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
because I'm not sure that was just Harry

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.690 
because I'm not sure that was just Harry
Redknapp<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.619> think<00:01:49.829> Daniel<00:01:50.070> EV<00:01:50.369> has<00:01:50.490> this

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
Redknapp I think Daniel EV has this

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.789 
Redknapp I think Daniel EV has this
thing<00:01:50.939> when<00:01:51.450> he<00:01:51.570> does<00:01:51.720> transfers<00:01:52.259> where<00:01:52.710> he

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
thing when he does transfers where he

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.770 
thing when he does transfers where he
says<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.490> what<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.759> prices<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.509> if<00:01:54.659> the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
says this is what the prices and if the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.840 
says this is what the prices and if the
bind<00:01:54.990> no<00:01:55.500> there's<00:01:55.770> no<00:01:55.890> negotiation<00:01:56.399> if<00:01:56.759> the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
bind no there's no negotiation if the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.280 
bind no there's no negotiation if the
buying<00:01:57.090> club<00:01:57.360> doesn't<00:01:57.540> want<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.840> pay<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.110> and

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
buying club doesn't want to pay it and

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.990 
buying club doesn't want to pay it and
the<00:01:58.560> transfer<00:01:58.950> doesn't<00:01:59.219> take<00:01:59.369> place<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.909> I

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
the transfer doesn't take place and I

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.190 
the transfer doesn't take place and I
mean<00:02:00.299> we<00:02:00.390> saw<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.719> we<00:02:00.840> did<00:02:00.960> into<00:02:01.140> our

he didn't have time to spend the money

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.830 
he didn't have time to spend the money
because<00:02:08.670> he<00:02:08.819> was<00:02:08.910> haggling<00:02:09.090> over<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.509> couple<00:02:09.780> of

had a preseason and then Spurs wouldn't

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.410 
had a preseason and then Spurs wouldn't
have<00:02:17.340> spent<00:02:17.549> the<00:02:17.730> first<00:02:17.879> half<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.329> the

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
bottom of the league and so David

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.149 
bottom of the league and so David
Bentley<00:02:21.659> could<00:02:21.989> have<00:02:22.079> gone<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.290> think<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.799> think

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
Bentley could have gone I think I think

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:24.710 
Bentley could have gone I think I think

magic mark hughes one to do when he was

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.479 
magic mark hughes one to do when he was
a<00:02:24.780> manchester<00:02:25.170> city<00:02:25.349> but<00:02:25.950> yet<00:02:26.250> they<00:02:26.430> were

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
a manchester city but yet they were

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:27.830 
a manchester city but yet they were
haggling<00:02:26.700> they're<00:02:27.060> arguing<00:02:27.390> over<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.659> money

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
haggling they're arguing over the money

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.300 
haggling they're arguing over the money
and<00:02:28.049> they<00:02:28.349> wouldn't<00:02:28.560> let<00:02:28.650> him<00:02:28.709> go<00:02:28.920> i<00:02:28.950> think

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
and they wouldn't let him go i think

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.220 
and they wouldn't let him go i think
david<00:02:29.459> bentley<00:02:29.760> has<00:02:30.000> some<00:02:30.329> ability<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:31.019> he

david bentley has some ability and he
certainly<00:02:31.409> has<00:02:31.799> more<00:02:32.099> ability<00:02:32.310> than<00:02:32.549> he<00:02:33.090> was

that's<00:02:50.040> quite<00:02:50.370> an<00:02:50.579> important<00:02:50.940> role<00:02:51.090> in<00:02:51.239> the

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
that's quite an important role in the

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.089 
that's quite an important role in the
squad<00:02:51.629> so<00:02:52.079> yeah<00:02:52.319> I<00:02:52.349> mean<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.620> think<00:02:52.650> that<00:02:52.980> is<00:02:53.069> a

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
squad so yeah I mean I think that is a

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.530 
squad so yeah I mean I think that is a
good<00:02:53.280> move<00:02:53.459> by<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.730> dispersed<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.239> bring<00:02:54.420> that

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
good move by the dispersed to bring that

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.559 
good move by the dispersed to bring that
knee<00:02:54.690> back<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.859> Gareth<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:56.310> mean<00:02:56.489> with<00:02:57.389> that

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
knee back and Gareth I mean with that

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.839 
knee back and Gareth I mean with that
squad<00:02:57.920> moutinho's<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.159> mooted<00:02:59.549> to<00:02:59.700> perhaps

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
squad moutinho's the mooted to perhaps

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.240 
squad moutinho's the mooted to perhaps
be<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.329> man<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:01.290> replace<00:03:01.620> moderate<00:03:02.040> should

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
be the man to to replace moderate should

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.929 
be the man to to replace moderate should
he<00:03:02.459> go<00:03:02.989> is<00:03:03.989> that<00:03:04.340> is<00:03:05.340> that<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.609> sort<00:03:05.790> of

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:05.939 
he go is that is that the sort of

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:07.580 
he go is that is that the sort of
signing<00:03:06.389> you<00:03:06.569> would<00:03:06.750> expect<00:03:07.019> it's<00:03:07.319> a<00:03:07.379> sort<00:03:07.560> of

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
signing you would expect it's a sort of

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.110 
signing you would expect it's a sort of
signing<00:03:07.829> I<00:03:07.889> guess<00:03:08.069> we'd<00:03:08.220> expect<00:03:08.459> from<00:03:08.549> a<00:03:08.670> vb<00:03:08.970> is

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
signing I guess we'd expect from a vb is

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.759 
signing I guess we'd expect from a vb is
that<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.359> sort<00:03:09.510> of<00:03:09.629> signing<00:03:10.560> that<00:03:10.650> would

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
that the sort of signing that would

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.280 
that the sort of signing that would
excite<00:03:11.010> Spurs<00:03:11.310> fans<00:03:11.780> yeah<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:12.810> think<00:03:12.989> it

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
excite Spurs fans yeah I think it

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.140 
excite Spurs fans yeah I think it
wouldn't<00:03:13.680> I<00:03:13.859> think<00:03:14.250> Yang's<00:03:14.489> a<00:03:14.639> bit<00:03:14.790> more<00:03:14.939> than

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
wouldn't I think Yang's a bit more than

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.030 
wouldn't I think Yang's a bit more than
mod<00:03:15.689> Regina<00:03:16.019> final<00:03:16.349> third<00:03:16.560> in<00:03:16.739> terms<00:03:16.980> of

mod Regina final third in terms of

mod Regina final third in terms of
course<00:03:17.250> but<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.910> thing<00:03:18.120> is<00:03:18.150> you<00:03:18.810> know<00:03:18.930> it<00:03:19.319> what

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
course but the thing is you know it what

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.129 
course but the thing is you know it what
who<00:03:20.220> I<00:03:20.280> would<00:03:20.579> like<00:03:20.819> to<00:03:20.849> maybe<00:03:21.209> come<00:03:21.569> I<00:03:21.780> don't

positive<00:05:51.050> news<00:05:51.440> at<00:05:51.589> start<00:05:51.979> of<00:05:52.159> preseason

rather<00:05:53.240> than<00:05:53.509> deadline<00:05:54.289> day<00:05:54.500> so<00:05:55.129> I<00:05:55.159> I<00:05:55.610> agree

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
rather than deadline day so I I agree

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.790 
rather than deadline day so I I agree
with<00:05:56.389> what<00:05:56.629> you<00:05:56.690> say<00:05:56.839> about<00:05:56.960> bail<00:05:57.319> I<00:05:57.349> think<00:05:57.710> he

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
with what you say about bail I think he

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.469 
with what you say about bail I think he
signed<00:05:58.069> a<00:05:58.129> new<00:05:58.250> contract<00:05:58.400> as<00:05:58.789> much<00:05:58.969> because<00:05:59.210> it

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 
signed a new contract as much because it

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:00.939 
signed a new contract as much because it
means<00:05:59.659> that<00:05:59.779> when<00:06:00.050> he<00:06:00.169> goes<00:06:00.379> you'll<00:06:00.680> get<00:06:00.830> more

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:00.949 
means that when he goes you'll get more

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:02.769 
means that when he goes you'll get more
money<00:06:01.069> for<00:06:01.310> him<00:06:01.460> and<00:06:01.639> yet<00:06:02.089> the<00:06:02.210> chances<00:06:02.599> are<00:06:02.659> he

00:06:02.769 --> 00:06:02.779 
money for him and yet the chances are he

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:04.689 
money for him and yet the chances are he
will<00:06:02.900> leave<00:06:03.169> but<00:06:03.440> talking<00:06:04.009> back<00:06:04.159> to<00:06:04.190> mod<00:06:04.460> rich

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:30.289 
some other players but the problem was

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.409 
some other players but the problem was
doing<00:06:30.529> as<00:06:30.650> soon<00:06:30.770> as<00:06:30.979> you've<00:06:31.129> got<00:06:31.339> you<00:06:31.909> know<00:06:31.940> 35

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:32.419 
doing as soon as you've got you know 35

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:34.269 
doing as soon as you've got you know 35
40<00:06:33.020> million<00:06:33.199> in<00:06:33.409> your<00:06:33.500> back<00:06:33.649> pocket<00:06:34.069> every

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:34.279 
40 million in your back pocket every

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:36.629 
40 million in your back pocket every
play<00:06:35.000> you<00:06:35.300> inquire<00:06:35.750> shouldn't<00:06:36.199> he<00:06:36.259> goes

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:36.639 
play you inquire shouldn't he goes

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:38.489 
play you inquire shouldn't he goes
so<00:06:36.879> it's<00:06:37.240> a<00:06:37.389> balancing<00:06:37.810> act<00:06:37.930> between<00:06:38.080> going

00:06:38.489 --> 00:06:38.499 
so it's a balancing act between going

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:40.170 
so it's a balancing act between going
out<00:06:38.650> and<00:06:38.770> getting<00:06:38.919> a<00:06:38.949> place<00:06:39.159> perhaps<00:06:39.370> now<00:06:39.819> and

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830 
moderate being a little bit in the board

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.499 
moderate being a little bit in the board

said they're the club's usually I mean

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.860 
said they're the club's usually I mean
if<00:06:51.669> they<00:06:51.759> know<00:06:51.939> they<00:06:52.120> if<00:06:52.360> they<00:06:52.449> know<00:06:52.629> for<00:06:52.810> sure

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:52.870 
if they know they if they know for sure

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.179 
if they know they if they know for sure
and<00:06:53.169> they'll<00:06:53.259> have<00:06:53.409> a<00:06:53.499> very<00:06:53.710> good<00:06:53.860> idea<00:06:53.949> of

00:06:54.179 --> 00:06:54.189 
and they'll have a very good idea of

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:55.619 
and they'll have a very good idea of
Modric's<00:06:54.610> going<00:06:54.879> and<00:06:55.029> where<00:06:55.120> he's<00:06:55.240> going<00:06:55.539> and
