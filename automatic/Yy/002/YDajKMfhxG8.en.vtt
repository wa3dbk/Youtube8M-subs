00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Klaus bohms am and today I'm going to 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.230
 status of commanding the flip and the following 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.230
 Philip 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:17.160
 I do the same thing both pro flip 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.300
 while the city â€‹â€‹flip is the foot almost 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.820
 full 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.650
 just before the screw and full foot 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.480
 full I say is just before 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.760
 end of the shape here maybe a couple of 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.760
 Fingers like this is my way 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.629
 the movement is identical which of the eye 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.700
 the fed back 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.260
 of course you will hit I have here gives 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.760
 good pop the balance and the front foot 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.950
 in the first moment he will do the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.329
 movement of one eye even doubling 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.399
 so to get high but up there 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.340
 when you manage to achieve the highest 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:04.170
 possible height you will let escape 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:08.180
 the side so he will give yes you know this 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.180
 Thank you. 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.479
 I think the most complicated is this. 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.479
 even of picking up the right time 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.939
 release the front foot drop whatever 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.400
 say moment you release moment 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.490
 he's going to almost stop climbing 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.130
 Time to give the qat is the time stopped 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.250
 climb and after the descent is the 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.600
 possible as if you had the 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.600
 half eye down 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:46.479
 maybe you can adapt any tips 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.240
 I gave it but it's just practice the same day 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.130
 every day good mood 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.360
 juice in the vein 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:58.110
 sitting on the guide and tried on the street is like this 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.110
 What are you going to learn? 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:18.630
 but all of the recent new hope 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:22.520
 I'm klaus bohms I'm going to give a few touches 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.520
 command the flu and what flip
