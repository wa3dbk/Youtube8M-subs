00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.099 

go<00:00:56.660> ahead

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
go ahead

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.209 
go ahead
light<00:00:58.679> it<00:00:58.859> here<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.960> once<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.710> burn<00:01:02.190> chamber

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:10.219 
light it here and once the burn chamber
is<00:01:02.789> going<00:01:07.790> which<00:01:08.790> also<00:01:09.090> has<00:01:09.509> the<00:01:09.540> same<00:01:09.720> pot

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
is going which also has the same pot

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.600 
is going which also has the same pot
except<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.799> Bulls<00:01:10.979> are<00:01:11.159> combing<00:01:11.399> through

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
except the Bulls are combing through

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.210 
except the Bulls are combing through
that<00:01:12.390> goes<00:01:12.630> with<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.840> top<00:01:13.049> now<00:01:13.380> pull<00:01:14.189> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
that goes with the top now pull the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.340 
that goes with the top now pull the
camera<00:01:14.520> up<00:01:14.729> here<00:01:15.030> look<00:01:15.630> there's<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.899> little<00:01:16.020> gap

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
camera up here look there's a little gap

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.920 
camera up here look there's a little gap
between<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.130> two<00:01:17.369> inner<00:01:17.610> pots<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.750> that's

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
between the two inner pots and that's

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.249 
between the two inner pots and that's
where<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.200> secondary<00:01:19.680> air<00:01:20.659> around<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.810> holes

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
where the secondary air around the holes

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.730 
where the secondary air around the holes
if<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.740> all<00:01:22.890> makes<00:01:23.100> sense<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.490> use<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:24.740> what

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
if that all makes sense to use the what

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.679 
if that all makes sense to use the what
you<00:01:25.890> end<00:01:26.009> up<00:01:26.130> getting<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:27.179> very

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
you end up getting is this a very

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.389 
you end up getting is this a very
efficient<00:01:28.080> burn<00:01:28.229> it's<00:01:28.470> like<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.590> fire<00:01:28.920> thermos

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
efficient burn it's like a fire thermos

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.969 
efficient burn it's like a fire thermos
and<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:30.630> sticks<00:01:30.929> just<00:01:31.140> go<00:01:31.289> in<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.500> top<00:01:31.710> there

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
and the sticks just go in the top there

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.770 
and the sticks just go in the top there
like<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:32.970> said<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.360> gonna<00:01:33.450> be<00:01:33.569> a<00:01:33.630> short

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
like I said this is gonna be a short

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.190 
like I said this is gonna be a short
video<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.560> I'll<00:01:35.220> do<00:01:35.340> more<00:01:35.580> later<00:01:35.899> and<00:01:36.899> perhaps

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
video so I'll do more later and perhaps

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.320 
video so I'll do more later and perhaps
a<00:01:37.380> little<00:01:37.590> oil<00:01:37.830> tested<00:01:38.340> some<00:01:38.880> other<00:01:39.000> things

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
a little oil tested some other things

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.309 
a little oil tested some other things
but<00:01:40.190> it<00:01:41.190> basically<00:01:41.690> gasify<00:01:42.690> the<00:01:42.750> wood<00:01:43.049> that

00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:43.319 
but it basically gasify the wood that

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:55.280 
but it basically gasify the wood that
was<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.560> plan<00:01:53.000> fairly<00:01:54.000> good<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.270> win<00:01:54.450> there

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
was the plan fairly good to win there

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.550 
was the plan fairly good to win there
so<00:01:56.290> thanks<00:01:56.860> for<00:01:56.950> watching<00:01:58.049> we'll<00:01:59.049> do<00:01:59.170> more<00:01:59.409> on

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
so thanks for watching we'll do more on

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.159 
so thanks for watching we'll do more on
this<00:01:59.710> later
