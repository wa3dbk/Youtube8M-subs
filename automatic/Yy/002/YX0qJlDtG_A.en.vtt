actually<00:01:42.859> go<00:01:43.009> backwards<00:01:43.490> that<00:01:43.609> is<00:01:43.670> they're

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
actually go backwards that is they're

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:46.300 
actually go backwards that is they're
they're<00:01:44.689> in<00:01:44.719> great<00:01:45.109> shape<00:01:45.409> and<00:01:45.649> they<00:01:46.130> will

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
they're in great shape and they will

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.459 
they're in great shape and they will
actually<00:01:46.459> then<00:01:46.880> get<00:01:47.060> out<00:01:47.240> of<00:01:47.389> shape<00:01:47.630> so<00:01:48.200> they
