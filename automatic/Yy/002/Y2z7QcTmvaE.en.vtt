 we will present as well as a much more productive business 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.670
 taibo career product manager of scanners and multifunctionals for hp 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.270
 mexico and today I have the pleasure to represent our new scanner in 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.869
 the 77 10 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.239
 which is an ideal product for SMEs since it took was to denver its size is 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:35.670
 small so you do not need a large space to have additional 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.730
 It is accessible price but with all the benefits of visiting digitization 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.510
 that today you can offer hp 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.460
 surely your accountant notary medical lawyer 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.080
 you have a lot of information in a warehouse 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.810
 and this basis that 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.960
 little but this space looking for and managing these documents that are 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.200
 the day to day of these businesses 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.060
 and that is to present the four main benefits that you can 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.250
 get with this product 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.710
 the first beneficiary is the document weapon that can be houses canals is 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.880
 horned leaves letter size 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.740
 for example an electrocardiogram for all those radio the voice that 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.930
 They want to have their patients' files scanned 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.930
 the second benefit of generating databases from cards 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:30.860
 presentation 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.020
 surely we all have a lot of them without using the 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.500
 Soles we lose but we do not share them with all our colleagues 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.130
 work to take advantage of the seat 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.270
 chad in the 77 10 what gives you the advantage of being able to digitize the well 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.880
 to deny databases 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.340
 On the other hand, they acted individually 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.100
 if they do it individually 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.490
 you just have to place the card in the part of it through the scanner 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.040
 which is a special slot for them or you can do them by blocks 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.850
 placing them in the scanner feeder and only by learning a button 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.420
 but not only digitize them well including a single body 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.870
 what can you generate 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.270
 creating databases of these contacts with the min fields more 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.879
 important are more common 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:21.759
 They come included as the name the company the title of e 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:23.059
 the post 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:25.240
 the ine the phone 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.070
 and all this what will be generated will now be the time now in searches and 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.199
 especially 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:35.139
 avoid losing these contacts that are so important to our 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:35.870
 deal 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.349
 in this way between areas we can share this information since you 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.080
 allows the generation of databases that you can send ayc to share 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.469
 with all the areas of your company 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:51.119
 today they can even send it to the car to send them by email 

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:54.590
 four mobile devices phone ties 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.519
 As you can see this is one of the main tools offered by this 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.470
 scanner does not matter if you're a lawyer notary accountant this is a tool 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.119
 that will allow you such 

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:10.439
 have much faster access all these contacts avoid the loss of 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:15.239
 the same finally take advantage of this information that is so valuable 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.789
 for your company 

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:21.829
 the third benefit in profiling depending on the length of your 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.979
 theatrical business different documents that you want to digitize to share for 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:31.919
 store or to manage them more easily the scanner has the 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:37.089
 possibility of generating 32 different profiles that I do not want anything if you go to 

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:42.179
 generate a document that you want to leave from fcc is a profile if you want it cnc 

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:44.120
 it would be his second profile 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.060
 and he wants it to be a secret place third profile in black and white to color in order 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.640
 each of the tools in the digitalization can be generated by another 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.680
 stopped in one of these profiles 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.490
 the only thing you have to do is generate you have performed strong and 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.420
 then easily select which of these arrows and press the button 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.499
 digitization to generate these documents 

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:11.569
 with this clarification because you will not have to download a meaning every 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.379
 Once that is digitizing the funds commented you just have to do it with a 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:16.759
 only use 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:19.799
 the fourth benefit of the administration of all these 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.060
 printed documents it does not matter we go to the one to ask that you surely have a 

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:27.789
 a lot of files that digitize the only thing you have to 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:30.490
 do is place them in block 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.490
 to get a fifth digitization be much more accessible for all 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.640
 areas of your company 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.450
 you just have to place them in the scanner feeder and start the 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.020
 digitization of all your files one of the benefits is that you can 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.560
 generate different documents just by placing a white sheet 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.960
 where you want is to create another file 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.479
 even the most common is to grow 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.380
 these sheets can be pasted because those files usually have a lot 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:59.830
 stored time 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.300
 but the advantage is that the scanner to stop the process if this happens here 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.770
 is the benefit that you get is that you will not have any loss of 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.300
 information when you digital these files 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.710
 and the most important thing is that you will be able to search for the documents in a simple way 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.400
 and manage what I mean by looking 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:21.430
 all good are not included 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.400
 so you can make the knowledge of data and in this way can generate 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.520
 zone a search with just write a keyword of all 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.389
 these assets as you can see the era of digitalization is something that brings 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:38.669
 many benefits for all those entrepreneurs 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:43.439
 who have a large number of files or printed daily 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:49.449
 in view that you know them and what is different from these benefits to do 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.930
 durÃ¡n dam much more productive 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.020
 save time and especially to avoid loss 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.559
 these documents that are so important to your business
