00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
and the more it's transformed into sugar

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.920 
and the more it's transformed into sugar
and<00:00:33.219> we<00:00:33.399> end<00:00:33.550> up<00:00:33.670> with<00:00:33.820> a<00:00:33.880> sweet<00:00:34.149> liquid<00:00:34.570> cold

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
so now it's time to add mannequins

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.760 
so now it's time to add mannequins
special<00:01:40.760> proprietary<00:01:41.030> yeast<00:01:41.600> this<00:01:42.530> is<00:01:42.650> the

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
special proprietary yeast this is the

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.280 
special proprietary yeast this is the
same<00:01:43.010> yeast<00:01:43.370> strain<00:01:43.730> used<00:01:44.390> over<00:01:44.720> 100<00:01:45.110> years

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
same yeast strain used over 100 years

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.160 
same yeast strain used over 100 years
ago<00:01:45.620> and<00:01:46.070> why<00:01:46.490> Heineken<00:01:47.060> has<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:47.450> same<00:01:47.720> great

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
ago and why Heineken has the same great

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.440 
ago and why Heineken has the same great
taste<00:01:48.200> no<00:01:49.100> matter<00:01:49.520> where<00:01:49.820> in<00:01:49.940> the<00:01:49.970> world<00:01:50.060> you

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
taste no matter where in the world you

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.110 
taste no matter where in the world you
might<00:01:50.570> be<00:01:50.840> when<00:01:51.620> making<00:01:52.130> them<00:01:52.400> it<00:01:52.790> is<00:01:52.970> the

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
might be when making them it is the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.780 
might be when making them it is the
yeast<00:01:53.390> that<00:01:53.750> slowly<00:01:54.350> turns<00:01:54.770> your<00:01:55.010> brain<00:01:55.220> sugar

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
yeast that slowly turns your brain sugar

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.740 
yeast that slowly turns your brain sugar
into<00:01:56.420> carbon<00:01:56.900> dioxide<00:01:56.930> and<00:01:57.710> alcohol<00:01:58.750> this

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
into carbon dioxide and alcohol this

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.090 
into carbon dioxide and alcohol this
process<00:02:00.260> takes<00:02:00.530> about<00:02:00.940> 28<00:02:01.940> days<00:02:02.180> so<00:02:03.100> just

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
process takes about 28 days so just

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.930 
process takes about 28 days so just
relax<00:02:04.540> you'll<00:02:05.540> be<00:02:05.570> here<00:02:05.930> a<00:02:05.960> while
