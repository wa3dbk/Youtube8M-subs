00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.540
 He tied I finally his shirtfront it 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.210
 I liked the neck warm and doing 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.330
 drawing very good volume ugly 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.839
 the main heat and I tied literally over 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:20.689
 two days but it's from morning to fun of course 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:38.100
 so this is a couple of hours here and today i 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:41.600
 I tie a scarf from the rings the ball consists of 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.829
 ringlets their number can be 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.520
 countless as you want we will be 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.950
 do 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.739
 and the value also means everything depends on 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.760
 of how much wool I have I see 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:57.140
 residues that did not remain and see 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.140
 how many ringlets will be and how do i do it 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:05.850
 I see a ring on the knitting needles 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:09.900
 I am a prince and I have already typed 27 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.340
 loops and then further if someone does not 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.280
 I know how to play 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.720
 show well and I think everyone knows and 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.490
 Now I see the first due to rented as 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:27.810
 edge loop 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:32.030
 I knit the first row of facial loops I knit for 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:37.890
 back wall I'm not a master class I 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:39.900
 learned to knit from books so it can 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.860
 something disagree with me i am wrong 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.649
 I see I see for myself I am retired 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.630
 I have nothing here, she even somehow 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:54.420
 do right i have a granddaughter 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.810
 there is a scarf this will suit my raft 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:02.070
 wear me and pleasure and pleasure 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:07.649
 and to you who is watching me so here is the first 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:10.190
 row facial for back wall and up 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.190
 end of row 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:17.390
 I finished the first row turning over 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:21.290
 work second row purl loops i 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:26.440
 I knit the purl loop here I take 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:29.860
 I will lay out a loop for the front wall 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.860
 in this way 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:45.800
 and so I connected only 7 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:48.780
 in order for me to succeed 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.030
 I got such a ring now 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:56.340
 what should do 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:58.440
 close i close with the hook not 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.800
 it's easier here 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.690
 but you can with the help of course the needles me 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.910
 simpler and easier and faster with 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:10.170
 hooks do it closing like me 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:15.080
 close up are shown so going down like 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.080
 eyelets immediately fix them 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:29.430
 I am such a strip of this strip I 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.430
 I will make a ring 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:55.720
 looking daughters I closed this thread I 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.720
 cut off leaving a small tail such 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.379
 here billet as I do now 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.040
 little ring 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:08.780
 so I take my job my scarf 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:15.140
 here they are a little billets that's all 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:17.959
 Here ringlets with a hook means that 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:24.139
 i make this blank i put on exactly 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:29.510
 like a ring and on the front side here are those 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:32.600
 obverse combine then purl 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:35.660
 and on the face I will sew but I 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.510
 I will not sew, I'll tie that's no 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:46.419
 one tail like this i 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:51.250
 bind so here pass through the edge 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:54.860
 I spend this thread with a hook and 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:05:00.520
 so that these tips do not stick out 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:02.510
 I'm reaching you in the middle now 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.110
 start this thread 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:10.660
 turned out a bit short 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:16.090
 scary I bring it too so as if 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:20.020
 one exact went to now these 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.020
 I will tie the tips 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:30.229
 it turns out as if the connection here 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:37.060
 of this strip that sizo good on 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:37.060
 two knots tied and cut off all unnecessary 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:43.130
 I twist straighten 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:46.090
 I got it ring volume 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.090
 little ring 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:56.610
 in what way exactly the same way I do 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:06:00.180
 connect the next ring can these 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:03.690
 ring knit on three needles 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:07.050
 but I don't like it very much 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:10.290
 like i will show why because me 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:13.110
 It turns out longer and well, as if 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:15.540
 harder and so it turns out very 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:18.120
 quickly this scarf 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:22.050

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:24.680
 an hour so here i showed you my 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:27.800

 if you like please too 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:35.120
