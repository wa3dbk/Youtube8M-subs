00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 demonstrate with the help of a trial 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.270
 I give them the water storage today 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.200
 ability of two different 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.090
 substrates can be seen in comparison 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:18.000
 For this I use three-cylinder all 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.439
 The cylinders have a hole in the bottom 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.020
 are filled with half each 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.830
 liter play sound of a conventional good 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.230
 Pflanzerde and pcm is I always pour 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.609
 the same amount of water in the cylinder 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.980
 the water is for the better 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.200
 Illustration of the test stained blue 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.730
 a part of the water is then directly 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.219
 absorbed by the substrate 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.110
 another part is still running 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.559
 in the bottom through in this glass container 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.090
 where it is collected the less water 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.670
 then in glass containers 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.579
 collects the more water directly now 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:55.550
 stored in the substrate we start now 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:59.510
 the water shoots with the play gate 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.510
 Carefully in the cylinder 1 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.290
 easy turning of the cylinder should 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.770
 help the granules to steady 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.770
 moisten 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:29.500
 As you can see, spreadtrum takes comfort 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:31.320
 rose to the pores are at the 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.180
 closed surface 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.130
 most of the water runs directly 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.300
 through completely through and collects 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.300
 down in glass containers 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:02:03.039
 now to the earth here too i am pouring 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:03.039
 Carefully pour the water into the potting soil 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.489
 Again, turn the cylinder around 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.140
 the earth to enable the water 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.140
 to absorb evenly and everywhere 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.209
 here too, a large part of the 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.270
 water through the potting soil through without 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.680
 to be included 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.510
 this has the consequence that the plants 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:39.209
 not always enough with water and 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:40.349
 Nutrients is also available here 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.090
 so that the excess water 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.090
 back down in klaus becker 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:03:00.030
 we come to very close is the 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.230
 waterbed carefully again from above 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:07.830
 cast the zone turned west 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:11.060
 the color series changes from one 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.520
 Terracotta colors tone in a dark red 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.950
 you can see it very well how 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:24.180
 it is very moisture directly 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:28.050
 stores series consists of one 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.300
 natural death from the westerwald through 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.120
 his open previous evil sound 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.490
 Granules can water the water optimally 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.180
 record and very fast again 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.410
 submit 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.410
 it behaves like a sponge 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:54.480
 the moisture and nutrients themselves 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.480
 optimal symptom granules 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.159
 this is the water of the plant 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.659
 very well available 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:10.000
 even at completely on said 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:11.950
 Moisture is always in the clay granules 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.060
 still enough oxygen for the 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.060
 supply of the plant 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.500
 I think you can tell the difference 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.360
 clearly recognize the comparison with 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.669
 other substrates shows why very am 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.919
 is so much better than mineral 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.479
 product is stable and leipzig structure 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.090
 does not compress and thus creates 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.880
 long term the ideal water balance 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.560
 For all your plants you are fine 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.050
 for plants and plants are good for 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.360
 she hopes that you will receive our short 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.900
 has liked the demonstration and many 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.900
 thanks for watching
