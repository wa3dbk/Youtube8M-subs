 while some kids just like me i did not think or pins out 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.909
 Ergenzingen times that in Bavaria 

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:14.359
 I'm looking forward to having a good time with them that would be 

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:18.009
 You know, I really wanted to spend at least some time on the same thing 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:19.980
 Go to school 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.859
 is that unbearable I am suddenly a man to his visitors at the 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:25.039
 School as long as you want 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.599
 as long as you're close to that i dont have to worry but you should 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.849
 take advantage of the fact that they live with the chains under one roof 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.890
 they should and could heed the draw to stay on the heels then stopped 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.370
 I personally in a corridor and because they are using a 300 kilowatt peak 8 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.490
 God help me so much as I did them all a few times I did 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.220
 I finished they were rejected worldwide, the situation was not easy for them 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.579
 as long as both continue 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.580
 conceivably we would be the junior partner of a copious amount of work van 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.380
 Gaal 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.380
 would have 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.400
 I am a 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.970
 so far 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.070
 is not that judge 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.070
 I had in the past few days with the 18th 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.760
 v 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.190
 SID 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.200
 Bern 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.200
 Seeing on the Internet that is quite excellent 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.170
 kl 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.299
 Federer even if one 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.299
 but the way does not go far 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.230
 at the same time 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.720
 Now you're on it for only two weeks as an exchange student with us 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.650
 Stay tuned in our midst have become welcome 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.060
 Look in a blanket so stay 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.210
 then they will not be bombing technology and this whole military 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.699
 Do not bother to bully you 

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:09.629
