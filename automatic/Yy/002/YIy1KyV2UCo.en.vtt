Waypoint to Joe cash a name a little
hint<00:00:35.870> and<00:00:36.620> let's<00:00:37.400> program<00:00:37.640> that<00:00:38.000> right<00:00:38.210> now<00:00:38.390> so

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810 
hint and let's program that right now so

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.380 
hint and let's program that right now so
we<00:00:38.930> have<00:00:39.079> our<00:00:39.230> argon<00:00:39.650> here

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
we have our argon here

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.479 
we have our argon here
easiest<00:00:41.390> way<00:00:41.600> to<00:00:41.630> do<00:00:41.870> this<00:00:42.079> is<00:00:42.590> to<00:00:43.250> actually

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
easiest way to do this is to actually

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.930 
easiest way to do this is to actually
change<00:00:43.940> your<00:00:44.060> profile<00:00:44.829> to<00:00:45.829> the<00:00:46.460> geocaching

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
change your profile to the geocaching

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.120 
change your profile to the geocaching
profile<00:00:49.180> because<00:00:50.180> when<00:00:50.360> you<00:00:50.480> change<00:00:50.510> it<00:00:51.130> or

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.130 
profile because when you change it or

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.120 
profile because when you change it or
batteries<00:00:52.460> just<00:00:52.670> a<00:00:52.730> little<00:00:52.970> oh<00:00:53.059> that's<00:00:53.360> why

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
batteries just a little oh that's why

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.319 
batteries just a little oh that's why
because<00:00:55.130> when<00:00:55.460> you<00:00:55.579> change<00:00:55.880> it

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
because when you change it

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.560 
because when you change it
for<00:00:56.690> example<00:00:57.050> the<00:00:57.140> compass<00:00:57.470> page<00:00:58.120> you<00:00:59.120> saw<00:00:59.540> a

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
for example the compass page you saw a

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.110 
for example the compass page you saw a
little<00:00:59.690> mr.<00:00:59.989> chair<00:01:00.170> that<00:01:00.350> chirp<00:01:00.649> is<00:01:01.120> enabled

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
little mr. chair that chirp is enabled

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.880 
little mr. chair that chirp is enabled
for<00:01:02.510> searching<00:01:02.809> so<00:01:02.960> it's<00:01:03.140> all<00:01:03.290> researching

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
for searching so it's all researching

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.520 
for searching so it's all researching
here<00:01:04.670> that<00:01:04.850> detected<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:05.840> chirp<00:01:06.080> we<00:01:06.260> can<00:01:06.409> view

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
here that detected the chirp we can view

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.310 
here that detected the chirp we can view
the<00:01:06.680> details<00:01:07.130> or<00:01:07.340> tap<00:01:07.520> ok<00:01:07.909> let's<00:01:08.750> view<00:01:09.170> the

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
the details or tap ok let's view the

details

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.850 
details
says<00:01:10.940> here<00:01:11.150> that<00:01:11.180> the<00:01:11.390> church<00:01:11.630> chirp<00:01:12.200> hasn't

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
says here that the church chirp hasn't

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.620 
says here that the church chirp hasn't
been<00:01:12.979> programmed<00:01:13.370> like<00:01:13.549> the<00:01:13.729> program<00:01:14.120> it<00:01:14.270> yes

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
been programmed like the program it yes

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.960 
been programmed like the program it yes
no<00:01:14.840> let's<00:01:15.110> choose<00:01:15.380> yes<00:01:15.680> here<00:01:16.580> we<00:01:16.610> see<00:01:16.850> the

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
no let's choose yes here we see the

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.560 
no let's choose yes here we see the
details<00:01:18.040> obviously<00:01:19.040> the<00:01:19.460> chirp<00:01:19.729> is<00:01:19.970> empty<00:01:20.420> so

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
details obviously the chirp is empty so

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.859 
details obviously the chirp is empty so
there's<00:01:20.780> nothing<00:01:20.930> in<00:01:21.170> there<00:01:22.360> we<00:01:23.360> can<00:01:23.510> send<00:01:23.780> the

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
there's nothing in there we can send the

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:25.960 
there's nothing in there we can send the
waypoints<00:01:24.500> in<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:24.680> Jo<00:01:24.890> cache<00:01:25.159> the<00:01:25.700> name

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
waypoints in the Jo cache the name

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.960 
waypoints in the Jo cache the name
change<00:01:26.659> the<00:01:26.720> message<00:01:27.140> and<00:01:27.350> the<00:01:27.440> race<00:01:27.670> so<00:01:28.670> let's

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
change the message and the race so let's

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.609 
change the message and the race so let's
send<00:01:29.659> it<00:01:29.840> a<00:01:30.189> geocache<00:01:31.210> so<00:01:32.439> let's<00:01:33.439> say<00:01:33.590> that

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
send it a geocache so let's say that

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.830 
send it a geocache so let's say that
we're<00:01:33.920> doing<00:01:34.070> a<00:01:34.369> a<00:01:34.549> multi<00:01:35.060> so<00:01:35.299> we<00:01:35.450> want<00:01:35.630> people

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
we're doing a a multi so we want people

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.410 
we're doing a a multi so we want people
to<00:01:36.080> walk<00:01:36.229> by<00:01:36.439> a<00:01:36.470> trailhead<00:01:36.890> and<00:01:37.369> receive<00:01:38.240> the

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
to walk by a trailhead and receive the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.920 
to walk by a trailhead and receive the
Waypoint<00:01:38.930> so<00:01:39.530> let's<00:01:39.860> choose<00:01:40.479> this<00:01:41.479> one<00:01:41.540> right

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
Waypoint so let's choose this one right

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.020 
Waypoint so let's choose this one right
here<00:01:43.240> and<00:01:44.240> let's<00:01:44.600> tap<00:01:44.869> on<00:01:44.900> send<00:01:45.740> so<00:01:46.700> that<00:01:46.729> is

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
here and let's tap on send so that is

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.620 
here and let's tap on send so that is
going<00:01:47.270> to<00:01:47.509> send<00:01:47.840> those<00:01:48.650> coordinates<00:01:49.450> to<00:01:50.450> it

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
going to send those coordinates to it

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.710 
going to send those coordinates to it
now<00:01:50.930> a<00:01:51.189> geocache<00:01:52.189> also<00:01:52.520> has<00:01:52.700> some<00:01:53.030> text<00:01:53.540> to<00:01:53.600> it

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
now a geocache also has some text to it

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.980 
now a geocache also has some text to it
so<00:01:54.140> we'll<00:01:55.070> see<00:01:55.340> if<00:01:55.549> that<00:01:56.000> gets<00:01:56.210> sent<00:01:56.540> to<00:01:56.750> the

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
so we'll see if that gets sent to the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.800 
so we'll see if that gets sent to the
message<00:01:57.320> field<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.799> message<00:01:58.100> feels<00:01:58.310> on<00:01:58.460> about

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
message field the message feels on about

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.950 
message field the message feels on about
50<00:01:59.810> characters<00:02:00.259> the<00:02:00.920> name<00:02:01.189> is<00:02:01.810> limited<00:02:02.810> to

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
50 characters the name is limited to

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.560 
50 characters the name is limited to
nine<00:02:03.140> characters<00:02:03.799> you<00:02:04.670> can<00:02:04.850> send<00:02:05.150> the<00:02:05.299> stage

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
nine characters you can send the stage

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.290 
nine characters you can send the stage
to<00:02:05.900> the<00:02:06.020> Waypoint<00:02:06.470> and<00:02:07.090> that's<00:02:08.090> about<00:02:08.209> it

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
to the Waypoint and that's about it

which was never and see the little hint
here<00:02:33.210> look<00:02:33.480> for<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.780> sign<00:02:34.020> and<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:35.340> can<00:02:35.550> see

regular way points or geocaches so be a
