00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
was set up and checked out my lighting

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.010 
was set up and checked out my lighting
checked<00:01:22.259> out<00:01:22.409> my<00:01:22.650> substrate<00:01:23.689> started<00:01:24.689> working

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
checked out my substrate started working

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.899 
checked out my substrate started working
on<00:01:25.110> my<00:01:25.320> canopy<00:01:25.710> you'll<00:01:26.280> see<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.700> is

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
on my canopy you'll see this is

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.480 
on my canopy you'll see this is
lightweight<00:01:27.390> construction<00:01:28.250> compared<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.369> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
lightweight construction compared to the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.640 
lightweight construction compared to the
stand<00:01:29.960> both<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.170> which<00:01:31.290> were<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.500> little

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
stand both of which were a little

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.670 
stand both of which were a little
overkill<00:01:32.250> but<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.780> know<00:01:33.900> better<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.560> be

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
overkill but you know better to be

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.179 
overkill but you know better to be
sturdy<00:01:35.100> than<00:01:35.689> flimsy<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.530> installed<00:01:38.130> a

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
couple strip lights I kind of continued

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.490 
couple strip lights I kind of continued
on<00:01:40.740> with<00:01:40.920> my<00:01:41.100> sketches<00:01:41.820> installed<00:01:42.479> my<00:01:42.689> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
on with my sketches installed my the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.800 
on with my sketches installed my the
rest<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.860> my<00:01:43.950> lighting<00:01:44.509> and<00:01:47.149> then<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.180> really

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810

my<00:02:13.409> skirt<00:02:13.860> as<00:02:14.129> well<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:15.269> you<00:02:15.329> see<00:02:15.569> this<00:02:15.719> is<00:02:15.870> the

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
my skirt as well so you see this is the

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.589 
my skirt as well so you see this is the
first<00:02:16.200> time<00:02:16.379> I<00:02:16.409> have<00:02:16.650> all<00:02:16.799> three<00:02:17.099> set<00:02:17.370> up<00:02:17.549> in<00:02:18.030> my

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
first time I have all three set up in my

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.890 
first time I have all three set up in my
room<00:02:18.980> it's<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.040> glass<00:02:20.310> coffin<00:02:20.670> six<00:02:21.329> feet<00:02:21.599> long

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
room it's a glass coffin six feet long

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.990 
room it's a glass coffin six feet long
and<00:02:22.790> you<00:02:23.790> know<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:24.480> barely<00:02:24.780> fit<00:02:25.230> in<00:02:25.920> in<00:02:26.849> the

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
and you know it barely fit in in the

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.479 
and you know it barely fit in in the
space<00:02:27.329> so<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:28.049> was<00:02:28.469> lucky<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:28.859> was<00:02:29.040> able<00:02:29.159> to<00:02:29.370> get

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
space so I was lucky I was able to get

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.809 
space so I was lucky I was able to get
it<00:02:29.609> in<00:02:29.790> so<00:02:30.750> here's<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.349> styrofoam<00:02:32.010> I<00:02:32.280> start<00:02:32.730> to

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
it in so here's a styrofoam I start to

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.539 
it in so here's a styrofoam I start to
cut<00:02:33.030> it<00:02:33.180> into<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.599> shape<00:02:33.629> that<00:02:33.930> I<00:02:34.400> think<00:02:35.400> that

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
cut it into the shape that I think that

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.270 
cut it into the shape that I think that
I<00:02:35.609> need<00:02:35.760> flipped<00:02:36.569> upside<00:02:37.049> down<00:02:37.079> glued<00:02:38.010> it<00:02:38.159> all

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
I need flipped upside down glued it all

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.330 
I need flipped upside down glued it all
together<00:02:38.459> and<00:02:39.500> while<00:02:40.500> I<00:02:40.530> was<00:02:40.709> working<00:02:41.040> on<00:02:41.129> that

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
together and while I was working on that

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.589 
together and while I was working on that
I<00:02:41.370> also<00:02:41.549> started<00:02:42.389> to<00:02:43.670> wash<00:02:44.670> some<00:02:45.030> of<00:02:45.120> my<00:02:45.239> sand

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
I also started to wash some of my sand

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.660 
I also started to wash some of my sand
so<00:02:46.079> you'll<00:02:46.349> see<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.560> have<00:02:46.739> my<00:02:46.889> drawing<00:02:47.159> in<00:02:47.430> front

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
so you'll see I have my drawing in front

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.629 
so you'll see I have my drawing in front
of<00:02:47.760> me<00:02:47.939> I'm<00:02:48.299> starting<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.079> carve<00:02:49.409> my<00:02:49.859> styrofoam

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639 
of me I'm starting to carve my styrofoam

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.000 
of me I'm starting to carve my styrofoam
which<00:02:50.939> has<00:02:51.120> previously<00:02:51.780> been<00:02:51.870> glued<00:02:52.769> together

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
which has previously been glued together

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.819 
which has previously been glued together
with<00:02:53.430> silicone<00:02:53.909> and<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:55.049> main<00:02:55.230> tools<00:02:55.530> for

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
with silicone and the main tools for

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:01.509 
with silicone and the main tools for
that<00:02:55.980> are<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.909> saw<00:02:57.629> and<00:02:58.049> a<00:02:58.769> knife<00:02:59.459> and<00:02:59.870> just<00:03:00.870> a

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
that are a saw and a knife and just a

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.899 
that are a saw and a knife and just a
pic<00:03:02.519> of<00:03:02.760> some<00:03:03.209> kind<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:04.159> you<00:03:05.159> see<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.340> work<00:03:05.579> away

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
pic of some kind and you see I work away

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.089 
pic of some kind and you see I work away
on<00:03:06.090> it<00:03:06.269> took<00:03:06.569> a<00:03:06.599> couple<00:03:06.780> days<00:03:07.139> to<00:03:07.500> really<00:03:07.769> carve

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
on it took a couple days to really carve

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:09.110 
on it took a couple days to really carve
it<00:03:08.280> out

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
it out

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.080 
it out
you<00:03:09.389> know<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.739> more<00:03:10.739> of<00:03:10.859> an<00:03:10.950> art<00:03:11.099> form<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:11.760> then

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
you know is more of an art form and then

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.690 
you know is more of an art form and then
the<00:03:12.239> last<00:03:12.419> step<00:03:12.659> there<00:03:13.049> before<00:03:13.470> putting<00:03:14.430> the

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
the last step there before putting the

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.819 
the last step there before putting the
dry<00:03:14.879> lock<00:03:15.150> on<00:03:15.389> is<00:03:15.689> to<00:03:15.930> seal<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.739> entire

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
dry lock on is to seal the entire

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.399 
dry lock on is to seal the entire
surface<00:03:17.340> with<00:03:17.609> a<00:03:17.819> heat<00:03:18.090> gun<00:03:18.120> that<00:03:19.019> make<00:03:19.229> sure

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
surface with a heat gun that make sure

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:21.530 
surface with a heat gun that make sure
the<00:03:19.560> little<00:03:19.680> flecks<00:03:20.370> don't<00:03:20.790> come<00:03:21.000> off<00:03:21.239> the

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
the little flecks don't come off the

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.069 
the little flecks don't come off the
foam<00:03:21.780> beads<00:03:22.379> and<00:03:23.060> I<00:03:24.060> can't<00:03:24.540> stress<00:03:24.870> this

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
foam beads and I can't stress this

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.960 
foam beads and I can't stress this
enough<00:03:25.260> but<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.769> more<00:03:26.040> coats<00:03:26.310> of<00:03:26.489> dry<00:03:26.729> lock

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
enough but the more coats of dry lock

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.599 
enough but the more coats of dry lock
you<00:03:27.239> use<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.720> better<00:03:27.930> see<00:03:28.859> I<00:03:28.889> started<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.459> get

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
you use the better see I started to get

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:33.080 
you use the better see I started to get
in<00:03:29.760> some<00:03:30.120> mangroves<00:03:31.549> and<00:03:32.549> the<00:03:32.639> plan<00:03:32.849> was<00:03:33.030> to

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
in some mangroves and the plan was to

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.300 
in some mangroves and the plan was to
put<00:03:33.329> those<00:03:33.479> in<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.780> back<00:03:33.989> of<00:03:34.199> the<00:03:34.290> tank<00:03:34.530> this

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
put those in the back of the tank this

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.979 
put those in the back of the tank this
is<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.579> first<00:03:35.849> batch<00:03:36.120> of<00:03:36.150> mangroves<00:03:36.780> that<00:03:36.900> I

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
is the first batch of mangroves that I

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.649 
is the first batch of mangroves that I
purchased<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:38.400> ones<00:03:38.609> that<00:03:38.790> you've<00:03:38.909> seen<00:03:38.940> in

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659 
purchased the ones that you've seen in

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:41.500 
purchased the ones that you've seen in
recent<00:03:40.049> videos<00:03:40.349> are<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.590> ones<00:03:40.620> that<00:03:41.040> I

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
recent videos are the ones that I

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.719 
recent videos are the ones that I
acquired<00:03:42.739> see<00:03:43.739> I've<00:03:43.889> got<00:03:44.099> some<00:03:44.400> really<00:03:44.609> good

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:44.729 
acquired see I've got some really good

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:47.659 
acquired see I've got some really good
depth<00:03:45.209> of<00:03:45.419> color<00:03:45.720> on<00:03:46.109> the<00:03:46.430> background<00:03:47.430> now

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
depth of color on the background now

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:50.949 
depth of color on the background now
it's<00:03:48.569> probably<00:03:49.079> four<00:03:49.409> or<00:03:49.440> five<00:03:49.530> coats<00:03:50.040> and

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
it's probably four or five coats and

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.780 
it's probably four or five coats and
since<00:03:51.959> there's<00:03:52.290> a<00:03:52.349> cross<00:03:52.889> brace<00:03:53.220> in<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.549> tank

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
since there's a cross brace in the tank

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.509 
since there's a cross brace in the tank
I<00:03:54.000> needed<00:03:54.329> to<00:03:54.449> cut<00:03:54.690> my<00:03:55.049> background<00:03:56.010> into<00:03:56.310> three

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
I needed to cut my background into three

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.759 
I needed to cut my background into three
or<00:03:56.609> four<00:03:56.790> pieces<00:03:57.000> in<00:03:57.419> order<00:03:58.109> to<00:03:58.260> get<00:03:58.439> it<00:03:58.620> in

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
or four pieces in order to get it in

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:04.490 
or four pieces in order to get it in
don't<00:03:59.069> worry<00:03:59.599> it<00:04:00.599> went<00:04:00.930> in<00:04:01.109> fine<00:04:01.609> and<00:04:03.290> after<00:04:04.290> I

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
don't worry it went in fine and after I

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.379 
don't worry it went in fine and after I
was<00:04:04.650> done<00:04:04.799> touching<00:04:05.220> it<00:04:05.340> up<00:04:05.430> you<00:04:06.000> can't<00:04:06.239> really

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
was done touching it up you can't really

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.409 
was done touching it up you can't really
see<00:04:06.870> where<00:04:07.409> the<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.979> seams<00:04:08.370> are<00:04:08.639> so<00:04:09.000> it<00:04:09.150> wasn't

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:09.419 
see where the the seams are so it wasn't

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:11.629 
see where the the seams are so it wasn't

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
that big of a deal here it is lit up

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:15.050 
that big of a deal here it is lit up
with<00:04:12.150> no<00:04:12.329> water<00:04:12.629> in<00:04:12.900> it<00:04:13.019> yet<00:04:13.229> and<00:04:13.729> I'm<00:04:14.729> pretty
