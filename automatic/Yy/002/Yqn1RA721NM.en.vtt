00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.880
 basically food program 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.730
 has a laboratory in which 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.950
 we are now taking pictures is 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.619
 certified under iso 9000 standards and in the 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.760
 that three processes are carried out 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.980
 such as the elaboration of the 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.150
 seeds the maintenance of the bank of 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.949
 germplasm and everything that is 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.720
 research and transfer for 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.119
 encourage the development of production 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.369
 within the province good has 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.259
 different ways of contacting 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.609
 us either by mail by phone what 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.070
 what we usually do is to set a 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:35.530
 interview in which we meet and 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.899
 we chatted a little about their 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.670
 intentions of projects your intentions 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.710
 to carry forward the productive process 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.460
 and we are adjusting certain issues 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.769
 techniques to the project 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.510
 general that you go armed have a 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.309
 potential and can move forward and 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.840
 good they are agreeing guidelines and it goes 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.030
 working with that once the 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.530
 project is armed all the part of the 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.230
 project implementation commissioning 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.880
 March and follow-up 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.770
 It is developed for free and 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.080
 steadily with each one of the 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.390
 entrepreneurs will be responsible for 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.280
 laboratory technique I'm in charge of 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.610
 what is the management system of 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.990
 mushroom processing quality of 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.360
 advise on what is processing 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.630
 mushrooms in both dehydrated and pickled 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.460
 other products more and apart from a 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.860
 part of the process that of the 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.080
 I also ask for seeds 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.440
 if you explain exactly what is the 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.540
 seed processing process 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.960
 At first we have a 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.850
 germplasm bank that contains 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.700
 approximately 40 fungal strains 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.270
 both ages as lentini 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.280
 pleurotus ostreatus and the process of 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.860
 Seed processing starts from 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.770
 from there of the tubes that we 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.950
 with we have with him with the mushroom we start 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.060
 to a petri dish that has a home 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.509
 enriched 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.570
 We passed the tube a small mouthful of 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.490
 that tube we passed it to petri dish that 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.939
 petri dish already once you have this 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.190
 agar snack with mushrooms we passed it to 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.760
 a farming stove that is located 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.550
 25 degrees and it takes a time of 7 days 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.220
 so that this mushroom can say in 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.340
 way to completely cover the plate 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.950
 petri once the petre plate is 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.000
 covered in its entirety with this fungus 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.430
 this flask is passed to a primary bottle 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.390
 primary has previously been 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.519
 sterilized and with with seeds of my 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.400
 son and was previously mixed as well 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:41.519
 with plaster the plaster is used more than anything 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.010
 to lower the ph of the seed and to 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.019
 that the fungus can grow once 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.540
 I have the primary bottle with seed 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.120
 my son and already sterilized 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.579
 it's from that plate that I already had that is 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.799
 invaded with this mushroom happened to this 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.140
 flask to this jar small snacks 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:01.230
 of this plate the steps this jar 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.480
 primary this primary vial led him to 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.870
 an incubation room that takes 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.090
 approximately 14 12 days in incubate 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.310
 completely the vial this fungus that 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.530
 I just incubate 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.690
 after this jar once it is 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.330
 completely incubated by the fungus what 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.660
 step to a secondary bottle that we 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:25.470
 we call it so it contains seeds of 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.930
 wheat and also plaster that is also 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.760
 used to lower the ph this jar 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.239
 secondary once it was 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.510
 previously sterilized is inoculated with 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:39.150
 two or three tablespoons with 10 pardon with 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.330
 10 to 12 tablespoons of 20 grams 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.310
 approximately he passes it from that vial 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.610
 primary is passed to a secondary bottle 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.410
 these 10 tablespoons once the 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.140
 secondary vial is incubated with 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.519
 these spoonfuls that I put him 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.099
 also goes back to room 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:59.130
 incubation that is also at 25 degrees 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:02.819
 once this jar meets all 7 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:05.010
 days it is said that the bottle is incubated 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.349
 completely with the fungus 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.689
 after there from the secondary bottle it 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:12.629
 happens what we call bags 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:16.169
 tertiary tertiary bags also 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:18.389
 contain sterilized wheat and gypsum 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.239
 previously and incubated with this 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:22.500
 flask containing the fungus and it 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.510
 incubates with seven tablespoons 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.840
 approximately that each one weighs 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.120
 approximately 20 grams yes and from there to 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.030
 that bag was passed to the room 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.520
 incubation that is at 25 degrees and the 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.949
 leave this bag for 7 days in this 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.440
 room in these conditions until 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:42.330
 completely covers the bag with the fungus 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.699
 the mushroom is fully incubated in that voice 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.220
 that's what we marketed this is the 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:49.500
 say bag is the final product that 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.050
 goes on sale for the producer or the 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.490
 client the total process how long it lasts 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.470
 or less and the total process 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.289
 approximately lasts about 40 days 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:02.750
 starting from what is the plate up 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.750
 get to the tertiary bag 40 days
