what's up Internet Johnson here with TLD
back<00:00:02.580> was<00:00:02.820> another<00:00:03.030> Geekbench<00:00:03.570> and<00:00:03.780> speed

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
back was another Geekbench and speed

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.360 
back was another Geekbench and speed
test<00:00:04.350> this<00:00:04.500> time<00:00:04.680> we're<00:00:04.859> taking<00:00:04.950> a<00:00:05.130> look<00:00:05.220> at

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
test this time we're taking a look at

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.660 
test this time we're taking a look at
the<00:00:05.520> core<00:00:05.759> i5<00:00:06.500> 13-inch<00:00:07.500> baseline<00:00:07.980> MacBook<00:00:08.429> Pro

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
the core i5 13-inch baseline MacBook Pro

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.209 
the core i5 13-inch baseline MacBook Pro
so<00:00:08.700> prior<00:00:09.179> I<00:00:09.210> got<00:00:09.510> a<00:00:09.540> score<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:09.840> 64<00:00:10.469> 56

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
so prior I got a score of 64 56

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.100 
so prior I got a score of 64 56
let's<00:00:11.849> go<00:00:12.000> in<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.300> run<00:00:12.450> it<00:00:12.599> one<00:00:12.719> more<00:00:12.870> time<00:00:13.049> so

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
let's go in and run it one more time so

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.900 
let's go in and run it one more time so
you<00:00:13.349> guys<00:00:13.590> can<00:00:13.920> I<00:00:14.040> see<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.309> in<00:00:14.400> real-time<00:00:14.580> make

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
you guys can I see it in real-time make

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.060 
you guys can I see it in real-time make
sure<00:00:15.000> I'm<00:00:15.089> not<00:00:15.210> lying<00:00:15.800> there's<00:00:16.800> everything

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070

64-bit version of Geekbench in case you
guys<00:00:27.750> are<00:00:27.930> wondering<00:00:27.960> we're<00:00:28.890> nearing<00:00:29.189> over

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
guys are wondering we're nearing over

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.950 
guys are wondering we're nearing over
the<00:00:29.490> halfway<00:00:29.760> point<00:00:29.880> we<00:00:30.240> should<00:00:30.269> be<00:00:30.449> done<00:00:30.750> any

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
the halfway point we should be done any

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.749 
the halfway point we should be done any
second<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:32.070> here<00:00:32.369> we<00:00:32.460> go

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
second so here we go

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.030 
second so here we go
64<00:00:33.600> 71<00:00:34.110> actually<00:00:34.440> higher<00:00:34.649> than<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.860> got

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
64 71 actually higher than I got

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.229 
64 71 actually higher than I got
previously<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:35.730> there<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.910> guys<00:00:36.000> have<00:00:36.059> it

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
previously so there you guys have it

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.819 
previously so there you guys have it
let's<00:00:36.750> go<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:36.989> jump<00:00:37.110> over<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.320> ScreenFlow<00:00:37.680> 4

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
let's go and jump over to ScreenFlow 4

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.610 
let's go and jump over to ScreenFlow 4
an<00:00:37.950> HD<00:00:38.250> export<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.420> dual<00:00:39.719> core<00:00:39.809> Core

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
an HD export so this is a dual core Core

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.709 
an HD export so this is a dual core Core
i5<00:00:40.800> two<00:00:41.280> points<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.610> week<00:00:41.730> ago<00:00:41.910> Hertz<00:00:42.090> processor

one<00:00:43.290> thing<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.559> guys<00:00:43.680> got<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:44.010> notice

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
one thing you guys got to notice

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.889 
one thing you guys got to notice
compared<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.760> previous<00:00:45.149> generation<00:00:45.180> Core

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
compared to the previous generation Core

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.440 
compared to the previous generation Core
2<00:00:46.079> duos<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:47.250> feature<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.670> hyper<00:00:47.879> 13<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:48.329> what

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
2 duos this feature is hyper 13 so what

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.270 
2 duos this feature is hyper 13 so what
that<00:00:48.629> does<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.050> your<00:00:49.200> OS<00:00:49.469> sees<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.890> as<00:00:50.010> for

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
that does is your OS sees it as for

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.040 
that does is your OS sees it as for
course<00:00:50.579> it's<00:00:50.760> not<00:00:50.879> for<00:00:51.059> physical<00:00:51.570> cores<00:00:51.809> but

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
course it's not for physical cores but

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.990 
course it's not for physical cores but
there's<00:00:52.230> four<00:00:52.469> threads<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.640> get<00:00:53.789> four

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
there's four threads and you get four

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.400 
there's four threads and you get four
threads<00:00:54.239> two<00:00:54.390> processor<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:54.930> it's<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.110> huge

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
threads two processor so it's a huge

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.729 
threads two processor so it's a huge
different<00:00:55.829> compared<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> core<00:00:56.460> two<00:00:56.610> duo's

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
different compared to the core two duo's

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.170 
different compared to the core two duo's
we're<00:00:58.739> nearing<00:00:58.980> probably<00:00:59.579> about<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.969> halfway

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
we're nearing probably about the halfway

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.560 
we're nearing probably about the halfway
point<00:01:00.420> we're<00:01:00.840> about<00:01:00.989> 27<00:01:01.739> seconds<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.280> far<00:01:02.609> and

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
point we're about 27 seconds so far and

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.700 
point we're about 27 seconds so far and
if<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.750> guys<00:01:03.870> are<00:01:04.049> wondering<00:01:04.290> whether<00:01:04.559> you

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
if you guys are wondering whether you

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.560 
if you guys are wondering whether you
pick<00:01:04.830> up<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.129> 13-inch<00:01:05.549> base<00:01:06.000> line<00:01:06.270> or<00:01:06.299> do<00:01:06.479> you

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
pick up the 13-inch base line or do you

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.840 
pick up the 13-inch base line or do you
jump<00:01:06.720> up<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.020> i7<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.560> be<00:01:07.680> honest<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.250> was

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
jump up to the i7 to be honest I was

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.280 
jump up to the i7 to be honest I was
looking<00:01:09.090> at<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.210> couple<00:01:09.390> Geekbench<00:01:09.840> scores<00:01:10.170> and

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
looking at a couple Geekbench scores and

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.390 
looking at a couple Geekbench scores and
there's<00:01:10.409> not<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.830> big<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.250> difference

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
there's not that big of a difference

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.800 
there's not that big of a difference
I'll<00:01:11.700> kind<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:11.939> do<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.090> more<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.420> depth<00:01:12.659> video

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
I'll kind of do a more in depth video

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.020 
I'll kind of do a more in depth video
I'm<00:01:13.110> pretty<00:01:13.350> soon<00:01:13.619> but<00:01:14.460> just<00:01:14.670> for<00:01:14.880> right<00:01:15.000> now

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
I'm pretty soon but just for right now
