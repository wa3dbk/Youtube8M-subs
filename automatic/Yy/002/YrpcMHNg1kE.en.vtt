00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:18.990
 Hello everyone, so I have a printer 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:21.720
 samsung ml 2160 I asked him it works 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.830
 now everything is fine but ask after 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:29.699
 firmware requires chip sticking 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.300
 tape's four pins these need 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.570
 glue up 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.059
 either you can remove this chip 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.640
 remove the disassembled cartridge but if you still 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.300
 never once refilled it 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.930
 for the sake of removing cards well for the sake of chip removal 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.910
 I see no reason to disassemble the cartridges 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.190
 what can we do to forget about this chip 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.510
 in general, in principle, once and for all after 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:01:00.239
 when we flash the printer we look 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:02.640
 Inside here are four little rings that are like 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:09.900
 once closed on those on these four 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:15.240
 contact chip and read the chip itself to 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:17.820
 we forgot about it we need to remove these 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.500
 four ringlet or rather turn them off 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:25.590
 not necessarily clean up so what do we 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.630
 for this we will need 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:33.060
 climb a little bit inside the printer and 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:38.340
 most just just remove this side here 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:42.150
 cover bolt well no more to take off 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:46.890
 side cover you need to spin one 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:49.100
 screw is just one screw we have it 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.100
 removed 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.070
 like this 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:04.340
 remove the cover so that it is neat and 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.340
 so that nothing is broken here 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.890
 demonstrate inserting a screwdriver here 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.000
 surely old man 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.800
 I do not even know how I will try with one hand 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.130
 here we see that this cover is moving away 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:54.320
 further strongly zealous unnecessary 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:03:07.940
 so that it does not break off need 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:07.940
 knock here doing here like this 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:43.030
 We do do the same thing Well 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:43.030
 slightly we have now opened 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:25.000
 I disassembled the lid with one hand nothing 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.600
 breaking so now look what we have 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.570
 here inside hams can themselves 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:35.950
 disassemble this shawl first then 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:38.010
 this neat and natural and see 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:46.030
 what's inside 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:48.880
 we need this pin here 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:52.390
 the wires just go to those four rings 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:58.180
 here are four wires red white 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:05:01.270
 blue black is all we need is 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:09.960
 just like this, pull and unplug 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:16.270
 them and it's all now those rings are off 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:19.870
 it's so pussy dangles it all now 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:23.550
 you can insert any chip and so on and 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:29.849
 do not stick them and forget about them 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:35.470
 the box is put back and that's it 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:40.080
 for now don't forget to flash 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.080
 printer before disconnecting these rings
