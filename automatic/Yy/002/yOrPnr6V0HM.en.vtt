much we like most of it little little
little<00:00:53.989> goomy<00:00:54.860> here<00:00:55.100> little<00:00:55.489> out<00:00:55.610> of<00:00:55.640> control

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
little goomy here little out of control

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.789 
little goomy here little out of control
and<00:00:58.119> and<00:00:59.119> so<00:00:59.360> basically<00:00:59.900> the<00:01:00.019> only<00:01:00.110> eq<00:01:00.650> that

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:00.799 
and and so basically the only eq that

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:03.549 
and and so basically the only eq that
we're<00:01:00.920> doing<00:01:01.390> also<00:01:02.390> just<00:01:02.510> it<00:01:02.659> was<00:01:02.780> tiny<00:01:03.290> little

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
we're doing also just it was tiny little

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.570 
we're doing also just it was tiny little
pokey<00:01:04.010> when<00:01:04.220> the<00:01:05.380> snare<00:01:06.380> with<00:01:06.560> snappy<00:01:06.860> so<00:01:07.369> it

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
pokey when the snare with snappy so it

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.640 
pokey when the snare with snappy so it
here's<00:01:08.450> the<00:01:08.630> eq<00:01:09.049> you<00:01:09.500> just<00:01:11.650> non-tech

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
here's the eq you just non-tech

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.480 
here's the eq you just non-tech
equalizer<00:01:13.690> one<00:01:14.690> of<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:14.900> first<00:01:15.770> eq2

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
equalizer one of the first eq2

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.130 
equalizer one of the first eq2
something's<00:01:16.820> ever<00:01:17.030> made<00:01:17.270> actually<00:01:17.540> and<00:01:17.870> still

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
something's ever made actually and still

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.210 
something's ever made actually and still
on<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:18.440> bed

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.280 

pulling<00:01:21.760> out<00:01:23.550> low<00:01:24.550> shelf<00:01:24.880> and<00:01:25.240> 15<00:01:25.870> Hertz

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
pulling out low shelf and 15 Hertz

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.170 
pulling out low shelf and 15 Hertz
that's<00:01:27.100> pretty<00:01:27.280> technical<00:01:29.370> that's<00:01:30.370> pulling

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
that's pretty technical that's pulling

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.520 
that's pretty technical that's pulling
that<00:01:31.390> out<00:01:31.450> and<00:01:31.750> because<00:01:31.960> you're<00:01:32.140> coming<00:01:32.290> out

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
that out and because you're coming out

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.850 
that out and because you're coming out
solo<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:34.180> just<00:01:34.390> do<00:01:34.540> a<00:01:34.570> general<00:01:34.990> curve<00:01:35.230> up<00:01:35.530> back

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
solo you just do a general curve up back

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.150 
solo you just do a general curve up back
in<00:01:36.720> okay<00:01:37.720> we're<00:01:37.900> only<00:01:37.990> taking<00:01:38.290> out<00:01:38.530> a<00:01:38.560> tiny<00:01:38.860> bit

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
in okay we're only taking out a tiny bit

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.490 
in okay we're only taking out a tiny bit
of<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.460> low<00:01:39.640> end<00:01:39.850> just<00:01:40.690> another<00:01:40.930> half<00:01:41.200> shell

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
of the low end just another half shell

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.910 
of the low end just another half shell
from<00:01:41.770> the<00:01:41.830> API<00:01:43.140> 5500<00:01:45.270> equalizer<00:01:46.270> here<00:01:46.920> just

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
from the API 5500 equalizer here just

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.280 
from the API 5500 equalizer here just
taking<00:01:48.160> another<00:01:48.520> half<00:01:49.180> DB<00:01:49.600> out<00:01:49.750> it<00:01:49.930> for<00:01:50.110> you

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
taking another half DB out it for you

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.870 
taking another half DB out it for you
now<00:01:50.470> what<00:01:50.650> we're<00:01:50.800> trying<00:01:50.950> to<00:01:51.040> do<00:01:51.220> decide<00:01:51.670> is

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
now what we're trying to do decide is

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.000 
now what we're trying to do decide is
whether<00:01:52.480> we<00:01:52.600> just<00:01:52.840> want<00:01:52.990> to<00:01:53.080> pull<00:01:53.290> tiny<00:01:53.650> bit<00:01:53.890> of

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
whether we just want to pull tiny bit of

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.270 
whether we just want to pull tiny bit of
the<00:01:54.460> 10k<00:01:54.910> out<00:01:55.119> right<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:56.080> that's<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.860> upper

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
the 10k out right and that's the upper

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.930 
the 10k out right and that's the upper
upper<00:01:57.700> end<00:01:57.910> just<00:01:58.150> where<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:59.550> high<00:02:00.550> hat<00:02:00.790> is

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
upper end just where the high hat is

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.230 
upper end just where the high hat is
getting<00:02:01.240> there<00:02:01.990> but<00:02:02.650> uh<00:02:02.710> sound<00:02:03.700> good<00:02:04.000> actually

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
getting there but uh sound good actually

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.240 
getting there but uh sound good actually
so<00:02:04.630> I<00:02:04.660> thought<00:02:04.930> it<00:02:05.020> said<00:02:05.200> it<00:02:05.320> okay<00:02:05.619> we're<00:02:06.130> gonna

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
so I thought it said it okay we're gonna

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.820 
so I thought it said it okay we're gonna
leave<00:02:06.340> it<00:02:06.610> out<00:02:06.900> this<00:02:07.900> the<00:02:08.110> one<00:02:08.320> before<00:02:08.500> was<00:02:08.709> a

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
leave it out this the one before was a

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.469 
leave it out this the one before was a
tiny<00:02:09.160> bit<00:02:09.340> brighter<00:02:09.550> so<00:02:09.790> we're<00:02:09.910> just<00:02:10.090> pulling

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
tiny bit brighter so we're just pulling

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.540 
tiny bit brighter so we're just pulling
it<00:02:10.690> in<00:02:10.840> so<00:02:11.110> things<00:02:11.440> have<00:02:11.680> more<00:02:11.980> about<00:02:12.160> even

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
it in so things have more about even

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.240 
it in so things have more about even
this<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:13.570> and<00:02:13.720> just<00:02:13.780> hitting<00:02:14.770> a<00:02:14.830> little<00:02:15.010> bit

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
this to it and just hitting a little bit

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.980 
this to it and just hitting a little bit
into<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:15.580> tube<00:02:15.760> compressor<00:02:16.360> just<00:02:16.570> a<00:02:16.660> tiny<00:02:16.870> bit

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
into the tube compressor just a tiny bit

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.120 
into the tube compressor just a tiny bit
The<00:02:17.709> Meters<00:02:18.250> aren't<00:02:18.610> even<00:02:18.790> twin<00:02:19.150> jingly<00:02:19.420> so<00:02:20.200> so

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
The Meters aren't even twin jingly so so

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.410 
The Meters aren't even twin jingly so so
what<00:02:21.310> is<00:02:21.340> it<00:02:21.430> doing<00:02:21.640> if<00:02:21.820> it's<00:02:21.940> not<00:02:22.090> as<00:02:22.270> it's

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
what is it doing if it's not as it's

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.910 
what is it doing if it's not as it's
just<00:02:22.570> coloring<00:02:22.870> it<00:02:23.080> a<00:02:23.140> little<00:02:23.260> bit<00:02:23.440> it's<00:02:23.650> well

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
just coloring it a little bit it's well

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.320 
just coloring it a little bit it's well
it<00:02:24.070> is<00:02:24.160> still<00:02:24.430> hitting<00:02:24.700> it<00:02:24.820> something<00:02:25.239> the

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
it is still hitting it something the

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.150 
it is still hitting it something the
