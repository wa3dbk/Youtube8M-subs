00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.170
 in one more video and this personal video is 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.780
 basically an upgrade a lot of people are 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.450
 wondering what happened to fish and 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.640
 because the roger has changed so many times in this 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.690
 back from the team but I'm doing this 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.640
 video that can explain to you what 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.360
 happened and basically the following 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.309
 folks 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.210
 the initial team would be me drinking in the zone and 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.950
 panda 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:52.200
 the panda he had not even boxed the year and 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.440
 with the new administration will be 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.930
 we are receiving equipment and 7 and 8 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.910
 Panda's box was bought because of 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.800
 with the new administration 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.540
 and I'll leave you personal twitter 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.700
 administration than in the video description 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.110
 I ask you to follow them, are you with 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.970
 this majority of the staff lamplight 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.540
 Arcangeli drug but now there's a car 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.930
 new 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.300
 luddy, better known as lucas and as 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.530
 I said twitter is with the registration eu 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.140
 I ask you to follow him because if you do not 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.390
 I would not be back. 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.100
 but returning to the personal matter the team 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.060
 would be formed by the four I spoke I 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.610
 Let's go for another ride. 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.520
 time and the next day but did not talk 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.620
 with us and he explained that in the beginning 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.830
 January and it would already be 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:41.100
 doing college and working then 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.470
 Like him and he works in the morning in 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.570
 study at night what does not fit with the 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.270
 our schedule then and could not 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.260
 keep up with us on the team and do 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.470
 a switch 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.200
 he left and entered the ric in his place in the 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.670
 time and what happened next 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.380
 Rick was on the team but he ended up leaving. 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.360
 less than a week if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.460
 and why he left a lot of people criticized 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.879
 He's such but I understand the reason for leaving. 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.160
 He left because he was with us. 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:15.060
 time problem because the panda 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.970
 He only came home around 9 am 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.459
 so it was very hard to train is 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.190
 trying to sort out the 96-night type and 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.690
 also pulled it 's kind of complicated 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.330
 because the best teams do not happen 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.950
 at this time and are really people 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.140
 Chinese when you hardly 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.750
 get another then sometimes it falls 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.390
 The bottom line on the map is really annoying. 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.190
 and the panda is moving he lives in 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.780
 port and is moving to the 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.140
 city you previously wanted to see 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.810
 the hand and see the hand is half an hour is a little 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.370
 farther then what would happen as 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.740
 was arriving at 9 to train with the 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.810
 and people started coming from 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.690
 next week 969 40 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.430
 so, unfortunately, we had to 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.610
 take the team plan 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.830
 is a guy that bro he always honored sk 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.860
 it has always been my partner thrush 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.690
 and support in difficult times is the 15k 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.430
 who had played poorly to participate and such 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.520
 that the staff paced a lot and supported me 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.380
 much and since 2 when I played gb 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.190
 with him with carlão to pay him always 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.330
 supported 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.910
 So it's really a guy that I 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.770
 others consider it and was sad was 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.160
 difficult to have made that change the team 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.050
 have done among those that drop more 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.780
 first team 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.000
 we had to make that change there and 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.870
 3 was in was tricky to find a 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.640
 bedroom and taking panda this is the 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.640
 possibility of putting a Dual 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.620
 team new that is rick né that had 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.060
 left but as we do not have any more 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.720
 time problems he returned to the 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.299
 team 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.540
 along with joãozinho who is an old guy 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:50.970
 He's young, he's 15 and 16 years old, but he 's fine. 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.120
 different runner and plays there let the 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.760
 2001 then it is a well - known face 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.290
 community and has pure good family 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.870
 but I think here is not staying 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.880
 he will settle down he will succeed 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.040
 show what it can show because 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.799
 He's really a great player and I 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.150
 Boto faith in him Boto faith if he asks as he said 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.280
 in the previous video cbsk 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.950
 It was not the first thing you did not 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.620
 I'll promise, I'll make expectations. 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.290
 I'm just going to do our work to train. 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.900
 because now the big one is in san and we 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.340
 four are vacation and can 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.610
 really play pretty detail 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.320

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.270
