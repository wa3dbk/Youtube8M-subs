construction<00:01:10.360> the<00:01:11.320> reason<00:01:11.860> is<00:01:12.130> a<00:01:12.820> simple<00:01:13.540> one

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
construction the reason is a simple one

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.289 
construction the reason is a simple one
that<00:01:14.200> we<00:01:14.350> use<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.860> scaffolding<00:01:15.790> which<00:01:16.119> is

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
that we use the scaffolding which is

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:17.969 
that we use the scaffolding which is
which<00:01:16.600> is<00:01:16.750> a<00:01:16.780> contemporary<00:01:17.170> symbol<00:01:17.830> of

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
something new is in process and by

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.620 
something new is in process and by
adding<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.409> canvas<00:01:27.189> to<00:01:27.520> the<00:01:27.640> scaffold<00:01:27.970> it's

adding the canvas to the scaffold it's

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.169 
adding the canvas to the scaffold it's
somewhat<00:01:29.320> obscures<00:01:29.860> the<00:01:30.009> original<00:01:30.729> building

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
somewhat obscures the original building

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.450
