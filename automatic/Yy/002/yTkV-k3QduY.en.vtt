00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.180
 Barendrecht has to go to her today 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.580
 lost two points go against trying 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.170
 excelsior mesh lock today is the three 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.639
 to collect points 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.230
 we will do them in the hundredth 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:22.740
 top class competition that barendrecht 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:27.090
 plays here is the ibl to my to the 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:31.109
 ball and it sends the bass mauritsweg 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.750
 is what marx gives one for but there 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.610
 just no chance ensued 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.750
 then the excelsior mesh lock takes the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.520
 attack over excelsior a slice is the 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.050
 ball high into bringing your lungs 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.629
 Kevin Finch 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.090
 he sets himself free who lashes out 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.860
 but the ball goes well beside the goal 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.210
 from mark van splunter 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.120
 who still defended the goal by 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.449
 the mark markers injury 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.980
 here is good wash mode that 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.329
 marble is sending you away 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.350
 above might hear that he better 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.350
 being able to shoot yourself 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.210
 first half a bad half in which 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.580
 two teams for looking where he is 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.409
 itself this creates the opportunity 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.570
 be Christian from a red light district 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.659
 but the wash mode is just too late 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.130
 to go round 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.040
 then the excelsior mesh lock is something 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.590
 takes over brings the above we good 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.390
 checked and a fantastic cup 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.680
 movement of niels 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.810
 but that shows his left leg 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.540
 protruding excludes that is to get on 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.369
 because he is not good at it 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.509
 shoot at a target for market van 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.340
 splitter 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.110
 you give bass moluccan wrong width 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.340
 ball making excelsior mesh lock whole 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.990
 dangerously out of 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.390
 it's corner again and their green key 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.899
 get the most out of it is reurink in second 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.820
 body were mark full sprinter is out 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.110
 on his chest 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.810
 maybe barendrecht in the beginning 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.119
 some more initiative but as the 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.710
 match progresses in the first half 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.180
 the excelsior mesh lock the anvil and 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.219
 what kind of splinter wood here is one 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.680
 barendrecht in the race with two 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.829
 fantastic rescues good reflexes 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.440
 there on the attack of excelsior 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.960
 Maas lock then it is just before the break 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.500
 the tree is introduced 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.360
 it is again mark force points and that 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.350
 ensures that were gone with zero zero 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.110
 rest then we start the second 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.620
 half and is julia van houselt the field 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.820
 come in and with recently they see you before 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.830
 found a pond 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.550
 but luckily he is the better 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.100
 hand so barendrecht again with his bee 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.420
 the backs can just play 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.730
 it's here but again i'm going to be city 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.670
 sent away it is a closure of that 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.430
 pedestals and select the disc that sees 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.140
 There was a penalty kick in the outside 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.910
 And the question is whether or not you are indeed the 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.040
 ball was played by the opponent 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.880
 but referee decide to us 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.220
 penalty kick and candela noah cohen this 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.410
 go out pack a year rusting ball 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.670
 a reprehensible against the ropes and it 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.670
 is huge barendrecht 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.590
 then it's always exciting what's going on 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.890
 happen the why was bagged 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.540
 or are they going to expire are they going to go through the 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.250
 ball is played in and comes 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.300
 end up with your marvin 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.880
 ridgid 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.740
 you go find the 16 the action puts one 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.900
 comes back to danny people who shoots 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.610
 with his weak right leg and that bell 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.040
 it goes against the post 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.380
 via the back of lions' and goalkeeper 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.470
 it does not go in but that was one 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.810
 good chance of 200 barendrecht cohen here 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.530
 who sees that the right corner has been released 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:44.700
 by centuries but there volte 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:48.420
 2 0 not someone looking for the girls 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.160
 in case ds ajax she is right way 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.980
 for him that goes well on speed 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.750
 beyond that is just none along the 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.040
 compan of a come along must therefore 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.080
 who do it themselves 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.030
 loekie is too small and can not 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.200
 be completed 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.130
 a few good chances for barendrecht 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.660
 in order to expand a 0 there, 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.430
 barendrecht goes further by your livestock 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.550
 these phases in barendrecht the 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.440
 most dangerous team such as esajas here 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.530
 keep going and get it with the left 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.670
 out of lions and may be a barely 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.670
 tap the corner 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.419
 barendrecht keep creating opportunities in this 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:27.590
 phase and is back again to you two 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.270
 sent 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.159
 well in the second half with 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.840
 space he got 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:35.300
 enter the 16 in here and ready 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.030
 Bob is missing and bob him and has to meet with 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.819
 round left in the polygon 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.639
 but that does not work slowly because she 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:45.590
 would give birth to a bit of night away and can 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.419
 excelsior mesh lock 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.409
 vincent of the road that leads to the bath 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.330
 guy 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:51.800
 the ball goes to the side 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.990
 brought in and the substitute leads then 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.509
 we that there camping 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.360
 leaning on your studies in god but vote 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:01.159
 mark van splunter fictionally halve 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.990
 fantastic from the bulb 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:05.629
 moments later therefore becomes a free kick 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.580
 free kick for excelsior mesh lock 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:09.979
 is being introduced and it went there 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:14.139
 completely happy and he simply cuts it 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:14.139
 against the ropes and so it is a one 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:20.060
 because Maas lock actually has nothing 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:21.409
 to the one they go to by mistake 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.689
 from stanley husen 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:25.729
 but I can't finish because 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:30.409
 you from home will return on time 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:33.080
 it is the vincent of the mountain there 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:34.849
 punishes the Berlin 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.400
 in defense but July 4 from 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:41.930
 houselt who knows how to save 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:44.000
 Moments later, Barendrecht now votes them there 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:47.449
 the esajas the ball is not quite right 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.639
 day come lock come true 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:51.800
 vote now comes for it his man it is 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:52.909
 he liked to close the ball well 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.620
 plays 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:57.259
 good evening or for Dordrecht comes 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:00.020
 finally back to Daniel Esajas 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:02.120
 He brings him back to Ajax 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.610
 and you get an a us against the ball 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.470
 and preferably there just before the end 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.169
 10 minutes before the end 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:12.080
 two influence barendrecht where we 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:13.610
 lock 7 more crowds and at that time the 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.020
 most dangerous team 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.750
 knows Barendrecht from the counter 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.789
 score and were getting away a lot 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.159
 space to a lock should look for the 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:24.080
 equalizing which is you get here 

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:27.020
 for example a lot of space and that 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.909
 excellent all that flock of lions around 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.110
 off in the corner and so close where a deck 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:31.909
 in the final minutes 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.270
 where the match jutting day became 

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:34.270
 three one
