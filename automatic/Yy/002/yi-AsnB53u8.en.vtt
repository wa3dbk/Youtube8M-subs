there<00:02:14.459> is<00:02:14.550> just<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.760> good<00:02:14.880> example<00:02:15.239> of<00:02:15.300> how<00:02:15.450> you

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
there is just a good example of how you

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.180 
there is just a good example of how you
get<00:02:15.690> some<00:02:15.840> frontal<00:02:16.200> last<00:02:16.380> defender<00:02:16.800> this<00:02:17.010> one

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
get some frontal last defender this one

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.320 
get some frontal last defender this one
I<00:02:17.370> think<00:02:17.400> is<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.760> last<00:02:17.970> one<00:02:18.120> is<00:02:18.300> a

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
I think is the last one is a

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.449 
I think is the last one is a
particularly<00:02:18.959> good<00:02:19.110> example<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.770> then<00:02:20.400> I

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
particularly good example and then I

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.040 
particularly good example and then I
think<00:02:20.700> there<00:02:20.849> is<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:20.970> free-kick<00:02:21.330> maybe<00:02:21.720> after

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
think there is a free-kick maybe after

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.720 
think there is a free-kick maybe after
