00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:10.219 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:16.570 

but<00:00:11.219> it's<00:00:11.370> finished<00:00:11.639> now

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.029 

I've<00:00:17.060> looked<00:00:17.270> very<00:00:17.480> carefully<00:00:18.110> into<00:00:18.289> a<00:00:18.770> few

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
I've looked very carefully into a few

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:25.179 
I've looked very carefully into a few
little<00:00:19.250> problems<00:00:19.610> I<00:00:20.029> had<00:00:21.820> one<00:00:23.289> was<00:00:24.289> quite

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
little problems I had one was quite

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.080 
little problems I had one was quite
remarkable<00:00:25.400> in<00:00:26.150> that<00:00:26.660> I<00:00:27.550> realized<00:00:28.550> that<00:00:28.849> it

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
remarkable in that I realized that it

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
remarkable in that I realized that it
was<00:00:29.270> only<00:00:30.099> running<00:00:31.629> in<00:00:32.629> a<00:00:33.820> single<00:00:34.820> acting<00:00:35.449> form

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
was only running in a single acting form

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.900 
was only running in a single acting form
the<00:00:36.350> top<00:00:36.650> two<00:00:38.410> oscillating<00:00:39.410> vents<00:00:40.220> here<00:00:40.610> in

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
the top two oscillating vents here in

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.500 
the top two oscillating vents here in
the<00:00:41.180> central<00:00:41.720> part<00:00:41.769> were<00:00:42.769> somehow<00:00:43.510> obstructed

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
the central part were somehow obstructed

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.509 
the central part were somehow obstructed
and<00:00:44.830> I<00:00:45.830> had<00:00:46.220> to<00:00:46.400> clear<00:00:46.670> out<00:00:46.850> in<00:00:47.239> the<00:00:47.930> top<00:00:48.519> the

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:49.519 
and I had to clear out in the top the

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:52.740 
and I had to clear out in the top the
plugs<00:00:50.049> read<00:00:51.049> riddle<00:00:51.379> the<00:00:51.409> holes<00:00:51.769> and

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
plugs read riddle the holes and

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.829 
plugs read riddle the holes and
reassemble<00:00:53.750> the<00:00:53.870> engine<00:00:54.549> and<00:00:55.549> now<00:00:56.089> it's

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:56.839 
reassemble the engine and now it's

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:01.810 
reassemble the engine and now it's
running<00:00:57.229> much<00:00:57.409> better<00:01:00.159> double-acting<00:01:01.220> that's

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
running much better double-acting that's

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.090 
running much better double-acting that's
to<00:01:02.119> say<00:01:02.330> the<00:01:02.629> air<00:01:02.780> or<00:01:03.140> steam<00:01:03.500> pressure<00:01:03.799> is

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
to say the air or steam pressure is

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.000 
to say the air or steam pressure is
working<00:01:04.549> on<00:01:04.699> both<00:01:05.030> sides<00:01:05.390> of<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:06.650> cylinder

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
working on both sides of the cylinder

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:14.230 
working on both sides of the cylinder
and<00:01:08.920> or<00:01:09.920> cylinders<00:01:10.670> and<00:01:12.580> itself<00:01:13.580> starting

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
and or cylinders and itself starting

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.280 
and or cylinders and itself starting
every<00:01:14.600> time

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
every time

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
every time
anyway<00:01:16.130> it's<00:01:16.280> running<00:01:16.640> very<00:01:16.670> nicely<00:01:17.270> and<00:01:18.310> I'm

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
anyway it's running very nicely and I'm

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.529 
anyway it's running very nicely and I'm
very<00:01:19.820> pleased<00:01:20.270> with<00:01:20.509> it<00:01:20.570> indeed<00:01:22.299> what<00:01:23.299> more

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
very pleased with it indeed what more

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.719 
very pleased with it indeed what more
can<00:01:23.719> i<00:01:23.869> confide<00:01:24.140> can<00:01:24.770> I<00:01:24.920> say<00:01:25.189> so<00:01:26.149> there<00:01:27.109> it<00:01:27.289> is

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
can i confide can I say so there it is

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.609 
can i confide can I say so there it is
done<00:01:28.729> and<00:01:29.140> I'm<00:01:30.140> now<00:01:30.380> working<00:01:30.409> on<00:01:31.219> producing

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
done and I'm now working on producing

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:39.459 
done and I'm now working on producing
working<00:01:33.619> drawings<00:01:33.920> a<00:01:34.420> manual<00:01:35.420> and<00:01:36.280> a<00:01:38.140> video<00:01:39.140> of

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
working drawings a manual and a video of

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:43.779 
working drawings a manual and a video of
the<00:01:40.189> entire<00:01:41.350> construction<00:01:42.350> so<00:01:43.070> that<00:01:43.100> anybody

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
the entire construction so that anybody

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:50.319 
the entire construction so that anybody
that<00:01:44.090> wishes<00:01:45.020> to<00:01:45.819> make<00:01:46.819> his<00:01:47.060> own<00:01:48.670> inline<00:01:49.670> twin

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
that wishes to make his own inline twin

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.550 
that wishes to make his own inline twin

self-starting reversible steam engine

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.700 
self-starting reversible steam engine
which<00:01:58.789> would<00:01:59.030> be<00:01:59.240> ideal<00:01:59.719> for<00:01:59.749> a<00:02:00.049> small<00:02:00.350> boat

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.289 

then<00:02:03.710> I<00:02:03.740> hope<00:02:04.069> I'm<00:02:04.310> going<00:02:04.549> to<00:02:04.670> be<00:02:04.789> able<00:02:04.909> to<00:02:05.060> do

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
then I hope I'm going to be able to do

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:06.550 
then I hope I'm going to be able to do
it<00:02:05.420> and

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
it and

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.309 
it and
there's<00:02:06.680> too<00:02:06.950> much<00:02:07.070> time<00:02:07.520> but<00:02:08.149> anyway<00:02:08.450> here<00:02:09.140> it

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
there's too much time but anyway here it

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.280 
there's too much time but anyway here it
is<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:10.069> engine<00:02:10.429> is<00:02:10.550> finished<00:02:10.940> and<00:02:11.180> I'm<00:02:12.110> very

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
is the engine is finished and I'm very

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.910 
is the engine is finished and I'm very
happy<00:02:13.540> thank<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:14.720> ladies<00:02:16.390> first
