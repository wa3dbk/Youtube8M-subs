00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.919
 lianne van autumn 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:30.040
 19 years to spend the hilversum at young 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:31.230
 orange and at 10 on a shed recently 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.280
 in Amsterdam where I 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.800
 movement sciences study at the 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:41.649
 leisure but whole video card also one 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.989
 youngest of three brothers who 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.489
 all hockey and my dad have 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.809
 all sorts of things at the club was before 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.660
 I already pretty easy 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.089
 of the same angle along flow means now 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.559
 for me pure pleasure actually does yes 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:55.149
 it 's getting more serious and it is 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.440
 all become a bit professional 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.410
 but it's still real to me 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.480
 for fun for fun 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.219
 a combination between studying or for 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.540
 it is actually yes i'm fine 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.130
 so far who gets the 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.360
 university 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.910
 then I arrange some things from it 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.440
 moving exams and the like 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.510
 so there I can have some slack 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.510
 to coordinate it well 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.870
 but i see myself a few years i think 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.700
 I still hope in the big league 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.520
 i hope i still find it 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.440
 orange shirt you can wear it with 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.900
 young people we still or or the real 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.600
 big man but that burned me 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.490
 of course, playing in myself 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.990
 and maybe actually got mine 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.990
 Olympic Games use 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.430
 I am your everything from autumn and I am up 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.430
