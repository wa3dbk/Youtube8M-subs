Harley we call it a soft tail suspension
I<00:02:31.360> don't<00:02:31.480> think<00:02:31.630> we<00:02:31.690> can<00:02:31.810> call<00:02:31.989> it<00:02:32.110> that

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
I don't think we can call it that

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.110 
I don't think we can call it that
because<00:02:32.500> it's<00:02:32.680> trademarked<00:02:33.040> by<00:02:33.459> Harley<00:02:33.820> we'll
