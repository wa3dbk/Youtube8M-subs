00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.870
 in the olympic cabin of the team 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.610
 France cross country skiing I will make you 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.610
 a small tour of the premises 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.930
 but here we are in the part of 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.879
 cottages we will say individual for the 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.020
 teams in the Olympic Village background 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.510
 and background and biathlon 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.450
 so it's super cottage cottage 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.310
 semi-detached wooden house with rooms 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.400
 rooms by two who are really 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.430
 spacious past is really great 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.040
 well thought out and that is to say 50 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.890
 meters of the slopes then waiting for you in 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:30.110
 the entrance a beautiful brothel of shoes 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:33.080
 normal then a corridor he access to 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.050
 rooms each each each duo 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.380
 of athletes to a room as a title and so 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.030
 it's quite nice a little corner 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:46.520
 privacy 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:49.490
 here is the fair good go I take you 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.729
 to dairy see the rooms the 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.940
 room size 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:59.479
 so here is my room my common room 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.899
 with jean-marc so he is still at 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.750
 ski 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.789
 he's testing a skis body so here's a 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.770
 great living space we were not expecting 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:12.260
 not that and that's pretty good 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.260
 a large room with langres ans it's 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.810
 super what great bathroom super 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.080
 shower 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.459
 no frankly it's it's top it's 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.959
 top there is so far there's no big 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:29.390
 thing to say this is the tracks 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.980
 are right there behind which allows 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.160
 really our athletes to beat out 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.680
 to be on the track directly the one 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.989
 advantages of this site is that the 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.840
 so the all the whole Olympic Village 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.709
 in any case for the for the ski yeah I 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.030
 not sure if all the sites can be 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.340
 housed there but we are really close to 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.830
 tracks where Nordic trails are on 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.050
 takes a shuttle from 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.930
 in scooter that brings us in 30 seconds 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.450
 is sure we are at the stage of ray at the stadium 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.620
 cross-country skiing so this is the advantage the 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.870
 diagnosis right next 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.560
 so we're really here 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.150
 what are we going to minimize the journeys 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.630
 everything is within reach so it's true that 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.520
 it's important 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.510
 I see in Vancouver that it was 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.530
 my first games and it's true that there 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.090
 had there was what there were twenty 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.150
 minutes of shuttle bus to go 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.860
 on the site so yeah it's travel 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.150
 are not negligible so stop the 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.580
 more fatigue while there it is true 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.650
 that it's a plus we really 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.830
 it's surprising to see must 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:35.410
 start again was done in any case that has 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:39.040
 the air looks pretty good so the 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:41.940
 to suffer there in front of us embedded all 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.140
 building there of the biathlon with the 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.900
 viewers who will therefore be stuck just 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.090
 behind it suffers it's one of the most 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.570
 big structures that is one of the most 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.690
 big is even downright impressive 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:59.010
 the vietnam building the plane is 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.010
 oversized in the pressure 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.110
 I find that they have they smashed the 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.299
 nature to come implant a springboard 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.840
 a ski slope cromitie I find that 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:21.449
 it's almost a bit of a pity is good the 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.889
 the stage the stadium itself but pretty 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.509
 finally the springboard is pretty the track 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.070
 she is I think that profile is good 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:29.009
 etc. 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.900
 now it must remain a 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:32.310
 little more nature also we do a sport 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.289
 of nature of cannes r I think she 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.889
 should be blocked nature here it is 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:36.889
 now it will take 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.320
 next world in sochi
