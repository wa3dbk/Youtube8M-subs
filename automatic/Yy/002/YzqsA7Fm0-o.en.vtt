00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
example of this one's on it stealth I

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.380 
example of this one's on it stealth I
can<00:01:18.930> teleport<00:01:19.380> behind<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.220> target<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:21.030> do<00:01:21.240> my

can teleport behind the target and do my

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.780 
can teleport behind the target and do my
damage<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.380> with<00:01:22.590> subterfuge<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.490> very

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
damage and with subterfuge it is very

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.410 
damage and with subterfuge it is very
nice<00:01:24.680> because<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:26.100> can<00:01:26.189> get<00:01:26.580> up<00:01:26.700> my<00:01:26.850> garret<00:01:27.240> on

one<00:01:35.520> hundred<00:01:35.790> percent<00:01:35.820> more<00:01:36.270> damage<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:36.869> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
one hundred percent more damage in the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.770 
one hundred percent more damage in the
initial<00:01:37.320> ranged<00:01:37.920> attack<00:01:38.310> damage<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.540> new<00:01:39.750> on

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
initial ranged attack damage is new on

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.350 
initial ranged attack damage is new on
the<00:01:40.110> double<00:01:40.470> we<00:01:40.860> used<00:01:41.310> on<00:01:41.520> targets<00:01:42.030> further

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
the double we used on targets further

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.020 
the double we used on targets further
than<00:01:42.659> ten<00:01:42.930> yards<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.560> energy<00:01:44.520> cost<00:01:44.790> has<00:01:45.000> been

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
than ten yards and energy cost has been

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.469 
than ten yards and energy cost has been
increased<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.990> forty<00:01:46.740> percent<00:01:47.210> opens<00:01:48.210> when

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
increased to forty percent opens when

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.230 
increased to forty percent opens when
see<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.799> can<00:01:50.130> see<00:01:50.340> now<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.880> damage

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
see so you can see now that the damage

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.440 
see so you can see now that the damage
is<00:01:51.479> far<00:01:51.780> superior<00:01:52.159> but<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.549> can<00:01:53.759> only<00:01:53.909> cast<00:01:54.210> it

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
is far superior but you can only cast it

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.370 
is far superior but you can only cast it
three<00:01:54.689> times

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
three times

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.149 
three times
roughly<00:01:55.710> when<00:01:55.979> copying<00:01:56.460> combat<00:01:57.710> so<00:01:58.710> here<00:01:59.070> we

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
roughly when copying combat so here we

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.730 
roughly when copying combat so here we
go<00:01:59.360> shirking<00:02:00.360> sales<00:02:00.600> now<00:02:02.990> yeah<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.380> can<00:02:04.560> see

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
go shirking sales now yeah you can see

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.399 
go shirking sales now yeah you can see
straight<00:02:05.009> away<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.610> damage<00:02:05.990> is<00:02:06.990> much

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
straight away that the damage is much

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.979 
straight away that the damage is much
more<00:02:07.789> substantial<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.599> actually

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
more substantial and it is actually

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:48.850 
more substantial and it is actually
worth<00:02:10.170> using<00:02:10.530> now

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.920 

you
