00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.320 
did so double hit on the top two strings
and<00:01:05.199> then<00:01:05.320> second<00:01:06.130> fret<00:01:06.340> third<00:01:06.640> string<00:01:06.670> and

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
playing a little slower we can do that

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.030 
playing a little slower we can do that
too

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
like that and again just other rifts you

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.080 
like that and again just other rifts you
can<00:02:03.210> do<00:02:06.200> and<00:02:07.200> then<00:02:07.500> go<00:02:07.680> third<00:02:08.040> fret<00:02:08.580> first

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090

something like that
I<00:02:23.880> have<00:02:24.090> tend<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.390> wiggle<00:02:24.660> this<00:02:24.750> around<00:02:25.050> a

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
I was kind of when I play these little

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:42.120 
I was kind of when I play these little
riffs<00:02:30.060> I<00:02:30.210> was<00:02:30.360> returned

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.450 

now<00:02:42.940> that<00:02:43.090> one's<00:02:43.210> pretty<00:02:43.450> popular<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:44.140> old

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
now that one's pretty popular the old

now that one's pretty popular the old

just<00:02:53.510> slide<00:02:53.990> up<00:02:54.170> from<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.650> to<00:02:55.040> Prez<00:02:55.250> before<00:02:55.610> it

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
just slide up from the to Prez before it

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.010 
just slide up from the to Prez before it
so<00:02:58.070> I<00:02:58.100> guess<00:02:58.280> technically<00:02:58.670> you'd<00:02:58.850> start<00:02:59.240> on

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
so I guess technically you'd start on

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.500 
so I guess technically you'd start on

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.890 
string and then this fret 2nd string and
that<00:04:20.400> could<00:04:20.549> just<00:04:20.580> be<00:04:20.730> used<00:04:20.940> as<00:04:21.150> a<00:04:21.180> basic

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
hit that note and then you can just bar

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.860 
hit that note and then you can just bar

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
then the first three

00:04:43.060 --> 00:05:11.790 
then the first three
