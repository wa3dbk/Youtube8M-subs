i'm<00:05:13.600> going<00:05:13.840> to<00:05:13.960> demonstrate<00:05:14.620> the<00:05:15.430> flip<00:05:15.790> to

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
i'm going to demonstrate the flip to

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.770 
i'm going to demonstrate the flip to
mute<00:05:16.240> feature<00:05:17.110> that<00:05:17.560> I<00:05:17.860> also<00:05:18.270> enabled<00:05:19.270> with

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
mute feature that I also enabled with

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.990 
mute feature that I also enabled with
the<00:05:19.960> gravity<00:05:20.260> box<00:05:22.710> so<00:05:23.710> now<00:05:23.950> it<00:05:24.130> cause<00:05:24.370> I<00:05:24.670> will

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
the gravity box so now it cause I will

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.800 
the gravity box so now it cause I will
flip<00:05:25.240> it<00:05:26.310> so<00:05:27.310> now<00:05:27.550> it's<00:05:27.760> muted<00:05:28.180> and<00:05:30.600> you<00:05:31.600> can

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
flip it so now it's muted and you can

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:38.910 
flip it so now it's muted and you can
see<00:05:32.020> here<00:05:32.350> that<00:05:32.530> is<00:05:33.190> still<00:05:33.490> calls<00:05:37.260> but<00:05:38.260> the
