00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.280
 Hello, how are you doing on this occasion? 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.290
 I bring you a design of a looking for me in 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.210
 I love the personal thing and it's very 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.400
 fashion also for the background I'm 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.680
 putting a cream color for the body 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.960
 of the owl I'm putting a green color 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.480
 leaf for the owl's belly 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.029
 saying it like that is a mint green and for 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.750
 highlight the eyes I'm putting a 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.750
 yellow 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.650
 for the eyes it is necessary to have a 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.500
 pointer that has a thick part and the 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.690
 another finite part but if you do not have this 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.970
 no problem just use a 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.030
 stick and you make a thicker tip and 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.829
 the other more finite 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.260
 after applying the background color 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.449
 two layers of that that should be a color 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.430
 clearer to the color you get for the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.170
 mute usually to make it look 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.350
 the rest else you are going to give a layer 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.930
 thus 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.780
 so that it has rounded the part 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.880
 above 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.680
 you can do it in the whole center of the 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.479
 nail as you see I did it to the side 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.820
 this time I wanted to give that impression 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.790
 that as the boss is watching from 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.090
 side but that depends on the taste of each 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.090
 who 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.100
 with the pointer or the thin part of 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.450
 the 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.610
 let's draw two pages on one side of 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.070
 the curve we are going to draw a cookie 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.190
 to one side and another to the side 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.100
 other side 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:51.390
 and we repeat the same step of the other 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.390
 end of the curve 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:02:00.690
 using the same color of green 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.690
 strong is the color of the owl 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.340
 now I'm giving a second layer to 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.070
 owl body unnecessary energy that 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.250
 the color you are using are color 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.770
 that covers pretty well because if you do not go 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.459
 to have to give it many layers later 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:27.430
 that dries let's apply the green 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.350
 mint or the color you have chosen for 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.120
 the section of the owl's belly 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.519
 as I say I 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.290
 and do the exact same thing the only thing 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.129
 that does not do it is so big you do it 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.129
 little bit below 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:51.489
 If necessary, repeat this step to 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.069
 that is well covered and we passed 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:58.180
 then to make the eyes have to 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:02.310
 make two big points right where 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.310
 is the union of the two colors 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.840
 and with the color of the owl's body we're going 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.200
 to make other dots in the center of 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.880
 the eyes good I'm not doing it in 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.190
 the center of the eyes as I told them 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.050
 I think they are looking sideways like that 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.840
 that I did it to the side the two 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:36.370
 points 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:39.209
 and I'm using the green leaf color that 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.209
 I used for the body 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.730
 As you can see, the little eyes are like seeing 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.160
 side but as I told you from a 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.010
 principle do it according to how 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.950
 you most like it later with the same 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.560
 green color 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.140
 the green of the owl's body I'm 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.769
 drawing a line to make the piquito 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.769
 of the donkey 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.950
 and just to fill the front of the 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.220
 game I'm just plotting about 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:15.220
 little dots in golden color but you can 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.530
 do in the green color also or in 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.829
 yellow color the combination that most 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.829
 like 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.950
 for the other dreams I'm putting 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:29.420
 points in one and in the other one because I'm going to 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.420
 pass a click brightness 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:38.450
 indispensable an instagram layer of 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:41.690
 sally hansen that gives shine protects from 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:45.980
 dry your nails really fast here they 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:48.020
 I have a sample in blue use these 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.390
 deficits and in formula that are a set of 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.160
 three mini glazes I liked a lot 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.370
 and I recommend them because it covers 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:58.190
 very much and here I show you a cup in 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.860
 where I was inspired to do these 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.540
 owl designs and shows them this 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:07.600
 so they can see other combinations 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.600
 other colors and also be inspired 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:19.789
 and thank you for being here as always 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:21.650
 for your comments for your 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:22.699
 subscriptions and we'll see you until the 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.819
 next video
