00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.750
 the 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.120
 hello dear car friends welcome to 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.830
 a new episode of secondary school 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.960
 For me, it's all about the topic today 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.380
 electric because I have a little there 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.380
 problem 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.920
 So walking around is something else 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.810
 believe that has a problem is go 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.919
 check 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.410
 The interest system consists of 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:33.770
 different components lina begins 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.770
 with the search 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.390
 it does not sound like that if the engine does not open 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.340
 all places go out and about 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.450
 I'll start with the paartaler cap 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.430
 there is a mistake somewhere in china 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.070
 pulling the spark plug wire and remembers 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.560
 thereby the ignition sequence the cap becomes from 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.600
 two are cross-kept Screw 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.930
 You can completely solve the current distributor 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:03.850
 is easy to remove finger take 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:05.920
 also from very nice there has the 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.390
 gnawed tooth of time or 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.000
 there are so many sparks over 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.340
 beaten that time will be the finger 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.260
 to exchange one looks very nice 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.700
 the contact is already burned there 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.600
 can not spill over 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.700
 exchange remake off to ebay motors 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.150
 lina scours through various providers 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.740
 and finds some parts for the zinssystem 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.420
 including a new distributor cap 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:33.820
 plus distributor fingers here you can see it 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.270
 so very good see new contact areas in 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.440
 the cap and the distributor finger off 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.960
 from old to new 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.330
 where friction is generated and radio spark 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.040
 they can fly again now 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.840
 the distributor finger has a notch like that 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.390
 that he is only in a certain position 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.550
 in the distributor also fits in the 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.920
 Distributor cap pay attention to installation notches 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.880
 you can screw it properly 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.880
 be attracted 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.950
 The ignition cable then again to the right 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.460
 Order on the distributor cap 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:09.660
 stick 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:11.010
 finished wonderful studies kitten like that 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.560
 I imagined that 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.220
 what we screwed with it the ebay 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.100
