00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.850 

with<00:00:05.360> the<00:00:05.480> hands<00:00:05.900> a<00:00:05.990> lot<00:00:06.170> of<00:00:06.320> times<00:00:06.530> is<00:00:06.800> just

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:06.860 
with the hands a lot of times is just

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.980 
with the hands a lot of times is just
seeing<00:00:07.610> that<00:00:07.730> sense<00:00:08.000> of<00:00:08.090> structure<00:00:08.360> I<00:00:08.540> can<00:00:08.630> see

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
seeing that sense of structure I can see

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.780 
seeing that sense of structure I can see
in<00:00:09.260> there<00:00:09.590> you<00:00:09.740> have<00:00:09.889> some<00:00:09.920> little<00:00:10.280> blue<00:00:10.490> inner

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:10.790 
in there you have some little blue inner

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:11.830 
in there you have some little blue inner
structure<00:00:11.389> yeah

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 
structure yeah

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.270 
structure yeah
and<00:00:11.930> then<00:00:12.230> you<00:00:12.350> have<00:00:12.500> an<00:00:12.650> outline<00:00:13.010> on<00:00:13.190> the

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280 
and then you have an outline on the

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.750 
and then you have an outline on the
outside<00:00:13.780> I<00:00:14.780> think<00:00:15.640> understanding<00:00:16.640> that

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
outside I think understanding that

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.490 
outside I think understanding that
they're<00:00:16.940> just<00:00:17.119> basically<00:00:17.660> kind<00:00:18.080> of<00:00:18.110> like<00:00:18.230> tube

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
they're just basically kind of like tube

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.080 
they're just basically kind of like tube
shapes<00:00:18.830> or<00:00:19.010> even<00:00:19.280> though<00:00:19.400> you<00:00:19.640> can<00:00:19.789> treat<00:00:19.970> them

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
shapes or even though you can treat them

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.110 
shapes or even though you can treat them
out<00:00:20.210> as<00:00:20.480> soon<00:00:20.720> as<00:00:20.750> cylinders<00:00:21.740> and<00:00:22.250> then<00:00:22.700> build

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:23.120 
out as soon as cylinders and then build

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.670 
out as soon as cylinders and then build
up<00:00:23.240> the<00:00:23.480> hands<00:00:23.720> to<00:00:23.900> make<00:00:24.050> a<00:00:24.080> look<00:00:24.200> at<00:00:24.380> the<00:00:24.470> hand

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
up the hands to make a look at the hand

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.530 
up the hands to make a look at the hand
afterwards<00:00:25.010> mm-hmm<00:00:25.760> let's<00:00:25.970> see<00:00:26.090> the<00:00:26.210> action

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:26.540 
afterwards mm-hmm let's see the action

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.450 
afterwards mm-hmm let's see the action
so<00:00:26.900> the<00:00:26.990> action<00:00:27.290> does<00:00:27.470> feel<00:00:27.710> believable<00:00:28.280> like

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
so the action does feel believable like

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.100 
so the action does feel believable like
this<00:00:28.640> is<00:00:28.820> the<00:00:28.940> stronger<00:00:29.210> drawer<00:00:29.480> any<00:00:29.630> other<00:00:29.900> -

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:30.110 
this is the stronger drawer any other -

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.930 
this is the stronger drawer any other -
yeah<00:00:30.380> I<00:00:30.410> think<00:00:30.770> so<00:00:30.920> and<00:00:31.190> I<00:00:31.220> think<00:00:31.250> it<00:00:31.520> has<00:00:31.730> it

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
yeah I think so and I think it has it

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.459 
yeah I think so and I think it has it
and<00:00:32.090> what's<00:00:32.480> nice<00:00:32.660> is<00:00:32.840> you<00:00:32.930> used<00:00:33.110> a<00:00:33.290> glass

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
and what's nice is you used a glass

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:34.720 
and what's nice is you used a glass
bottle<00:00:33.890> so<00:00:33.980> you<00:00:34.010> can<00:00:34.100> see<00:00:34.280> the<00:00:34.370> hand<00:00:34.550> through

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
bottle so you can see the hand through

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.520 
bottle so you can see the hand through
it<00:00:34.760> so<00:00:34.969> that<00:00:35.090> was<00:00:35.210> kind<00:00:35.450> of<00:00:35.480> a<00:00:35.570> smart<00:00:35.780> idea<00:00:35.930> okay

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
it so that was kind of a smart idea okay

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.530 
it so that was kind of a smart idea okay
obviously<00:00:39.460> you<00:00:39.550> did<00:00:39.700> your<00:00:39.850> cows<00:00:40.060> yeah<00:00:40.360> exactly

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
obviously you did your cows yeah exactly

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.560 
obviously you did your cows yeah exactly
yeah<00:00:41.230> I<00:00:41.260> did<00:00:41.500> the<00:00:41.620> cat<00:00:41.830> of<00:00:42.070> the<00:00:42.580> horse<00:00:43.180> family<00:00:43.270> I

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
yeah I did the cat of the horse family I

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.510 
yeah I did the cat of the horse family I
was<00:00:43.750> with<00:00:43.960> at<00:00:44.230> the<00:00:44.290> time<00:00:44.440> okay<00:00:45.100> that's<00:00:45.280> good

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
was with at the time okay that's good

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.100 
was with at the time okay that's good
yeah<00:00:45.940> cuz<00:00:46.120> they<00:00:46.210> know<00:00:46.330> like<00:00:46.570> is<00:00:46.810> like<00:00:46.990> you're

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
yeah cuz they know like is like you're

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.900

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
gonna get to the zoo yeah but I think

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.000 
gonna get to the zoo yeah but I think
the<00:00:49.060> domesticated<00:00:49.840> animals<00:00:50.290> are<00:00:50.500> the<00:00:50.680> easiest

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
the domesticated animals are the easiest

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.070 
the domesticated animals are the easiest
cuz<00:00:51.340> you<00:00:51.700> can<00:00:51.880> actually<00:00:52.060> kind<00:00:52.390> of<00:00:52.510> get<00:00:52.660> them<00:00:52.870> to

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.080 
cuz you can actually kind of get them to

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.560 
cuz you can actually kind of get them to
move<00:00:53.500> yeah<00:00:54.190> and<00:00:54.460> you're<00:00:54.580> also<00:00:54.880> used<00:00:55.090> to<00:00:55.270> seeing

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
move yeah and you're also used to seeing

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.680 
move yeah and you're also used to seeing
them<00:00:55.750> yeah<00:00:56.140> yeah<00:00:56.680> so<00:00:56.920> I<00:00:56.950> was<00:00:57.730> some<00:00:58.000> student<00:00:58.570> I

wondering if people are just get getting
things<00:01:12.220> out<00:01:12.310> of<00:01:12.369> books<00:01:12.580> I<00:01:12.760> don't<00:01:13.000> know<00:01:13.090> if

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
things out of books I don't know if

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.730 
things out of books I don't know if

there's anything you have to see like

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.160 
there's anything you have to see like
kind<00:01:15.130> of<00:01:15.190> about<00:01:15.430> structure<00:01:15.910> sharing<00:01:16.330> I<00:01:16.510> added

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
kind of about structure sharing I added

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.690 
kind of about structure sharing I added
cheating<00:01:17.590> there<00:01:17.770> but<00:01:17.950> I'm<00:01:18.070> not<00:01:18.100> sure<00:01:18.400> if<00:01:18.460> I

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
cheating there but I'm not sure if I

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.609 
cheating there but I'm not sure if I
think<00:01:18.760> the<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.479> less<00:01:19.660> of<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:19.900> shady<00:01:20.140> like<00:01:20.380> I

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
think the the less of the shady like I

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.140 
think the the less of the shady like I
can<00:01:20.860> see<00:01:21.010> that<00:01:21.130> you're<00:01:21.280> developing<00:01:21.729> the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
can see that you're developing the

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.150 
can see that you're developing the
scapula<00:01:22.840> there<00:01:23.050> but<00:01:23.619> I'm<00:01:23.710> not<00:01:23.740> seeing<00:01:24.040> the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
scapula there but I'm not seeing the

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.680 
scapula there but I'm not seeing the
other<00:01:24.369> part<00:01:24.820> so<00:01:24.970> you're<00:01:25.090> not<00:01:25.210> doing<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:25.450> flat

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
other part so you're not doing the flat

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.870 
other part so you're not doing the flat
of<00:01:25.869> the<00:01:25.930> back<00:01:26.140> and<00:01:26.470> then<00:01:26.680> you're<00:01:27.160> losing<00:01:27.400> weird

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
of the back and then you're losing weird

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.850 
of the back and then you're losing weird
that<00:01:28.090> other<00:01:28.300> back<00:01:28.600> like<00:01:28.840> is<00:01:29.080> like<00:01:29.350> you<00:01:29.500> can<00:01:29.650> see

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
that other back like is like you can see

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.800 
that other back like is like you can see
the<00:01:29.979> back<00:01:30.160> like<00:01:30.369> there<00:01:30.520> but<00:01:30.670> not<00:01:30.820> on<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.270> back

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
the back like there but not on the back

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.780 
the back like there but not on the back
side<00:01:32.080> of<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.380> cat<00:01:32.590> yeah<00:01:32.950> so<00:01:33.250> I<00:01:33.280> can<00:01:33.369> see<00:01:33.640> that

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
side of the cat yeah so I can see that

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.820 
side of the cat yeah so I can see that
you're<00:01:33.910> understanding<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:34.990> geometry<00:01:35.650> of<00:01:35.710> the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
you're understanding the geometry of the

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.980 
you're understanding the geometry of the
cat<00:01:36.070> you<00:01:36.340> know<00:01:36.460> the<00:01:36.580> proportions<00:01:37.270> but<00:01:37.540> the

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
cat you know the proportions but the

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.560 
cat you know the proportions but the
actual<00:01:38.320> structure<00:01:38.920> how<00:01:39.340> had<00:01:39.550> it<00:01:39.580> some<00:01:40.300> things

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
actual structure how had it some things

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.390 
actual structure how had it some things
that<00:01:40.810> could<00:01:40.990> have<00:01:41.110> been<00:01:41.290> fixed<00:01:41.890> but<00:01:42.070> that's<00:01:42.310> a

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
that could have been fixed but that's a

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.370 
that could have been fixed but that's a
movie<00:01:42.610> yeah<00:01:43.390> okay

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
movie yeah okay

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.200 
movie yeah okay
so<00:01:44.530> it's<00:01:44.650> a<00:01:44.710> tough<00:01:44.860> one<00:01:45.010> but<00:01:45.550> I<00:01:45.760> like<00:01:45.909> the<00:01:46.090> fact

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
so it's a tough one but I like the fact

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.580 
so it's a tough one but I like the fact
that<00:01:46.330> you<00:01:46.450> have<00:01:46.570> an<00:01:46.690> inner<00:01:46.930> structure<00:01:47.290> in

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
that you have an inner structure in

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.160 
that you have an inner structure in
there<00:01:47.830> okay<00:01:48.310> and<00:01:48.550> it<00:01:48.760> it<00:01:49.090> all<00:01:49.360> this<00:01:49.690> look<00:01:49.900> feels

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
there okay and it it all this look feels

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.850 
there okay and it it all this look feels
really<00:01:50.409> strong

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
really strong

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.560 
really strong
this<00:01:51.040> looks<00:01:51.250> gets<00:01:51.520> a<00:01:51.610> little<00:01:51.820> wobbly<00:01:52.060> yeah

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
this looks gets a little wobbly yeah

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.180 
this looks gets a little wobbly yeah
that's<00:01:52.930> a<00:01:53.020> hard<00:01:53.170> one<00:01:53.350> to<00:01:53.409> do<00:01:53.620> yeah<00:01:53.800> I<00:01:53.830> think<00:01:53.950> it

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
that's a hard one to do yeah I think it

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.160 
that's a hard one to do yeah I think it
was<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.430> angle<00:01:54.790> or<00:01:54.909> something<00:01:55.300> back<00:01:55.450> I<00:01:55.930> can

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
was the angle or something back I can

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.560 
was the angle or something back I can
shoot<00:01:56.409> alright<00:01:57.310> cuz<00:01:57.520> you<00:01:57.700> don't<00:01:58.060> not<00:01:58.240> you're

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
shoot alright cuz you don't not you're

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.270 
shoot alright cuz you don't not you're
not<00:01:58.720> really<00:01:58.900> sure<00:01:58.990> what<00:01:59.350> that<00:01:59.380> joint<00:01:59.770> is<00:01:59.920> doing

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
not really sure what that joint is doing

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.580 
not really sure what that joint is doing
yeah<00:02:00.610> and<00:02:01.000> sometimes<00:02:01.300> a<00:02:01.659> bigger<00:02:01.900> fluffier<00:02:02.350> cat

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
yeah and sometimes a bigger fluffier cat

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.580

lazy was just a lazy cat and really mean

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.190 
lazy was just a lazy cat and really mean
as<00:02:14.320> soon<00:02:14.500> as<00:02:14.620> I<00:02:14.739> touch<00:02:14.950> him<00:02:15.130> he<00:02:15.160> he'd<00:02:15.640> bite<00:02:15.880> so<00:02:16.660> I

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
touching him and I had designed a

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.920 
touching him and I had designed a
raccoon<00:02:23.739> at<00:02:24.010> first<00:02:24.280> which<00:02:24.970> was<00:02:25.150> this<00:02:25.330> one<00:02:25.600> and

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
raccoon at first which was this one and

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.539 
raccoon at first which was this one and
it<00:02:26.110> was<00:02:26.230> pretty<00:02:26.500> likable<00:02:26.799> and<00:02:27.160> stuff<00:02:27.370> but

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
it was pretty likable and stuff but

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.670 
it was pretty likable and stuff but
people<00:02:27.630> that<00:02:28.630> I<00:02:28.720> had<00:02:28.930> a<00:02:28.959> friend<00:02:29.140> who<00:02:29.320> told<00:02:29.560> me

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
people that I had a friend who told me

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.440 
people that I had a friend who told me
oh<00:02:29.830> he<00:02:30.190> looks<00:02:30.370> exactly<00:02:30.670> like<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:31.120> one<00:02:31.269> friend

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
oh he looks exactly like the one friend

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.870 
oh he looks exactly like the one friend
over<00:02:32.320> the<00:02:32.440> hedge<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:32.680> then<00:02:33.130> I<00:02:33.220> looked<00:02:33.549> at<00:02:33.730> it

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
over the hedge and then I looked at it

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.060 
over the hedge and then I looked at it
and<00:02:34.360> it's<00:02:34.750> true<00:02:35.019> it<00:02:35.140> was<00:02:35.260> pretty<00:02:35.470> similar<00:02:35.709> and

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
and it's true it was pretty similar and

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.620 
and it's true it was pretty similar and
I<00:02:36.130> definitely<00:02:36.370> didn't<00:02:37.030> want<00:02:37.060> to<00:02:37.299> lose<00:02:37.450> any

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
I definitely didn't want to lose any

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.030 
I definitely didn't want to lose any
points<00:02:37.840> for<00:02:37.989> like<00:02:38.200> yeah<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:38.739> know<00:02:38.860> what

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
points for like yeah you know what

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.620 
points for like yeah you know what
honestly<00:02:39.280> I<00:02:39.549> think<00:02:39.700> you<00:02:40.060> probably<00:02:40.239> made<00:02:40.510> the

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
honestly I think you probably made the

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.180 
honestly I think you probably made the
best<00:02:40.840> choice<00:02:41.080> because<00:02:41.200> seeing<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:41.650> little<00:02:41.799> cute

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
best choice because seeing a little cute

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.360 
best choice because seeing a little cute
raccoon<00:02:42.580> with<00:02:42.820> a<00:02:42.850> gun<00:02:43.120> like<00:02:43.390> being<00:02:43.690> like<00:02:44.370> whole

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
raccoon with a gun like being like whole

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.200 
raccoon with a gun like being like whole
um<00:02:45.519> guy<00:02:45.670> very<00:02:46.209> nice<00:02:46.540> designed<00:02:46.990> the<00:02:47.110> face

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
um guy very nice designed the face

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.330 
um guy very nice designed the face
and<00:02:48.450> then<00:02:48.630> you<00:02:48.750> shadowed<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.410> in<00:02:49.620> we're<00:02:50.100> still

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
and then you shadowed it in we're still

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.650 
and then you shadowed it in we're still
working<00:02:50.640> with<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.850> structure<00:02:51.210> on<00:02:51.270> the<00:02:51.300> video

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
working with the structure on the video

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.870 
working with the structure on the video
so<00:02:52.050> like<00:02:52.800> I<00:02:52.950> guess<00:02:53.190> there's<00:02:53.520> a<00:02:53.610> sense<00:02:53.790> of

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
so like I guess there's a sense of

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.630 
so like I guess there's a sense of
appeal<00:02:54.210> in<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.360> face<00:02:54.570> but<00:02:54.840> he's<00:02:54.990> like<00:02:55.640> raccoon

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
appeal in the face but he's like raccoon

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.710 
appeal in the face but he's like raccoon
gone<00:02:56.850> real<00:02:57.090> bad

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
gone real bad

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.880 
gone real bad
yeah<00:02:58.020> storyline<00:02:58.920> yeah<00:02:59.850> so<00:03:00.210> cliche<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:01.470> isn't

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
yeah storyline yeah so cliche it isn't

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.130 
yeah storyline yeah so cliche it isn't
it<00:03:01.980> isn't<00:03:02.160> like<00:03:02.430> I<00:03:02.610> just<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:03.450> always<00:03:03.960> get

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
should really different people from not

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.010 
should really different people from not
doing<00:03:11.580> that<00:03:11.910> so<00:03:12.210> there's<00:03:12.540> all<00:03:12.660> this<00:03:12.750> gameplay

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
doing that so there's all this gameplay

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.530 
doing that so there's all this gameplay
stuff<00:03:13.500> yeah<00:03:13.860> we're<00:03:14.370> looking<00:03:14.520> at<00:03:14.760> portfolios<00:03:15.330> I

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
stuff yeah we're looking at portfolios I

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.600 
stuff yeah we're looking at portfolios I
think<00:03:15.810> you<00:03:16.050> know<00:03:16.170> don't<00:03:16.500> have<00:03:16.650> you're<00:03:16.830> trying

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
think you know don't have you're trying

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.340 
think you know don't have you're trying
to<00:03:17.700> look<00:03:17.820> for<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.120> story<00:03:18.450> that's<00:03:18.870> that's

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
to look for a story that's that's

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.920 
to look for a story that's that's
original<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.070> not<00:03:20.430> really<00:03:21.090> like<00:03:21.300> gratuitous

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
original and not really like gratuitous

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.490 
original and not really like gratuitous
or<00:03:22.110> just<00:03:22.410> like<00:03:22.590> cheek<00:03:23.190> yeah<00:03:23.820> yeah<00:03:24.540> so<00:03:24.720> that

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
or just like cheek yeah yeah so that

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.710 
or just like cheek yeah yeah so that
that<00:03:25.800> I<00:03:25.830> put<00:03:26.250> that<00:03:26.280> in<00:03:26.670> my<00:03:26.700> extras<00:03:27.360> after

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
that I put that in my extras after

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.630 
that I put that in my extras after
because<00:03:27.930> I<00:03:28.020> thought<00:03:28.200> it's<00:03:28.380> done<00:03:28.650> yeah<00:03:28.950> nobody

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
because I thought it's done yeah nobody

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.040 
because I thought it's done yeah nobody
put<00:03:29.910> that<00:03:30.060> in<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.239> edges<00:03:30.660> because<00:03:30.750> that's

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
put that in the edges because that's

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.990 
put that in the edges because that's
that<00:03:31.410> makes<00:03:31.620> sense<00:03:31.860> to<00:03:31.980> plenty<00:03:32.160> extras<00:03:32.610> yeah

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
that makes sense to plenty extras yeah

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.970 
that makes sense to plenty extras yeah
and<00:03:33.239> it<00:03:33.660> shows<00:03:33.930> that<00:03:33.959> you<00:03:34.170> have<00:03:34.200> a<00:03:34.410> sense<00:03:34.739> of

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
and it shows that you have a sense of

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.830 
and it shows that you have a sense of
like<00:03:35.310> what<00:03:35.610> is<00:03:35.760> appropriate<00:03:36.000> before<00:03:36.600> the

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
like what is appropriate before the

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.840 
like what is appropriate before the
actual<00:03:37.200> characters<00:03:37.560> on<00:03:37.709> you<00:03:37.920> what<00:03:38.130> what<00:03:38.700> was

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
actual characters on you what what was

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.960 
actual characters on you what what was
sort<00:03:39.030> of<00:03:39.150> runner<00:03:39.390> up<00:03:39.600> mm-hmm<00:03:40.340> so<00:03:41.340> I<00:03:41.550> did<00:03:41.820> that

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
sort of runner up mm-hmm so I did that

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.910 
sort of runner up mm-hmm so I did that
and<00:03:42.120> then<00:03:42.270> you<00:03:42.690> have<00:03:42.840> my<00:03:43.020> aura<00:03:43.260> junker<00:03:43.709> yeah

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
and then you have my aura junker yeah

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.090 
and then you have my aura junker yeah
yeah<00:03:44.760> so<00:03:45.030> that<00:03:45.360> was<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:46.200> design<00:03:46.620> here<00:03:46.980> I

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
yeah so that was the the design here I

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.940 
yeah so that was the the design here I
think<00:03:47.489> the<00:03:47.610> second<00:03:47.970> use<00:03:48.120> of<00:03:48.150> it<00:03:48.770> the<00:03:49.770> MU

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
think the second use of it the MU

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.009 
think the second use of it the MU
characters<00:03:50.459> a<00:03:50.489> bit<00:03:50.610> stick<00:03:51.030> yeah<00:03:51.239> it's<00:03:51.540> very

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
characters a bit stick yeah it's very

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.960 
characters a bit stick yeah it's very
complicated<00:03:52.560> what<00:03:52.980> you<00:03:53.070> decided<00:03:53.459> to<00:03:53.640> choose

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
complicated what you decided to choose

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.509 
complicated what you decided to choose
yeah<00:03:54.510> thank<00:03:54.780> you<00:03:54.810> for<00:03:55.620> talking<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.250> you<00:03:56.370> I'd

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
yeah thank you for talking to you I'd

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.820 
yeah thank you for talking to you I'd
say<00:03:56.549> just<00:03:57.030> make<00:03:57.209> it<00:03:57.360> a<00:03:57.420> human<00:03:57.750> character<00:03:58.230> put

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
say just make it a human character put

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.580 
say just make it a human character put
in<00:03:58.950> a<00:03:58.980> more<00:03:59.220> relaxed<00:03:59.670> pose<00:03:59.880> mm-hmm<00:04:00.690> um<00:04:00.810> and

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
in a more relaxed pose mm-hmm um and

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.560 
in a more relaxed pose mm-hmm um and
then<00:04:02.100> don't<00:04:02.489> be<00:04:02.700> afraid<00:04:02.940> to<00:04:03.030> show<00:04:03.209> that<00:04:03.360> inner

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
then don't be afraid to show that inner

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.210 
then don't be afraid to show that inner
structure<00:04:03.959> even<00:04:04.230> within<00:04:04.500> that<00:04:04.650> because<00:04:05.040> I

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
structure even within that because I

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.370 
structure even within that because I
would<00:04:05.400> assume<00:04:05.700> that<00:04:05.760> you<00:04:05.940> clean<00:04:06.299> that<00:04:06.510> up<00:04:06.570> yeah

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
would assume that you clean that up yeah

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.970 
would assume that you clean that up yeah
yeah<00:04:08.160> okay<00:04:08.640> yeah<00:04:09.209> so<00:04:09.510> so<00:04:09.810> not<00:04:10.350> necessarily

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
yeah okay yeah so so not necessarily

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.550 
yeah okay yeah so so not necessarily
have<00:04:11.130> a<00:04:11.160> cleaner<00:04:11.489> um<00:04:12.090> you<00:04:12.480> have<00:04:13.110> a<00:04:13.140> clean<00:04:13.440> up

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
have a cleaner um you have a clean up

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.289 
have a cleaner um you have a clean up
line<00:04:13.830> underneath<00:04:14.549> have<00:04:14.910> that<00:04:15.090> inner

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
line underneath have that inner

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.690 
line underneath have that inner
structure<00:04:15.870> okay<00:04:16.260> not<00:04:16.410> have<00:04:16.680> a<00:04:16.709> couple<00:04:17.519> sheets

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
structure okay not have a couple sheets

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.820 
structure okay not have a couple sheets
so<00:04:17.940> show<00:04:18.150> your<00:04:18.299> ups<00:04:18.510> and<00:04:18.630> also<00:04:19.350> your<00:04:19.470> clean<00:04:19.680> up

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
so show your ups and also your clean up

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.680 
so show your ups and also your clean up
okay<00:04:20.190> that's<00:04:20.400> good<00:04:20.580> to<00:04:20.609> know<00:04:20.850> yeah<00:04:21.090> and<00:04:21.330> also

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
okay that's good to know yeah and also

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.180 
okay that's good to know yeah and also
um<00:04:22.200> I<00:04:22.890> think<00:04:23.160> maybe<00:04:23.430> a<00:04:23.930> good<00:04:24.930> advice<00:04:25.620> would<00:04:26.130> be

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
um I think maybe a good advice would be

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.640 
um I think maybe a good advice would be
like<00:04:27.060> if<00:04:27.270> you<00:04:27.390> have<00:04:27.510> a<00:04:27.540> human<00:04:27.930> character<00:04:28.410> and

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
like if you have a human character and

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.200 
like if you have a human character and
not<00:04:28.710> necessarily<00:04:29.220> have<00:04:29.490> human<00:04:29.910> proportions

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
not necessarily have human proportions

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.510 
not necessarily have human proportions
unless<00:04:30.720> you're<00:04:30.930> sure<00:04:30.960> that<00:04:31.560> ya<00:04:31.860> bought<00:04:32.220> it<00:04:32.370> on

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
unless you're sure that ya bought it on

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.550 
unless you're sure that ya bought it on
its<00:04:33.000> strong<00:04:33.390> I<00:04:33.600> can<00:04:33.780> tell<00:04:33.960> that<00:04:33.990> you<00:04:34.169> can<00:04:34.350> draw

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
its strong I can tell that you can draw

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.510 
its strong I can tell that you can draw
you<00:04:35.250> have<00:04:35.400> a<00:04:35.430> sense<00:04:35.729> of<00:04:35.880> proportion<00:04:36.360> shadowing

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
you have a sense of proportion shadowing

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.400 
you have a sense of proportion shadowing
but<00:04:38.520> it's<00:04:38.850> that<00:04:39.150> that<00:04:39.570> inner<00:04:39.810> structure<00:04:40.290> they

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
but it's that that inner structure they

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.260 
but it's that that inner structure they
want<00:04:40.620> to<00:04:40.710> see<00:04:40.890> I<00:04:41.130> can<00:04:41.610> see<00:04:41.760> that<00:04:41.910> you<00:04:42.000> probably

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
want to see I can see that you probably

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.150 
want to see I can see that you probably
tackled<00:04:42.990> at<00:04:43.080> some<00:04:43.350> point<00:04:43.590> but<00:04:43.710> you<00:04:43.800> clean<00:04:44.010> it

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
tackled at some point but you clean it

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.440 
tackled at some point but you clean it
up<00:04:44.250> to<00:04:44.430> the<00:04:44.520> point<00:04:44.640> where<00:04:44.850> we<00:04:44.940> don't<00:04:44.970> see<00:04:45.120> that

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
up to the point where we don't see that

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.560 
up to the point where we don't see that
yeah

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.120 

all<00:04:49.570> right<00:04:49.750> fill<00:04:50.020> that<00:04:50.170> a<00:04:50.200> booster<00:04:50.590> actually

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
all right fill that a booster actually

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.110 
all right fill that a booster actually
yeah

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
yeah

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.960 
yeah
is<00:04:52.810> that<00:04:53.080> in<00:04:53.260> a<00:04:53.410> aerobic<00:04:54.370> classroom<00:04:54.730> as<00:04:54.880> to

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
is that in a aerobic classroom as to

exactly
yeah<00:05:16.150> yeah<00:05:16.540> so<00:05:17.110> a<00:05:17.380> nice<00:05:17.890> design<00:05:18.220> you<00:05:18.340> can<00:05:18.430> have

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
yeah yeah so a nice design you can have

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.730 
yeah yeah so a nice design you can have
a<00:05:18.580> sense<00:05:18.760> of<00:05:18.910> gravity<00:05:19.300> even<00:05:19.540> in<00:05:19.660> the<00:05:19.810> fabric<00:05:20.710> so

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
a sense of gravity even in the fabric so

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.010 
a sense of gravity even in the fabric so
oh<00:05:21.190> okay

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.380 

so<00:05:24.890> what<00:05:25.190> is<00:05:25.370> good<00:05:25.580> here<00:05:25.910> is<00:05:26.030> that<00:05:26.150> there<00:05:26.330> are

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
so what is good here is that there are

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.480 
so what is good here is that there are
actual<00:05:26.780> real<00:05:26.960> facial<00:05:27.470> expressions<00:05:27.980> a<00:05:28.100> law

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
actual real facial expressions a law

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.760 
actual real facial expressions a law
people<00:05:29.270> passed<00:05:29.480> in<00:05:29.660> this<00:05:29.750> assignment<00:05:30.020> and<00:05:30.410> we

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
people passed in this assignment and we

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.430 
people passed in this assignment and we
don't<00:05:31.040> get<00:05:31.340> the<00:05:32.090> face<00:05:32.360> and<00:05:32.660> real<00:05:32.900> facial

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
don't get the face and real facial

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.970 
don't get the face and real facial
expressions<00:05:33.920> or<00:05:34.010> the<00:05:34.070> mask<00:05:34.640> on<00:05:34.940> it<00:05:34.970> or<00:05:35.980> what

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:36.980 
expressions or the mask on it or what

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.290 
expressions or the mask on it or what
you're<00:05:37.100> doing<00:05:37.130> also<00:05:37.610> doing<00:05:37.790> is<00:05:37.880> turning<00:05:38.090> the

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
you're doing also doing is turning the

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.120 
you're doing also doing is turning the
head<00:05:38.420> so<00:05:38.660> it's<00:05:38.780> not<00:05:38.900> all<00:05:39.080> front<00:05:39.470> views<00:05:39.770> yeah

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
head so it's not all front views yeah

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.560 
head so it's not all front views yeah
exactly<00:05:40.310> I<00:05:40.610> think<00:05:40.730> they<00:05:40.940> were<00:05:41.060> kind<00:05:41.300> of<00:05:41.330> asking

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
exactly I think they were kind of asking

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.350 
exactly I think they were kind of asking
for<00:05:41.870> that<00:05:42.080> latch<00:05:42.640> Ange<00:05:43.640> the<00:05:43.820> angle<00:05:44.120> of<00:05:44.240> the

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
for that latch Ange the angle of the

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.180 
for that latch Ange the angle of the
head<00:05:44.510> so<00:05:44.690> I<00:05:44.750> think<00:05:45.010> that's<00:05:46.010> definitely

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
head so I think that's definitely

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.710 
head so I think that's definitely
something<00:05:46.580> and<00:05:47.030> one<00:05:47.180> thing<00:05:47.330> I'll<00:05:47.540> say<00:05:47.570> about

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
something and one thing I'll say about

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.470 
something and one thing I'll say about
sort<00:05:48.440> of<00:05:48.500> the<00:05:48.980> hero<00:05:49.340> looking<00:05:49.760> character<00:05:50.270> like

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:50.480 
sort of the hero looking character like

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.960 
sort of the hero looking character like
the<00:05:50.720> very<00:05:51.320> clean<00:05:51.920> with<00:05:52.010> hot<00:05:52.220> character<00:05:52.820> that's

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
the very clean with hot character that's

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.150 
the very clean with hot character that's
out<00:05:53.120> of<00:05:53.210> the<00:05:53.270> film<00:05:53.500> making<00:05:54.500> of<00:05:54.620> princes<00:05:55.010> and

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
out of the film making of princes and

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.280 
out of the film making of princes and
princesses<00:05:55.280> films<00:05:56.000> is<00:05:56.120> they're<00:05:56.870> hard<00:05:57.170> to

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.290 
princesses films is they're hard to

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.230 
princesses films is they're hard to
really<00:05:57.500> push<00:05:57.860> that<00:05:58.040> facial<00:05:58.490> expression<00:05:58.520> so<00:05:59.210> I

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
really push that facial expression so I

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.760 
really push that facial expression so I
think<00:05:59.390> you<00:05:59.630> did<00:05:59.780> a<00:05:59.810> good<00:06:00.020> job<00:06:00.080> they're<00:06:00.560> good

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
think you did a good job they're good

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.530 
think you did a good job they're good
but<00:06:01.100> those<00:06:01.250> are<00:06:01.400> tougher<00:06:01.730> characters<00:06:02.210> to<00:06:02.360> get

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.540 
but those are tougher characters to get

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.630 
but those are tougher characters to get
strong<00:06:02.900> facial<00:06:03.440> expressions<00:06:03.890> on<00:06:04.010> yeah<00:06:04.250> yeah

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:04.640

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.040 
you can see that I think in the top

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.180 
but composition always plays in mind
yeah<00:06:35.510> so<00:06:35.750> compositionally<00:06:36.590> wise<00:06:36.740> I<00:06:36.980> probably

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
yeah so compositionally wise I probably

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.830 
yeah so compositionally wise I probably
would<00:06:37.370> have<00:06:37.400> put<00:06:37.580> that<00:06:37.610> ball<00:06:37.940> behind<00:06:38.180> that

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 
would have put that ball behind that

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.230 
would have put that ball behind that
cube<00:06:39.140> and<00:06:39.380> then<00:06:39.530> the<00:06:40.130> you<00:06:40.850> almost<00:06:41.030> have<00:06:41.210> a

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 
cube and then the you almost have a

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.240 
cube and then the you almost have a
forced<00:06:41.540> perspective<00:06:41.720> yeah<00:06:42.350> on<00:06:42.650> that<00:06:42.710> cue

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.250 
forced perspective yeah on that cue

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.360 
forced perspective yeah on that cue
because<00:06:43.400> I<00:06:43.820> see<00:06:44.060> it<00:06:44.150> now<00:06:44.380> yeah<00:06:45.380> I<00:06:45.410> can<00:06:45.830> there's

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:04.190 
getting the perspective on the lower

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.400 
getting the perspective on the lower
half<00:07:04.460> the<00:07:04.730> top<00:07:04.970> half<00:07:05.180> not<00:07:05.420> as<00:07:05.570> much<00:07:05.780> but<00:07:06.140> yeah

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:06.410 
half the top half not as much but yeah

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.160 
half the top half not as much but yeah
and<00:07:06.710> in<00:07:07.070> something<00:07:07.490> in<00:07:07.610> here<00:07:07.790> where<00:07:08.030> you<00:07:08.930> have

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:13.640 
no pop I probably would've said just I

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.210 
no pop I probably would've said just I
have<00:07:13.790> here<00:07:14.060> is<00:07:14.240> more<00:07:14.510> of<00:07:14.810> the<00:07:15.170> actual<00:07:15.560> inside

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:16.220 
have here is more of the actual inside

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.520 
have here is more of the actual inside
structured<00:07:17.150> design<00:07:17.330> of<00:07:17.630> it<00:07:17.750> opposed<00:07:18.200> to<00:07:18.410> the

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:18.530 
structured design of it opposed to the

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.950 
structured design of it opposed to the
the<00:07:18.800> shading<00:07:19.220> yeah<00:07:19.580> me<00:07:19.850> personally<00:07:20.030> okay<00:07:20.840> i'm

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 
the shading yeah me personally okay i'm

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.360 
the shading yeah me personally okay i'm
and<00:07:21.140> i<00:07:21.200> can<00:07:21.380> assume<00:07:21.650> where<00:07:21.860> you're<00:07:22.010> trying<00:07:22.190> to

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:22.370 
and i can assume where you're trying to

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.630 
and i can assume where you're trying to
explain<00:07:23.360> the<00:07:23.740> bullion<00:07:24.740> there<00:07:25.250> and<00:07:25.490> that

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:25.640 
explain the bullion there and that

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.030 
explain the bullion there and that
actually<00:07:26.090> helps<00:07:26.510> describe<00:07:27.500> that<00:07:27.800> shape

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:28.040 
actually helps describe that shape

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.160 
actually helps describe that shape
without<00:07:28.190> shadowing<00:07:28.850> it<00:07:28.970> in<00:07:29.180> uh-huh<00:07:29.630> so<00:07:29.960> in

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:30.170 
without shadowing it in uh-huh so in

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:31.960 
without shadowing it in uh-huh so in
that<00:07:30.530> sense<00:07:30.770> that's<00:07:30.980> that's<00:07:31.340> really

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:31.970 
that sense that's that's really

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.280 
that sense that's that's really
interesting<00:07:32.480> I<00:07:32.780> haven't<00:07:33.050> seen<00:07:33.260> a
