00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
movie is about about five people who all

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:44.310

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
feel like they don't belong and and I

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.649 
feel like they don't belong and and I
think<00:01:47.350> that's<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:48.009> experience<00:01:48.429> of<00:01:48.789> so<00:01:49.539> many

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
think that's the experience of so many

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.959 
think that's the experience of so many
teenagers<00:01:50.109> in<00:01:50.439> school<00:01:50.740> back<00:01:51.100> into<00:01:51.429> time<00:01:51.670> how

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:51.969 
teenagers in school back into time how

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:54.059 
teenagers in school back into time how
much<00:01:52.179> did<00:01:52.420> you<00:01:52.509> relate<00:01:52.990> to<00:01:53.289> your<00:01:53.439> characters

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
much did you relate to your characters

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:57.660 
much did you relate to your characters
um<00:01:54.460> well<00:01:55.299> I<00:01:55.329> didn't<00:01:55.689> really<00:01:56.109> relate<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:57.640> much

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
um well I didn't really relate so much

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.849 
um well I didn't really relate so much
because<00:01:58.329> I<00:01:58.359> was<00:01:58.569> you<00:01:58.810> know<00:01:58.840> a<00:01:58.929> working<00:01:59.229> actress

00:01:59.849 --> 00:01:59.859 
because I was you know a working actress

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:03.359 
because I was you know a working actress
and<00:02:00.189> so<00:02:00.280> my<00:02:00.460> my<00:02:01.270> teen<00:02:02.079> experience<00:02:02.770> I<00:02:02.950> think<00:02:03.009> was

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
and so my my teen experience I think was

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.719 
and so my my teen experience I think was
was<00:02:03.729> a<00:02:03.969> little<00:02:04.420> atypical<00:02:04.889> but<00:02:05.889> but<00:02:06.520> still

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
was a little atypical but but still

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.090 
was a little atypical but but still
there<00:02:07.270> were<00:02:07.389> certain<00:02:07.780> things<00:02:08.110> in<00:02:08.710> the<00:02:08.830> movie

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
there were certain things in the movie

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.670 
there were certain things in the movie
that<00:02:09.190> I<00:02:09.250> think<00:02:09.490> I<00:02:09.580> related<00:02:10.210> to<00:02:10.330> you<00:02:10.720> know<00:02:10.960> even

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680
