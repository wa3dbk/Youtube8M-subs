00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
hi this is Luke this is my review of the

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.349 
hi this is Luke this is my review of the
flexi<00:00:03.929> shield<00:00:04.170> case<00:00:04.410> for<00:00:04.710> nexus<00:00:05.069> 4<00:00:05.339> this<00:00:06.240> is

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
flexi shield case for nexus 4 this is

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.210 
flexi shield case for nexus 4 this is
actually<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.779> black<00:00:07.020> version<00:00:07.319> although<00:00:07.859> as

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
actually the black version although as

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.860 
actually the black version although as
you'll<00:00:08.400> see<00:00:08.610> it's<00:00:09.120> not<00:00:09.210> not<00:00:09.360> too<00:00:09.510> much<00:00:09.660> black

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
you'll see it's not not too much black

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.620 
you'll see it's not not too much black
to<00:00:10.139> it<00:00:10.290> it's<00:00:10.440> pretty<00:00:10.590> much<00:00:10.800> just<00:00:10.860> clear<00:00:11.630> it's

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
to it it's pretty much just clear it's

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.390 
to it it's pretty much just clear it's
got<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.780> nice<00:00:12.929> frosted<00:00:13.440> back<00:00:13.650> which<00:00:13.889> quite<00:00:14.219> like

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
got a nice frosted back which quite like

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.480 
got a nice frosted back which quite like
and<00:00:15.389> I've<00:00:15.630> read<00:00:16.230> on<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.590> web<00:00:16.859> page<00:00:17.190> for<00:00:17.400> this

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
and I've read on the web page for this

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.429 
and I've read on the web page for this
product<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:18.090> they<00:00:18.660> say<00:00:18.869> it<00:00:18.990> has<00:00:19.050> the

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
product that they say it has the

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.070 
product that they say it has the
toughness<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:21.060> crystal<00:00:21.449> case<00:00:21.720> but<00:00:22.020> the

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
toughness of a crystal case but the

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.810 
toughness of a crystal case but the
durability<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.500> silicon<00:00:23.250> see<00:00:23.430> get<00:00:23.609> sort<00:00:23.789> of

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
durability of silicon see get sort of

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.630 
durability of silicon see get sort of
the<00:00:23.910> best<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.269> both<00:00:24.420> worlds<00:00:25.640> obviously

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
the best of both worlds obviously

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.759 
the best of both worlds obviously
springs<00:00:27.480> back<00:00:27.689> into<00:00:27.960> shape<00:00:28.140> which<00:00:28.439> gives<00:00:28.680> you

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
springs back into shape which gives you

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.859 
springs back into shape which gives you
the<00:00:28.949> durability<00:00:29.369> in<00:00:29.730> need<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.720> also

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
the durability in need and it also

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.260 
the durability in need and it also
protects<00:00:31.410> against<00:00:31.679> scratches<00:00:32.070> as<00:00:32.189> well<00:00:32.369> so

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
protects against scratches as well so

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.479 
protects against scratches as well so
I'll<00:00:33.390> just<00:00:33.739> clip<00:00:34.739> around<00:00:35.070> you'll<00:00:35.219> see<00:00:35.250> how

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
I'll just clip around you'll see how

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.630 
I'll just clip around you'll see how
easily<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.880> goes<00:00:36.120> on<00:00:36.329> there<00:00:37.309> clear<00:00:38.309> sides

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
easily it goes on there clear sides

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.330 
easily it goes on there clear sides
obviously<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.899> can<00:00:40.020> still<00:00:40.260> see<00:00:40.530> the

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
obviously so you can still see the

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.770 
obviously so you can still see the
aspects<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.879> your<00:00:42.000> Nexus<00:00:42.360> 4<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:44.450> the<00:00:45.450> slightly

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.500 
aspects of your Nexus 4 and the slightly
transparent<00:00:46.050> back<00:00:47.030> obviously<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.210> see<00:00:48.390> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
transparent back obviously to see the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.799 
transparent back obviously to see the
Nexus<00:00:48.899> logo<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.530> LG<00:00:49.920> logo<00:00:50.480> some<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.629> best

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
concept I think there are a couple of

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.330 
concept I think there are a couple of
other<00:04:38.960> products<00:04:39.290> in<00:04:39.410> the<00:04:39.470> market<00:04:39.800> similar<00:04:40.190> to

best<00:04:42.919> value<00:04:43.220> for<00:04:43.250> money<00:04:43.780> it<00:04:44.780> combines<00:04:45.139> a

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
best value for money it combines a
