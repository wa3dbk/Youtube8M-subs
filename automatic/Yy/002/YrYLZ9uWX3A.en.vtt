00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
that think well we've had this one

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.959 
that think well we've had this one
formula<00:00:32.579> for<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:33.690> long<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:34.860> know<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.340> that's

formula for so long you know and that's

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.130 
formula for so long you know and that's
the<00:00:36.059> way<00:00:36.149> we<00:00:36.270> should<00:00:36.300> stick<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.050> the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
the way we should stick to it and the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.080 
the way we should stick to it and the
thing<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.290> with<00:00:37.590> hell<00:00:38.460> by<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.640> way<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:38.879> video

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
thing is with hell by the way this video

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.010 
thing is with hell by the way this video
is<00:00:39.149> going<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.300> be<00:00:39.360> player<00:00:39.540> preference<00:00:39.930> but

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
is going to be player preference but

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.200 
is going to be player preference but
that<00:00:40.170> comes<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.500> little<00:00:40.590> bit<00:00:41.000> but<00:00:42.000> in

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
that comes in a little bit but in

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.970 
that comes in a little bit but in
general<00:00:42.450> terms<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:43.410> have<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.620> understand

wind-ups aren't all about the hand loop
I<00:00:45.570> mean<00:00:46.020> that's<00:00:46.710> why<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:46.920> know<00:00:47.160> if<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.370> get

know<00:01:27.750> they<00:01:27.900> can't<00:01:28.080> play<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.439> deck<00:01:28.590> like<00:01:28.740> he

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
know they can't play the deck like he

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.249 
know they can't play the deck like he
could<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.820> know<00:01:29.939> different<00:01:30.630> results

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
could you know different results

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.710 
could you know different results
different<00:01:31.950> people<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.820> know<00:01:32.970> that's<00:01:33.540> why<00:01:33.659> you

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
different people you know that's why you

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.230 
different people you know that's why you
have<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.229> like<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.640> can<00:01:35.729> be<00:01:35.850> as<00:01:35.939> good<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.119> a

player's you want like you can net that

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.679 
player's you want like you can net that
a<00:01:37.799> deck<00:01:38.100> for<00:01:38.280> me<00:01:38.400> straight<00:01:38.700> up<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.000> i'm<00:01:39.479> pretty

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
a deck for me straight up and i'm pretty

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:40.730 
a deck for me straight up and i'm pretty
sure<00:01:39.840> you'll<00:01:39.960> change<00:01:40.170> two<00:01:40.320> or<00:01:40.380> three<00:01:40.500> cards

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
sure you'll change two or three cards

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.080 
sure you'll change two or three cards
because<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.040> have<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.369> tune<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.790> up<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.000> your

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
because you have to tune it up to your

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.060 
because you have to tune it up to your
preference<00:01:42.299> like<00:01:42.750> there's<00:01:43.380> only<00:01:43.470> very

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
preference like there's only very

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
that can actually perfectly net deck me

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.789 
that can actually perfectly net deck me
and<00:01:47.520> like<00:01:48.450> did<00:01:49.049> one<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.439> them's<00:01:49.560> my<00:01:49.649> good

you know he doesn't change anything he's
pretty<00:01:58.229> much<00:01:58.409> playing<00:01:58.619> card<00:01:58.860> for<00:01:58.979> card<00:01:59.070> I'm

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
pretty much playing card for card I'm

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.340 
pretty much playing card for card I'm
pretty<00:02:00.000> impressed<00:02:00.119> but<00:02:00.390> besides<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.170> point

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
pretty impressed but besides the point

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.530 
pretty impressed but besides the point
so<00:02:01.890> glad<00:02:02.430> preference<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.119> little<00:02:03.390> thing

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
so glad preference is this little thing

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.179 
so glad preference is this little thing
that<00:02:03.570> says<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:04.110> can<00:02:04.350> do<00:02:04.439> whatever<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.770> want<00:02:04.860> as

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
that says I can do whatever I want as

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.830 
that says I can do whatever I want as
long<00:02:05.310> as<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.520> achieve<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.939> same<00:02:06.090> result<00:02:06.299> if<00:02:06.659> not

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
long as I achieve the same result if not

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.139 
long as I achieve the same result if not
greater<00:02:07.079> results<00:02:07.500> than<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.770> because<00:02:07.950> one<00:02:08.910> I'm

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
greater results than you because one I'm

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.850 
greater results than you because one I'm
innovating<00:02:09.720> into<00:02:10.379> I'm<00:02:10.709> breaking<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.220> mold

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
innovating into I'm breaking the mold

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.990 
innovating into I'm breaking the mold
you<00:02:12.130> know<00:02:12.250> there's<00:02:12.400> built<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:12.640> same<00:02:12.760> thing

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
you know there's built the same thing

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.540 
you know there's built the same thing
but<00:02:13.030> you<00:02:13.270> get<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.420> point<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:14.230> know

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
but you get the point you know

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.830 
but you get the point you know
innovation<00:02:15.550> is<00:02:15.670> that<00:02:15.880> one<00:02:16.150> key<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.540> yugioh

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
innovation is that one key to yugioh

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.380 
innovation is that one key to yugioh
like<00:02:17.290> it's<00:02:17.740> the<00:02:18.040> one<00:02:18.310> thing<00:02:18.550> that<00:02:18.610> I<00:02:18.970> can<00:02:19.090> do

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
like it's the one thing that I can do

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.900 
like it's the one thing that I can do
differently<00:02:19.810> than<00:02:20.740> you<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.280> it'll<00:02:21.790> get

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
differently than you and it'll get

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.090 
differently than you and it'll get
recognized<00:02:22.420> because<00:02:23.200> it's<00:02:23.620> different<00:02:24.010> you

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
recognized because it's different you

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.830 
recognized because it's different you
know<00:02:24.220> if<00:02:24.730> you<00:02:24.850> follow<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.240> same<00:02:25.420> formulas

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
know if you follow the same formulas

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.810 
know if you follow the same formulas
everybody<00:02:26.140> else<00:02:26.290> then<00:02:26.650> it's<00:02:26.980> her<00:02:27.370> deter<00:02:27.610> you

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
everybody else then it's her deter you

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.010 
everybody else then it's her deter you
know<00:02:27.970> there's<00:02:28.270> nothing<00:02:28.390> different<00:02:28.630> about<00:02:28.870> it

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
know there's nothing different about it

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.970 
know there's nothing different about it
but<00:02:29.560> if<00:02:29.650> you<00:02:29.710> play<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:31.290> rabid<00:02:32.290> deck<00:02:32.410> for<00:02:32.590> example

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
but if you play a rabid deck for example

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.110 
but if you play a rabid deck for example
and<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:34.540> know<00:02:35.250> before<00:02:36.250> drew<00:02:36.460> aa<00:02:36.670> bhi<00:02:36.730> was<00:02:36.940> cool

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120
