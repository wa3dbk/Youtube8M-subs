00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.290
 summer review 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.220
 not 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.240
 rihanna 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.410
 restaurant 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.009
 happy before getting on 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.279
 in the saddle before riding 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.750
 let's see the saddle 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.780
 what it is made of what they are 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:22.999
 parts 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:25.999
 the parts of the saddle 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.569
 first of all 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:35.800
 the thing that you immediately notice in the western help saddle man 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.620
 this part is called como 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.530
 it was 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.270
 used me 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.810
 in the past years when the la la western saddle was born 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.050
 eeee 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.050
 inter to fix the lace 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.550
 when used by cabbage ter press calves 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.610
 it's a work accessory now though 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.539
 not in the Philippines the most popular ones do not come 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:11.549
 actually used but remained 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.230
 has remained in the ou est cee hall just the thing that characterizes it 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.690
 the little 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.120
 after which we have the season 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.440
 barcelona 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.120
 these two protruding parts are called shoulders 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.440
 the lower part of the pommel is called the throat 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.770
 first of all 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.950
 the red court is a horse as he has not 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.310
 generally a very pronounced withers 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.740
 however it is very important when we go to choose a star 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.610
 vat find the right one for our horse 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.369
 that is, if he gave up our horse he is more pronounced 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.200
 we're going to look for a hatred in the narrowest 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.730
 yes our horse is rather big as we can 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.080
 imagine the typical typical horse quorter stallion and then with 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.170
 a very very flat withers 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.759
 it is important to find a saddle with a very large kiss 

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:19.929
 ok also because 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:21.339
 siii 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:25.109
 could risk going to look for the horse 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:27.879
 nooo on the withers 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.909
 on the sides of the carrese 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.930
 then a horse that has very flat Hungarian 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.469
 where and we lean a saddle with a very narrow action 

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:39.839
 Amber 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:43.269
 kya kare and still cause pain 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.189
 two sides 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:47.679
 of the withers 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:50.679
 it is important to find the right one 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.239
 throat horn 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.430
 this sergio 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.510
 the six days enduro and us 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.700
 and let's just sit and see what we do 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.819
 sergio 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.709
 scoop 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.729
 these are the skirts 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:09.869
 saddle women can be like in this case a single woman a 

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:11.659
 simple 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:14.499
 or 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:16.800
 they can also be a double woman 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.629
 then another another 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:19.979
 art in leather 

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:22.029
 and makes a double woman 

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:22.939
 woman 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:25.339
 this the offender stirrup 

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:29.679
 it can be smooth as in this case this is a work saddle 

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:32.629
 then curly or in a saddle from shoes 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.089
 de corato 

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:36.609
 worked e 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.149
 maybe with the addition of silver 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:41.349
 the star shop 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.789
 live to be comfortable to have a bench 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:46.799
 rather large 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.919
 so our foot has good grip 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:55.469
 here, too, in the summer they vary according to the russia of the second discipline 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:57.569
 disappointed that I do saddle 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.219
 in this case, as we said, it is a work saddle for which it must be 

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:03.829
 comfortable must be of good material 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:08.739
 and and no I do not care that there are particular processing or particular 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.430
 silver decoration 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.609
 so must 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:15.849
 be right for the right horse for the rider who has to work 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.849
 so I will go and choose a falcon auction with a rather large bench where I am 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:25.049
 I can comfortably support the entire sole of the foot 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.620
 this we have seen before, zingate girth 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:38.229
 I am looking for a variety of types of this neoprene girth 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:42.419
 because neopreme because as we said before the saddle is a work saddle 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:47.599
 so subpage or prenet is convenient because I can easily wash it 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:51.759
 every time I wait it goes down every time the horse gets. 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:54.759
 however, I can also find it in leather 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:00.239
 or with other neopreme formats in rubber sum there are different types 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:02.879
 iva demizzare 

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:04.199
 elisei la 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.349
 it is appropriate to take the measure of summer 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.349
 and every time yes 100 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.889
 I adjust my stirrups every time I do something around on horseback 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.580
 I place the covered belly bear blanket 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.659
 I always have to be very careful 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:24.349
 to control the horse then always hold the reins 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.259
 if you need demos 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:30.689
 hands I can hold them on my arm and use both hands 

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:34.339
 if I just need a hand 

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:39.399
 comet for example to pull under the belly I can use the other hand to 

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:42.439
 keep them reins 

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:43.210
 to do 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.449
 the size of the summer I can use 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:49.449
 rheumatologist 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.580
 quite effective ce 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:53.960
 not 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.689
 it will not be 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:59.409
 no sora is not always accurate but can be helpful 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.470
 It leans 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.639
 the fist 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:05.180
 at the beginning of the fender 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.370
 siii and extends to bring the bracket 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:11.360
 under your cell 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.240
 if this happens 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.440
 if this has arrived 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.600
 in the armpit 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.540
 could be a fair measure
