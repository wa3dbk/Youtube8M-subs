00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:03.869
 the group to give inverted or a 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.980
 grouped inverted only differs from the position of the group to d'avila 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.809
 reversing body position 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.190
 today the shins remain standing 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.409
 I sold surface necklaces 

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:22.560
 the difficulty in this position is to maintain the body balance ' 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.369
 the place 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:26.699
 to give 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.669
 in the carp position of the body is reflected nothing in the hips to form an angle 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.460
 90 degrees 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.100
 the column should remain for a long time 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.450
 with legs and feet extended 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.740
 for this it is necessary a good stretch of the posterior muscles of 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.390
 trunk legs 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.570
 otherwise the athlete will not be able to extend the knees 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.580
 nor stay with the straight column leaves the sea 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.580
 the tool 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.850
 vertical position 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.830
 upright 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.980
 it is very important to keep the body in full extension 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.940
 aligned from head to toe 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.600
 in this position the body consciousness 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.460
 or not 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.230
 and balance are essential for an efficient execution 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.340
 the palm he uses from the cradle 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.460
 the opening position 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.990
 is a position where the legs are kind of boring mind forward and backward 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.740
 things happen on the surface 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.049
 the lower part of the column is still 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.729
 with hips of heads in vertical alignment 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.610
 the joints of her hips and shoulders are not aligned 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.060
 opening up these politicians was good 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.550
 As a variation of this position we have an aerial opening where the body was 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.820
 autopsy and legs are above the surface 

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:20.089
 crane 

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:23.139
 which gives full very similar to the fish tail 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.419
 the difference is in the position of total shortage 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:34.090
 the list was parallel to the area independent of the height of the 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.119
 hip to the surface 

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:40.629
 in the year the group is 90 degrees with the body 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:41.789
 keeping 

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:44.789
 in full extension in the vertical position 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:51.679
 note that the hips are aligned differently to the wall for which athlete 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:53.089
 is looking 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:57.679
 the legs should also be oriented in the same way 

00:02:57.679 --> 00:03:00.679
 without external rotation 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.799
 fish tail 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.709
 equal to the crane position 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.069
 it is certain that by the foot of the leg extended to the front that must be in the 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.379
 independent surface of hips height 

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:22.279
 in the second example we have evaluation in this aerial position of fish tail 

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:27.449
 in this example operated by peace and well-being on the surface 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:29.069
 but the body is advanced
