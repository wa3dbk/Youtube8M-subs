00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
know angels are there not real talkative

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.620 
know angels are there not real talkative
they're<00:04:02.980> kind<00:04:03.190> of<00:04:03.280> to<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:03.549> point<00:04:03.850> and<00:04:04.150> it's

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
they're kind of to the point and it's

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.300 
they're kind of to the point and it's
more<00:04:04.930> when<00:04:05.260> you're<00:04:05.380> around<00:04:05.650> them<00:04:05.860> the<00:04:06.010> feeling

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
more when you're around them the feeling

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.069 
more when you're around them the feeling
you<00:04:06.519> get<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:06.940> emotions<00:04:07.360> you<00:04:07.450> get<00:04:07.600> and<00:04:07.780> I<00:04:07.840> felt

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
you get the emotions you get and I felt

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.650 
you get the emotions you get and I felt
nothing<00:04:08.290> but<00:04:08.500> pure<00:04:08.980> love<00:04:09.390> she<00:04:10.390> told<00:04:10.600> me

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
nothing but pure love she told me

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.090 
nothing but pure love she told me
everything<00:04:10.780> was<00:04:11.079> gonna<00:04:11.200> be<00:04:11.320> okay<00:04:11.709> and<00:04:11.859> I<00:04:11.950> was

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
everything was gonna be okay and I was

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.599 
everything was gonna be okay and I was
exactly<00:04:12.609> where<00:04:12.760> I<00:04:12.820> needed<00:04:13.120> to<00:04:13.269> be<00:04:14.609> and

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
exactly where I needed to be and

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.789 
exactly where I needed to be and
ironically<00:04:16.150> enough<00:04:16.329> that<00:04:16.900> was<00:04:17.079> when<00:04:17.320> I<00:04:17.530> found

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
ironically enough that was when I found

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:18.240 
ironically enough that was when I found
the<00:04:17.919> Lord

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
the Lord

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.729 
the Lord
in<00:04:18.310> my<00:04:18.820> life<00:04:19.030> and<00:04:19.299> that's<00:04:19.390> when<00:04:19.780> I<00:04:20.049> truly

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
in my life and that's when I truly

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.320 
in my life and that's when I truly
started<00:04:21.340> to<00:04:21.489> believe<00:04:21.849> that<00:04:22.120> there<00:04:22.300> was

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
started to believe that there was

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.610 
started to believe that there was
something<00:04:22.660> higher<00:04:23.020> than<00:04:23.050> myself<00:04:23.470> and<00:04:23.979> that

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
something higher than myself and that

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.760 
something higher than myself and that
I<00:04:25.070> was<00:04:25.400> not<00:04:25.550> a<00:04:25.580> bad<00:04:25.820> person<00:04:26.060> and<00:04:26.600> that<00:04:26.810> I<00:04:27.110> was<00:04:27.530> a

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
I was not a bad person and that I was a

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.520 
I was not a bad person and that I was a
good<00:04:28.220> person<00:04:28.430> and<00:04:28.910> that<00:04:29.150> no<00:04:29.570> matter<00:04:29.780> what<00:04:30.500> I

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
good person and that no matter what I

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.530 
good person and that no matter what I
had<00:04:30.740> done<00:04:30.889> up<00:04:31.100> into<00:04:31.310> that<00:04:31.430> point<00:04:31.760> I<00:04:32.180> was

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
had done up into that point I was

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.350 
had done up into that point I was
forgiven<00:04:32.840> and<00:04:33.110> loved<00:04:33.350> and<00:04:33.910> that's<00:04:34.910> that's

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
forgiven and loved and that's that's

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.689 
forgiven and loved and that's that's
