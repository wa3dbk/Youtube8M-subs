00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:53.100
 and when I was little you liked 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.560
 arrope much did my mother 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.780
 gruel 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:04.000
 and decided to look clear 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:08.369
 as they sold the rice before, it came 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.040
 a man who from outside with a bicycle 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:16.540
 I was going through the streets saying clothes and pumpkin 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:21.530
 of the women came out with a saucepan or 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:25.750
 with a jar and they bought the rice 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.750
 and your mother liked 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:36.590
 and I'm sure that now he would like 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:39.549
 Of course that's not always that they like the 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.549
 note forever 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.840
 apart from this you can tell us a 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.070
 scary story 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.380
 Well, I do not know how to tell us your stories 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.590
 fear is not of some movie that has 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.300
 viewed 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.800
 but 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:01.500
 there was also a man who went to 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.010
 Cemetery to pay a visit 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.210
 and he got hooked in a water he was hooked 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:11.790
 the jacket from behind and he thought that 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:14.960
 it was a dead man who had caught it and it was 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:19.080
 at night and he spent the whole night 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:21.590
 asking for forgiveness have died for the 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.240
 spirit so he would not do anything 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.450
 forgive me and let me go for 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.550
 please and when the next morning it 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.680
 did day is had not looked for 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.300
 back I look back and then saw that 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.300
 it had hooked on a pick 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.180
 on a nail that hooked the 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.180
 jacket 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:49.709
 I would not know the recipe or make the arrope myself 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.830
 no and to know the recipe for that is done 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.800
 with me 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:59.320
 and it's made with pumpkin 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.320
 but I do not know I have never done it
