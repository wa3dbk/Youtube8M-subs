00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.610
 If you follow it, as you are, I am out 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.070

 in a games of all against all 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.619
 I play another day and it seems to me 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.940
 funniest the most entertaining and for 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.980
 that I have chosen but it is only one 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.449
 excuse to talk about something else we are going to 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.890
 make a video of these reflection that 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.020
 I like it so much and also lately 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.520
 I'm really enjoying the videos of 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.350
 reflection of other youtubers especially 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.300
 the unequal you know is a friend and 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.670
 I like the videos he does but 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.019
 also from other people and well I do not know 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.149
 if sometimes I come up with ideas and I 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:47.800
 I want to talk a little bit about this plus the 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:49.690
 another day then I saw a video that is in the 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.579
 description is in English it's pretty 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.499
 difficult to follow even if you speak 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.909
 English but he says very interesting things 

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:57.339
 about the haters about the comments 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.350
 negative about insults etc. and 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.839
 how can we react and what and what 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.879
 say what they say about yourself 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.770
 reactions in front of that is pretty 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.840
 interesting but I do not want to talk 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.729
 strictly from that of the haters and you 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.860
 had ever talked about how the 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.050
 managed et cetera no but but I want 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.409
 talk a little about education or about 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.109
 What I 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.509
 I think about what it means to be educated or 

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:22.270
 address with education to other people and 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.670
 of what it means to hate very examples 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.990
 fast the other day I made a joke without 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.640
 bad intention with no intention of offending 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.039
 to nobody but as always he offended 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.289
 Colombians speak someone about the 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.390
 colombia style to refer to a theme 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:35.890
 of drug and such then they jumped a 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.450
 bunch of Colombians to tell me that 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.909
 Colombia is much more than that 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.179
 we are making these jokes but 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.950
 we take a topic and so on that is also 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:46.209
 one thing not to joke about 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.159
 because it's a very big disgrace in 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:50.890
 order and they had part of reason 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.289
 obviously, you make jokes for not 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.789
 offend but sometimes offend what happens 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:58.390
 which is what I liked a lot and I say 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:01.119
 sincerely is that 98% of people 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.310
 who told me about that he did it with total 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.390
 education I like your videos but I 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.849
 I think maybe you've 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.099
 wrong I see it so maybe you 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:11.440
 you do not see it like that etcetera and I liked it a lot 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.819
 because it made me realize that I can 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.379
 be wrong in part that at 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.930
 better I was wrong I did not choose the best 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:18.310
 joke or just when you do this 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.470
 kind of jokes you have to apechugar with 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.520
 the fact that there are people to whom 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.750
 is offended 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.780
 the price you have to pay to do 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.340
 jokes of these but I really liked it 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.860
 Well, the education with which they gave me 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.140
 your opinion and they are already in some things 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.350
 we do not agree it is already and it left me 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.900
 surprised however in the video of 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.850
 give me something this one where I talk football 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.180
 and such and Catalan and talk in 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.359
 Catalan reactions are much more 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.659
 intense and people who hate and hate 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:52.000
 catalonia and I hate all the Catalans and 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:54.400
 shut up now to shit Polish and the 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.480
 other Spanish fachas I do not know what because 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.060
 I hate and that hate that yes that 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.829
 worries is to say as well as a kid 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.930
 13 years old one day he sits in front of the 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:07.480
 computer call me bank of shit 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.250
 Fuck that for me is not important 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.079
 It is obviously not pleasant and hopefully not 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.969
 will happen but it seems to me that in the end they are 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.409
 kids that good that write that 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:16.269
 I would say obviously not the 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.980
 street but good that I will have 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.689
 had a bad day today or that they are 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.840
 accustomed in their environment to insulting 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:25.540
 I do not know, but I do not care 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.569
 sorry what I do worry about is that 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.540
 people who really feel hate for 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:35.200
 others I hate even for a whole 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:38.709
 community people who live angry and 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.239
 hating things that I should not hate not 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.030
 I know if I explain myself runs runs runs runs 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.000
 run 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.709
 that is to say that someone hates all 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.260
 Catalan means you're hating 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.910
 to 7 million people to the majority of 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.830
 which do not know you are 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.840
 different because I have to tell you and 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.670
 that is scientifically proven that 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.500
 the asshole is everywhere and 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.840
 They are also very well distributed with 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.610
 which all the autonomous communities and 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.220
 all the countries of the world have a 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.430
 similar percentage of asshole nobody 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.650
 is neither better nor worse in that so I do not know 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.070
 I do not understand how someone can live 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:16.260
 really hating not me audio at all 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.450
 those of madrid and I hate all those who 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.579
 they are from the barÃ§a I hate the people who 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:25.290
 like football I hate justin bieber 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:27.930
 I hate and I really do not know I do not know 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.810
 the best I'm weird but I do not no I do not have 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.940
 time to lose in my life hating to 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.610
 lots of people that I do not know and that 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.490
 you can also perfectly ignore hate 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:42.030
 I hate the videos of the consumer hey well no 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:45.180
 see me uncle be happy you know you hate willy 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:48.920
 rex hey so obviously do not see it no no 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.020
 I mean, avoid bad things 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.300
 agree that there are people who believe that 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.980
 there are things that are totally unfair and 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.810
 therefore you have to fight for your 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.940
 ideals and you have to denounce things 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.070
 that you get mad and you do not have to turn the 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.140
 face you do not have to turn your eyes to another 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.750
 side is worth it 's fine that 's fine but 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.510
 that does not lead you to see only the bad and 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.970
 to be all the time hating all the 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.220
 while watching the negative parts of the 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:16.250
 things I do not know I do not know is something that does not go 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:19.900
 with me that seems to me a wear and a 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:23.360
 an excess of being a waste of energy 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:25.460
 waste energy on being unhappy 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.170
 it's something I never understood not because 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.090
 please put me in the comments if 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:31.190
 some of you I do not know if I do not 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.810
 I understand well or your point of view or 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.790
 If you think the same eye to the cop 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.820
 colleague or if you think different I do not know what 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:39.560
 it's better that I do not understand it, but 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.350
 it's always something that has surprised me is 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.970
 say and I tell you that someone does not know 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.460
 Say what you said is very wrong and 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.930
 I fall fatally and I think you are such and such 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.760
 and I do not know how good it is, so it does not work 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.380
 I fall well then it is already goodbye no 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:56.270
 we need to see each other again but 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:59.030
 that irrational hatred tucked inside 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:02.370
 unconditional that is, I can not say 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:05.220
 I hate people who are not so - so 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:07.710
 I hate all Catalans I hate everyone 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.120
 I do not know what I hate all the people who talk 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:13.080
 I do not know what I hate all the people who do 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:15.030
 such thing I do not know I do not always seem to me 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.760
 it seems like I said invest in your 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:20.370
 unhappiness and it's something that has always 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:24.480
 surprised and I do see it in some 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.980
 videos and I'll tell you and it does not leave me stunned 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.260
 I hope that maybe with you 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.730
 comments you can take something out something in 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:33.270
 Of course I also do not take this opportunity to tell you 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:34.770
 that to me the criticisms the insults by 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.360
 the hard ones blow at me because 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.650
 end that I insult someone who does not 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.840
 nobody knows because it's like 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.370
 you will understand while one ear and 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.770
 I get it for the other one and if I can laugh at 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.830
 him during the road, I do it but 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:49.830
 the criticism if I listen to all of them 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.770
 they are even being manifested with 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:55.020
 little education not all because 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.880
 Normally if a criticism stings me, not if 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.260
 who chops or two eat it is a 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.090
 criticism bites me normally is because 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.560
 is partly right and that helps me 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:02.820
 to fix myself and to say host rock that 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.830
 better you have made a mistake in this 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:07.080
 I could have done better but I encourage you 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:09.900
 I encourage you to criticize you to be 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:13.680
 critical but always with education 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:15.510
 I assure that 95% of youtubers 

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.850
 when you make constructive criticism 

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:20.190
 they will listen to it and they will appreciate it and 

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:22.470
 the 5% that do not do it is not worth it 

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:24.540
 obviously not clear if you're going to look 

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:26.460
 these look at these who did not know if 

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.720
 you go to someone and they say you asshole are you 

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.730
 awful that's not a criticism 

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.290
 constructive but constructive criticism 

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.940
 thank you I encourage you that the 

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.560
 do with me with my channel and with all 

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.270
 the others but always with the respect 

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.130
 because everyone has an opinion 

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:39.600
 but also everyone deserves a 

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.850
 little bit of respect has been good 

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.830
 finished the gameplay I'm finishing and just 

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:46.470
 is to talk about that irrational hatred that 

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:49.410
 consumes happiness and forms 

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:50.790
 different from expressing one thing with 

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.500
 which you do not agree is above all 

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:54.510
 especially especially if something we like 

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.010
 guys tried to send it in your 

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:57.780
 life you are much happier and 

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.770
 you will take better advantage of your time like this 

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:01.140
 I hope you liked this one 

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:03.420
 video and see you later and by the way tomorrow 

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:05.940
 I have a very interesting video of 

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.290
 canijo with a very special guest not 

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.980
 you miss it because you're going to like hype 

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:11.700
 spam 

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.700
 goodbye
