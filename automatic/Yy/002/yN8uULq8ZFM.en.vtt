00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.199
 the preparation phases is a tart 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.390
 really simple but result is great 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.730
 the pastry and really crumbly 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.410
 very soft we go below to see 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.670
 the ingredients that mine will run 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.670
 to prepare it 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.239
 first of all 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.899
 I'm going to prepare vague shortcrust pastry ad 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.940
 use the mixer for convenience 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.789
 but it can also be done by hand 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.420
 going to put ingredients on the plan 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.700
 work as I show you now 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.850
 I put the flour 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:17.009
 add the sugar the zest 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:24.690
 grated lemon a pinch of 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:27.810
 cold salt and cold butter began 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.670
 to knead with the leaf until 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.659
 all the ingredients will not be there 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.080
 malgama you going to form a compound 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.259
 sandy 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.679
 as soon as I get a compound 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:43.200
 sandy 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:46.170
 I add an egg is a continuous yolk to 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.789
 knead until the pastry does not 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:53.159
 we will go to compact the pastry itself 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.959
 compacted I go to put it on the plan of 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.090
 work 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:59.090
 I put the pastry on the work surface 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:07.439
 I add a veil of flour and I go to 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:11.340
 work briefly just the time of 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:14.100
 go and make the dough once ha 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.790
 formed the dough I go to wrap it 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.220
 in the transparent film and I will do it 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.769
 rest in the fridge at least for 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.019
 thirty minutes I did rest 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:29.720
 the dough in the fridge at least for 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.720
 half an hour now I can spread it out 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:39.989
 giving it a circular shape and the stand 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:45.709
 with a rolling pin, roll it out of the 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.709
 thickness of about 5 mm 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:03:03.170
 now I'm going to roll it up I go to 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.990
 take a tart mold for this 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.790
 and with a diameter of 28 centimeters but if 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.620
 you want to get the thickness of 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.720
 highest tart 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:23.420
 go and use a mold of 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:27.340
 small size now I go to 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.340
 remove the excesses of pastry 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:46.850
 and with the handle of a teaspoon I go to 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:49.130
 press on the edges I'm going to flour the 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:55.400
 at the edge of the spoon so at least the 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:57.560
 dough will not attack the height of the 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.790
 tart should be about one 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:05.240
 centimeter an inch and a half 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:08.030
 now I'm going to drill holes up 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:11.810
 the whole base with the tines of one 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:16.540
 fork I can insert the jam 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:20.030
 I will go to put the apricot one 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:23.230
 I'm going to level the jam all over 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:27.260
 the base of the tart in a uniform way 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:31.870
 with leftover pastry I go to 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:35.720
 smoking a lattice over the tart 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.940
 if you prefer you can go to pave 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.990
 with a rolling pin and then to cut some 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.510
 Stripes 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.610
 or as I prefer to do I go to 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:49.340
 form small cords of 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:52.820
 I am going to get some dough 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:59.780
 pieces of dough and then I go to form 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:05:03.790
 some pretty thin strings I go to 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.790
 place them on the tart 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:25.290
 now I proceed by putting the second one 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.860
 reticulated going to put it for 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.860
 I explain 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:56.840
 I proceed by putting a cord too 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.840
 along the circumference 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.960
 the tart after 30 to 35 minutes of cooking 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.720
 ready 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:36.400
 as soon as you see that it begins to brown 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:40.720
 slightly to go away now 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:44.169
 I let it cool completely and behold 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:46.750
 an excellent tart ready both for the 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:48.699
 breakfast for a snack 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.020
 I hope this recipe is there too 

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:52.120
 was useful 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.750
 a hug to everyone and the next 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.750
