00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.880 

this<00:01:35.470> battery<00:01:36.870> that<00:01:37.870> isn't<00:01:38.080> excessive<00:01:38.620> amount

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
this battery that isn't excessive amount

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.590 
this battery that isn't excessive amount
packaging<00:01:39.400> to<00:01:39.550> be<00:01:39.640> honest

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.190 

let<00:01:43.600> me<00:01:43.690> just<00:01:43.840> prepare<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.350> battery<00:01:46.050> all<00:01:47.050> of

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
let me just prepare the battery all of

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.140 
let me just prepare the battery all of
the<00:01:47.320> package<00:01:47.680> I<00:01:48.100> don't<00:01:48.610> really<00:01:48.760> think<00:01:48.880> it

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
the package I don't really think it

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.120 
the package I don't really think it
needed<00:01:49.300> that<00:01:49.540> much<00:01:49.720> we're<00:01:50.530> gonna<00:01:50.710> find<00:01:50.920> in<00:01:51.040> the

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
needed that much we're gonna find in the

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.400 
needed that much we're gonna find in the
box<00:01:51.370> but<00:01:51.700> you<00:01:52.030> can't<00:01:52.480> complain<00:01:52.780> about<00:01:52.840> extra
