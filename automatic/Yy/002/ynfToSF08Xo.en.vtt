00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
I'm going to explain you why I have to

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.299 
I'm going to explain you why I have to
EMPs<00:00:56.850> here<00:00:57.120> I've<00:00:57.570> seen<00:00:57.870> him<00:00:58.379> with<00:00:58.800> this<00:00:58.949> class

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
EMPs here I've seen him with this class

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.920 
EMPs here I've seen him with this class
and<00:01:00.680> with<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.800> smoke<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.250> well<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.760> i<00:01:03.750> use

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
and with the smoke is well and i use

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.109 
and with the smoke is well and i use
scavenger<00:01:04.619> pack<00:01:04.949> on<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.369> one<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.760> think<00:01:06.030> I

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
scavenger pack on this one I think I

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.679 
scavenger pack on this one I think I
think<00:01:06.390> toughness<00:01:06.810> does<00:01:07.710> better<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.280> job

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
think toughness does better the job

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.719 
think toughness does better the job
because<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.720> know<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.049> won't<00:01:10.500> flinch<00:01:10.770> but<00:01:11.700> I

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
because you know you won't flinch but I

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.649 
because you know you won't flinch but I
like<00:01:11.970> scavenging<00:01:12.659> some<00:01:13.380> EMPs<00:01:13.920> or<00:01:14.220> or<00:01:14.820> smoke

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
like scavenging some EMPs or or smoke

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.060 
like scavenging some EMPs or or smoke
and<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.869> Mike's<00:01:16.049> i'm<00:01:16.409> going<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.710> explain<00:01:17.009> you

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
and I Mike's i'm going to explain you

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.649 
and I Mike's i'm going to explain you
why<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.970> have<00:01:18.540> EMPs<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:20.159> let's<00:01:21.150> get<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.420> on<00:01:21.509> to

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
why I have EMPs so let's get it on to

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.130 
why I have EMPs so let's get it on to
the<00:01:21.750> game<00:01:23.119> alright<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.299> let's<00:01:24.479> jump<00:01:24.750> into<00:01:24.930> the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
the game alright so let's jump into the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.440 
the game alright so let's jump into the
game<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.700> probably<00:01:26.970> one<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.270> my

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
game and this is probably one of my

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.640 
game and this is probably one of my
first<00:01:27.840> games<00:01:28.140> using<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.220> class<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.290> I<00:01:31.290> think

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
first games using this class and I think

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.140 
first games using this class and I think
this<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:31.890> team<00:01:32.130> deathmatch<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.820> don't<00:01:33.030> go

fist ISA is a big fan of EMPs because

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.270 
fist ISA is a big fan of EMPs because
you<00:03:09.240> know<00:03:09.360> it<00:03:09.540> does<00:03:09.990> its<00:03:10.260> tax<00:03:10.560> a<00:03:10.680> lot<00:03:10.830> of<00:03:10.920> points

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
you know it does its tax a lot of points

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.000 
you know it does its tax a lot of points
but<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.090> might<00:03:12.720> miss<00:03:12.990> it<00:03:13.200> on<00:03:13.380> one<00:03:13.560> of<00:03:13.680> his<00:03:13.770> videos

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
but I might miss it on one of his videos

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.730 
but I might miss it on one of his videos
maybe<00:03:14.400> why<00:03:14.760> he<00:03:14.790> he<00:03:15.510> likes<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:15.840> use<00:03:16.050> it<00:03:16.200> but

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
maybe why he he likes to use it but

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.310 
maybe why he he likes to use it but
using<00:03:17.520> this<00:03:17.640> class<00:03:18.000> I<00:03:18.390> discovered<00:03:19.050> something

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
know I never been a big fan of quick

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.030 
know I never been a big fan of quick
scoping<00:04:20.489> I<00:04:20.850> think<00:04:21.540> that<00:04:21.810> snipers<00:04:22.350> are<00:04:22.620> very

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
scoping I think that snipers are very

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.790 
scoping I think that snipers are very
overpowered<00:04:23.820> it's<00:04:24.060> a<00:04:24.479> one-shot<00:04:24.750> kill<00:04:25.320> on<00:04:25.740> a

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
overpowered it's a one-shot kill on a

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.050 
overpowered it's a one-shot kill on a
quick<00:04:26.250> scope<00:04:26.550> which<00:04:26.850> I

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
quick scope which I

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.670 
quick scope which I
think<00:04:27.180> it's<00:04:27.330> ridiculous<00:04:27.540> and<00:04:28.020> it<00:04:28.380> shouldn't

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
think it's ridiculous and it shouldn't

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.570 
think it's ridiculous and it shouldn't

snipers<00:04:35.580> I<00:04:35.669> always<00:04:35.970> said<00:04:36.210> that<00:04:36.240> I<00:04:36.419> always<00:04:36.750> said

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
snipers I always said that I always said

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.760

that<00:04:37.139> that<00:04:38.330> snipers<00:04:39.330> it<00:04:39.570> should<00:04:39.870> be<00:04:40.050> one<00:04:40.380> shot

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
that that snipers it should be one shot

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.090 
that that snipers it should be one shot
kill<00:04:41.130> if<00:04:41.520> you<00:04:41.580> only<00:04:42.270> hearts<00:04:42.900> go<00:04:43.169> and<00:04:43.500> that's

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
kill if you only hearts go and that's

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.710 
kill if you only hearts go and that's
the<00:04:44.370> way<00:04:44.520> it<00:04:44.639> meant<00:04:44.850> to<00:04:45.060> be<00:04:45.180> you<00:04:45.330> know<00:04:45.450> if<00:04:45.600> you

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
the way it meant to be you know if you

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.330 
the way it meant to be you know if you
want<00:04:45.900> to<00:04:45.990> go<00:04:46.080> unrealistic<00:04:46.470> with<00:04:46.800> the<00:04:46.889> game<00:04:47.100> I

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
want to go unrealistic with the game I

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.409 
want to go unrealistic with the game I
think<00:04:47.610> it<00:04:47.760> should<00:04:48.000> be<00:04:48.210> that<00:04:48.389> way<00:04:49.310> and<00:04:50.310> if<00:04:51.300> you

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
think it should be that way and if you

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.780 
think it should be that way and if you
want<00:04:51.600> to<00:04:51.660> do<00:04:51.750> your<00:04:51.900> 360<00:04:52.500> scope<00:04:52.950> whatever<00:04:53.520> you

want to do your 360 scope whatever you

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.610 
want to do your 360 scope whatever you
know<00:04:53.910> like<00:04:54.120> peg<00:04:54.480> it<00:04:54.720> should<00:04:54.930> be<00:04:55.080> at<00:04:55.200> least<00:04:55.230> two

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
know like peg it should be at least two

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.190 
know like peg it should be at least two
three<00:04:55.830> hit<00:04:56.010> markers<00:04:56.460> you<00:04:57.450> have<00:04:57.630> you<00:04:57.930> know<00:04:58.050> like

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
three hit markers you have you know like

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.010 
three hit markers you have you know like
the<00:04:58.380> scope<00:04:58.740> I<00:04:59.120> mean<00:05:00.120> snipe<00:05:00.479> the<00:05:00.720> way<00:05:00.870> it's

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
the scope I mean snipe the way it's

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.540 
the scope I mean snipe the way it's
meant<00:05:01.169> to<00:05:01.410> be<00:05:01.440> that<00:05:01.800> that's<00:05:02.070> how<00:05:02.280> it<00:05:02.430> is

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
meant to be that that's how it is

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.360
