open up cydia later and add them in its
again<00:03:53.310> it's<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:53.670> small<00:03:53.790> shortcut<00:03:54.450> but<00:03:54.600> again

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
again it's a small shortcut but again

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.080 
again it's a small shortcut but again
it's<00:03:55.019> an<00:03:55.139> improvement<00:03:55.500> you<00:03:56.250> can<00:03:56.280> add<00:03:56.639> in<00:03:56.849> your

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
it's an improvement you can add in your

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.690 
it's an improvement you can add in your
source<00:03:57.780> here<00:03:58.139> whatever<00:03:58.739> it<00:03:58.980> may<00:03:59.130> be<00:03:59.160> and<00:03:59.340> add

source here whatever it may be and add

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.339 
source here whatever it may be and add
it<00:03:59.849> so<00:04:00.090> it<00:04:00.150> will<00:04:00.359> be<00:04:00.480> available<00:04:01.760> straight<00:04:02.760> away

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
it so it will be available straight away
