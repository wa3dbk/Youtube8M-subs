00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.510 

and<00:00:03.090> right<00:00:03.300> now<00:00:03.540> I'm<00:00:03.750> building<00:00:04.110> my

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:04.520 
and right now I'm building my

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.200 
and right now I'm building my
observatory<00:00:05.520> so<00:00:05.790> this<00:00:06.089> is<00:00:06.240> rather<00:00:06.480> late<00:00:08.210> and

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
observatory so this is rather late and

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.589 
observatory so this is rather late and
yeah<00:00:09.660> I'm<00:00:09.809> going<00:00:10.050> now<00:00:10.349> I'm<00:00:11.300> trying<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:14.599> attack

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
yeah I'm going now I'm trying to attack

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.830 
yeah I'm going now I'm trying to attack
him<00:00:15.630> with<00:00:16.010> dark<00:00:17.010> Templars<00:00:17.609> maybe<00:00:17.880> he's<00:00:18.390> got<00:00:18.630> to

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
him with dark Templars maybe he's got to

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.679 
him with dark Templars maybe he's got to
know<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.020> lot<00:00:19.470> this<00:00:19.949> expansion<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.000> if<00:00:21.180> he

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
know a lot this expansion and if he

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.120 
know a lot this expansion and if he
hasn't<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.730> speed<00:00:23.730> upgrade<00:00:23.970> yet<00:00:24.619> then<00:00:25.619> this

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
hasn't the speed upgrade yet then this

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.550 
hasn't the speed upgrade yet then this
will<00:00:26.340> be<00:00:26.519> my<00:00:26.789> chance<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:27.359> kill<00:00:27.630> any<00:00:27.869> expansion

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
will be my chance to kill any expansion

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.299 
will be my chance to kill any expansion
then<00:00:28.980> I've<00:00:29.099> gotta<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.820> big<00:00:30.150> advantage<00:00:30.689> and

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
then I've gotta and big advantage and

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:34.910 
then I've gotta and big advantage and
I'm<00:00:32.309> going<00:00:32.700> from<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.880> third<00:00:33.180> expansion<00:00:33.920> usually

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
I'm going from a third expansion usually

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.639 
I'm going from a third expansion usually
you<00:00:35.130> don't<00:00:35.700> expand<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.570> early<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.350> first

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
you don't expand that early the first

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.459 
you don't expand that early the first
time<00:00:38.160> because<00:00:39.590> normally<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.800> circ<00:00:42.469> contains

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
time because normally the circ contains

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.389 
time because normally the circ contains
you<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.680> little<00:00:43.950> bit<00:00:44.129> with<00:00:44.280> lurkers<00:00:46.070> but<00:00:47.070> in

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
you a little bit with lurkers but in

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.430 
you a little bit with lurkers but in
this<00:00:47.670> on<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.090> map<00:00:48.390> it's<00:00:48.600> rather<00:00:48.960> easy<00:00:49.230> to

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
this on this map it's rather easy to

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.860 
this on this map it's rather easy to
expand<00:00:49.920> there<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:50.879> just<00:00:50.910> do<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.539> he<00:00:51.690> has

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
expand there so I just do it and he has

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.490 
expand there so I just do it and he has
no<00:00:52.140> overload<00:00:52.920> there<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.149> he<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.570> noticed

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
no overload there so and he is noticed

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.130 
no overload there so and he is noticed
that<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.980> runs<00:00:56.399> with<00:00:56.520> his<00:00:56.670> drones<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.989> I'm

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
that and runs with his drones and I'm

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.470 
that and runs with his drones and I'm
attacking<00:00:58.500> attacking<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:59.070> hatchery<00:00:59.460> if<00:01:00.210> he

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
attacking attacking the hatchery if he

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.420 
attacking attacking the hatchery if he
didn't<00:01:01.079> realize<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.680> had<00:01:01.770> tucked<00:01:02.039> m+

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
didn't realize that I had tucked m+

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.939 
didn't realize that I had tucked m+
there<00:01:02.640> he<00:01:03.059> wouldn't<00:01:03.449> if<00:01:03.660> he<00:01:04.019> wouldn't<00:01:04.589> realize

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
there he wouldn't if he wouldn't realize

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.280 
there he wouldn't if he wouldn't realize
it<00:01:05.129> even<00:01:05.280> even<00:01:05.700> if<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.299> killed<00:01:06.869> his<00:01:07.020> drones

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
it even even if I killed his drones

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.789 
it even even if I killed his drones
because<00:01:07.820> if<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:09.090> unit<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:09.720> stock<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.170> one<00:01:10.500> hits

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
because if a unit in stock of one hits

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.890 
because if a unit in stock of one hits
another<00:01:11.189> unit<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:11.909> dies<00:01:12.090> after<00:01:12.420> one<00:01:12.750> hit

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
another unit so it dies after one hit

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.550 
another unit so it dies after one hit
then

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
then

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.920 
then
your<00:01:15.130> enemy<00:01:15.670> won't<00:01:15.909> hear<00:01:16.149> any<00:01:16.420> attacking

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
your enemy won't hear any attacking

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.300 
your enemy won't hear any attacking
noise<00:01:17.229> so<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.820> sir<00:01:19.259> doesn't<00:01:20.259> say<00:01:20.439> you're

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
noise so the sir doesn't say you're

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.469 
noise so the sir doesn't say you're
under<00:01:21.610> attack<00:01:23.159> when<00:01:24.159> the<00:01:24.340> Dark<00:01:24.670> Templar<00:01:25.060> hit

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
under attack when the Dark Templar hit

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.969 
under attack when the Dark Templar hit
the<00:01:25.630> drones<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:28.450> at<00:01:28.600> first<00:01:28.810> you<00:01:29.049> always<00:01:29.770> want

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
the drones so at first you always want

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.310 
the drones so at first you always want
to<00:01:30.039> take<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.549> workers<00:01:31.360> will<00:01:31.780> they<00:01:31.929> are<00:01:32.049> also

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
to take the workers will they are also

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.499 
to take the workers will they are also
very<00:01:32.820> important<00:01:33.820> as<00:01:33.939> universe<00:01:36.270> yeah<00:01:37.270> and<00:01:37.390> I'm

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
very important as universe yeah and I'm

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.200 
very important as universe yeah and I'm
pretty<00:01:37.720> safe<00:01:38.439> here<00:01:38.590> I<00:01:38.950> hope<00:01:39.159> I<00:01:39.310> have<00:01:39.490> observers

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
pretty safe here I hope I have observers

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:47.370 
pretty safe here I hope I have observers
yet<00:01:40.720> I'm<00:01:41.409> not<00:01:41.619> so<00:01:41.979> sure<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:44.789> yeah<00:01:45.990> more<00:01:46.990> pylons

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
yet I'm not so sure and yeah more pylons

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.420 
yet I'm not so sure and yeah more pylons
of<00:01:47.500> course

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
of course

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.870 
of course
and<00:01:50.150> now<00:01:50.450> I'm<00:01:50.660> I'm<00:01:51.530> also<00:01:52.070> protecting<00:01:52.640> this

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
and now I'm I'm also protecting this

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:02.320 
and now I'm I'm also protecting this
space<00:01:53.450> from<00:01:53.810> mutant<00:01:54.680> escs<00:02:00.010> and<00:02:01.010> I<00:02:01.460> have<00:02:02.060> no

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
space from mutant escs and I have no

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.950 
space from mutant escs and I have no
idea

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
idea

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.100 
idea
right<00:02:03.140> why<00:02:03.530> I'm<00:02:03.590> doing<00:02:03.980> that<00:02:04.010> a<00:02:04.340> second

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
right why I'm doing that a second

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.950 
right why I'm doing that a second
observatory<00:02:06.110> so<00:02:06.920> you<00:02:06.980> see<00:02:07.430> I'm<00:02:08.360> not<00:02:08.420> in<00:02:08.660> the

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
observatory so you see I'm not in the

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.980 
observatory so you see I'm not in the
best<00:02:09.170> in<00:02:09.440> okay<00:02:10.340> I<00:02:10.369> don't<00:02:10.850> have<00:02:11.060> an<00:02:11.240> observer

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
best in okay I don't have an observer

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:19.240 
best in okay I don't have an observer
yet<00:02:12.590> it's<00:02:13.490> very<00:02:13.850> interesting<00:02:17.470> and<00:02:18.470> as<00:02:18.980> you<00:02:19.100> can

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
yet it's very interesting and as you can

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.980 
yet it's very interesting and as you can
see<00:02:19.430> my<00:02:20.030> enemy<00:02:20.420> is<00:02:21.670> expanding<00:02:22.670> a<00:02:22.790> fourth<00:02:23.570> time

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
see my enemy is expanding a fourth time

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.980 
see my enemy is expanding a fourth time
and<00:02:24.820> you<00:02:25.820> should<00:02:26.060> never<00:02:27.820> attack<00:02:28.820> the<00:02:28.990> new

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
and you should never attack the new

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.690 
and you should never attack the new
expansion<00:02:30.380> with<00:02:30.590> all<00:02:30.800> your<00:02:31.010> units<00:02:31.340> because

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
expansion with all your units because

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.810 
expansion with all your units because
then<00:02:31.880> your<00:02:32.690> enemy<00:02:33.110> could<00:02:33.290> counter<00:02:33.830> you<00:02:34.580> and

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
then your enemy could counter you and

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.790 
then your enemy could counter you and
just<00:02:35.150> rush<00:02:35.690> in<00:02:35.900> your<00:02:36.080> base<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.290> kill

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
just rush in your base and kill

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.230 
just rush in your base and kill
everything<00:02:37.130> so<00:02:38.090> just<00:02:38.120> use<00:02:38.690> just<00:02:39.610> a<00:02:40.610> few<00:02:40.640> units

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
everything so just use just a few units

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.040 
everything so just use just a few units
to<00:02:41.450> kill<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.810> expansion<00:02:42.700> and<00:02:43.870> now<00:02:44.870> he's

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
to kill the expansion and now he's

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.150 
to kill the expansion and now he's
running<00:02:45.290> with<00:02:45.500> rockets<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:46.040> protect<00:02:46.400> it<00:02:48.160> and

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
running with rockets to protect it and

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.490 
running with rockets to protect it and
that<00:02:49.340> didn't<00:02:49.610> manage<00:02:49.850> to<00:02:49.880> kill<00:02:50.030> them<00:02:50.440> and<00:02:51.440> then

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
that didn't manage to kill them and then

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.420 
that didn't manage to kill them and then
finally<00:02:52.370> I<00:02:52.400> get<00:02:52.730> I'll<00:02:52.940> get<00:02:53.209> some<00:02:53.420> observers<00:02:54.430> so

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
finally I get I'll get some observers so

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.400 
finally I get I'll get some observers so
in<00:02:55.580> as<00:02:55.880> you<00:02:56.060> can<00:02:56.209> see<00:02:56.360> in<00:02:56.540> Protoss<00:02:57.140> versus

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
in as you can see in Protoss versus

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.810 
in as you can see in Protoss versus
circle<00:02:57.800> are<00:02:57.920> many<00:02:58.820> things<00:02:59.180> to<00:02:59.450> think<00:02:59.720> of<00:03:00.820> yeah

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
circle are many things to think of yeah

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.650 
circle are many things to think of yeah
now<00:03:02.060> it's<00:03:02.300> safe<00:03:03.170> there<00:03:03.500> for<00:03:03.739> some<00:03:03.950> time<00:03:03.980> and

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
now it's safe there for some time and

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.470 
now it's safe there for some time and
it's<00:03:05.660> got<00:03:05.810> Scorchers<00:03:06.709> to<00:03:06.920> kill<00:03:07.100> my<00:03:07.250> observers

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
it's got Scorchers to kill my observers

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.420 
it's got Scorchers to kill my observers
you<00:03:08.480> should<00:03:08.690> always<00:03:08.959> pay<00:03:09.560> a<00:03:09.890> lot<00:03:10.160> of<00:03:10.190> attention

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
you should always pay a lot of attention

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.870 
you should always pay a lot of attention
on<00:03:11.330> your<00:03:11.540> service<00:03:12.200> because<00:03:12.560> with<00:03:13.489> high-risk

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
on your service because with high-risk

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.979 
on your service because with high-risk
and<00:03:14.209> with<00:03:15.050> scorcher<00:03:15.920> scores<00:03:16.700> it's<00:03:17.060> not<00:03:17.390> very

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
and with scorcher scores it's not very

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.290 
and with scorcher scores it's not very
hard<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:18.440> kill<00:03:18.680> them<00:03:18.910> so<00:03:19.910> mike<00:03:20.480> redemtech

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
hard to kill them so mike redemtech

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.390 
hard to kill them so mike redemtech
behind<00:03:22.660> your<00:03:22.840> army<00:03:23.230> so<00:03:23.440> if<00:03:23.590> dragons<00:03:23.890> can<00:03:24.190> kill

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
behind your army so if dragons can kill

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.480 
behind your army so if dragons can kill
it<00:03:24.550> or<00:03:24.760> or<00:03:25.530> high<00:03:26.530> temples<00:03:26.980> and<00:03:27.100> as<00:03:27.250> you<00:03:27.340> can<00:03:27.430> see

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 
it or or high temples and as you can see

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.670 
it or or high temples and as you can see
it's<00:03:28.120> a<00:03:28.270> big<00:03:28.510> mistake<00:03:28.750> it<00:03:29.200> should<00:03:29.230> have<00:03:29.470> done

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
it's a big mistake it should have done

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.220 
it's a big mistake it should have done
these<00:03:29.920> workers<00:03:30.340> in<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:30.970> space<00:03:32.190> and<00:03:33.930> well<00:03:34.930> this

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
these workers in the space and well this

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.860 
these workers in the space and well this
is<00:03:35.290> I<00:03:35.680> think<00:03:36.190> that<00:03:36.700> this<00:03:36.880> is<00:03:37.090> game<00:03:37.330> because

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
is I think that this is game because

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.400 
is I think that this is game because
that<00:03:38.740> was<00:03:38.890> a<00:03:38.920> rather<00:03:39.310> very<00:03:40.090> big<00:03:40.420> mistake<00:03:40.630> and

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
that was a rather very big mistake and

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.020 
that was a rather very big mistake and
I'm<00:03:42.370> killing<00:03:42.760> this<00:03:42.880> expansion<00:03:44.640> and<00:03:45.640> he's

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
I'm killing this expansion and he's

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.380 
I'm killing this expansion and he's
trying<00:03:46.330> to<00:03:46.480> defend<00:03:46.810> it<00:03:46.990> but<00:03:47.200> I<00:03:48.090> guess<00:03:49.090> now<00:03:49.360> it's

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
trying to defend it but I guess now it's

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.140 
trying to defend it but I guess now it's
over<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:52.590> he's<00:03:53.590> got<00:03:53.830> a<00:03:54.010> locker<00:03:54.460> there<00:03:54.670> and<00:03:54.940> I

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
over and he's got a locker there and I

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.070 
over and he's got a locker there and I
have<00:03:55.990> no<00:03:56.230> observers<00:03:56.800> there<00:03:57.240> so<00:03:58.240> I<00:03:58.510> got<00:03:58.720> to<00:03:58.900> kill

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
have no observers there so I got to kill

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.770 
have no observers there so I got to kill
the<00:03:59.370> locusts<00:04:00.370> with<00:04:00.610> hi<00:04:00.910> temperance<00:04:01.240> which

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
the locusts with hi temperance which

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.500 
the locusts with hi temperance which
storms<00:04:02.200> a<00:04:02.410> deck<00:04:03.340> underscores<00:04:03.910> but<00:04:04.180> they<00:04:04.300> won't

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
storms a deck underscores but they won't

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.610 
storms a deck underscores but they won't
find<00:04:04.600> any<00:04:05.080> observers<00:04:07.170> yeah<00:04:08.170> and<00:04:08.290> this

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
find any observers yeah and this

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.910 
find any observers yeah and this
expansion<00:04:09.490> seems<00:04:09.820> to<00:04:10.030> be<00:04:10.150> there<00:04:10.390> and<00:04:10.960> it<00:04:11.650> still

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
expansion seems to be there and it still

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.670 
expansion seems to be there and it still
got<00:04:12.160> his<00:04:12.340> locker<00:04:12.700> there<00:04:12.880> so<00:04:13.120> bets<00:04:13.960> terms<00:04:14.350> and

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
got his locker there so bets terms and

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:24.740 
got his locker there so bets terms and
my<00:04:15.070> path<00:04:17.730> but<00:04:18.730> the<00:04:18.910> expansion<00:04:19.150> goes<00:04:19.510> down

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:31.970 

and<00:04:25.620> I<00:04:25.860> might<00:04:26.070> have<00:04:26.310> won<00:04:26.640> the<00:04:26.820> game<00:04:30.920> yeah<00:04:31.920> you

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
and I might have won the game yeah you

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.920 
and I might have won the game yeah you
should<00:04:32.280> pay<00:04:32.670> more<00:04:33.000> attention<00:04:33.210> on<00:04:33.660> your<00:04:33.780> high

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
should pay more attention on your high

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.440 
should pay more attention on your high
templates<00:04:34.500> but<00:04:34.880> right<00:04:35.880> now<00:04:36.090> it's<00:04:36.270> already

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
templates but right now it's already

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.530 
templates but right now it's already
over<00:04:36.870> and<00:04:37.170> yeah<00:04:38.130> doing<00:04:38.790> another<00:04:39.150> expansion

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
over and yeah doing another expansion

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.770 
over and yeah doing another expansion
there<00:04:39.930> it's<00:04:40.830> the<00:04:40.980> best<00:04:41.220> point<00:04:42.120> of<00:04:42.240> time<00:04:42.510> when

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
there it's the best point of time when

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.270 
there it's the best point of time when
you<00:04:43.770> attack<00:04:44.130> then<00:04:44.370> you<00:04:44.550> should<00:04:44.730> expand<00:04:46.280> and

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
you attack then you should expand and

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.650 
you attack then you should expand and
you<00:04:47.580> should<00:04:47.730> never<00:04:47.880> expand<00:04:48.510> without

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
you should never expand without

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.780 
you should never expand without
defending<00:04:49.380> it<00:04:49.500> you<00:04:49.800> should<00:04:49.950> never<00:04:50.070> just<00:04:50.520> hope

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
defending it you should never just hope

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.060 
defending it you should never just hope
that<00:04:51.720> your<00:04:51.990> enemy<00:04:52.320> won't<00:04:52.500> find<00:04:52.770> that<00:04:52.950> you

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
that your enemy won't find that you

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.950 
that your enemy won't find that you
should<00:04:53.250> always<00:04:53.810> be<00:04:54.810> able<00:04:54.930> to<00:04:55.110> defend<00:04:55.530> it<00:04:56.960> and

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
should always be able to defend it and

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.470 
should always be able to defend it and
I'm<00:04:58.140> still<00:04:58.380> pumping<00:04:58.800> units<00:04:59.190> so<00:04:59.400> if<00:05:00.000> you<00:05:00.240> think

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
I'm still pumping units so if you think

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.960 
I'm still pumping units so if you think
that<00:05:00.720> you've<00:05:00.990> already<00:05:01.290> won<00:05:01.770> never<00:05:02.670> stop

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
that you've already won never stop

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.420 
that you've already won never stop
producing<00:05:03.360> units<00:05:04.260> because<00:05:04.560> maybe<00:05:04.770> your<00:05:05.070> enemy

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
producing units because maybe your enemy

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.850 
producing units because maybe your enemy
has<00:05:05.550> another<00:05:05.850> expansion<00:05:06.240> or<00:05:06.690> any<00:05:07.350> counter

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
has another expansion or any counter

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.490 
has another expansion or any counter
unit<00:05:08.190> may<00:05:08.400> be<00:05:08.430> an<00:05:08.640> invisible<00:05:09.180> unit<00:05:09.780> and<00:05:09.990> then

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
unit may be an invisible unit and then

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.310 
unit may be an invisible unit and then
you<00:05:10.650> have<00:05:10.770> no<00:05:11.010> units<00:05:11.460> many<00:05:12.180> minerals<00:05:12.480> and<00:05:12.930> your

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
you have no units many minerals and your

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.560 
you have no units many minerals and your
enemy<00:05:13.800> maybe<00:05:14.790> could<00:05:15.060> kill<00:05:15.420> you<00:05:15.650> so<00:05:17.330> you<00:05:18.330> should

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
enemy maybe could kill you so you should

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.570 
enemy maybe could kill you so you should
always<00:05:19.200> keep<00:05:19.620> producing<00:05:20.040> units<00:05:21.740> and<00:05:22.740> wow

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
always keep producing units and wow

of my subscribers will will buy
Starcraft<00:06:40.620> 2<00:06:40.800> because<00:06:41.160> they<00:06:41.370> are<00:06:41.490> real

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.090

Starcraft<00:06:42.660> fans<00:06:42.930> but<00:06:43.860> I<00:06:44.070> guess<00:06:44.280> some<00:06:44.490> people

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 
Starcraft fans but I guess some people

will<00:06:44.970> still<00:06:45.330> stick<00:06:45.780> to<00:06:45.810> Starcraft<00:06:46.740> 1<00:06:47.100> and<00:06:47.480> so

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:48.480 
will still stick to Starcraft 1 and so
