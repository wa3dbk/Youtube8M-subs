00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello friends I've arrived to save the world 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.500
 today we will talk about the sender mans 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.400
 I'll tell the curiosities first because 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.500
 energizer is shitting good let's start 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.570
 the sender man are creatures we are the 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.119
 which are peaceful until you see them 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.119
 directly to the face they apparently own 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.310
 a weakness in the face of water in 2011 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.680
 we add lenderman to the version of 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.019
 pc as a tribute to the creepy pasta of 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.510
 slender man this was known the moment of 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.730
 the tests this mode is not hostile if you 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.950
 you see the face with a pumpkin too 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.170
 has the ability to dodge all 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.300
 shooting with bows however if you 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.730
 hooked with a fishing rod is 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.710
 will produce a bug in which lenderman will 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.469
 will go crazy teleporting to 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.789
 five places in a second the thunder 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.860
 they maintain the ability to 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.469
 teleport and steal blocks e 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.149
 even placing them can also steal 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.370
 flowers and there is a percent of 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.559
 chances of you grabbing a block of 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.989
 cactus and sow it in a block of 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.969
 earth cobweb and even fire when 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.129
 they get angry they open their mouths and they tremble 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.980
 they even keep trembling if they are placed 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.320
 pause 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.560
 the enter keeps a lot of 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.650
 curiosities good and I get energizer 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.720
 of the bathroom and your theory fuck one no longer 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.510
 can shit in peace less badly I'm 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.270
 prepared this is my theory of the 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.430
 they were all normal aliens 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.470
 who lived on a planet on another side of 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.630
 the galaxy or in another dimension the 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.520
 which were infected by a 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.230
 bacteria that extended their arms and 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.870
 legs and hÃ©lÃ¨ne berr dragon and the 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.300
 mentally controlled then they 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.730
 they paid attention to what he ordered them 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.010
 command the earth to look for blocks to 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.900
 create a portal to other dimensions 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.420
 for the dragon to extend his kingdom of 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.610
 sick to other worlds the most sender 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.010
 They are not aggressive because they are three 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.480
 blocks of height then they do not see us 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.870
 ok but when we see it directly 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.000
 dragon leander orders you to attack this 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.370
 explain why the portal to 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.490
 in the background you see some stars as if 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.320
 outside a galaxy or another dimension the 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.660
 in the crystal that regenerate leander 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.179
 dragon maybe they are crystals with a 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.430
 evil spell because if you pay attention 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.530
 in the textures of the in the crystal 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.689
 evil symbols are seen like those of a 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.150
 pentagram which leads me to think that 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:21.099
 maybe the dragon leander is the mascot 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.099
 of a superior being as a boss in 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.750
 derman now I will tell you some things that 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.670
 they have happened to me with sender mans 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.620
 good is in a normal world and of 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.629
 I suddenly appeared numen derman color 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.760
 white with semi red eyes but I 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:36.549
 I was creative and he could not kill me 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.469
 was in version 1.5 point 2 and the 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.510
 second story is that once I was 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:42.400
 in a new survival and I went as of 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.530
 custom to mine immediately and 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.569
 when I went to leave the mine placing 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.489
 Column-shaped blocks and suddenly 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.139
 came an under man and I take all the 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.689
 block making me fall and I 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:54.129
 will lower a heart then select my 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:56.739
 sword and when I was going to kill him 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.780
 two two zhong creepers and two 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.760
 spiders and three skeletons which is weird 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.859
 since there were not many close when 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.409
 I was watching so they killed me in 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:07.389
 less than 10 seconds and I was captured 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:10.540
 since something like this had never happened to me 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:12.760
 this happened to me in version 1.7 point 2 and 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.099
 good with this I say goodbye do not forget 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.139
 subscribe if you want more videos like this 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.319
