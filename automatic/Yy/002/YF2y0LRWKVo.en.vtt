00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.780
 Pepa and his family have left 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.099
 I'm going to take you to see a 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:14.539
 stay that has fish I know 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.539
 because you were when you were little 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:24.990
 is in the middle of the forest we have to go 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.910
 Walking unpopular, keep in mind that 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.950
 I learned the way when I was 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.270
 small you will remember that already 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.270
 a lot of time for daddy 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.370
 thanks dad because in the year of 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.510
 maricastaÃ±a we started walking by a 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.850
 little footpath here is this as 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.400
 the birds because I remember that too 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.940
 There were a florets can the 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:54.900
 things have changed or not even talk about anything 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.180
 it changes so much now we have to go through 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.610
 a few small trees until you reach one 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.330
 big but the small trees will have 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.909
 grown up is true are these who have 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:11.159
 grown up much then how are we going to 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:13.049
 find the big tree that collides 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.369
 against the trees mom beam has 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.369
 found the big tree 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.050
 I knew you would continue here we continue 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.050
 family 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.539
 we are almost alone 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.539
 of quiet hunger on the way and a 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:40.140
 Super drinks because I want 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:42.810
 take a good coffee of course there will be 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.479
 ice cream for everyone who wants and 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.020
 we arrived the post has to be here 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.240
 today I will do where is behind that 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.340
 heap of rotten wood I'm afraid that 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.439
 this pile of woods is what 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.119
 we were looking for 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.579
 Well sure that's not going to come out of there 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.000
 no ice cream what a pity 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.729
 hi what do you want me to put today a 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.099
 hot coffee and three ice creams 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.099
 please right now thank you very much 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:18.120
 we continue let's go to the pond to follow me 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.500
 you better not go down that road 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.330
 direct to an area full of brambles 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.940
 Exactly that is the shortcut out there I go 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.580
 when I was small and shortcut if what 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.370
 you want is to go to the pond the best thing is to go 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.670
 on that path, I prefer to go 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:39.060
 by the shortcut very well who wants to go 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:43.310
 for a road full of cakes and me and 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.310
 who comes with me on the path 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.300
 I will arrive before days 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.030
 but that is where it was and everything seems 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:02.530
 be very different from how I remember it 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.530
 dad who is the pond is 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.310
 two 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.360
 dad said they were little but these 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.730
 animals 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:18.370
 Dad has not seen them since he was little 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.370
 but that the fish have grown a lot 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:26.819
 hey and dad where is a there will be 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.819
 lost I'll call him 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:40.350
 say to the gentleman Mr. 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:44.880
 Hi, I'm stuck 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:47.900
 hold on right away we'll take you two and 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.900
 three thousand 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:57.450
 the stand that you have seen if there are 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:01.020
 little fish 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.020
 it is bigger 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.920
 if they are coins when I was little 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.910
 we would throw a pond coin and 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.910
 we asked for a wish 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.640
 yes, of course, yes 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.960
 It is the same desire that I asked when I was 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:25.960
 small
