this is where he got through last time I
braked<00:05:28.620> him<00:05:28.770> coming<00:05:29.070> down<00:05:29.190> to<00:05:29.280> the<00:05:29.370> chicane

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
braked him coming down to the chicane

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.670 
braked him coming down to the chicane
and<00:05:29.940> he's<00:05:30.419> making<00:05:30.810> his<00:05:30.930> move<00:05:30.960> now<00:05:31.320> I<00:05:31.350> think

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
and he's making his move now I think

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.230 
and he's making his move now I think
possibly<00:05:31.919> just<00:05:32.370> to<00:05:32.490> pull<00:05:32.700> out<00:05:32.790> at<00:05:32.910> the<00:05:33.000> strip

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
possibly just to pull out at the strip

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.390 
possibly just to pull out at the strip
there<00:05:33.660> the<00:05:33.870> stream<00:05:34.110> whining<00:05:34.350> he's<00:05:35.010> taken<00:05:35.310> the

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
there the stream whining he's taken the

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.159 
there the stream whining he's taken the
outside<00:05:35.910> line<00:05:36.180> this<00:05:36.389> time<00:05:36.600> trying<00:05:36.900> to<00:05:36.990> I'd

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
outside line this time trying to I'd

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:38.659 
outside line this time trying to I'd
break<00:05:37.410> him<00:05:37.590> but<00:05:37.710> I<00:05:37.740> think<00:05:37.800> Kim<00:05:38.130> Barker<00:05:38.460> number

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
break him but I think Kim Barker number

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.840 
break him but I think Kim Barker number
five<00:05:39.229> may<00:05:40.229> just<00:05:40.740> hold<00:05:40.950> it<00:05:41.100> here<00:05:41.280> well<00:05:41.460> he<00:05:41.550> s<00:05:41.700> he

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
five may just hold it here well he s he

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.820 
five may just hold it here well he s he

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:04.529 
so buck is still lead from while for

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:06.709 
so buck is still lead from while for
second<00:06:05.159> and<00:06:05.279> third<00:06:05.369> places<00:06:05.969> but<00:06:06.089> Pete<00:06:06.270> wild<00:06:06.629> as

he<00:06:06.809> got<00:06:06.959> it<00:06:07.080> back<00:06:07.229> here<00:06:07.469> with<00:06:07.619> a<00:06:07.649> tighter<00:06:08.009> line

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:08.449 
he got it back here with a tighter line

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:12.229 
he got it back here with a tighter line
no<00:06:09.449> Kim<00:06:10.080> Barker<00:06:10.589> just<00:06:10.860> not<00:06:11.429> chops<00:06:11.939> him<00:06:12.089> but

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:12.239 
no Kim Barker just not chops him but

00:06:12.239 --> 00:06:13.729 
no Kim Barker just not chops him but
certainly<00:06:12.569> make<00:06:12.749> sure<00:06:12.929> he<00:06:13.139> stays<00:06:13.469> in<00:06:13.679> that

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:13.739 
certainly make sure he stays in that

00:06:13.739 --> 00:06:16.669 
certainly make sure he stays in that
second<00:06:14.550> place
