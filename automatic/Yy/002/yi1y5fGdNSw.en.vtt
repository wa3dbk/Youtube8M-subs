00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.570 

somewhere<00:02:14.710> I'd<00:02:15.710> say<00:02:15.860> that's<00:02:16.040> quite<00:02:16.310> a<00:02:16.430> good

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
somewhere I'd say that's quite a good

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:23.160 
somewhere I'd say that's quite a good
episode<00:02:16.700> because<00:02:17.270> he's<00:02:17.420> got<00:02:17.630> his<00:02:17.840> brother

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.700 

also<00:02:24.820> there's<00:02:25.820> another<00:02:25.910> Fox<00:02:26.870> promotion<00:02:27.530> for

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.699 
also there's another Fox promotion for
DVDs<00:02:28.660> obviously<00:02:29.660> aren't<00:02:29.810> selling<00:02:30.170> that<00:02:30.260> well

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:42.310 

Simpson<00:02:33.709> season<00:02:34.100> 7<00:02:39.190> onto<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.280> discs<00:02:41.320> again

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.260 
Simpson season 7 onto the discs again
with<00:02:42.800> this<00:02:42.980> theme<00:02:43.280> I'm<00:02:43.490> guessing<00:02:43.910> it's<00:02:44.060> head

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
with this theme I'm guessing it's head

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.900 
with this theme I'm guessing it's head
swapping<00:02:44.750> as<00:02:44.930> with<00:02:45.440> this<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:46.220> can<00:02:46.400> do<00:02:46.520> it<00:02:46.550> so

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
swapping as with this you can do it so

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.840 
swapping as with this you can do it so
it<00:02:47.030> looks<00:02:47.209> like<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.980> one<00:02:49.130> people's<00:02:49.459> bodies

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
it looks like the one people's bodies

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.699 
it looks like the one people's bodies
but<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.570> be<00:02:50.660> honest<00:02:50.959> they<00:02:51.590> don't<00:02:51.620> really<00:02:51.980> work

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
but to be honest they don't really work

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.040 
but to be honest they don't really work
to<00:02:54.709> be<00:02:54.830> on<00:02:54.920> with<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.459> loop<00:02:55.610> you<00:02:55.850> know<00:02:56.000> and<00:02:56.870> then
