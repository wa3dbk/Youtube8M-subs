00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
is the vision centres hmm that is let us

is the vision centres hmm that is let us
go<00:01:24.930> stuff<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.860> cannot<00:01:26.130> on<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.490> box

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
go stuff is you cannot on the box

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.170 
go stuff is you cannot on the box
oh<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:28.020> another<00:01:28.170> thing<00:01:28.470> unnoticed<00:01:29.250> because

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
oh and another thing unnoticed because

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.899 
oh and another thing unnoticed because
that<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.930> didn't<00:01:31.590> went<00:01:31.770> for<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.040> expectation

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
that I didn't went for the expectation

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.850 
that I didn't went for the expectation
of<00:01:33.060> 93<00:01:33.750> GT<00:01:33.990> because<00:01:34.640> you<00:01:35.640> know<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:36.860> 128-bit

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
of 93 GT because you know that 128-bit

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.510 
of 93 GT because you know that 128-bit
but<00:01:38.329> this<00:01:39.329> theory<00:01:39.630> here<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.079> 250<00:01:40.860> speed<00:01:41.130> has<00:01:41.490> a

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
but this theory here is 250 speed has a

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.580 
but this theory here is 250 speed has a
to<00:01:41.850> be<00:01:41.970> cities<00:01:42.240> with<00:01:42.420> no<00:01:42.570> interface<00:01:43.220> so<00:01:44.220> that's

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
to be cities with no interface so that's

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.740 
to be cities with no interface so that's
you<00:01:46.590> know<00:01:46.619> been<00:01:46.890> doing<00:01:47.270> better<00:01:48.270> ended<00:01:48.630> a

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
you know been doing better ended a

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.300 
you know been doing better ended a
different<00:01:50.270> so<00:01:51.270> let's<00:01:51.479> go<00:01:51.659> with<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.409> unboxing

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
different so let's go with the unboxing

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:01.789 
different so let's go with the unboxing
generation<00:01:56.090> mmm<00:01:57.560> much<00:01:58.790> good<00:01:59.790> dog<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.710> I

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
generation mmm much good dog so so I

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.630 
generation mmm much good dog so so I
should<00:02:01.979> stick<00:02:02.189> around

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640
