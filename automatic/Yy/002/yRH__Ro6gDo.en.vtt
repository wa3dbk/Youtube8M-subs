00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:35.189
 but see no point cuts shaves 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:38.040
 the hair on the arm is very comfortable 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.409
 hand is sitting pretty fine 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.340
 as if this is a notch 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:50.600
 fingers fall into it and generally on the hand 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:58.079
 like flying in general like a cast sits here 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:02:02.479
 generally very comfortable very comfortable 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:07.530
 a knife such a workhorse in general I 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:11.190
 just delighted with him as if working 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.530
 knife for work for small work whom 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.510
 would cut on wood i think im going 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:22.860
 very convenient we will take a look 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:26.549
 So I thought that this cheap model 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.010
 will be much worse but not found 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:31.290
 found no flaws in it for. 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.630
 super the only thing i donâ€™t 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.849
 I liked it so much that plastic 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.420
 principle so pretty durable but here in 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:43.349
 This place of connection with food already 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.630
 you can see whiter there that 's the only thing 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:49.110
 what did not suit me but in 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:52.920
 Basically, in principle, this is all pretty 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:57.299
 still need to be solved to change and that's 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:02.850
 make a nice hang and will 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:08.630
 well and so absorbing the horse, I generally 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.630
 happy with such a pen 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:20.680
 so here has such a card 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.739
 card allows you to very comfortable 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:27.180
 keep your finger straight here 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:31.239
 cut crush very well how would 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:34.060
 manipulate the knife here's the food cuts 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:38.250
 I have already tried very well in 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:42.819
 in general, I am satisfied, as it were, for my money 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:47.069
 he is worth a cool little knife in general 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.069
 well done swedes all all bye
