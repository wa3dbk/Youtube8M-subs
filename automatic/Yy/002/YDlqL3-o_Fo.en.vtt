00:00:00.679 --> 00:00:04.440
 Such a large selection nowadays allows us to easily find the perfect one 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.219
 Finding shoes is more difficult if the feet are sensitive 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:11.569
 Thanks to the expert 

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:14.569
 and specializes in comfortable shoes 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:19.279
 Of course there is not only good to fit but also if the sports show 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:20.269
 watch 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:24.219
 So nice shoes Habertürk in the foreground the matching shoe 

00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:25.279
 healthy shoes 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.300
 Health is also the focus of Brigitte Winkler 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.130
 she has the Beatles and needs special insoles for her shoes 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.140
 first Bernhard Wiedemann takes a blueprint off his foot 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.220
 stand there 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.659
 then follows the so-called 3d experience 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:46.589
 the foot is pressed into the foam in Egypt so that's why 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:49.739
 Shoe is evenly supported in the later insert 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.980
 Kloten led 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.100
 after the note that it is a diabetic deposit and off in the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.170
 Workshop 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.449
 the RBI thick already completely Münster can 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.399
 Should not have asked if possible where the toes succeed 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:08.720
 could 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.210
 a Dennis Olm stiffening so an ECG redistribution 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.190
 The pressure peaks in bales area when walking can be easily comes with an aperitif 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.930
 it combined so naturally 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.800
 and especially if he has material 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.010
 not Sigrid Pook Seib and Sigrid hapert 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.010
 the 3d dries out filled with resin 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.940
 not completely a bit of space is afforded for a frequently done 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.869
 this should fit in easily and gives the material stability after 20 minutes 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.180
 is the resin Bernhard and can be taken out 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.600
 only the right shape is missing 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.960
 if the impression was optimally sanded and a perfect copy of the bus 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.730
 the group's deposit rating is cut out of the imprint 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.540
 but then experienced material sets Bernhard Wiedemann on the imprint of 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.540
 enters both cases with the WASG press to Sat 1 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.950
 so that the forces reopened and the insert had the desired shape 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.129
 accepted 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.809
 Scissors are cut off after the coarsest and off you go again 

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:12.649
 grind 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:15.859
 It is abused until the lawyers represent the elected 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:18.859
 Airport 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:23.829
 then follows the offers 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:25.859
 a lighter one 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:28.749
 important now is the question where it still pushes 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:30.129
 the BDK has 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:35.069
 Very often the neurological problems he has neuropathies he does not feel what 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:38.229
 that succeeded or somewhere 

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:42.209
 a rock or even the ghosts lie there is their baby run there mostly times 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.779
 in the floor Rome 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:48.549
 the blu-ray really does not ask if the Schulenburg lures and this too 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.560
 We need to check the electronic internal pressure pressure 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:54.559
 apply when we see how the pressure distribution in the shoe 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:03:00.249
 Brigitte Winkler sees a significant improvement without deposits she says 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:02.329
 she could not walk anymore 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.669
 you mean, Dokter 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:06.339
 you could have acted 

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:07.249
 &amp; Cie 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:10.429
 does not realize that will be easy test against Rooney 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:14.619
 and you have a strong cars nautical charts so both still have them 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:18.979
 in addition to the revenue, no victim alleviate 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:21.979
 not quite clean considerably 

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:25.539
 and drew polished is the Hanseatic great speaker 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.479
 What is now the government understands 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:32.139
 and now realize that I'm getting a little easier and have it 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.139
 a special unit did not get much better 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:39.530
 Apart from custom-made inserts, you can also make your own 

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:42.029
 On haferl shoes 

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:45.899
 or even hardware for lumberjack shoes the goal is that every customer 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:47.879
 can go through life without pain
