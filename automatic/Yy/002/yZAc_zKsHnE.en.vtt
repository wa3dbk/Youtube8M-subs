how it's gonna go but I do know this is

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.420 
how it's gonna go but I do know this is
a<00:00:49.649> cool<00:00:50.250> game<00:00:50.640> it's<00:00:51.180> visually<00:00:52.280> excellent<00:00:53.280> it

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
a cool game it's visually excellent it

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.029 
a cool game it's visually excellent it
is<00:00:53.610> it's<00:00:53.969> your<00:00:54.300> remote-control<00:00:54.960> cars

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
is it's your remote-control cars

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
this is about the optimum view and I

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.940 
this is about the optimum view and I
can't<00:01:05.900> and<00:01:06.080> want<00:01:06.200> to<00:01:06.229> control<00:01:06.530> this<00:01:06.680> for<00:01:06.890> it

playing<00:02:23.090> this<00:02:23.239> on<00:02:23.420> a<00:02:23.450> ps3<00:02:23.810> and<00:02:24.140> it<00:02:24.200> smooths<00:02:24.560> out

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
playing this on a ps3 and it smooths out

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.430 
playing this on a ps3 and it smooths out
all<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:25.069> textures<00:02:25.670> or<00:02:25.819> something<00:02:28.120> but

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.220 

I<00:02:31.560> do<00:02:32.070> like<00:02:32.490> the<00:02:32.640> way<00:02:32.760> ps1<00:02:33.360> games<00:02:33.660> look<00:02:33.960> these

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
I do like the way ps1 games look these

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.140 
I do like the way ps1 games look these
days<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.890> mean<00:02:35.010> it's<00:02:35.190> like<00:02:35.370> my<00:02:35.550> brain<00:02:35.610> is

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
days I mean it's like my brain is

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.420 
days I mean it's like my brain is
acclimatize<00:02:36.720> or<00:02:37.350> attuned<00:02:37.710> or<00:02:37.890> whatever<00:02:38.190> to

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
acclimatize or attuned or whatever to

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.780 
acclimatize or attuned or whatever to
the<00:02:38.520> ps3<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.420> PS<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.950> my<00:02:41.100> eyes<00:02:41.310> kind<00:02:41.730> of

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
the ps3 and PS to to my eyes kind of

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.530 
the ps3 and PS to to my eyes kind of
looks<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.150> bit<00:02:42.180> there<00:02:42.980> just<00:02:43.980> like<00:02:44.100> muddy<00:02:44.550> ps3

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
looks a bit there just like muddy ps3

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.640 
looks a bit there just like muddy ps3
the<00:02:46.020> ps1<00:02:46.880> it's<00:02:47.880> really<00:02:48.600> got<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:48.900> retro<00:02:49.380> charm

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
the ps1 it's really got that retro charm

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.340 
the ps1 it's really got that retro charm
to<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.130> now<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.840> games<00:02:51.840> like<00:02:51.990> this<00:02:53.960> look<00:02:54.960> great
