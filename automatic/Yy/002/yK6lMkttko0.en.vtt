00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.350 
kind of sucks we could be making a
little<00:01:35.770> bit<00:01:35.920> more<00:01:36.040> money<00:01:36.280> but<00:01:37.000> we're<00:01:37.119> able<00:01:37.240> to

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
little bit more money but we're able to

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.410 
little bit more money but we're able to
get<00:01:37.479> a<00:01:37.510> hill<00:01:37.869> which<00:01:38.560> hill<00:01:39.159> it's<00:01:39.280> only<00:01:39.460> 630<00:01:39.909> 4k

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
get a hill which hill it's only 630 4k

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.679 
get a hill which hill it's only 630 4k
but<00:01:41.049> a<00:01:41.229> pair<00:01:41.500> of<00:01:41.590> bandos<00:01:41.950> gloves<00:01:42.310> 2.7<00:01:43.210> so<00:01:43.570> that

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 
but a pair of bandos gloves 2.7 so that

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:45.899 
but a pair of bandos gloves 2.7 so that
brings<00:01:43.810> it<00:01:44.020> to<00:01:44.140> around<00:01:44.470> five<00:01:44.860> point<00:01:45.250> six<00:01:45.520> mil

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
brings it to around five point six mil

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.920 
brings it to around five point six mil
and<00:01:46.750> that<00:01:46.869> is<00:01:47.020> from<00:01:47.170> a<00:01:47.490> 293<00:01:48.490> kill<00:01:48.790> count<00:01:49.030> so<00:01:49.600> if

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
and that is from a 293 kill count so if

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.370 
and that is from a 293 kill count so if
we<00:01:50.170> have<00:01:50.520> five<00:01:51.520> point<00:01:51.820> six<00:01:52.060> mil<00:01:53.189> /<00:01:54.840> 293<00:01:55.840> that's

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
we have five point six mil / 293 that's

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.950 
we have five point six mil / 293 that's
a<00:01:56.500> round<00:01:56.920> 19<00:01:57.729> k<00:01:58.000> /<00:01:58.240> kill<00:01:58.509> if<00:01:58.630> you<00:01:58.720> want<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:58.900> look

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
a round 19 k / kill if you want to look

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.560 
a round 19 k / kill if you want to look
at<00:01:59.110> it<00:01:59.229> like<00:01:59.290> that<00:01:59.490> or<00:02:00.490> we<00:02:00.939> could<00:02:01.119> do<00:02:01.299> is<00:02:01.509> we

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
at it like that or we could do is we

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.140 
at it like that or we could do is we
could<00:02:02.080> take<00:02:02.409> the<00:02:02.650> five<00:02:03.009> point<00:02:03.340> six<00:02:03.549> min<00:02:03.850> and

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
could take the five point six min and

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.600 
could take the five point six min and
divide<00:02:04.990> it<00:02:05.020> by<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.290> four<00:02:05.710> trips<00:02:05.979> I<00:02:06.100> did<00:02:06.369> which

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
divide it by the four trips I did which

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.649 
divide it by the four trips I did which
is<00:02:06.759> around<00:02:06.970> 1.4<00:02:07.960> mil<00:02:08.259> per<00:02:09.009> trip<00:02:09.459> at<00:02:10.149> bandos

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:10.659 
is around 1.4 mil per trip at bandos

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:12.990 
is around 1.4 mil per trip at bandos
obviously<00:02:11.110> solo<00:02:11.379> bandos<00:02:11.829> so<00:02:12.099> there's<00:02:12.849> a<00:02:12.939> few

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
obviously solo bandos so there's a few

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.089 
obviously solo bandos so there's a few
calculations<00:02:13.299> for<00:02:13.810> you<00:02:13.870> guys<00:02:14.019> and<00:02:14.290> yeah<00:02:15.010> I'll
