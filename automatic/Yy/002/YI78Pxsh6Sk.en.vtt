00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
everybody in the house could actually

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.200 
everybody in the house could actually
use<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:19.189> because<00:00:20.189> some<00:00:20.520> people<00:00:20.760> might<00:00:20.910> not<00:00:20.970> be

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
use it because some people might not be

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.529

although my family is well versed in all
of<00:00:26.640> them<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:26.939> think<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.420> probably<00:00:27.630> a

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
of them I think this is probably a

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.500 
of them I think this is probably a
little<00:00:27.990> bit<00:00:28.170> better<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.920> operate<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.789> without

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
little bit better to operate and without

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.620 
little bit better to operate and without

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
rifle but then I shopped around to get

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.060 
rifle but then I shopped around to get
the<00:01:14.580> actual<00:01:15.119> add-on<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.259> some<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.920> add-ons

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070

the actual add-on so some of the add-ons
that<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.490> added<00:01:18.409> the<00:01:19.409> go<00:01:19.590> site<00:01:19.830> actually<00:01:20.070> came

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
that I added the go site actually came

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.980 
that I added the go site actually came
with<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.759> which<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:20.970> was<00:01:21.090> really<00:01:21.270> surprised<00:01:21.780> for

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
with it which I was really surprised for

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.200 
with it which I was really surprised for
an<00:01:22.049> inexpensive<00:01:22.409> shotgun<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.130> have<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.520> go<00:01:23.880> site

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
an inexpensive shotgun to have a go site

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.230 
an inexpensive shotgun to have a go site
but<00:01:24.930> they<00:01:25.110> actually<00:01:25.320> had<00:01:26.310> nice<00:01:26.549> polymer<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.060> I

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
but they actually had nice polymer so I

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.850 
but they actually had nice polymer so I
could<00:01:27.479> burn<00:01:27.750> but<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.049> thought<00:01:28.259> what<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.530> will<00:01:28.710> do

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
could burn but I thought what I will do

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.380 
could burn but I thought what I will do
is<00:01:29.070> go<00:01:29.220> with<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.460> Blackhawk<00:01:30.060> nock
