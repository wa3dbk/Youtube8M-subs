00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.190 
to the left of a pair of Black Keys
nearest<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.270> center<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.750> keyboard<00:00:54.200> now

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
nearest the center of the keyboard now

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.740 
nearest the center of the keyboard now
each<00:00:55.379> time<00:00:55.590> we<00:00:55.770> move<00:00:55.950> from<00:00:56.309> one<00:00:56.610> key<00:00:57.450> on<00:00:57.480> the

keyboard to the next key immediately to
its<00:01:00.629> right<00:01:01.309> we're<00:01:02.309> raising<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.820> pitch<00:01:02.969> of

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
its right we're raising the pitch of

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.940 
its right we're raising the pitch of
that<00:01:03.149> note<00:01:03.449> by<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.470> semitone<00:01:05.070> or<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.580> half-step

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
that note by a semitone or a half-step

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.200 
that note by a semitone or a half-step
so<00:01:07.950> from<00:01:08.190> here<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.700> here

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
so from here to here

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.230 
so from here to here
half<00:01:12.110> step<00:01:12.850> half<00:01:13.850> step<00:01:14.500> half<00:01:15.500> step<00:01:16.210> half<00:01:17.210> step

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
half step half step half step half step

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.050 
half step half step half step half step
and<00:01:17.780> so<00:01:18.110> on

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
and so on

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.910 
and so on
now<00:01:20.060> all<00:01:20.270> major<00:01:20.540> chords<00:01:20.840> have<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:21.680> same

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
now all major chords have the same

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.969 
now all major chords have the same
combination<00:01:22.310> of<00:01:22.940> half<00:01:23.240> steps<00:01:25.000> so<00:01:26.000> if<00:01:26.210> we<00:01:26.420> make

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
combination of half steps so if we make

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.899 
combination of half steps so if we make
middle<00:01:27.979> C<00:01:28.130> our<00:01:28.369> number<00:01:28.850> one<00:01:29.030> key<00:01:29.270> and<00:01:30.909> then

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
middle C our number one key and then

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.240 
middle C our number one key and then
count<00:01:32.210> up<00:01:32.420> to<00:01:33.080> number<00:01:33.590> five<00:01:34.180> two<00:01:35.180> three<00:01:36.250> four

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
count up to number five two three four

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.149 
count up to number five two three four
five<00:01:38.270> we<00:01:39.259> now<00:01:39.320> have<00:01:39.500> E<00:01:39.860> so<00:01:40.850> C<00:01:41.210> and<00:01:41.509> E<00:01:42.020> 1<00:01:42.770> and<00:01:42.920> 5

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
five we now have E so C and E 1 and 5

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:53.350 
five we now have E so C and E 1 and 5
and<00:01:44.030> now<00:01:44.750> we<00:01:44.810> need<00:01:45.050> 8<00:01:45.550> 6<00:01:46.899> 7<00:01:47.899> 8<00:01:49.360> so<00:01:50.360> C<00:01:50.780> E<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:51.800> G<00:01:52.100> 1<00:01:52.940> 5

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
and now we need 8 6 7 8 so C E and G 1 5

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.650 
and now we need 8 6 7 8 so C E and G 1 5
and<00:01:53.600> 8<00:01:55.030> is<00:01:56.030> our<00:01:56.240> C<00:01:56.450> major<00:01:56.600> chord<00:01:58.179> this<00:01:59.179> chord<00:01:59.240> is

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
and 8 is our C major chord this chord is

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.540 
and 8 is our C major chord this chord is
in<00:01:59.810> what's<00:02:00.200> called<00:02:00.410> a<00:02:00.500> root<00:02:00.649> position<00:02:00.860> in

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
in what's called a root position in

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.800 
in what's called a root position in
other<00:02:01.670> words<00:02:01.910> the<00:02:02.810> lowest<00:02:03.170> note<00:02:03.380> of<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:03.860> chord

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
other words the lowest note of the chord

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.080 
other words the lowest note of the chord
the<00:02:05.810> note<00:02:05.990> C<00:02:06.229> is<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:07.009> name<00:02:07.220> of<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:07.640> chord<00:02:07.880> and

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
the note C is the name of the chord and

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.350 
the note C is the name of the chord and
the<00:02:09.080> other<00:02:09.229> notes<00:02:09.800> are<00:02:10.100> built<00:02:10.340> up<00:02:10.550> on<00:02:10.789> top<00:02:11.330> of

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
the other notes are built up on top of

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.760 
the other notes are built up on top of
that<00:02:11.569> note

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
that note

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.890 
that note
so<00:02:14.340> this<00:02:14.490> is<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.640> c-major<00:02:15.210> root<00:02:15.810> position<00:02:16.020> chord

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
so this is a c-major root position chord

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.000 
so this is a c-major root position chord
so<00:02:18.900> if<00:02:18.960> you<00:02:19.080> remember<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.470> one<00:02:19.560> five<00:02:19.830> eight

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
so if you remember the one five eight

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.120 
so if you remember the one five eight
you<00:02:20.820> can<00:02:21.000> play<00:02:21.180> any<00:02:21.510> of<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.140> 12<00:02:22.530> major<00:02:22.920> chords

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
you can play any of the 12 major chords

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:33.220 
you can play any of the 12 major chords
possible<00:02:23.970> which<00:02:24.600> are<00:02:24.840> based<00:02:25.110> on<00:02:25.380> these<00:02:25.590> keys

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.380 

anywhere<00:02:34.230> on<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.500> keyboard<00:02:34.860> so<00:02:35.700> let's<00:02:35.880> try<00:02:36.090> an

plain seventh or dominant seventh chord

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.600 
plain seventh or dominant seventh chord
for<00:05:25.520> example<00:05:25.900> c7<00:05:27.340> again<00:05:28.340> is<00:05:28.550> one<00:05:28.819> five<00:05:29.090> eight

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
for example c7 again is one five eight

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.300 
for example c7 again is one five eight
but<00:05:31.610> this<00:05:31.759> time<00:05:32.000> it's<00:05:32.330> one<00:05:32.659> five<00:05:32.900> eight<00:05:33.080> 11

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
but this time it's one five eight 11

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.749 
but this time it's one five eight 11
nine<00:05:34.310> ten<00:05:35.090> eleven

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:36.759 
nine ten eleven

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:45.369 
nine ten eleven
so<00:05:37.759> here<00:05:37.909> we<00:05:38.000> have<00:05:40.389> c7<00:05:42.159> f7<00:05:43.159> would<00:05:43.669> be<00:05:43.819> one<00:05:44.689> five

00:05:45.369 --> 00:05:45.379 
so here we have c7 f7 would be one five

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:51.399 
so here we have c7 f7 would be one five
eight<00:05:45.770> 11<00:05:49.090> so<00:05:50.090> again<00:05:50.360> we<00:05:50.599> can<00:05:50.750> add<00:05:50.960> a<00:05:50.990> bass<00:05:51.199> to

eight 11 so again we can add a bass to

00:05:51.409 --> 00:06:04.070 
eight 11 so again we can add a bass to
it
