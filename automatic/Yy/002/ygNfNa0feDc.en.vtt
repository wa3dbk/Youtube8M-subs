00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
I think this is this look at all of that

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.890 
I think this is this look at all of that
bud<00:03:21.620> would<00:03:22.400> you<00:03:22.580> at<00:03:22.730> least<00:03:22.760> try<00:03:23.210> in<00:03:23.420> that<00:03:23.450> sense

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
bud would you at least try in that sense

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:39.290 
bud would you at least try in that sense
of

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.840 

I<00:03:39.800> think<00:03:40.800> triple<00:03:41.160> Eight's<00:03:41.280> might<00:03:41.550> be<00:03:41.700> the

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
I think triple Eight's might be the

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.540 
I think triple Eight's might be the
greatest<00:03:42.120> superstar<00:03:42.960> of<00:03:42.990> his<00:03:43.320> generation<00:03:43.770> and

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
greatest superstar of his generation and

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.550 
greatest superstar of his generation and
I<00:03:44.700> think<00:03:44.940> that<00:03:45.060> in<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.270> future<00:03:45.570> superstars

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
I think that in the future superstars

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.230 
I think that in the future superstars
are<00:03:46.680> going<00:03:46.800> to<00:03:46.860> talk<00:03:47.040> about<00:03:47.190> Triple<00:03:47.610> H<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:47.970> way

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 
are going to talk about Triple H the way

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.360 
are going to talk about Triple H the way
superstar<00:03:50.300> Flair<00:03:51.300> the<00:03:51.990> idea<00:03:52.530> that<00:03:52.950> triple

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
superstar Flair the idea that triple

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.130 
superstar Flair the idea that triple
Eight's<00:03:53.490> might<00:03:53.730> potentially<00:03:54.180> become<00:03:54.840> a<00:03:54.870> role

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
Eight's might potentially become a role

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.680 
Eight's might potentially become a role
model<00:03:55.170> to<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.040> next<00:03:56.280> generation<00:03:56.940> turns<00:03:57.390> my

hope all you want junior but you know
I'm<00:04:02.970> right<00:04:03.480> Triple<00:04:04.170> H<00:04:04.260> has<00:04:04.290> accomplished<00:04:04.950> too

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
I'm right Triple H has accomplished too

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:17.370 
I'm right Triple H has accomplished too
much

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.550 

where

they<00:04:23.100> sure

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:36.749 

I<00:04:31.230> think<00:04:32.230> we're<00:04:32.380> gonna<00:04:32.500> find<00:04:32.770> out

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:36.759 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:47.170 

I<00:04:36.789> think<00:04:37.180> you're<00:04:37.330> right<00:04:37.449> King<00:04:37.779> big<00:04:38.469> superstars
