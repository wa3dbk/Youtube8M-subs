00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.539
 hey here is florian friedrich from 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.619
 florians bass lessons in this video 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.570
 I want to be a bit more accurate 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.970
 on the hammers us and pollux go 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.740
 but then especially with regard to the sap 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.539
 This is how it is with towing technology 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.400
 that you two notes that fast 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.010
 be played in a row only 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.290
 difficult both dolls can completely 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.370
 just because you have to pop the page with 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.320
 show yours respectively 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.320
 middle finger under the side hook must 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.690
 Of course, none of that should be done now 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.039
 be satisfaction 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.719
 Of course you can just like that 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.059
 long practice can be up to fast but 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.219
 Nevertheless, the sound of this movement is 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.539
 Pretty special and your line sounds 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.539
 relatively hard and angular 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.760
 and that's why you play such fast 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.949
 he notes with hammer us and pollux what 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.239
 then much better and more fluid and 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.239
 sounds natural, of course 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.229
 but also when hauling when 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.270
 strike the side with the thumb 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:20.770
 one uses hens and polens more often than 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:22.270
 if you play with the fingers and that 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.040
 is also due to the movement 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.940
 has to be pretty fast and there you go 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.460
 unconsciously always the most efficient 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.990
 Method chooses something as simple as 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.180
 possible to play 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.500
 you look for hermanns instead of the 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.539
 page again and again 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.220
 drag because the sap movement is 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.720
 if you look fast in a row 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.909
 quarter a contrary one 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.679
 movement sequence and can not be 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.659
 very easy to repeat quickly 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.880
 the well-being goes into the 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.500
 opposite direction and each 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.509
 dragging a single note sounds just like that 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.509
 not as smooth as you played with heart 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.020
 you probably play when hauling 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.459
 He also accessaries us and Pohl again because 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.229
 in contrast to the page 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.679
 finger play much more momentum 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.720
 gives 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.250
 the stroke is much stronger and the 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.720
 side vibrates much stronger and the 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.549
 the following sounds are possible 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.170
 lighter without further stop 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.170
 clearer to sound 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.320
 and of course many are based 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.120
 typical slap riffs and licks on the 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.799
 hammers and pull-off technology with lesson 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.329
 pages for example so special 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.799
 when hauling the hammers us and pulse 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.989
 As always, you should practice 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.910
 start slowly , for example , plays completely 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.799
 simple fingers but practice the last 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.510
 week only the first note on one page 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.930
 and the second or the 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.920
 western side do you play then 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.510
 and then you can already 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.860
 with some cool moves and bass left 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.860
 continue to do this , for example 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.450
 or something 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.330
 I have more exercises for you 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.560
 of course written again in notes 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.030
 and tabula tour and again 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.800
 player longs made to those only with 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.299
 you can play and practice you can 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.680
 again under this video on florian 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.720
 fun lessons download points

 if you have questions or maybe 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.739
 own experiences and tips for others 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.450
 then just write everything down to me 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.190

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.110
 also like to google on facebook or 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.060
