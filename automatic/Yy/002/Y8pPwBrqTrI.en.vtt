00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.130

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.630
 on stage 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.350
 given to look at the camera and in the workshop 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.660
 with a 6.3 percent chance of almost everything 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.820
 spare head and animatronics and 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.920
 skilled will look in camera black 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:52.140
 eyes also in the workshop can 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:55.110
 look into the camera bonnie without eyes when 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.870
 checking camera 2b can get caught 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.570
 poster featuring freddie but 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.289
 yellow or gold with black 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.300
 eyes 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.000
 if she is a poster look more than two 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.460
 seconds you can hear the girls laugh after 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.840
 This remove the tablet and the office will be 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.659
 sit golden Freddy 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.420
 then you will start hallucinating as 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.799
 Freddy's heads with human eyes and 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.990
 it's me 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.150
 after which the golden creamer appears 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.549
 freddie game crashes 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.470
 will simply fly to the desktop 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.420
 to get rid of animatronics need 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.420
 raise and lower the tablet it will disappear 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.750
 when checking camera 2b with a chance of 11.4 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.640
 percent can get poster with 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.540
 an image of freddie who shoots 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.610
 costume head 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.710
 maybe this is a hint of an incident with 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.049
 missing children namely that 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.600
 a man lured five children and killed them 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.360
 it is in the costume of Freddie and Freddie 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.939
 there are handprints on the mask maybe he 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.590
 he himself left them possible that someone or 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.590
 something is trying to get out of the frenzy 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:04.360
 sometimes with a 25-30 percent chance 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.610
 pirate bay on the plate instead of a quarrel 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.400
 out of order out of order 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:14.610
 will be written and the media in Russian is me 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.610
 perhaps this is a reference to the bite 87 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.620
 sometimes instead of posters in eastern holly 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.570
 three paintings may appear with a face 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.000
 crying boy looking like 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.730

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.740
 ipmi inscription on the right wall which 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.650
 may appear about 3 chance 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:38.800
 percent crying children with a chance about 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:40.600
 10 percent from 4 nights check him 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.480
 don't look at the camera and jerk their heads 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.210
 while they are trying to say something 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.940
 when they say in the beginning you hear pliz 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:53.260
 pliz russian please 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.360
 or experience the enthusiasm in Russian open the door to 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.870
 some places if you combine these 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.300
 phrases 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.850
 please, please open 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.280
 the door maybe they want the guard 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.290
 opened the door to the office just can not find out 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:11.110
 what they want to tell us because 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:13.600
 that the voices are strong I will say on camera 4b with 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.300
 about 5-10 percent chance a piece of paper with 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.850
 rules can be replaced by clippings from 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.350
 newspapers in these clippings are written about 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:26.080
 pizzeria incidents 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:28.060
