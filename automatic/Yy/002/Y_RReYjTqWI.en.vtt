00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.510
 carmen lillo social like this year if 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.730
 absent and well, welcome them to 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.580
 a one way review for version 0 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.920
 point 9.5 of minecraft epic and well then 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.439
 first of all channels like that is not 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.020
 dead I have returned from the depths of 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.480
 knows where but good on large scales 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.820
 not roughly what happened 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.439
 you know why I had not uploaded very videos 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.779
 I tell you above, these are questions 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.170
 this now that personal work 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.480
 more than anything then it is that I do not know 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.790
 I just had complications with 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.620
 my current job then I'm in this 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.540
 growth possibilities of changes 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.400
 you can follow many things here 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.860
 stressful ones that take away too much 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.659
 time to fall asleep early you know 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.010
 that I record at night already in the 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:52.649
 early morning 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.879
 so then it is something is something complicated 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.920
 do it when you have to get up 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.539
 early and I hope you understand that part is 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.729
 another reason why not to see this 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.960
 series more to the time but good carles or of 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:02.670
 I take your time because I know it is 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.379
 Maybe there are people who are new and nothing 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.820
 more come to the review of the mod then 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.259
 that little by little we are going to go to this 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.390
 talking about those changes in the series or 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.979
 that it was simply to tell them that and 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.690
 I'm already here, well, do not forget me 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.320
 so what are we doing in 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.509
 this mod 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.909
 obviously sometimes they saw 0.9 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.520
 points 5 of minecraft and the launcher pro 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.340
 1.7 point 5 I know that maybe they are 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.009
 saying traces the 1.6 point that is 1.7 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.360
 points 6 no and if channels have already been 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.250
 any way there is the description 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.630
 that version in case you want me to 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.149
 I'm using and I 'm staying with 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.340
 for the moment it is 1.7 point 5 a 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.170
 So, nothing, they already know how to be 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.789
 the modes here are below this link 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.190
 download of what they are in the end them 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.959
 I say where to click to download that 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.450
 there are people who are clueless who do not 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:47.250
 he then has the forums as well 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.890
 if that is it is very easy they realized 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.350
 is the mod of the waypoints or that the 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.580
 version 1.7 if I'm not wrong obviously 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.509
 the one that had happened to them is improved 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.189
 previously it was for the 0.9 points 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.750
 2.4 I do not remember something like that and this is already 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.570
 more complete as you can see we add 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.150
 a button that is this that is the one of the w 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.590
 when we open this this appears 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.509
 already we will be able to change it 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.310
 language here direct that is only 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.110
 a way is not like it was before 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.340
 a Spanish version not here no 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.930
 we can continue to change the language 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.080
 we're just going to give it a twist and it 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.400
 will change answer spanish spanish 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.030
 Spanish I think it's also current 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.350
 quota and French something like that then just 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.630
 We must stop waiting unless 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.030
 have is your international already you know 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.380
 that to pure quality then what is it 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.880
 let's see first show 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.410
 this one was already in the 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.060
 previous version remember that you can not see 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.230
 if you are in turning to heaven the 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.760
 numbers are not enough to see then 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.170
 something half stupid in any way 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.330
 the mode the coordinates already also the 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.770
 upload this but I recommend simply 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.510
 it's called mod coordinates 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.100
 so good when you want it 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.520
 hide possibly you give him here in 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.810
 hide and now we're going to create a 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.550
 marker because here comes what 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.290
 interesting carnal let's get to 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.420
 make pp for those who do not know what to do 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.070
 pp in minecraft tps that 's right 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.630
 just to teleport 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.190
 now let's see more or less how it 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.590
 do we are going to first create a point or 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.239
 be a bookmark and well I want 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.730
 transport from here so I'm going to 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.960
 put here 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.750
 these are the coordinates again we're going 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.580
 to give ok it does not move anything like good 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.320
 there were already seeing here the point 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.060
 added we're going to go right now to this 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.130
 part of this up here from the 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.080
 church is because it is necessary right now 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.820
 they will see what then good 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.260
 being here I was in the part of 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.670
 down already on the part of the 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.250
 church is going to show you again here in 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.530
 the wy as you can see if we select 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.660
 here this button is going to put color 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.310
 blue and it's obviously telling us that 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.860
 is up and this would be not that 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.959
 it's just to warn us towards 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.160
 where how to move us the little arrow 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.350
 it will simply tell us where 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.270
 direct us and when we get to the point 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.680
 because where we left our marker 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.170
 start to spin this simply 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.250
 in case someone did not know then good 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.720
 what are we going to do now if we 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.190
 I say here that teleport not 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.840
 let's remove those as it is removed 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.080
 simply giving it one more touch and you already 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.520
 remove then good leave a point here 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.890
 above, obviously , I'm going to show you how 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.380
 I put him there then good as you 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.300
 let's do to teleport 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.310
 simple we are going to give a touch in the 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.770
 point that we want to go by 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.400
 example I want to go there or that is already 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.930
 is directing that it is there 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.690
 and let's write what we're going to 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.150
 write diagonal tp although with the point 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.970
 such a selection 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.800
 which are we going to give here in the little window 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.180
 is although as you can see follows the 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.440
 arrow is still active we will be able to 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:33.150
 get to the pp and give it in following us 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.440
 will automatically transport that 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.940
 point ok to the point that we 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.430
 we have chosen the one that we have put 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.960
 in blue and good no no photos are not 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.340
 they may be circling but look 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.560
 here I already spoke the light and 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.390
 nations going around then 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.640
 visibly to return we go to 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.680
 select here or to the point that we 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.940
 we want, you know, let's put diagonal 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.710
 pp and we will be here 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.850
 the name here back then then 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.830
 nothing meat I hope you liked it 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.660
 we are already you know it is simply the 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.460
 update of the past but good 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.470
 before finishing the video we will see 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.000
 how is it downloaded ok is 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.070
 simply what we have to do is 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.630
 give you carnal clicks let's click 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.490
 here below the link and that says the link 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.520
 of the forum ma in parentheses this one 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.260
 download and as you can see there we are going to 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.580
 send straight to the carnal forum the only thing 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.840
 what you have to do is give it a touch 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.270
 where I even put you in a 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.620

 been this of the good ones 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.000
