00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.509
 hello or entering the weather 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.980
 this week brings the forecast to almost 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.920
 all Brazil on this extended holiday 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.949
 for those who will come off already this 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.300
 Thursday the best beach option is the 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.800
 northeast of the country 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.599
 This is because a mass of hot 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.119
 dry matter predominates in virtually all 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.840
 areas here from sergipe to the coast 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.460
 guaranteed sunny days 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.380
 hot and with no rain forecast only 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.879
 in the bay that has the possibility of 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.190
 some strokes mainly in the 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.440
 south coast region of isles port 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.390
 insurance and caravelas contain a little 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.489
 more unstable in the next few days 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.930
 but if you want to enjoy temperatures 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.420
 a little more amenable 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.949
 the Rio Grande do Sul is the best destination in 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.140
 last days an air mass of origin 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.039
 reached the region caused a drop in 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.690
 thermometers 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.520
 both in the stretches of the Rio Grande 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.680
 as well as in the mountain ranges 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.019
 Santa Catarina temperature dropped 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.880
 and in the coming days during the 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.570
 when the temperature 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.549
 minimum 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.290
 the thermometers should be below 10 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.510
 degrees, not to mention that it has a 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.000
 cold wind then gives a feeling of 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.790
 temperatures lower than 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.250
 besides great climatic conditions for 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.770
 the two itineraries the trip can go well 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.549
 cheaper because we are still in the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.119
 season 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.460
 225 other cities in the country 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.409
 they will have an even greater 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.540
 amended the holiday of the 20th of 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.939
 November next Tuesday 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.460
 now only three capitals will have these 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.770
 three days of rest in Sao Paulo 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.020
 six years is already celebrated the day of the 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.210
 black awareness and weather forecast 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.430

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.229

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.540

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.390

 sun also shining stronger and stronger 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.060
 but there is no way to discard the 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.619
 possibility of rapid rain on account of 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.869
 of the humid winds that blow from the sea 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.989
