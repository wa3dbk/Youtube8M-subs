00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
too fast way too small a way to skilled

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.729 
too fast way too small a way to skilled
really<00:02:27.769> good<00:02:27.920> reflexes<00:02:28.549> I<00:02:29.390> think<00:02:30.140> I<00:02:30.349> don't

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
really good reflexes I think I don't

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.449 
really good reflexes I think I don't
think<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.700> nether<00:02:31.910> would<00:02:32.150> beat<00:02:32.330> Rigondeaux<00:02:32.780> I

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
think the nether would beat Rigondeaux I

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.070 
think the nether would beat Rigondeaux I
think<00:02:34.459> he<00:02:34.549> can<00:02:34.790> he<00:02:35.180> has<00:02:35.209> a<00:02:35.299> good<00:02:35.569> chance<00:02:35.780> if<00:02:36.049> he

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
think he can he has a good chance if he

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.039 
think he can he has a good chance if he
keeps<00:02:36.379> his<00:02:36.590> patients<00:02:37.190> cuz<00:02:38.060> man<00:02:38.540> what's<00:02:38.900> the

keeps his patients cuz man what's the

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.660 
keeps his patients cuz man what's the
point<00:02:39.260> why<00:02:39.410> would<00:02:39.590> he<00:02:39.709> go<00:02:39.890> for<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:40.250> one<00:02:40.430> punch

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
point why would he go for the one punch

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.210 
point why would he go for the one punch
knockout<00:02:40.760> man<00:02:41.410> that's<00:02:42.410> what<00:02:42.530> I<00:02:42.560> expected<00:02:43.040> I

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220

expected<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.849> fight<00:02:44.030> to<00:02:44.150> be<00:02:44.239> very

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
expected the fight to be very

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.990 
expected the fight to be very
competitive<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:45.400> all<00:02:46.400> of<00:02:46.549> a<00:02:46.610> sudden<00:02:46.640> he

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
competitive and all of a sudden he

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.250 
competitive and all of a sudden he
decided<00:02:47.329> to<00:02:47.420> go<00:02:47.569> for<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:47.810> one<00:02:47.930> punch<00:02:48.170> knockout

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
decided to go for the one punch knockout

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.809 
decided to go for the one punch knockout
and<00:02:48.739> he<00:02:48.890> was<00:02:49.040> getting<00:02:49.340> schooled<00:02:49.670> in<00:02:49.790> there<00:02:49.970> and

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
and he was getting schooled in there and

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.430 
and he was getting schooled in there and
the<00:02:52.819> same<00:02:53.030> thing<00:02:53.239> will<00:02:53.480> most<00:02:53.780> likely<00:02:53.989> happen

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
the same thing will most likely happen

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.789 
the same thing will most likely happen
if<00:02:54.590> they<00:02:54.709> fight<00:02:54.890> again<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:57.170> only<00:02:57.380> way<00:02:57.500> i<00:02:57.530> seed

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
if they fight again the only way i seed

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.270 
if they fight again the only way i seed
another<00:02:58.069> winning<00:02:58.549> is<00:02:58.700> if<00:02:58.989> he<00:02:59.989> actually

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
another winning is if he actually

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.309 
another winning is if he actually
listens<00:03:01.280> to<00:03:01.459> his<00:03:01.579> coach<00:03:02.000> wasn't<00:03:02.810> listening

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
listens to his coach wasn't listening

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.890 
listens to his coach wasn't listening
crap<00:03:03.739> to<00:03:03.890> his<00:03:04.010> trainers<00:03:04.579> he<00:03:05.180> wasn't<00:03:05.510> listening

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
crap to his trainers he wasn't listening

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.470 
crap to his trainers he wasn't listening
to<00:03:06.140> them<00:03:06.260> at<00:03:06.410> all<00:03:06.440> and<00:03:06.799> if<00:03:07.760> he<00:03:07.879> listens<00:03:08.060> to<00:03:08.329> them

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
to them at all and if he listens to them

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.910 
to them at all and if he listens to them
there's<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:08.900> good<00:03:09.079> chance<00:03:09.290> he<00:03:09.590> might<00:03:09.739> actually

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
there's a good chance he might actually

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.430 
there's a good chance he might actually
pull<00:03:10.280> it<00:03:10.310> off<00:03:10.519> and<00:03:10.790> if<00:03:11.420> he<00:03:11.540> stays<00:03:11.810> if<00:03:12.049> he<00:03:12.290> keeps

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
pull it off and if he stays if he keeps

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.289 
pull it off and if he stays if he keeps
his<00:03:12.680> patience<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:14.319> actually<00:03:15.760> not<00:03:16.760> go<00:03:17.030> for<00:03:17.209> the

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
his patience and actually not go for the

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.599 
his patience and actually not go for the
one<00:03:17.480> punch<00:03:17.780> knockout<00:03:18.280> he<00:03:19.280> might<00:03:19.459> actually

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
one punch knockout he might actually

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.449 
one punch knockout he might actually
pull<00:03:20.389> it<00:03:20.420> off<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:21.380> way<00:03:21.530> I<00:03:21.560> expected<00:03:21.829> him<00:03:22.310> the

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
pull it off the way I expected him the
