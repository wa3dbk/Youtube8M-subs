00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
computer craft tutorial so today I'm

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.400 
computer craft tutorial so today I'm
updating<00:00:05.700> you<00:00:06.120> on<00:00:06.150> one<00:00:06.540> of<00:00:06.660> my<00:00:06.779> computer<00:00:07.200> craft

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
updating you on one of my computer craft

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.030 
updating you on one of my computer craft
programs<00:00:08.360> since<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.540> release<00:00:09.690> of<00:00:09.840> 15<00:00:10.380> to<00:00:10.620> my

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
programs since the release of 15 to my

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.039 
programs since the release of 15 to my
farm<00:00:11.429> program<00:00:12.150> has<00:00:12.360> not<00:00:12.540> really<00:00:12.780> been<00:00:12.809> working

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
farm program has not really been working

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.079 
farm program has not really been working
because<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.190> fact<00:00:14.400> that<00:00:14.580> instead<00:00:15.030> of

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
because of the fact that instead of

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.269 
because of the fact that instead of
growing<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.960> instead<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.560> growing<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:17.100> crop

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
growing and instead of growing a crop

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.200 
growing and instead of growing a crop
from<00:00:17.670> stage<00:00:18.390> 0<00:00:18.960> stage<00:00:19.350> max<00:00:19.920> in<00:00:20.279> one<00:00:20.880> piece<00:00:21.090> of

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
from stage 0 stage max in one piece of

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.380 
from stage 0 stage max in one piece of
bone<00:00:21.300> meal<00:00:21.510> instead<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.590> now<00:00:22.710> takes<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.400> two

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
bone meal instead it now takes and two

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.710 
bone meal instead it now takes and two
to<00:00:24.660> three<00:00:24.930> pieces<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.650> bone<00:00:25.769> meal<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.720> fully

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
to three pieces of bone meal to fully

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.589 
to three pieces of bone meal to fully
grow<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.080> crop<00:00:28.439> so<00:00:29.099> obviously<00:00:29.880> my<00:00:30.210> previous

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
grow a crop so obviously my previous

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.330 
grow a crop so obviously my previous
program<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.080> no<00:00:31.199> longer<00:00:31.410> working<00:00:31.619> but<00:00:32.160> this

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
program is no longer working but this

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.170 
program is no longer working but this
one<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:32.790> as<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.630> can<00:00:33.780> see<00:00:34.130> so<00:00:35.130> um<00:00:35.550> minor

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
one is as you can see so um minor

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.869 
one is as you can see so um minor
changes<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.840> program<00:00:37.070> still<00:00:38.070> getting<00:00:38.670> the

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
changes to the program still getting the

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.900 
changes to the program still getting the
bone<00:00:39.120> meal<00:00:39.329> from<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:40.320> chest<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:41.309> their<00:00:41.550> right

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
bone meal from the chest to their right

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.709 
bone meal from the chest to their right
and<00:00:42.770> putting<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.890> output<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.579> button<00:00:45.480> as

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
and putting the output on the button as

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.490 
and putting the output on the button as
you<00:00:45.870> can<00:00:45.989> see<00:00:46.230> here<00:00:46.530> um<00:00:47.840> yeah<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.170> that's

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500

like to show you how to do one of these
things<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.329> how<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.510> set<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.780> up<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.079> install

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
things and how to set it up and install

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.869 
things and how to set it up and install
it<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.559> all<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.129> let<00:00:59.370> me<00:00:59.460> get<00:00:59.609> one<00:00:59.789> of

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
it in all that so let me get one of

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.100 
it in all that so let me get one of
these<00:01:00.230> one<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.350> these<00:01:02.210> tend<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.270> get<00:01:03.420> one<00:01:03.899> of

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
these one of these tend to get one of

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.300 
these one of these tend to get one of
those<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:05.119> one<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.210> these<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.659> then<00:01:07.159> we<00:01:08.159> need

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
those and one of these and then we need

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.010 
those and one of these and then we need
is<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> ho<00:01:09.110> ho<00:01:10.110> ho<00:01:10.350> there<00:01:11.040> we<00:01:11.130> go<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.960> there<00:01:12.960> we

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
is a ho ho ho there we go and there we

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.620 
is a ho ho ho there we go and there we
go<00:01:13.170> alright<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.810> dig<00:01:15.810> two<00:01:15.930> blocks<00:01:16.200> chest

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
go alright so dig two blocks chest

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.560 
go alright so dig two blocks chest
mining<00:01:18.630> turtle<00:01:19.700> one<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.790> those

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
mining turtle one of those

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.849 
mining turtle one of those
they're<00:01:23.619> there<00:01:24.619> and<00:01:25.810> done<00:01:26.810> so<00:01:27.500> that's<00:01:27.590> pretty

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:27.859 
they're there and done so that's pretty

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:29.529 
they're there and done so that's pretty
much<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.070> setup<00:01:28.490> that<00:01:28.939> you<00:01:29.030> need<00:01:29.179> for<00:01:29.420> each

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
much the setup that you need for each

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:31.209 
much the setup that you need for each
turtle<00:01:29.990> and<00:01:30.170> you<00:01:30.289> can<00:01:30.409> see<00:01:30.560> you<00:01:30.619> can<00:01:30.770> stack<00:01:31.039> him

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:31.219 
turtle and you can see you can stack him

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:33.340 
turtle and you can see you can stack him
like<00:01:31.369> that<00:01:31.549> and<00:01:32.329> with<00:01:32.569> different<00:01:32.750> crops<00:01:33.170> even

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
like that and with different crops even

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.569 
like that and with different crops even
it's<00:01:33.799> very<00:01:34.369> very<00:01:34.969> efficient<00:01:35.450> all<00:01:36.020> right<00:01:36.229> so

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
it's very very efficient all right so

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:39.309 
it's very very efficient all right so
this<00:01:37.579> does<00:01:37.939> require<00:01:38.119> that<00:01:38.659> you<00:01:38.750> have<00:01:38.929> like<00:01:39.140> an

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
this does require that you have like an

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:41.529 
this does require that you have like an
infinite<00:01:39.860> amount<00:01:39.920> of<00:01:40.130> bone<00:01:40.219> meal<00:01:40.490> like<00:01:41.329> you

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
infinite amount of bone meal like you

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:42.999 
infinite amount of bone meal like you
the<00:01:41.810> turtles<00:01:42.170> will<00:01:42.289> still<00:01:42.469> run<00:01:42.649> even<00:01:42.979> though

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
the turtles will still run even though

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.059 
the turtles will still run even though
you<00:01:43.130> don't<00:01:43.280> have<00:01:43.459> any<00:01:43.610> bone<00:01:43.819> meal<00:01:44.000> but<00:01:45.069> why

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:46.069 
you don't have any bone meal but why

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:47.410 
you don't have any bone meal but why
have<00:01:46.369> them<00:01:46.490> running<00:01:46.759> if<00:01:46.969> they're<00:01:47.119> not<00:01:47.270> doing

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
have them running if they're not doing

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.809 
have them running if they're not doing
anything<00:01:47.719> right<00:01:48.079> so<00:01:48.799> make<00:01:49.280> sure<00:01:49.310> you<00:01:49.640> have<00:01:49.789> a

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819 
anything right so make sure you have a

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:51.249 
anything right so make sure you have a
skeleton<00:01:50.240> farm<00:01:50.450> or<00:01:50.569> something<00:01:50.600> where<00:01:51.049> you<00:01:51.140> can

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
skeleton farm or something where you can

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.949 
skeleton farm or something where you can
get<00:01:51.409> a<00:01:51.469> lot<00:01:51.799> about<00:01:51.979> male<00:01:52.479> all<00:01:53.479> right<00:01:53.630> so<00:01:53.899> to

00:01:53.949 --> 00:01:53.959 
get a lot about male all right so to

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:55.449 
get a lot about male all right so to
install<00:01:54.289> the<00:01:54.530> program<00:01:54.860> what<00:01:55.069> you<00:01:55.130> need<00:01:55.310> is

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:55.459 
install the program what you need is
