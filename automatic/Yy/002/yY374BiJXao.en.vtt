the<00:00:34.559> fly<00:00:34.950> bar<00:00:35.190> paddles<00:00:35.730> now<00:00:37.640> depending<00:00:38.640> on

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
the fly bar paddles now depending on

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.530 
the fly bar paddles now depending on
your<00:00:38.760> model<00:00:40.640> they'll<00:00:41.640> attach<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.180> different

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
your model they'll attach in different

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.000 
your model they'll attach in different
ways<00:00:42.809> but<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.140> really<00:00:43.620> want<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.829> make<00:00:43.980> sure

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
ways but you really want to make sure

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.680 
ways but you really want to make sure
that<00:00:44.309> you're<00:00:44.489> holding<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:45.440> shaft<00:00:46.640> securely

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
that you're holding this shaft securely

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.299 
that you're holding this shaft securely
especially<00:00:48.690> if<00:00:48.780> these<00:00:48.930> screw<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.739> which<00:00:50.100> I

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
especially if these screw on which I

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.389 
especially if these screw on which I
think<00:00:50.550> probably<00:00:50.789> most<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.360> them<00:00:51.510> do<00:00:51.750> now<00:00:52.559> just

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
think probably most of them do now just

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.029 
think probably most of them do now just
like<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.670> length<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.449> fly<00:00:54.690> bar<00:00:54.989> we<00:00:55.800> want

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
like the length of the fly bar we want

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.430 
like the length of the fly bar we want
to<00:00:56.129> verify<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:57.270> we<00:00:57.449> have<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.660> same<00:00:57.960> distance

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
to verify that we have the same distance

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.930 
to verify that we have the same distance
on<00:01:00.260> both<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.620> fly<00:01:01.859> bar<00:01:02.129> paddles<00:01:02.640> on<00:01:02.879> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
on both of the fly bar paddles on the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.490 
on both of the fly bar paddles on the
fly<00:01:03.449> bar<00:01:05.689> you<00:01:06.689> want<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.930> be<00:01:06.990> really<00:01:07.290> careful

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
fly bar you want to be really careful

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.530 
fly bar you want to be really careful
this<00:01:07.920> part<00:01:08.189> it's<00:01:08.369> absolutely<00:01:08.970> imperative

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
this part it's absolutely imperative

this part it's absolutely imperative
that<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.619> do<00:01:10.920> not<00:01:11.159> bend<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:11.700> fly<00:01:11.909> bar<00:01:12.150> if

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
that you do not bend this fly bar if

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.480 
that you do not bend this fly bar if
this<00:01:12.510> fly<00:01:12.720> bar<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.080> bent<00:01:13.409> you're<00:01:14.070> gonna<00:01:14.189> have

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
this fly bar is bent you're gonna have

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.870 
this fly bar is bent you're gonna have
all<00:01:14.909> kinds<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.780> flight<00:01:16.080> issues<00:01:16.640> okay<00:01:17.640> it's

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
all kinds of flight issues okay it's

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.109 
all kinds of flight issues okay it's
extremely<00:01:18.869> important<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:20.640> fly<00:01:20.880> bar

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
extremely important that the fly bar

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.170 
extremely important that the fly bar
paddle<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:21.930> part<00:01:22.229> here<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.619> this<00:01:23.280> fly<00:01:23.939> bar

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
paddle this part here and this fly bar

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.230 
paddle this part here and this fly bar
assembly<00:01:24.630> cross<00:01:24.990> piece<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.430> sight<00:01:26.850> down

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
assembly cross piece that you sight down

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.899 
assembly cross piece that you sight down
these<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.409> can<00:01:28.590> see<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.460> paddle

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
these and you can see that the paddle

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.510 
these and you can see that the paddle
and<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.210> cross<00:01:30.479> piece<00:01:30.810> are<00:01:31.140> level<00:01:31.829> that's

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
and that cross piece are level that's

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.940 
and that cross piece are level that's
extremely<00:01:33.150> important<00:01:33.810> if<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.290> tilted<00:01:34.740> up

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
extremely important if this is tilted up

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.390 
extremely important if this is tilted up
or<00:01:35.130> down<00:01:35.280> you're<00:01:35.939> gonna<00:01:36.030> have<00:01:36.270> some<00:01:36.479> problems

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
okay now I am hooking up the final two

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.539 
okay now I am hooking up the final two
ball<00:01:44.850> links<00:01:45.409> to<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.560> pinch<00:01:46.799> can<00:01:47.070> pitch

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
ball links to the pinch can pitch

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.310 
ball links to the pinch can pitch
control<00:01:48.119> arms<00:01:48.540> from<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.500> swash<00:01:49.860> plate<00:01:50.100> here

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
control arms from the swash plate here

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:59.120 
control arms from the swash plate here
and<00:01:55.430> that<00:01:56.600> will<00:01:57.600> complete<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.380> assembly<00:01:58.740> of

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
and that will complete the assembly of

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.819 
and that will complete the assembly of
the<00:01:59.219> rotor<00:02:00.060> head<00:02:00.329> now<00:02:00.869> what<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.439> want<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.710> do
