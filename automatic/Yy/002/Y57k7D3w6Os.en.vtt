00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.550
 And there, guys, beauty rafael here and play. 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.059
 with you more close to the play 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.559
 feedback company 2 and face this game I 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.900
 I have to play with him once in a while 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.090
 the guy is having a lot of fun and I 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.070
 I thought it was good to buy 2 today a good 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.750
 out for you or me as well as 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.550
 I do not want to play well at the end of three 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.960
 Because of course who's playing for 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.580
 front have a good time 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.890
 for example I'm playing more than one 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.349
 year was 3 there are moments that we are 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.239
 in order to play another game and generally 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.890
 my choice of game for when I 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.840
 I want to leave the neighborhood of 3 is well 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.969
 meet two doctors and two for me 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.800
 still one of the best if not the best 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.570
 in my opinion I really like to play 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.149
 I'm not much of a fan of him. 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.329
 I think he's very good in terms of 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.160
 action in terms of sealing the way you 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.260
 wants to play classic you want to play you 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.270
 You can have some nice game missile here. 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.949
 as a player and when this legal way 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.399
 health of another way it's there 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.039
 My very cool, I like it a lot, man. 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.449
 So this is usually my game that 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.519
 When I do not want to play the video of your 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.070
 I leap at him and I'm going to throw him away 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.420
 in a while then the guy if you 're a guy 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.850
 who plays at the end of three to a good time 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.159
 I recommend you and this game to 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.270
 you test he buys it too 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.090
 AntÃ³nio Martinho 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.070
 you can avail him there asked 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.540
 You're going to play a lot. It 's hard to start. 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.790
 very hard, I will not lie, I will not say that 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.979
 it's easy to play because it 's not 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.420
 played very complicated at first you 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.590
 people are going to die enough to start 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.470
 play well 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.290
 So dude, patience if you buy the 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.909
 game would be difficult at first but not only 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.060
 about killing yourself using here I want this 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.360
 map here is a very very good show map 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.390
 this map is the cultural map or the map 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.979
 of snow is one of the things that almost 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.000
 has number was three only has a map 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:54.270
 that el oro mon has this map 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.030
 here it is very show because if you 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.049
 want to play the only infantry map this 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.180
 map that is ideal 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.299
 this map has no vehicle of the type 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.710
 tauÃ¡ tank already has a cable book only that 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.009
 it's actually a car in the middle that 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.660
 random because this case has nothing 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.250
 in a truck truck who knows what 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.959
 these trucks take what drives the 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.650
 soldiers and then I have to be 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.870
 stopped 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.459
 only he's no good at all, he can 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.099
 Hurry up and you're alone for us. 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.140
 pretty on the map to be on this map here 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.010
 so almost no one uses it and clean lines 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.269
 anything 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.760
 the only thing you can do is 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.610
 truck bomb but I do not know there is easy to be 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.349
 also built this game here 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.019
 this map here as you are speaking is a 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.269
 map and this map that is 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.069
 available for rush ill being mode 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.650
 you have to plant 2011 is the 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.079
 advance and I have a lot of fun 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.090
 playing topped up so you have 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.620
 some of the routes you can take 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.120
 plant 2011 such 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.620
 it is not a straight path for you 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.769
 planting pumps have several locations that 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.180
 you can you can over the mountain 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.700
 by the area you look is a bastard 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.879
 as the old you can by area 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.470
 from the mountain to where you practically 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.639
 leave the map you can chase after 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.560
 a house that has 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:06.180
 and then you can rule for the team and 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.250
 try to get out there get the bombs that 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.280
 she has many options of paths then 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.629
 it's really cool that many maps streak 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.849
 the map offers quite enough 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.189
 options also though you 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.440
 Can not you sell in play like this? 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:21.569
 can you imagine that you can only 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.129
 come in front was Spanish not you 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.799
 there are several path options that I 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.930
 I really think we're the ones who like this 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.400
 map of henrique for me is a 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.980
 of the things that our selection is not 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.680
 very fan because it is a map more than 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.810
 the pictures then I'll always fall from 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.430
 close the cases and when you know I 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.739
 I really like and asked 'here' 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:45.120
 But when the Wii game with I like 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:48.569
 to play near comes close because it is a 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.239
 shot to kill you and if you look 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.280
 far as the guy is two so far 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.690
 children an uncle at the mall but I want 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.829
 came to fix a chest and did not 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.979
 I have any place I 've trained the most 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:02.190
 with the bullet only he knows that a galley 

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:04.019
 It makes a lot of people stop and I just 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.139
 pass a medical pace behind me 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:10.739
 hunting and every field that happened was 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:15.269
 The stab happens then happens like 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:17.190
 is saying a close-up shot of a 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.019
 far or two kicks from afar is the 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.209
 esn perak balancing number was 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.219
 said 22 and I think it works 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.870
 it was because it made it easy and 

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:26.150
 with an extremely useful class when 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.850
 you go 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.380
 tea with your team so that's why 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.810
 I really like to play, I'm just 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.220
 very big fan and some things that have 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.960
 happened now when I'm playing it 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.110
 What a lot of people playing Gustavo. 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:43.389
 which is to say that the esmal or rpg of my 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:45.169
 son of three and beauty because that 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.910
 good part players are starting 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.039
 now the players then that are Joseph 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.020
 lewgoy are new players so he is 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:52.400
 so I'm not used to the last 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.410
 are using these things a lot 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.380
 but it 's cool, I recommend it to everyone 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:00.020
 buy a game that will understand 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.190
 you do a lot but a lot of time then 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.199
 Guys, I hope you liked it. 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.539

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:12.910

 a hug to everyone even more and said is
