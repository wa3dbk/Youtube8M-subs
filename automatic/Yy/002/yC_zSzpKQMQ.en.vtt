00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello and thank you for watching a drop 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.180
 in the pond the big companies 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.950
 producers of triple play are not 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.200
 more able to make video games 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.210
 of exception these games that we remember 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.429
 even ten years after so many minutes 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.590
 you will be convinced we live in 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.150
 a growth company an ideology 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.310
 chosen by most democracies 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.170
 today that wants tomorrow to be more 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.180
 powerful than today the big 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.590
 companies require every year a 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.330
 profitability superior to the year 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.039
 previous turnover 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.840
 identical to the year before and so 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.189
 considered a failure and cause 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.480
 immediately sanctions 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.829
 whether by the loss of a 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.340
 investor or by cuts 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.920
 budgetary 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.629
 this ideology shape our way 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.610
 to think tells us that the good 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.140
 business and whoever gets bigger the 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.640
 citizen expects his comfort 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.230
 cross and that technologies 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.820
 they use on a daily basis either 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.190
 more and more performant over the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.420
 time our society is not looking for the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.559
 balanced point as in a 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.480
 natural ecosystem 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.250
 she is looking for the expansion point as 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.760
 in an empire for a big 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.020
 business 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.640
 every new year is so 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.590
 the opportunity to reissue this 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.300
 message congratulations for the year you have 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.189
 achieved our goals for the new 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.740
 year are at our fingertips redoubling 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.340
 of efforts applied to large publishers of 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.020
 video games 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.909
 this ideology of growth has 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.500
 resulted in several strategies for 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.689
 gains that all had consequences 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.360
 for the intended player a wider audience 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.890
 leave to automate the gameplay sell 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.060
 additional content leaves to 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.250
 amputate the main game 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.990
 years passing and since it had to 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.119
 add growth to growth 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.650
 from the previous year the increase of 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.780
 the frequency of publication of the franchises 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.240
 the most profitable ones stood out as a 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.040
 strategy over face the frequency of 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.960
 output of large productions the duration 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.850
 visibility of a security has been reduced 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.290
 stores have accelerated the rotation 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.420
 the highlighted game and 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.130
 commentators move quickly to other 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.470
 thing in order to test the next big 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.140
 output of what to make video game a 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.939
 fashion object a title has so little of 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.579
 time to shine and hope 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.750
 afford the desired profitability the pre 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.820
 orders then become an issue 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.380
 strategic must because the game 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.590
 loses its mass visibility a few 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.600
 weeks only after its release 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.359
 nothing should spoil the famous one 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.079
 hence the massive recourse to the mda agreement of 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:08.420
 non disclosure 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.670
 to survive in this system a game 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.010
 triple a is now design and for in 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.510
 last one year of teasing six months of meadow 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.989
 orders and only two months from 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.269
 sale 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.099
 once past this window of fire the 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.959
 game will quickly return to deflation 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.030
 only way to scratch a visibility 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.810
 now constrained by the game status 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.879
 past of fashion 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.560
 the player meanwhile is caught in this 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.540
 outflow whirlwind and his behavior 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.400
 maintenance the systemic problem 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.709
 the video game now forced fashion 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.630
 now accessible in abundance thanks 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.170
 to deflation France loses its 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.030
 superb 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.130
 he's desacralized is relegated to the rank 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.620
 consumables once valuables 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.750
 rare and deserving attention prolong 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.090
 video games are now buying at 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.250
 high frequency or in batches of 5 then 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.079
 dismissed at the least annoyance the 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.819
 butterfly player connects conquests 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:55.310
 videogame without a future with a 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.840
 Many volatile requirement 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.970
 consumers are constantly 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.950
 connected to the market barely a new 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.510
 bought game to discover who are buying them 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.069
 in parallel with other games on sale 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.690
 for later and maintain a 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.400
 important watch on outings to 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.139
 come what drives them to preorder 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.030
 so their attention is quickly 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:12.620
 diverted to another potential 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.239
 of buying the youngsters hold them back 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.069
 longer but as they have 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.150
 other things flew over this is from 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.519
 anyway plus those who wait for them 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.680
 of the game consequence of these consumers 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.599
 always available in 2015 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.579
 replayability and alternative endings 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.389
 are no longer a priority for 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.220
 market leaders 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:30.470
 make legendary games becomes 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.840
 financially counterproductive in a 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.280
 world where customers and influencers do not 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.109
 maintain more lasting attention 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.930
 on an exit he then returns to 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.430
 players to regulate a market 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.989
 do this there is good practice 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.519
 who would like each new 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.079
 acquiring a title the player 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.060
 away from the market during the period 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.510
 necessary for full experimentation 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.310
 Artwork 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.109
 for example if I buy assassin's 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.730
 creed unions it i become so 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.290
 unavailable as a buyer on 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.150
 time well explored the game and I do not 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.099
 so can not get started in black ops 3 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.409
 on its release or make the steam sales 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.639
 nor think about pre-ordering another title 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:02.920
 nor play the big productions 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:04.739
 free which piled up offered each 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.329
 months with the live subscription 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.340
 this good practice therefore means that 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:11.470
 the player are turning away from the market 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.150
 marketplace or store the time to 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.099
 play with his purchase a time 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.479
 unavailability which will oblige 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.459
 competing securities to position themselves 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.989
 as sustainable works to succeed at 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.940
 seduce you once your game of 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.280
 moment finish the natural selection 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.810
 will then value the securities sufficiently 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.550
 rich to attract the attention of 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.000
 players even once the haye can 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.919
 drop 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.259
 remember a time not so 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.150
 far away where blockbusters stay on 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:36.120
 stalls during the entire life of the 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.530
 console this downtime 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.810
 allows to get in touch with his 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.580
 play and restores emotional value to 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.710
 this product of great consumption 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.539
 because the pleasure is not to be 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.789
 enjoyment this case of limits of 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:51.190
 scarcity of value of the object 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:53.800
 a value that leads to commitment and 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.030
 to perseverance towards his game that he 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.780
 must recognize that nintendo the 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.310
 understand very well 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.260
 not only the output rate is 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.090
 slow but above all it does not devalue 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.740
 often these games the nintendo games like 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.330
 Mario kart or smash bros keep 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.250
 long their monetary value and 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.930
 remain highlighted in the long term 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.580
 nintendo knows that a player who 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.710
 do not like nintendo games has nothing to 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.750
 do it on you and that is why 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.060
 wiiu player is here because he likes them 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.470
 nintendo games for this love to last 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.880
 firm understood that it must 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.650
 maintain the feeling that their games 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.630
 are precious blood to denigrate them by a 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.220
 rapid deflation contrary to what 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.930
 wish this industry the video game 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.970
 has nothing to gain by becoming a 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.830
 merchandise to accumulate in large numbers 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.539
 it is up to us not to accept 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.550
 that is worth this growth that the big 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:35.500
 publishers orders itself 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.840
 make available sustainably for a 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.479
 game both finish these games as one 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.770
 finish a book is surrender 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:42.300
 unavailable 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.039
 just for the market 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.960
 decrease of our purchases which in 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:48.060
 will arise will force these great 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.099
 companies compensated by producing 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.020
 fewer titles but capable titles 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:53.789
 to sell the games longer 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.169
 video can no longer rely on 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:57.629
 the very short-term fashion effect for 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:06:00.720
 make a profit will gain in ambition 

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:02.490
 so is in recognition a little player 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.900
 attentive who passes frantically from a 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.490
 game to another that's what the 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.830
 industrialists expect us to 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:11.210
 maintain their growth the good 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.210
 practice disappoint them
