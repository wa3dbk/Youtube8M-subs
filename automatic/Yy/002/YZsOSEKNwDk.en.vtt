00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:08.760
 hello friends i want you 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.300
 greet on the channel 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.690
 bl-10 you won't believe i got such 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.300
 Finally t28 concept and today I want 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:23.160
 a little could not say and show 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:27.060
 beating the most important advantage to my 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:31.859
 look at this fri saudi seventh level this 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:35.610
 her forehead is more precise his booking as much as 203 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:40.219
 millimeter also this one has signed 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:45.870
 a good tool with a break 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:47.149
 181 and alpha strike a320 not even a fight by us 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.469
 shells 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:54.899
 still it remains american 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:58.559
 PT-ACS T28 she chose all the disadvantages of its 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:03.300
 relatives this slowness big 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:07.049
 dimensions are 960 horsepower 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.830
 forces to lay 70 tons is not very 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.840
 much therefore 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.700
 you yourself will notice when playing hume 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.810
 slow speed duration 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.720
 reversal slow acceleration though up 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.940
 thirty kilometers per hour it accelerates 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.490
 in about 5 seconds but no longer 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.250
 takes ovda i forgot to say about the most 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.760
 huge minus is these two here 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.550
 the big barrels on the sides that us 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:37.390
 punch who wants when he wants where 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:40.600
 they want to hide from both sides not 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.570
 so easy but we have to do it 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.770
 I'll show you how to get started in battles 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.770
 I'll make tea 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.830
 what listen did you see yourself she 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.979
 devil suffers from like faith in 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:05.180
 principle like any tank getting into the peen 

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:08.430
 8m level we looked good 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:10.860
 vytankovyvat a lot of damage attracting 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:13.380
 attention draws attention away from 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:16.020
 other tanks that at this time could 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:19.500
 selling the flank kill all my 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:22.410
 opponents not every time all the same from 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:25.229
 randomly we ourselves put not so much 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.740
 damage so i think this task is necessary 

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:29.550
 to put 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:31.260
 our other ally and to do the most 

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:33.720
 the main attraction is not 

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.310
 on myself i can say honestly this is not 

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:38.670
 bad tank for 7 

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:42.780
 he is even very cool and that his weapon 

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:45.570
 can be compared with ore at iso 1 y 

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:49.020
 which 175 penetration 

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:52.860
 and we have 181 alpha strike we have less 

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:55.140
 but reloading is faster therefore our damage 

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:57.930
 will be roughly comparable to his 

00:07:55.140 --> 00:08:00.780
 there is one huge plus in this signed 

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:02.550
 I just did not stick it out I got it on 

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:07.260
 a freebie how do you know for personal martial 

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:10.790
 tasks well then go ahead into battle all for now 

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.790
