00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
to get some mineral spirits what I can

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.090 
to get some mineral spirits what I can
do<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.570> I<00:02:12.690> can<00:02:12.890> dip<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.070> brush<00:02:14.250> in<00:02:14.580> there<00:02:14.790> and

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
get any of the excess off I also found

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.600 
get any of the excess off I also found
that<00:02:20.190> using<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.550> little<00:02:20.760> bit<00:02:20.880> of<00:02:20.940> steel<00:02:21.180> wool

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
that using a little bit of steel wool

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.340 
that using a little bit of steel wool
dipped<00:02:23.610> in<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.880> mineral<00:02:24.150> spirits<00:02:24.570> really

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
dipped in the mineral spirits really

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.350 
dipped in the mineral spirits really
helped<00:02:25.980> take<00:02:26.160> off<00:02:26.340> any<00:02:26.550> of<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.730> excess<00:02:27.120> that

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
helped take off any of the excess that

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.840 
helped take off any of the excess that
you<00:02:27.510> couldn't<00:02:27.840> reach<00:02:27.990> with<00:02:28.200> your<00:02:28.230> scraper<00:02:28.860> and

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
you couldn't reach with your scraper and

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.280 
you couldn't reach with your scraper and
because<00:02:30.180> there's<00:02:30.420> still<00:02:30.660> a<00:02:30.690> fair<00:02:30.990> amount<00:02:31.230> of

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
because there's still a fair amount of

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.470 
because there's still a fair amount of
paint<00:02:31.590> in<00:02:31.830> here<00:02:32.280> I'm<00:02:32.850> going<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.090> go<00:02:33.180> ahead<00:02:33.270> and

paint in here I'm going to go ahead and

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.110 
paint in here I'm going to go ahead and
add<00:02:33.600> some<00:02:33.930> more<00:02:33.959> stripper<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:35.100> hopefully<00:02:35.970> be

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
just one more scraping it's been another

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.360 
just one more scraping it's been another
about<00:02:42.959> 15<00:02:43.440> minutes<00:02:43.800> and<00:02:43.950> I'm<00:02:44.010> gonna<00:02:44.100> go<00:02:44.280> ahead

of<00:02:49.740> the<00:02:49.800> paint<00:02:50.010> off<00:02:50.100> and<00:02:51.000> my<00:02:51.209> experience<00:02:51.870> is

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
of the paint off and my experience is

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.400 
of the paint off and my experience is
that<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:52.530> will<00:02:52.820> never<00:02:53.820> be<00:02:53.970> able<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.240> get<00:02:54.420> every

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
single piece of paint off that's okay

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.840 
single piece of paint off that's okay
you<00:02:58.680> just<00:02:58.740> wanna<00:02:58.980> get<00:02:59.070> as<00:02:59.190> much<00:02:59.340> as<00:02:59.550> you<00:02:59.580> can

is<00:05:20.090> that<00:05:20.120> it's<00:05:20.540> actually<00:05:20.750> stainable<00:05:21.440> and

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
is that it's actually stainable and

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.100 
is that it's actually stainable and
paintable<00:05:22.160> so<00:05:22.640> that<00:05:23.570> makes<00:05:23.750> it<00:05:23.900> really

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110
