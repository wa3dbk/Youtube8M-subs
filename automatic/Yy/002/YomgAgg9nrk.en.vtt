00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.410 
because for me the ones that I have
they're<00:03:30.250> nice<00:03:30.459> and<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.940> colors<00:03:31.120> are

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
they're nice and the colors are

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.190 
they're nice and the colors are
beautiful<00:03:33.299> but<00:03:34.299> for<00:03:34.540> me<00:03:34.630> the<00:03:34.750> formulas<00:03:35.170> a

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
beautiful but for me the formulas a

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
beautiful but for me the formulas a
little<00:03:35.380> bit<00:03:35.470> more<00:03:35.590> chalky<00:03:35.890> than<00:03:36.130> the

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
little bit more chalky than the

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.560 
little bit more chalky than the
covergirl<00:03:36.519> and<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:36.910> covergirl<00:03:37.209> of<00:03:37.420> that

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
covergirl and the covergirl of that

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.690 
covergirl and the covergirl of that
formula<00:03:37.870> is<00:03:38.109> not<00:03:38.260> nearly<00:03:38.530> as<00:03:38.680> smooth<00:03:39.070> as<00:03:39.370> like

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
formula is not nearly as smooth as like

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.640 
formula is not nearly as smooth as like
the<00:03:39.820> wet<00:03:39.970> and<00:03:40.120> wild<00:03:40.239> or<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:41.290> L'Oreal

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
the wet and wild or the L'Oreal

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.740 
the wet and wild or the L'Oreal
infallible<00:03:41.680> but<00:03:42.370> it's<00:03:42.609> nice<00:03:42.850> and<00:03:43.209> it<00:03:43.299> lasts<00:03:43.690> a

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
infallible but it's nice and it lasts a

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.300 
infallible but it's nice and it lasts a
long<00:03:43.840> time<00:03:44.109> it's<00:03:44.290> easy<00:03:44.440> to<00:03:44.590> blend<00:03:44.739> out<00:03:44.980> if<00:03:45.190> you

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
long time it's easy to blend out if you

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.970 
long time it's easy to blend out if you
can<00:03:45.459> kind<00:03:45.700> of<00:03:45.760> get<00:03:45.940> a<00:03:45.970> bunch<00:03:46.180> of<00:03:46.380> like<00:03:47.380> dust<00:03:47.680> to

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
can kind of get a bunch of like dust to

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.840 
can kind of get a bunch of like dust to
pick<00:03:48.130> up<00:03:48.310> as<00:03:48.489> weird<00:03:48.700> as<00:03:48.850> that<00:03:48.880> sounds<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:51.730> next

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
pick up as weird as that sounds the next

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.849 
pick up as weird as that sounds the next
one<00:03:52.090> is<00:03:52.209> a<00:03:52.239> Catrice<00:03:52.660> single<00:03:53.200> eye<00:03:53.290> shadow<00:03:53.590> in

one is a Catrice single eye shadow in

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.090 
one is a Catrice single eye shadow in
560<00:03:54.489> I<00:03:54.519> like<00:03:54.820> to<00:03:55.000> move<00:03:55.660> it<00:03:55.870> it's<00:03:56.739> supposed<00:03:56.859> to

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
560 I like to move it it's supposed to

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.430 
560 I like to move it it's supposed to
be<00:03:57.250> a<00:03:57.280> payoff<00:03:57.549> I<00:03:57.819> like<00:03:57.970> to<00:03:58.090> move<00:03:58.299> it<00:03:58.510> but<00:03:58.690> the

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
be a payoff I like to move it but the

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.309 
be a payoff I like to move it but the
word<00:03:59.590> mauve<00:03:59.890> move<00:04:00.600> never<00:04:01.600> sounds<00:04:01.959> like<00:04:02.079> move

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
word mauve move never sounds like move

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.770 
word mauve move never sounds like move
so<00:04:02.859> I<00:04:03.220> don't<00:04:03.640> know<00:04:03.700> about<00:04:03.790> that<00:04:04.060> I<00:04:04.209> love
