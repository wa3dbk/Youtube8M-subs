00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.460
 good and welcome to this new 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.040
 section that we inaugurate today a kind 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.450
 from the history corner of the wow a site 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.610
 where we will talk about the beginnings of the 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.380
 class and the one even delaware where 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.790
 lich king compared to the 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.670
 current expansions like a cataclysm 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.440
 pandaria that has changed that has 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.000
 eliminated that has been improved or worsened 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.859
 etc 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.960
 Obviously the typical disputed will not come 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.210
 flight from in times of troll survived 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.220
 maybe or anything 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.900
 we had a kind of mma and now 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.210
 we have another kind of different meme and 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.660
 different will be each thing when deciding 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.760
 if they were better or worse times 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.500
 this little introductory video is for 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.450
 comment on some issues that we will touch on 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.160
 the videos that will go out I hope with 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.630
 relative frequency 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.670
 For example, we will talk about the 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.739
 extinct forecasts to be able to access 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.239
 to bands like the need to have 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.190
 the amulet stack another occupy enter or 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.410
 nicks already with the teacher's key to 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.180
 to be able to enter the house although all these 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.310
 requirements are already eliminated from the game 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.710
 for the most part we will talk about the 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.020
 legendary weapons of what are how they 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.690
 they get what benefits they supposed in the 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.880
 epoch and others we will talk about the changes 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.220
 of class then we in the elimination of 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.990
 arrows or the hunter's 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.690
 epic weapons of level 60 like the 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.670
 anathema the elimination of re agents 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.350
 band for benefits or using 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.600
 particles of blindness of the rogues 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.700
 among many other things we will talk about 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.030
 the reuse of old material 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.850
 as the future reuse of full to evils 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.580
 colom before the instances of monastery 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.140
 Scarlet etcetera in short a bit 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.119
 everything so that people know a 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.220
 little of the egg story and see what 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.110
 what was there before and what there is now that 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.640
 new players know what it was like before 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.140
 the things that veteran players 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.370
 remember a little of your 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.530
 first times in the first 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.720
 curious data expansions of the same 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.729
 as I said then a corner of history 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.530
 of the egg the only problem maybe that 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.060
 I will find is to be able to recreate 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.260
 the entire content removed 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.970
 because most of the material 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.610
 extinct of the game we will do what we can 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.050
 and we will assemble what we can for example 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.759
 when we talk about the forecasts of 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.560
 band will be somewhat difficult to make a 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.810
 tracking when they are already deleted 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.120
 for the most part so I'll have to 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.680
 recreate it like for example how was 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.360
 scarlet monastery before and how is 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.500
 now or see the old hacker of his guru 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.959
 but ccoo is curious the less 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.610
 of all the articles and we go on the 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.380
 next video that may be from 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.500
 the forecasts or the weapons 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.360
 legendary adonix I do not know to begin 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.900
 with something interesting a greeting and not 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.900
 we see the next
