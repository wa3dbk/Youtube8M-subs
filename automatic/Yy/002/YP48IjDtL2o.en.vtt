 daily eating habits what 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.560
 we do every day at every 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.600

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.360
 four bad eating habits 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.980
 by month only this may seem 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.450
 slow on the short term but it takes 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.650
 see well that your motivation is all 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.000
 higher now because you

 have not started to deprive you 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.060
 the motivation also fluctuates depending 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.470
 your progress 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.269
 at the beginning of a diet we have 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.860
 always a lot of motivation we can 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.420
 control yourself and resist temptation 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.920
 much better than after 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.840
 weeks and months of deprivation 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.460
 by changing three or four bad 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.499
 habits per month you will already have 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.549
 changed about 20 bad habits 

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:17.469
 in six months 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:19.539
 the goal is to be the most regular 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:21.670
 possible and in 6 months your body will have 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:22.929
 already completely changed another point 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.729
 important thing to talk about is the 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:26.710
 sport your body expenses already 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.450
 a lot of energy every day without 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.700
 that you have to do sports it's this 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.259
 which is called basal metabolism it 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.729
 is the equivalent of two to three 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.319
 hours of intensive sport every day 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.240
 even if you stay completely 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:38.889
 lengthened and inactive for 24 hours 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.539
 so the sport will not change 

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:41.590
 great thing to slimming cover 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:42.670
 half an hour each morning it does not 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.560
 will not change much to your 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.679
 slimming it's not going to speed up 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.240
 your weight loss of many more 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:51.149
 important is to change his 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.409
 food 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.119
 in the beginning therefore makes mostly 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.979
 food efforts and sports 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.659
 then only if it motivates you 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.249
 and if that gives you energy 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.509
 because sport you have to admit it 

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:02.679
 it takes a lot of time 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.969
 free a time slot in his 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:05.770
 schedule is not always 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:09.190
 practical and above all it is very exhausting 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.929
 and tiring for the body use 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.120
 your motivation in priority for 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.230
 change your diet and decrease 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.250
 very gradually 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.800
 your daily energy intake 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.310
 to find out if you are progressing on the 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.930
 long term 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.580
 ask yourself once a week and 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.909
 compare your weight by one month on

 day after day also measure your 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.549
 progression by noting in embodied by 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.099

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.849
 try to reduce your consumption of 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.950
 sodas simply note each day the 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.569
 number of soda consumed the weight does not 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.799
 not everything sometimes we stack likewise when 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.720
 we continue to make efforts 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.459

 while saving his motivation for 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.430
 hold on in the long run not to 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.660
 run out and do not give up before 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.640
 to have achieved its objectives 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.319
 you have to use your energy and 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.670
 motivation first and foremost on what 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.010
 works ie on 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.540
 the diet before the sport finally he 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.220

 doing for example once a week 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:16.750
 if we really want to measure a 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.980
 progression every day so we can 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.690
 note every day the efforts that we have 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.139
