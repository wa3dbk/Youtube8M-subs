00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 I've thought about it a lot and it has come to the 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.500
 conclusion that the best I can 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.120
 offer to all those who in their 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.160
 day they entered my channel to learn to 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.630
 draw manga is to recommend to the 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.370
 five best channels that can be 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.710
 find on youtube to learn to 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.269
 draw in this top I value all that 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.640
 channel that teaches to draw in a way 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.949
 real thing that I can value very well for 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.390
 years of experience with drawing and 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.070
 besides that in the list there are two 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.320
 channels that although they do not teach to draw 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.990
 proper they offer a distinction 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.000
 of the most interesting thing though in this 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.260
 top I present the best channels you 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.399
 on your part you have to make a small 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.920
 effort in learning English 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.770
 indispensable and very valuable at the time of 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.149
 understand the explanations here do not 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.390
 there is an excuse that you can 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.399
 learn equally just by seeing it these 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.000
 are the five best channels for 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.250
 learn to draw 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.710
 in position number 5 we have scott 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.540
 robertson first and foremost 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.790
 tell you that these channels do not touch the 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.830
 manga style but at the end of the video you 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.960
 I will give the solution to it scott 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.580
 Robertson is the closest thing to having 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.190
 a professional partner of the drawing and 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.989
 of the design of funds machines and all 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.700
 class of futuristic vehicles and with a 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.770
 luxury of details of what would fit 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.630
 expect from a rare professional 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.310
 find a tutorial on your channel like 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.170
 I said he moves in a field 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.780
 professional and the videos are focused 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.700
 to teach the work despite that some 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.229
 that another video goes up and when that happens 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.509
 you have to be very alert and awake 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.070
 not to miss any detail but not 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.590
 are for their tutorials that is in this 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.479
 position but although it seems lie they are 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.880
 his videos where he teaches his works and 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.250
 his sketching books and especially the 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.289
 designs the bad as it is logical to 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.990
 devote entirely to another job is 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:40.780
 that upload very few videos with luck you 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.909
 you will find two or one video per month 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.520
 in position number 4 we have here 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.920
 will adapt in this position we will not have 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.750
 drawing tutorials proper and 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.240
 is already the last of the list from 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.450
 here the others will be fine 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.190
 who he is and what he does if he will adapt if in the 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.810
 previous we were with a channel 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.640
 professional but in physical media 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.280
 here we find a true 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.110
 master in the digital color videos and 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.390
 videos where you can see from scratch 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.069
 how it works with colors like it does 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.800
 the textures and everything that the 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.200
 illustration entails the illustrator has 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.519
 a good range of techniques routes shortcuts 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.010
 and tricks that you can learn 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.350
 directly from his videos the great 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.670
 is that in no time there is 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.790
 watch your videos as if they were 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.410
 tutorials but as demonstrations what 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.239
 true is that the usefulness of both this 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.130
 channel like that of scott robertson the 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.900
 you'll find once you've seen the 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.140
 other remaining positions that remain in 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.459
 this top what is said if will adapt has a 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.440
 handling of color and composition 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.670
 worthy of someone who has dedicated a 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.130
 whole life to drawing 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.430
 at number 3 we have a cg 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.920
 master academy this channel is not easy 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.989
 to see me explained the channel serves as 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.750
 promotion for themselves which 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.040
 they have another channel but I'm not paying 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.230
 saying that the purpose is that you 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.810
 go to the payment channel is more I think that 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.370
 is blocked for certain countries there 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.140
 than trying to squeeze the videos that 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.720
 go up in this channel because you can take it out 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.069
 much more than what seems only the video 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.190
 of introduction to the design of characters 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.319
 and creatures it 's great to see the work 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.050
 the evolution of ideas and how 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.730
 develops is the best they have 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.220
 the worst thing naturally is that it's about 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.380
 shows videos in general 30 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.239
 minutes that show the introduction to 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.160
 subject matter and that presumably 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.230
 I would find him he found out in the other 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.180
 channel in any way I choose the channel 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.040
 for the seriousness and the guidelines its 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.900
 The main goal is for you to learn 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.730
 otherwise it would not make sense that 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.269
 they would like to sell it on this channel 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.780
 you will find first discipline in the 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.940
 position number 2 we have pro ccoo 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.680
 now so if we start with the 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.069
 channels that will take your drawing to another 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.860
 level 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.440
 broco between videos of the timelapse type 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.810
 before called speed drawing have their 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.459
 whole tutorials covers a quantity 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.780
 of interesting topics that go further 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.910
 beyond the typical videos about 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.950
 anatomies talking for example about the 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.200
 gesture rigid outline lines 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.630
 Balanced and balanced positions and 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.190
 much more follows for the most start 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.920
 with these kinds of topics it can be something 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.300
 boring and heavy tedious for this guy 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.160
 of people can also find 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.110
 more focused tutorials for people 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.390
 started as the skeleton and the 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.040
 proportions the channel has an idea 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.470
 television program that is appreciated 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.780
 the mix between explanation and examples 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.820
 it is balanced somewhat long for those who 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.550
 look forward to the drawing but very 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.960
 useful for those who pay attention 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.460
 Another great point in favor is that the 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.680
 videos come with English subtitles 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.540
 put by himself what does it mean 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.060
 that at the time of translating you will have 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.740
 a faithful translation to the explanation 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.260
 something that with the other channels you will not be able 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.940
 find finally at the number stand 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.880
 one we have the person who does the 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.890
 difference 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.870
 with more or less a regularity of two 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.000
 videos per week upload artwork 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.490
 tutorials critical to jobs that 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.010
 they send highly interesting point and 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.300
 everything you can expect the bad is 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.460
 that although it is organized by 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.650
 playlists untidy 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.270
 a medley of videos in which he gives the 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.820
 impression of jumping into a full pool 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.670
 of tips ideas and techniques but without 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.830
 order if you create a channel to see each 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.810
 one of his videos without exception his 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.610
 direct and real explanations the 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.190
 useful tips and experience 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.780
 someone with a high level as it came 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.070
 saying what makes the difference is 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.020
 that if face also speaks of 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.360
 compositions of the illustration of 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.090
 rhythm of drawing personal style and 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.130
 so many interesting topics that again 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.810
 I advise to see your videos where you 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.360
 send drawings to correct them and 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.850
 the analyze are simply unpayable 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.010
 something as simple as seeing how it corrects a 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.320
 another person's error is of a utility 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.850
 incredible first because if you have the 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.220
 same mistake that he will have solved and 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:47.340
 second helps you in case you do not 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.170
 have to not commit it in the future as 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.969
 I said at the beginning of the video it's true 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.949
 that these channels do not touch the drawing 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:55.199
 in a direct way but to learn 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:57.389
 you do not have to do it in a way 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:59.069
 practice and correct should be first 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:00.479
 keep in mind the great tips and 

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:03.059
 techniques that they offer us in these 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:04.979
 channels and then take the road towards 

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:07.589
 manga style looking at other channels or 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:09.869
 buying certain books with that little 

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:12.149
 final help we will have a good fund as 

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:14.129
 cartoonists and a polished manga style and 

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:17.279
 Believe me that in that journey you have 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:19.349
 found your own style and nothing 

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:22.489
 more family subscribe give him the xxi has you 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:22.489
 liked and see you soon
