choose<00:00:20.310> this<00:00:20.689> because<00:00:21.689> it's<00:00:22.019> much<00:00:22.259> more

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
choose this because it's much more

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.859

addicting<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.390> even<00:00:24.390> though<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.539> has<00:00:24.599> the

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
addicting and even though it has the

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.029 
addicting and even though it has the
same<00:00:25.079> repetitious<00:00:25.739> gameplay<00:00:26.630> still<00:00:27.630> better

in<00:02:38.270> half<00:02:38.420> so<00:02:38.720> you<00:02:38.780> could<00:02:38.989> use<00:02:39.110> it<00:02:39.140> twice<00:02:39.410> in<00:02:39.830> a

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
up half you can already use it once

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.180 
up half you can already use it once
instead<00:02:44.900> of<00:02:44.959> getting<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:45.380> whole<00:02:45.530> circle<00:02:46.010> in

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190
