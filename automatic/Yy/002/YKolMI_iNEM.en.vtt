00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:12.510
 site always remains is that tolstoj and here yes 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.840
 events from the game will speed up not 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.610
 let me show you wait here indeed 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:22.170
 of random long as I show 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:25.830
 works against people or split i 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:32.579

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:40.590
 two is here let me explain if the thing is not here 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:42.960
 I know it ok if I 'm back here 10 months ago 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.189
 was on the other side went ahead of 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:50.270
 one I don't understand this I was ahead of 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:53.930
 all right 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:59.689
 how many others already that normally without 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:01.590
 my 12 normal hormones and now nice goal 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:05.830
 good boy 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.679
 very good ok here crushed minus 1 e 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.090
 the ball you see a lot presents and not where 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.220
 you can talk very easily 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.170
 this game i 'm playing with my hand 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.200
 because the microphone is that of the 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:24.280
 earmuffs also very difficult if any 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:28.959
 study with tomorrow can risk friend 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:31.349
 you look at the photos though if I could 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:36.120
 make a nice goal where I make another one 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.120
 if it comes, it comes if it does not come 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.290
 therefore they can also go up to the minute 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.930
 then I'll show you even slower 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:48.040
 but it is not that it will be so many 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.549
 let's see if he didn't come anyway 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:58.660
 however marked because then it is delayed 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:03:02.049
 quite buried at least two ifs 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.709
 motivates with the case of power type il 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:10.000
 power drink I know and the fireball 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:12.070
 good future because therefore stop go 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.709
 sir again as I said pine then 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.109
 because he will then pull straight 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:20.890
 move the word goes straight to the shadows 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:26.170
 They rotate it around if him if he expressed 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:28.870
 immediately fuck ok 22 we are anyway 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:33.730
 cost to sign because I have to marked with 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:36.070
 force where I pull try to risk a good one 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.650
 I shoot like that, but I refuse all the same 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.200
 here then he himself thought that 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.670
 threw the last shot but it is not 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:48.630
 what I wanted to do but always a 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:50.980
 beautiful veniero ii and parade no yes 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.799
 maybe he went to the pole 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:59.230
 I felt very badly about it 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:04:03.480
 of unexpected we know I invite you 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.480
