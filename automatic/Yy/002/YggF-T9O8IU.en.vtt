00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.110
 s type 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.110
 t-It is a slightly unknown number 

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:14.109
 Normal blockade 

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:16.379
 There is not much in x 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.029
 So there is a policy of denial that the rainy season has begun 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.359
 The employee is being offered 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.859
 This is 2 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.699
 It seems to be a little high putting 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.250
 Went to the whole 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.310

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.040
 The team's 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.580
 It will be the best 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.400
 It becomes Enrique form 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.520
 That styling as to the cause of this failure 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.400
 Was 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.030
 From around the face 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.220
 Especially muscle separation work to the front 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.550
 I will give an example 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.840
 Use as an effect of advancing the baseline 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.950
 From the day when 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.530
 To Ephron 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.470
 Other acquaintances do not need to re-screen 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.250
 To Yutaka President who was waiting because he is not a living person 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.510
 Connect and skip Angel Motes 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.510
 Prepare the hair 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.980
 I am a set force 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.550
 Someday it will be points 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.340
 Match with orange and base 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.900
 I want to keep the water moving on for 10 days 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.530
 For those who are styling
