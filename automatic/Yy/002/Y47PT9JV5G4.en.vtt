video it was really over-the-top

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.690 
video it was really over-the-top
lighting<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:07.589> people<00:00:07.799> seem<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.099> dislike<00:00:08.280> it

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
lighting and people seem to dislike it

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.610 
lighting and people seem to dislike it
now<00:00:09.120> they<00:00:09.269> didn't<00:00:09.450> really<00:00:09.570> bother<00:00:10.139> me<00:00:10.290> at<00:00:10.530> all

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
now they didn't really bother me at all

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.700 
now they didn't really bother me at all
because<00:00:10.980> it<00:00:11.099> is<00:00:11.130> an<00:00:11.370> opinion<00:00:11.849> based<00:00:12.480> video<00:00:12.929> but

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
because it is an opinion based video but

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.110 
because it is an opinion based video but
here<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.070> think<00:00:14.370> people<00:00:14.580> will<00:00:14.700> like<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:14.969> more

here I think people will like it more

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.000 
here I think people will like it more
because<00:00:15.269> it<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.599> realistic<00:00:15.990> writing<00:00:16.470> lighting

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
because it is realistic writing lighting

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.420

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
see the textures are so much more

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.980 
see the textures are so much more
defined<00:01:25.409> than<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.430> vanilla<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.509> bonfire

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
defined than the vanilla and the bonfire

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.109 
defined than the vanilla and the bonfire
everything<00:01:28.439> just<00:01:28.530> looks<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.070> much<00:01:29.340> sharper

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
than the vanilla graphics now it's just

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.980 
than the vanilla graphics now it's just
amazing<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:35.880> really<00:01:36.180> highly<00:01:36.390> suggest<00:01:36.810> if
