00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:13.759
 The professional repair system for Sanchez windshield make 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.699
 permanent repairs and air-proof on most windshields 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.119
 breaks of up to 1 and a quarter of an inch on the windshield shaped like 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.830
 Oxen or combined stars can be repaired in just minutes 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:33.059
 using this last system in technology repairs should be 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.280
 made in the shade or outside of direct sunlight when the windshield 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.680
 do not be hot high 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.760
 the optimum windshield temperature should be between 50 and 75 degrees for 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.030
 this year it is important that the flood does not come in contact with the surface 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.760
 of the termination 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.440
 hop inside the car because it can cause damage first I put the 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.290
 included thumbtack to clean any piece of loose glass in the 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.130
 damaged area then I put the towel wet in alcohol to clean around 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.420
 of the damaged area 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.049
 inside and outside it is suggested that a cloth be placed under the 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:17.100
 windshield to contain any resin that may fall during the 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.190
 preparation 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.300
 Remove the protective layer on one side of the adhesive disc with the tongue toward 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.280
 above or the hole of the decisive disc with the center of the damaged area 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.140
 Apply the disc to the windshield making sure the entire disc makes 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.420
 contact with the windshield looking at the disc from the inside of the car 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.970
 muvim verify that there are no air bubbles it is very important that the disc 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.210
 Have a clean seal free of air bubbles then remove the layer 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.480
 protector on the other side of the zibo palin disc and on the tongue of the 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:53.320
 pedestal 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.520
 with the tab of the simplification disc and firmly against the 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.640
 disc ensuring that there is a sony seal without air bubbles uncover it 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.180
 had the resin with the lid away from his face just like the surface 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.910
 Painted car portela tube nozzle roughly bubok out 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.019
 refined to open the same 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.049
 Place the nozzle inside the pedestal opening and carefully 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.489
 Tighten the tube to load the resins on the pedestal must apply 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.280
 approximately three quarters of the resin in interview 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.900
 clean any residue of the chubut apple police had keep it for use 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.370
 future make sure that time is pushed completely into the syringe 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.789
 Carefully press the syringe into the pedestal 

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:43.729
 the pedestal and the syringe must be tight 

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:48.259
 holding the syringe with one hand to the plunger with the other hand until you reach 

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:51.029
 to the second lowest brand 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:55.689
 after vettel who flew at the lowest mark pulling the mark in time what 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:59.969
 simpler system klerk compressor t so that the plunger is left 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:02.030
 secured on your site this goes 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.030
 play like a vacuum removing the air from the break leaving the resin without 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.570
 air bubbles let kurz rest 10 minutes these ten minutes allows 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.130
 the offices settle 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.739
 and move any air bubble before 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.439
 then you it's minutes maybe temporarily the pedestal syringe 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:23.870
 ensuring that he in 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.870
 bolus is kept at the lowest mark this allows air to enter the syringe 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.640
 keeping the plunger at the lowest mark carefully return to the syringe 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.220
 to the pedestal 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.820
 Indo the syringe on the pedestal as he did previously holding the syringe with 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.550
 a hand 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.020
 with the other hand you are the plunger until you get it out of the lowest mark and 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.730
 push delicately down I recorded the plunger in the mark more to the you are 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.770
 to the plunger working it in its place biden 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.390
 of standing for at least 20 minutes this forces the resin area damaged 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.060
 After 20 minutes remove the syringe from the pedestal with the help of a sheet of 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.720
 shaving detach the edges and then carefully the pedestal the disc has 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.059
 I decide from the difficult 

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:16.489
 It prevents any residue of the glass from removing the cap from the tube. 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.870
 resin and carefully apply some boot of presinal hole 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.419
 In the damaged area place the yellow curing band over the damaged area 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.610
 to contain the resin 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.639
 with the help of a razor blade and you air bubbles to when hoisting the 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.620
 cure band park the vehicle in direct sunlight 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.170
 and I see that rested for about 15 minutes the resin cures with ultraviolet calluses 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.500
 of natural sunlight on cloudy days requires at least one 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.370
 hour of duration once the resin rushed carefully remove the band 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:57.620
 cleaned by removing the windshield if the surface of the glass is uniform use 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.540
 a razor blade to remove any excess swollen teak from the 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.770
 windshield wipe the windshield again with the towel moistened 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.100
 alcohol in some cases it is possible that the preparation does not completely remove 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.729
 the imperfection notwithstanding the area will be repaired thus preventing the 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:22.919
 structure expand if you have any questions about this bit when I want another
