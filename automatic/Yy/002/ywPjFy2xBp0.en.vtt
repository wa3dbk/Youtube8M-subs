00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.790
 Hi, my name is marcelo, I'm advertising. 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.260
 my name is maria your mother of marcelo 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.790
 smile and tourism 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.439
 We live here in this apartment already 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:31.110
 It is in four years and always looking for 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.560
 Newsstand magazines is about 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.900
 decoration and in one of those searches I 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.400
 I found the magazine casa linda the hour that I 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.739
 I went to the magazine 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.510
 I saw that I had this promotion that could 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.120
 I showed him to Marcelo. 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.449
 I sent an email to participate in the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.590
 promotion to achieve this reform is 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.879
 because I knew it was something of mine. 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.940
 Mom wanted a lot like this a long time ago. 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.350
 good to our room she's seems to be missing 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.429
 something like that, right? 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.260
 a life a color she is very beige brown 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:06.620
 So something is missing like that in the 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.790
 sense of a colorful fairy 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.010
 comics that kind of heart thing 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.860
 there is nothing decorative so it's just the 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:19.500
 table the sofa one that is then the people 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.780
 is in the expectation in the city to see 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.509
 to start happening 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.579
 the changes and also to see if people 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.979
 will like what you will have or 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:31.500
 No, right? 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.990
 the pgr on operator and was responsible 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.729
 transformation in the living room of the 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.729
 a series of breakdowns in curitiba 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.659
 as the residents themselves are home 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.549
 I need more of it to deal with our 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.659
 transformation began with the change in 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.119
 thing is slow 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.969
 we believe in a bright green that is 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.310
 gentle but at the same time cheerful and 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:58.700
 clarin allows us to use 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.140
 various details 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.990
 besides the green chose the colors 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.630
 predominant red decoration 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.100
 blue and white including caresses 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.100
 I would call so much I wanted 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.470
 the graphite rap was replaced by a 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.450
 red retro counter that value 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.300
 aesthetics discussed and also quite 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.400
 utility in the drawers you can save 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.130
 for example the remote controls and 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.170
 dvd player doors 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.660
 the old curtain was replaced by a 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.510
 My good city hall tip well 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.570
 in contrast she put in the well-colored and 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:40.010
 inviting for the moments of rest 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:42.560
 and a good deal of boldness can yield 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.410
 surprising fine as is the case with 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.720
 The coolest paper I've found 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.030
 it was large enough to jump from 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.520
 3 meters long so I made a 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.110
 composition between peixoto bring you 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.560
 a conveyor counted in a 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:00.410
 supermarket with you we are 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.170
 quite something with Pratinha SEFAZ 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.350
 almost illustrations with photos of chile - 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.720
 acting now you registered post 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.780
 can add what you want 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.150
 the girl was the same size that changed 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.160
 It was the position we put her in 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.769
 is closer to the wall and 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.530
 we put the chairs only the sides 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.220
 so the room 's circulation space was 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.620
 enlarge 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.760
 already the room's special were the niches 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.250
 made of box of r df old area 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.410
 replaced by a good banker. 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.200
 smaller but that she stayed a little longer 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:39.010
 interesting to invest all wirelessly with 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.010
 this bass 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:46.290
 many of the details and colors in the 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.420
 Details I think you were perfect 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.790
 we have a lot to thank this 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.480
 house clean for this opportunity 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:57.480
 this dream realized the environment was 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.760
 wonderful, very cool, we're going 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.890

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.190
