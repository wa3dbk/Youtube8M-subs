00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.500
 let's see how to build a pyramid 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:08.730
 origami which is also used as 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.440
 gift box 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.639
 let's open the opening and see that 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.970
 it can be a pretty little box for 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:19.740
 keep items a gift box 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.230
 to pack gifts we take away 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.970
 the paper and let's pack the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.580
 our organic but the starting sheet 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.980
 we take a sheet of paper from 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.960
 gift cut into water and shape 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.540
 square with a cutter made a 12 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.710
 for 12 any other is fine 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:41.719
 dimension 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:44.700
 we explain it this way in half 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.500
 once cut in half we go to 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.850
 but draw lines for yours 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.890
 more clarity I will mark here one is 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.949
 precisely two in such a way that not 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.140
 loses orientation now here from the side 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.570
 opposite to point 1 I'll go get it 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.229
 this tip and the contribution to the center 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.119
 I stop when he came to have the line 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.119
 which leads me precisely to point 1 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.479
 when I'm exactly on that line 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:14.520
 trace the first arm is prolonged 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.560
 bending at this point I turn the 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.140
 sheet 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.500
 and we do the same thing for point 2 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.720
 then down with me so with this 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.270
 point the road with future I go to verse 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.259
 the center- center was even better if 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:35.539
 I had marked it several times that I go towards 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:37.130
 the center and when I'm with this tip 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:41.090
 towards the center this point here me 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:45.470
 firm and trace from in this line 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.299
 we trace the most by having 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.409
 traced the lines in this way 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:53.450
 we have this intersection here on this 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.330
 crossing of lines we are going to 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.250
 lower we also have in these three 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.250
 with kill these two lines those 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:05.539
 I recommend here when we are too well 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.819
 we ask now see here we already have one 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.619
 pyramid species na traced to this 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.989
 point let's take this folded part 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.459
 we finish it up we explain above 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.200
 so we explain again 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.269
 sheet in meda we will have another half line 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:23.060
 water later so we put ourselves like this 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:25.100
 we put ourselves so geometric and trace 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.060
 our line 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.890
 all the lines we mark the most 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.170
 it will be easier than the construction of the 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.790
 at this point we will trace other pyramids 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.500
 two lines like we did before 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.030
 that the fixed point will be this where 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.580
 double and what moves for example 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:45.560
 it's now where two is written let's go to 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.310
 to lower ourselves when we are in this 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.220
 situation 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.110
 let's take the point is traced ie with 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.690
 the tip towards the new center that 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.810
 we have traced is the starting point 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.440
 of which we go to this other side 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:04.240
 we lower there at this point point of 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.610
 departure will be 4 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.640
 ok point of arrival will be full to this 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.830
 point you trace your life 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.780
 I always feel in this embroidery of 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.610
 tracing it is stronger 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.560
 at this point we are going to open see 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.300
 what we have what we have 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.030
 we have all this this sheet with 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.280
 these plots exactly here where 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:31.410
 we have these interests bil'in and us there 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:33.709
 let's go to bend that we trace this 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.709
 line 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.400
 at this point all the geometric rest 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:53.150
 the same was to be done in such a way 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.150
 of the tip of an electric comment 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.020
 in this case I have to do this now 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.819
 we have this sachet this way 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:06.819
 I take this top and fold it 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:09.639
 I take the whole lower part of the shot 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:12.159
 up like this is the stone 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:14.079
 we go for a kind of packet within 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.470
 which we will go to once opened 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:19.780
 this businnes aqua we will go to insert 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.289
 this little closure 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.289
 we open 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.530
 that at this point we follow 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.230
 inside the right and the sachet is 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.040
 closed if we have a store 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.420
 costume jewelry 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.280
 this can be our sachet 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:38.060
 ready until it reaches the customer when 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.890
 we have to put our ring away 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.520
 we sold the sachet 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:45.020
 we put in and the magic we can 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.270
 build the bags ourselves when 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.650
 we also cost very small 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.720
 legal sachets instead in this way 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.380
 we will do something more appreciated by 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.870
 our customers and even more and 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.760
 economic I think you are in Japan 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.070
 of the shops that take on 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.770
 people just to pack up 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:07.130
 gifts because the art of drumming i 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.870
 gifts is something very welcome and 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.900
 create added value when you are 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.510
 at this point, go and think 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.980
 so the yes a little bit the angles in 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.480
 so that it remains alone but not 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.420
 it remains just by itself because you see 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.640
 that here is this this is a bit of a 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.600
 little bit open well we can create ourselves 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.910
 also the closure 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.500
 take a sheet here it is 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.090
 always football from gifts 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.500
 very cheap we cut it into 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.750
 square shape in this case we have 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.300
 made an 8x8 with cutter 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:39.770
 that guy and it takes a moment to the 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:42.980
 who have copy shops so bends to 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:46.700
 half once folded in half 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.480
 let's take we put on that we take 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.490
 so 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.550
 we take this really very little e 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:56.210
 we click so we created a 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.980
 origami where we have these two 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.320
 plaques books that can go 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.090
 thread in this point right now 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.250
 however they are very close so could 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.800
 be complicated then slip them there 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.340
 let's move away from the tips of these 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.890
 these two frappe so simply 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:14.420
 bending in this way we go to see 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.830
 calmly what in these parts thing 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.170
 we did we did a little 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.770
 triangulated and the tip is there 

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:23.450
 simply turned so far inside 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:26.240
 bending in this way the tips are 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:29.210
 more distant so it will be easier to do 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.700
 center then who positions above see 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:34.310
 this one tip comes in here explains in 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.270
 this way a tip will come in from 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.880
 this other made 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:42.360
 I do n't want to go in. Here it is, that's it 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.550
 the more prizes we are at the bottom 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.790
 successful 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.790
 anything 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:57.120
 we live we feel down 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.120
 while as you do n't want 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.389
 at this point instead of entering and we have 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.580
 had our church 

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:05.800
 so at this point we are done 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.720
 to our our box that can 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.430
 also be made of harder material 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.139
 and above the little box we can 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.730
 wanting to put a decoration on 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:15.370
 fiocchettino I did for example 

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:16.930
 this a two-tone underneath accato a game 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.520
 is cut out of playing cards but 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:21.040
 just to give you an idea then 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.930
 attach us any and circles 

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:26.889
 normal for decoration and we did 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:31.530
 our small elegant box for 

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:31.530
 pyramid origami gifts
