00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.310
 eduardo safe puntocom we are about 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.830
 to have breakfast 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:13.270
 it's seven in the morning and we're in 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:15.459
 the royal square on a neckline a hotel 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:18.220
 center of singapore I will see what they have 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:20.430
 at breakfast now that has a lot 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.430
 of things 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.620
 and I say are 7 in the morning from 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.620
 cookies 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.920
 here preparing something dirty where 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.500
 it disappears 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.230
 a lot of vegetables out there you have more here 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.379
 some cakes this seems to me that it's going to 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.379
 be 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.199
 we have not slept 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.180
 we got there a little bit of fruit 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.059
 fruit is awesome in singapore by 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.120
 course and yogurts that this moves with the 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:00.420
 fruit with yogurt 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.679
 and I say no we have not slept 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.679
 Because we have 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:10.140
 awesome and we arrived yesterday 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.689
 in the evening dinner juices and now they are the 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.090
 7 in the morning but that the equivalent 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.470
 of Spanish time are the one of the 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.390
 early morning with what is now when 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.290
 we should go to sleep and I do not know if we're going 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.630
 come to the meter 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.940
 to see if we help them we can sleep 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.770
 three or four hours these are the 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.290
 pickpockets that we have seen in other 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.180
 part to teach them that I 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.830
 I take the opportunity to check now that 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.400
 action there are many people then good 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.440
 Well, it did not bother much, look what 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.810
 silly and prettiest detail that is 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.400
 the pots are transparent by 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.190
 up so you can see what they are 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.490
 I think it's the first place where I see it 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:52.860
 and it makes so much sense so much that 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.390
 I do not understand why no one else does 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.890
 I what I always say what you have to 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.080
 do is go to the sites to copy the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:03.200
 things because if you have a hotel to 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.200
 to rest is to go out into the world to copy 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:14.120
 the kitchen is still this special 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:18.459
 although jcs and ribs to your liking 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.459
 have a fresh match to your liking 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.250
 clean 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.420
 and more you see of course maybe 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.420
 this is rice with something 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.220
 the star 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.870
 is something 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.600
 and rest a little 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.769
 but because he wants to rest in the 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.540
 shelf to read the straits times that 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.540
 the danger without love 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.260
 is the sunday times sad from the 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.390
 straits times and to be infinite without 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.890
 contributions from eduardo puntocom and we are 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.890
 jet lag and 2 to 1
