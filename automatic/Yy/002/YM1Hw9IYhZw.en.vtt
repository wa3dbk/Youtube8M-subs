00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:06.650 
all right so now we're gonna take it to

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.470 
all right so now we're gonna take it to
the<00:00:06.680> next<00:00:06.800> level<00:00:07.250> now<00:00:07.520> you've<00:00:08.029> been<00:00:08.149> panning

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.480 
the next level now you've been panning

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.640 
the next level now you've been panning
for<00:00:08.630> a<00:00:08.720> while<00:00:08.870> you've<00:00:09.200> got<00:00:09.230> the<00:00:09.410> knack<00:00:09.620> of

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.650 
for a while you've got the knack of

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.680 
for a while you've got the knack of
panning<00:00:09.980> down<00:00:10.010> but<00:00:10.610> you're<00:00:10.760> noticing<00:00:11.030> that

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
panning down but you're noticing that

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.210 
panning down but you're noticing that
takes<00:00:11.870> a<00:00:11.960> long<00:00:12.139> time<00:00:12.200> to<00:00:12.710> get<00:00:12.800> all<00:00:12.860> the<00:00:13.130> dirt

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:13.220 
takes a long time to get all the dirt

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.009 
takes a long time to get all the dirt
classified<00:00:13.670> into<00:00:13.850> your<00:00:13.940> pan<00:00:14.180> and<00:00:14.450> you<00:00:14.840> want<00:00:14.960> to

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:15.019 
classified into your pan and you want to

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:16.410 
classified into your pan and you want to
do<00:00:15.080> that<00:00:15.170> faster<00:00:15.530> so<00:00:15.800> that's<00:00:15.860> our<00:00:16.040> next<00:00:16.130> step

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
do that faster so that's our next step

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.990 
do that faster so that's our next step
you<00:00:17.420> can<00:00:17.570> use<00:00:17.720> this<00:00:17.960> this<00:00:18.320> is<00:00:18.500> a<00:00:18.560> nice<00:00:18.710> tool<00:00:19.000> but

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
you can use this this is a nice tool but

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.250 
you can use this this is a nice tool but
it's<00:00:20.210> a<00:00:20.270> little<00:00:20.449> on<00:00:20.510> the<00:00:20.600> slow<00:00:20.720> side<00:00:21.020> when

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
it's a little on the slow side when

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.480 
it's a little on the slow side when
doing<00:00:21.440> it<00:00:21.470> into<00:00:21.619> a<00:00:21.680> pan<00:00:21.920> because<00:00:22.130> you<00:00:22.250> can't

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
doing it into a pan because you can't

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.830 
doing it into a pan because you can't
really<00:00:22.640> walk<00:00:23.150> enough<00:00:23.390> dirt<00:00:23.570> through<00:00:23.720> at<00:00:23.810> a

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
really walk enough dirt through at a

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.150 
really walk enough dirt through at a
time<00:00:23.869> you<00:00:24.170> do<00:00:24.260> three<00:00:24.410> or<00:00:24.470> four<00:00:24.680> of<00:00:24.770> these<00:00:24.830> and

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
time you do three or four of these and

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.260 
time you do three or four of these and
you<00:00:25.220> go<00:00:25.310> back<00:00:25.460> to<00:00:25.580> panning<00:00:25.910> and<00:00:26.000> you<00:00:26.060> go<00:00:26.150> back

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
you go back to panning and you go back

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.130 
you go back to panning and you go back
to<00:00:26.300> this<00:00:26.510> and<00:00:26.720> so<00:00:26.840> on

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
to this and so on

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.720 
to this and so on
so<00:00:27.650> if<00:00:27.710> I<00:00:27.830> help<00:00:28.010> you<00:00:28.070> if<00:00:28.160> you<00:00:28.250> can<00:00:28.369> do<00:00:28.430> a<00:00:28.460> lot<00:00:28.699> of

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
so if I help you if you can do a lot of

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.099 
so if I help you if you can do a lot of
this<00:00:28.910> at<00:00:29.029> once<00:00:29.270> and<00:00:29.600> then<00:00:29.810> do<00:00:29.900> all<00:00:29.930> your

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
this at once and then do all your

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:31.390 
this at once and then do all your
panning<00:00:30.410> at<00:00:30.500> once<00:00:30.650> it'll<00:00:30.830> be<00:00:30.920> more<00:00:31.070> efficient

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
panning at once it'll be more efficient

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.520 
panning at once it'll be more efficient
they<00:00:32.210> take<00:00:32.390> a<00:00:32.419> five<00:00:32.599> gallon<00:00:32.720> bucket<00:00:32.870> this

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
they take a five gallon bucket this

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.200 
they take a five gallon bucket this
design<00:00:33.890> to<00:00:34.010> fit<00:00:34.129> inside<00:00:34.280> of<00:00:34.580> it<00:00:34.699> like<00:00:35.030> that

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
design to fit inside of it like that

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.819 
design to fit inside of it like that
we're<00:00:36.140> gonna<00:00:36.260> fill<00:00:36.380> the<00:00:36.470> bucket<00:00:36.680> up<00:00:36.710> a

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
we're gonna fill the bucket up a

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:45.010 
we're gonna fill the bucket up a
throttle<00:00:40.780> all<00:00:41.780> the<00:00:41.840> way<00:00:42.140> up<00:00:42.260> at<00:00:42.350> the<00:00:42.410> top<00:00:44.020> set

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
throttle all the way up at the top set

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.639 
throttle all the way up at the top set
it<00:00:45.110> down<00:00:45.170> someplace<00:00:45.530> pretty<00:00:45.950> level<00:00:47.410> now<00:00:48.410> we'll

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
it down someplace pretty level now we'll

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:49.750 
it down someplace pretty level now we'll
go<00:00:48.739> scoop<00:00:48.950> up<00:00:49.040> ossified<00:00:49.340> material<00:00:49.640> under

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
go scoop up ossified material under

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.889 
go scoop up ossified material under
there<00:00:49.960> so<00:00:50.960> I'm<00:00:51.620> gonna<00:00:51.739> take<00:00:51.860> a<00:00:51.950> shovel<00:00:52.899> and

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
there so I'm gonna take a shovel and

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:55.360 
there so I'm gonna take a shovel and
scoop<00:00:54.110> up<00:00:54.230> dirt<00:00:54.440> now<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:54.980> problem<00:00:55.250> of<00:00:55.280> the

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
scoop up dirt now the problem of the

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.590 
scoop up dirt now the problem of the
shovel<00:00:55.670> is<00:00:55.760> a<00:00:55.910> lot<00:00:56.030> of<00:00:56.120> time<00:00:56.300> then<00:00:56.510> you're

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
shovel is a lot of time then you're

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.940 
shovel is a lot of time then you're
walking<00:00:56.870> in<00:00:56.989> creeks<00:00:57.260> the<00:00:57.500> dirts<00:00:57.680> kind<00:00:57.890> of

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
walking in creeks the dirts kind of

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.709 
walking in creeks the dirts kind of
compacted<00:00:58.430> and<00:00:59.000> so<00:00:59.120> these<00:00:59.210> three<00:00:59.360> things<00:00:59.450> or

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
compacted and so these three things or

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.110 
compacted and so these three things or
garden<00:01:00.020> tines<00:01:00.289> really<00:01:01.280> work<00:01:01.399> great<00:01:01.550> so<00:01:01.850> you<00:01:02.000> go

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
garden tines really work great so you go

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.490 
garden tines really work great so you go
through<00:01:02.270> you<00:01:02.449> scoop<00:01:02.660> up<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:02.960> rocks

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
remove the biggest ones out of the way

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:07.570 
remove the biggest ones out of the way

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.490 
do several different kinds of motion
here<00:01:53.070> because<00:01:53.430> if<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.549> just<00:01:53.790> twist<00:01:54.030> like<00:01:54.210> this

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
here because if you just twist like this

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.480 
here because if you just twist like this
you<00:01:55.500> can<00:01:55.619> wind<00:01:55.800> up<00:01:55.890> with<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.070> sinner<00:01:56.250> with<00:01:56.430> a

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
you can wind up with a sinner with a

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.040 
you can wind up with a sinner with a
clean<00:01:56.759> but<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.119> along<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.420> outside<00:01:57.570> edge

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
clean but the along the outside edge

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.080 
clean but the along the outside edge
you'll<00:01:58.350> have<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.530> line<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.100> small<00:01:59.610> dirt<00:01:59.970> that

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
you'll have a line of small dirt that

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.850 
you'll have a line of small dirt that
hasn't<00:02:00.270> been<00:02:00.360> classified<00:02:00.720> properly<00:02:01.140> the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
hasn't been classified properly the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.109 
hasn't been classified properly the
nectar<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.280> drops<00:02:02.490> underneath<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.000> other

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
nectar that drops underneath the other

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.859 
nectar that drops underneath the other
rocks<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:03.659> check<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.440> like<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.710> like<00:02:05.340> that

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
rocks so check it like that like that

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.639 
rocks so check it like that like that
back<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:06.990> force<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.229> little<00:02:07.290> bit<00:02:07.470> does<00:02:07.560> that

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
back in force a little bit does that

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.309 
back in force a little bit does that
count<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.890> can<00:02:08.009> win<00:02:08.100> you<00:02:08.190> panning<00:02:09.200> and<00:02:10.200> when

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
count I can win you panning and when

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.680 
count I can win you panning and when
you're<00:02:10.410> done<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.860> pick<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.100> up<00:02:11.690> straight

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
you're done you pick it up straight

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.280 
you're done you pick it up straight
through<00:02:12.900> just<00:02:13.050> like<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.170> did<00:02:13.320> before<00:02:15.290> looking

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
through just like I did before looking

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.020 
through just like I did before looking
for<00:02:16.410> those<00:02:16.500> elusive<00:02:16.709> big<00:02:17.010> gold<00:02:17.190> nuggets<00:02:17.519> and

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
for those elusive big gold nuggets and

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.259 
for those elusive big gold nuggets and
then<00:02:18.690> toss<00:02:19.340> you<00:02:20.340> continue<00:02:20.670> doing<00:02:20.790> that<00:02:21.030> until

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
then toss you continue doing that until

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.900 
then toss you continue doing that until
this<00:02:21.989> bucket<00:02:22.290> is<00:02:22.380> full<00:02:22.590> if<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.580> can<00:02:23.700> take<00:02:23.820> about

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
this bucket is full if I can take about

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.390 
this bucket is full if I can take about
a<00:02:24.000> half<00:02:24.180> an<00:02:24.330> hour<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.840> an<00:02:25.170> hour<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:25.739> classify<00:02:26.280> up

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
a half an hour to an hour to classify up

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
a half an hour to an hour to classify up
enough<00:02:26.610> material<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.030> fill<00:02:27.150> this<00:02:27.239> bucket

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
enough material to fill this bucket

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.970 
enough material to fill this bucket
depending<00:02:28.170> on<00:02:28.260> where<00:02:28.440> you're<00:02:28.560> digging<00:02:28.680> the

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
depending on where you're digging the

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.199 
depending on where you're digging the
kind<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.250> rocks<00:02:29.459> you're<00:02:29.610> walking<00:02:29.880> in<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.120> so

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
kind of rocks you're walking in and so

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.360 
kind of rocks you're walking in and so
on<00:02:30.420> now<00:02:31.200> this<00:02:31.680> bucket<00:02:31.980> is<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.069> pretty<00:02:32.250> good

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
on now this bucket is a pretty good

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.070 
on now this bucket is a pretty good
system<00:02:32.550> but<00:02:33.120> there's<00:02:33.300> another<00:02:33.600> way<00:02:33.840> that's

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
system but there's another way that's

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.449 
system but there's another way that's
actually<00:02:34.440> quite<00:02:34.530> cheaper<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.100> think<00:02:35.400> it

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
actually quite cheaper and think it

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.009 
actually quite cheaper and think it
works<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.670> little<00:02:35.819> bit<00:02:35.910> faster<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:36.540> that's

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
works a little bit faster and that's

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.410 
works a little bit faster and that's
what<00:02:37.140> this<00:02:37.230> is<00:02:37.290> here<00:02:37.440> oh<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:38.030> this<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.180> just<00:02:39.300> an

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
what this is here oh and this is just an

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.070 
what this is here oh and this is just an
ordinary<00:02:39.569> tub<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.640> this<00:02:41.640> is<00:02:41.819> a<00:02:41.850> piece<00:02:42.120> of<00:02:42.390> the

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
ordinary tub and this is a piece of the

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.680 
ordinary tub and this is a piece of the
mesh<00:02:43.410> that<00:02:43.440> they<00:02:43.680> use<00:02:43.860> behind<00:02:44.370> tile<00:02:44.790> input

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
mesh that they use behind tile input

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.449 
mesh that they use behind tile input
they<00:02:45.930> put<00:02:46.079> it<00:02:46.170> behind<00:02:46.260> bathtubs<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:47.130> nail<00:02:47.340> this

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
they put it behind bathtubs a nail this

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.710 
they put it behind bathtubs a nail this
up<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.790> two<00:02:47.910> by<00:02:48.030> fours<00:02:48.299> and<00:02:48.540> then<00:02:48.600> they

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
up to the two by fours and then they

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.390 
up to the two by fours and then they
spread<00:02:48.959> grout<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.470> concrete<00:02:49.860> on<00:02:49.980> this<00:02:50.190> and

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
spread grout and concrete on this and

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.069 
spread grout and concrete on this and
they<00:02:50.459> put<00:02:50.489> tile<00:02:50.790> up<00:02:50.910> against<00:02:51.150> that<00:02:51.329> it's<00:02:51.900> used

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
they put tile up against that it's used

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.449 
they put tile up against that it's used
for<00:02:52.140> variety<00:02:52.320> of<00:02:52.440> applications<00:02:52.680> like<00:02:53.280> that

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
for variety of applications like that

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.229 
for variety of applications like that
you<00:02:54.360> can<00:02:54.510> take<00:02:54.600> this<00:02:54.840> pretty<00:02:55.620> cheap<00:02:56.060> just<00:02:57.060> lay

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
you can take this pretty cheap just lay

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.430 
you can take this pretty cheap just lay
it<00:02:57.299> over<00:02:57.390> whatever<00:02:57.660> container<00:02:57.900> you<00:02:58.049> have<00:02:58.140> it's

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
it over whatever container you have it's

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.100 
it over whatever container you have it's
about<00:02:58.590> this<00:02:58.739> size<00:02:59.390> watch<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.540> edges<00:03:00.810> because

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
about this size watch the edges because

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.890 
about this size watch the edges because
it<00:03:01.200> kind<00:03:01.350> on<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.500> sharp<00:03:01.709> side<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.690> just<00:03:03.690> bend

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
it kind on the sharp side and just bend

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.430 
it kind on the sharp side and just bend
it<00:03:03.959> down<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:05.250> sides<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:06.780> kringle<00:03:07.079> the<00:03:07.140> ends

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
it down to sides and kringle the ends

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:16.850 
it down to sides and kringle the ends
under<00:03:07.799> and<00:03:08.040> then<00:03:08.489> bend<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.820> top<00:03:08.970> oval

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:36.030 

that<00:03:19.110> down<00:03:20.110> the<00:03:20.200> other<00:03:20.319> end<00:03:33.569> all<00:03:34.569> right<00:03:34.720> so<00:03:35.440> the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
that down the other end all right so the

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.710 
that down the other end all right so the
beauty<00:03:36.340> of<00:03:36.370> this<00:03:36.550> is<00:03:36.850> for<00:03:37.390> one<00:03:37.480> thing<00:03:37.630> it

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
beauty of this is for one thing it

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.790 
beauty of this is for one thing it
doesn't<00:03:37.959> cost<00:03:38.080> twenty<00:03:38.350> dollars<00:03:38.380> like<00:03:38.680> that

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
doesn't cost twenty dollars like that

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.350 
doesn't cost twenty dollars like that
classifying<00:03:39.160> screen<00:03:39.400> does<00:03:39.610> and<00:03:40.239> it's

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
classifying screen does and it's

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.080 
classifying screen does and it's
basically<00:03:40.660> the<00:03:40.780> same<00:03:40.840> size<00:03:41.819> it's<00:03:42.819> filled<00:03:43.030> up

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
basically the same size it's filled up

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.790 
basically the same size it's filled up
with<00:03:43.209> water<00:03:43.270> and<00:03:43.840> you<00:03:44.200> the<00:03:44.319> same<00:03:44.440> thing<00:03:44.650> with

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
with water and you the same thing with

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.940 
with water and you the same thing with
it<00:03:47.040> straight<00:03:48.040> down<00:03:48.220> here<00:03:49.470> put<00:03:50.470> your<00:03:50.590> materials

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
it straight down here put your materials

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.610 
it straight down here put your materials
on<00:03:51.070> top<00:03:55.019> and<00:03:56.019> this<00:03:56.110> time<00:03:56.170> you<00:03:56.380> stick<00:03:56.590> around

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
on top and this time you stick around

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.790 
on top and this time you stick around
your<00:03:56.950> hands<00:03:57.570> because<00:03:58.570> this<00:03:58.810> sags<00:03:59.080> enough<00:03:59.410> into

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
throwing it this time we just take it we

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.380 
throwing it this time we just take it we
just<00:04:09.670> scoop<00:04:10.510> it<00:04:10.600> off<00:04:10.660> yet<00:04:12.060> of<00:04:13.060> course<00:04:13.090> we're

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
just scoop it off yet of course we're

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.790 
just scoop it off yet of course we're
looking<00:04:13.600> for<00:04:13.750> gold<00:04:13.930> as<00:04:13.989> we<00:04:14.080> go<00:04:14.230> but<00:04:14.410> we<00:04:14.470> can<00:04:14.620> see

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
looking for gold as we go but we can see

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.020 
looking for gold as we go but we can see
it<00:04:14.890> because<00:04:15.069> one's<00:04:15.250> going<00:04:15.400> like<00:04:15.580> one<00:04:15.760> layer<00:04:15.940> at

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030

it because one's going like one layer at
a<00:04:16.090> time<00:04:18.269> if<00:04:19.269> you<00:04:19.359> have<00:04:19.479> more<00:04:19.630> than<00:04:19.750> one<00:04:19.870> person

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
a time if you have more than one person

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.320 
a time if you have more than one person
then<00:04:20.979> you<00:04:21.190> can<00:04:21.280> make<00:04:21.370> it<00:04:21.459> more<00:04:21.549> efficient<00:04:21.910> by

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
then you can make it more efficient by

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.330 
then you can make it more efficient by
having<00:04:22.570> one<00:04:22.720> person<00:04:22.870> dig<00:04:23.260> and<00:04:23.979> having<00:04:24.280> the

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
having one person dig and having the

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.469 
having one person dig and having the
other<00:04:24.490> person<00:04:24.880> scrape<00:04:25.060> it<00:04:25.180> down<00:04:25.210> at<00:04:25.360> their

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
other person scrape it down at their

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:32.700 
other person scrape it down at their
hands<00:04:25.830> check<00:04:26.830> it<00:04:26.979> and<00:04:27.130> throw<00:04:27.460> it<00:04:27.490> away<00:04:31.710> and

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
hands check it and throw it away and

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:33.540 
hands check it and throw it away and
then<00:04:32.830> you<00:04:32.890> do<00:04:32.979> welcome<00:04:33.130> till<00:04:33.280> you<00:04:33.340> get<00:04:33.460> that

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
then you do welcome till you get that

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.940 
then you do welcome till you get that
full<00:04:33.789> and<00:04:34.030> then<00:04:34.240> you<00:04:34.360> run<00:04:34.479> your<00:04:34.600> pan<00:04:34.750> and<00:04:35.050> those

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
full and then you run your pan and those

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.020 
full and then you run your pan and those
are<00:04:36.070> the<00:04:36.130> two<00:04:36.280> simplest<00:04:36.580> ways<00:04:36.760> of<00:04:36.910> classifying

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
are the two simplest ways of classifying

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.390 
are the two simplest ways of classifying
on<00:04:37.539> a<00:04:37.570> budget<00:04:37.930> but<00:04:38.560> there's<00:04:38.710> another<00:04:38.890> way<00:04:39.130> that

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
on a budget but there's another way that

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.710 
on a budget but there's another way that
will<00:04:39.880> allow<00:04:39.970> you<00:04:40.030> to<00:04:40.090> process<00:04:40.270> up<00:04:40.510> a<00:04:40.570> whole

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
will allow you to process up a whole

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.270 
will allow you to process up a whole
bunch<00:04:40.870> of<00:04:40.900> more<00:04:41.020> material<00:04:41.410> and<00:04:41.919> once<00:04:42.190> you

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
bunch of more material and once you

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.260 
bunch of more material and once you
advance<00:04:42.550> to<00:04:42.640> the<00:04:42.760> stage<00:04:42.940> where<00:04:43.090> you<00:04:43.180> can

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
advance to the stage where you can

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.969 
advance to the stage where you can
process<00:04:43.479> up<00:04:43.720> that<00:04:43.870> material<00:04:44.260> will<00:04:44.800> show<00:04:44.919> you

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
process up that material will show you

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:46.890 
process up that material will show you
how<00:04:45.100> to<00:04:45.160> do<00:04:45.280> it<00:04:45.430> first<00:04:45.789> you're<00:04:46.479> gonna<00:04:46.570> run<00:04:46.750> into

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
how to do it first you're gonna run into

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.810 
how to do it first you're gonna run into
a<00:04:46.930> problem<00:04:47.080> at<00:04:47.289> this<00:04:47.380> point<00:04:47.470> that<00:04:48.310> now<00:04:48.520> you<00:04:48.580> can

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
a problem at this point that now you can

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.870 
a problem at this point that now you can
classify<00:04:49.030> material<00:04:49.810> by<00:04:50.289> the<00:04:50.320> bucketload<00:04:50.880> but

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
classify material by the bucketload but

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.070 
classify material by the bucketload but
painting<00:04:52.240> all<00:04:52.330> that<00:04:52.419> material<00:04:52.539> adds<00:04:52.900> gonna

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
painting all that material adds gonna

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.300 
painting all that material adds gonna
take<00:04:53.169> you<00:04:53.260> hours<00:04:53.440> and<00:04:54.039> you're<00:04:54.130> gonna<00:04:54.220> be

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
take you hours and you're gonna be

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.409 
take you hours and you're gonna be
saying<00:04:54.490> a<00:04:54.520> lot<00:04:54.640> more<00:04:54.820> time

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
saying a lot more time

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.719 
saying a lot more time
panning<00:04:56.140> then<00:04:56.440> you'll<00:04:56.560> be<00:04:56.680> classifying<00:04:57.160> does

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
panning then you'll be classifying does

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:58.680 
panning then you'll be classifying does
that<00:04:57.850> means<00:04:58.000> that<00:04:58.150> the<00:04:58.210> panning<00:04:58.510> of<00:04:58.600> your

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
that means that the panning of your

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.050 
that means that the panning of your
weakest<00:04:58.930> link<00:04:59.140> and<00:04:59.289> this<00:05:00.010> whole<00:05:00.160> process<00:05:00.400> for

make and then you got a pretty good
system<00:05:13.810> that's<00:05:14.080> where<00:05:14.200> I'm<00:05:14.260> at<00:05:14.380> now<00:05:14.580> so<00:05:15.580> you

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
system that's where I'm at now so you

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.790 
system that's where I'm at now so you
come<00:05:16.180> to<00:05:16.270> panning<00:05:16.660> and<00:05:16.960> need<00:05:17.260> something<00:05:17.500> metal
