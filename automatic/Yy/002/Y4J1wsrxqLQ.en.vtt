vitamin C content and the calcium and
the<00:01:21.330> phosphorous<00:01:21.750> content<00:01:22.100> because

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
the phosphorous content because

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.550 
the phosphorous content because
obviously<00:01:23.400> guinea<00:01:23.970> pigs<00:01:24.240> like<00:01:24.659> ourselves<00:01:24.840> do

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
obviously guinea pigs like ourselves do

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.990 
obviously guinea pigs like ourselves do
not<00:01:25.710> produce<00:01:25.890> vitamin<00:01:26.189> C<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.700> donate

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
not produce vitamin C so you donate

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.679 
not produce vitamin C so you donate
extra<00:01:27.630> but<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:29.159> correct<00:01:29.549> amount<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:30.150> vitamin

C their guinea pig needs in their diet

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.080 
C their guinea pig needs in their diet
