 He charged the man who killed before 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.730
 I really love a guy to know 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.770
 ride and friends 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.800
 mounted we go there to the point of 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.610
 three magistrates at the beginning is to say 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.680
 what if you want your curiosity 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.030
 the next episode is made since 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.500
 the policy for comments and such 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.510
 that always goes well will kill me 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.680
 other kids have seen the wheels and 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.760
 also say what you like in series 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.869
 can leave a piece of like in the 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.580
 video that also motivates a lot 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.110
 continue it and having said that we are going to 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.160
 for the guiri and we're also going to start 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.820
 with the curiosities of is new 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.960
 episodes 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.510
 we go with the first one that the 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.369
 sir he fought curiosity because when you 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.320
 car is new and the door is scratched 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.270
 they charge you like 300 dollars and when the 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.470
 car is much more broken they charge you 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.850
 only a couple of dollars for 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.030
 repair it in gt5 custom cars 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.229
 online to see then it's worth tech 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.210
 really something quite curious since 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.740
 it's true I think this happens because 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.090
 there is a limit or I think that 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.009
 by repairing your vehicle you can not 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.899
 charge more than 400 dollars that is to say I'm going 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.009
 to kill ya and well really I think 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.780
 that's why not because there is a simple 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.670
 limit and then having that limit 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.530
 I do not know if the car is super 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.210
 shattered will always charge you little 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.939
 more than $ 300 basically that's why 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.380
 so I do not know, I think that's the 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.810
 basic reason good that the subscribed only 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.860
 channel written up the audio kit something 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.360
 that the next curiosity thank you for 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.099
 your curiosity thank you attentive thank you with 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.539
 that classic you're curious does not come from 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.099
 Mr. Alexander's hand and he says 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.780
 curiosity two points because cars 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.519
 in races they destroy more 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.019
 easily when they fall from a high place 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.640
 and when we are in free mode they are more 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.720
 hard because the time is quite another thing 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.610
 interesting this episode of 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.650
 Pretty cool curiosities and this 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.000
 I really do not know why it happens I think 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.680
 that will be to give you more play what 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.430
 you come to the capital and it's true that 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.630
 when we are 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.489
 the kid looks like I bought this 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.560
 completely new environment we are going to 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.440
 go so much cured to repair a boy 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.340
 Well, how do I really say this? 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.450
 we are in a race and we fall 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.700
 a rather high site and here we have 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.470
 folded with the capo and not so high 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.150
 a rather short place as the car 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.739
 thematically exploits the truth I do not know 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.180
 own balls happens this and when 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.620
 we are without people to 5 online here by 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.500
 example in free mode and we say 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.240
 I super high with the car 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.890
 upside down and we give with all the roof in 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.570
 the ground the car does not explode is like 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.070
 says the question itself is as if the 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.300
 cars were harder then 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.220
 I really do not know why the fuck 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.840
 it really happens recently that I 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.370
 I realized this the truth when 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.420
 I started playing massa race he pulled like 8 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.010
 there's this whole thing I really gave myself 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.780
 account at that time and good really 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.280
 I think this happens to give you more 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.390
 game how difficult is to control the 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.430
 damn car with the press conference of 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.720
 action this I think happens because no 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.070
 I know to give more games to the race not 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.780
 so that people get bitten more so that 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.190
 more people to have fun racing 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.650
 since the cars to explode more 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.209
 easily that I can not bend because no 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.590
 you are like more entertaining for 7 although 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.910
 also sometimes I get some pisses 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.680
 you flip I've seen the race 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.150
 visiting some basically I think 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.470
 that will be why we go with the next 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.730
 and last question to see if it arrived before 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.890
 of terminals of the cars cults for 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.750
 prepare this vehicle and ask sir 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.580
 pineapple if indeed a person who 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.470
 call pineapple if so I was wondering 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.030
 curiosity because when you kill someone 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.100
 with just a nudge being close to 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.170
 him and yet with a gun 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.340
 You need 45 shots to kill him 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.840
 this latest advertising is also 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.340
 quite interesting that have been there will be 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.410
 in this floor 3 curiosity is pretty 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.340
 cool and good, it really is 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.290
 true that we are not close to a 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.670
 person that we have an ass an ass to 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.120
 fiba decided mother of mine I do not know what 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.549
 what the fuck are you thinking when we hit 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.269
 a kind of punch with the butt 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.860
 of the weapon 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.510
 that's why said period because I wanted 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.890
 refer to the gun butt then 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.060
 really when we go with the butt of 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.010
 ad in the mouth as we are very 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.720
 near him we killed him in one fell swoop and 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.180
 when we shoot him with bullets 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.769
 we close with four or five or even 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.909
 six or seven shots kill us because 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.639
 well that depends on the connection that 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:18.780
 you have why this happens because it warned us 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.949
 that this is like what call of duty does not 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.900
 when you hit a knife 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:23.250
 time is not close you kill it from nothing 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.650
 a knife stroke and when you shoot him with 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.840
 the guns take me that I know 34 more shots or 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.210
 minus 25 then when really this 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.440
 will happen I do not know why when giving it to a 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.760
 very close to him is pretty 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.470
 deficit that the other can get you 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.000
 a shot something of that then then 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.800
 the game rewards you for what 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.539
 can technically kill a blow not that 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.350
 is what basically for that reason as well as 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:41.580
 Boy, it 's been three 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.110
