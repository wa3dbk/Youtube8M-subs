00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.429
 Samsung test suite 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.139
 galaxy rating 10 points edition 2014 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.759
 we'll do a little tour 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.710
 technical specifications of this 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.210
 android tablet so first of all one 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.460
 is going to talk about the screen so it's a screen 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.939
 which is 10 1 inches with a resolution 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.220
 full HD of 2560 by 1600 pixels 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.439
 it's one of the biggest resolutions 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.019
 we can have on the tablet android 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:33.719
 currently it's the same resolution 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.219
 on the nexus 10 of google that came out 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.890
 last year so really we have a 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.320
 screen of superb quality also the 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.489
 slab technology that was 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.329
 used with a resolution 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.860
 super clear lcd so we have one 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.690
 density a contrast rendition 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.820
 but really very very good quality 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.910
 really on it super nice effort of 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.170
 the part of samsung 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.640
 also we will talk about the 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.840
 processor because it's a bit 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.730
 especially it changes 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.070
 say that we have at first a 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.440
 dual processor 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.140
 what of body that is installed on 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.950
 first quad-core processor it makes 1.9 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.510
 gigahertz 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.900
 so that's the first one and we have a 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.060
 second quad-core installed which him 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.250
 turn three giguÃ¨re so that makes us 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.260
 an October processor so with eight 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.210
 hearts that turn the tablet and 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.880
 so it's going really fast 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.250
 but the real interest is that samsung 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.729
 we offer on this tablet 3 giga 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.050
 of ram 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.380
 I think it's the first tablet 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.270
 to propose precisely 3 giga of ram in 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.380
 native and for once it's really a 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.729
 nice surprise because all 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.740
 applications all in this very 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.720
 quickly and almost no lag that 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.820
 are noticed it's really hyper 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.580
 nice to surf or use 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.690
 applications with this tablet then 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.940
 we are on android 4.3 for the moment 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.460
 there is a passage to android 4.4 kit 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.500
 kat that is logically expected at the beginning 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.149
 of year 2014 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.649
 so here is a little bit for the specs 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.100
 from this tablet 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.259
 I will now go to the small 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.720
 turn that we usually do so on 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.860
 this bracket on the bottom here was the 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.790
 micro sensor right there the micro usb port 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.260
 which allows you to recharge the tablet 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.070
 or communicate with your computer 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.140
 portable when I turn here we just 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.060
 there and there it's really a real interest 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.730
 for this tablet is that we have a 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.340
 microsd slot that lets you go 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.950
 up to 64 gigabytes of storage 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.360
 really we can have a superb 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.299
 storage capacity by adding a 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.620
 little card that turns for 64 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.019
 giga years turn around 50 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.790
 euros of memory and that of 32 gigas 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.100
 years turn around 20 25 euros 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.290
 so that's a real interest in the face of 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.269
 other competitors like google 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.430
 nexus who do not have it, or even 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.670
 the whole ipad series that has no 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.549
 connectivity here so a grid right there 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.570
 for the audio part so that's up to 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:57.989
 speakers there is a second of 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.590
 the other side 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:04.560
 is what makes the galaxy note mark 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.709
 it's the little stylus you see little 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.670
 stylus that just slips in there so that 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.019
 takes a little bit the same style and that 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.090
 had seen before with the little button 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.500
 here and the famous mines that we are 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.100
 offered initially by 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.190
 samsung 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:20.790
 so we will come a little more in detail 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.950
 the use of the stylus right there on the 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.120
 high slice so there you have a port 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.170
 infrared that allows you to 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.820
 turn your tablet into 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.050
 remote control so that allows you to 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.410
 control for example your freebox 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:34.020
 your orange box or even your chain 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.600
 hi fi so that's pretty handy so 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:40.820
 right there the infrared port there the volume 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:45.480
 + - here the power on off button 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:49.200
 I turn there on to the jack 3.5 mm 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.720
 and just here we have the second high 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.020
 speakers that's right there for 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.600
 finish the little trick I wanted you 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.340
 show the back then the back already he has 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.720
 been totally reviewed resume 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.030
 completely mistletoe the new range 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.680
 we could see with galaxy note 3 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.450
 access more a kind of big 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.850
 plastic but now it's a 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.590
 kind of imitation leather and for the 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.050
 blow really is very very pretty very 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.940
 managed it gives a rather luxurious appearance 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.200
 of this tablet is not found on 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.680
 other tablets for example even on 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.239
 ipad 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.370
 it's not so classy 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.890
 sincerely right there so we have the 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.740
 video sensor which is a sensor of 8 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:28.740
 megapixel autofocus with a led flash 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.540
 integrated so also a little one 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.110
 small tool interesting enough to do 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:38.610
 of video capture and to finish hop I 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:40.770
 come back here we have the sensor that 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.630
 must be I think of memory of I 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.840
 believe it's 2 megapixels in 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.280
 frontal is the same the two the sensor 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.610
 on the back allows you to make 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.620
 the full HD recording in 1080p and 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.510
 the front one it allows you 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.800
 only in 720p but hey you 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.540
 to portray well to make the 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.580
 videoconferencing 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:02.510
 to finish I will finish with the weight 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.770
 of the tablet is made 5 140 grams 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.530
 it's not too heavy it's okay 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.940
 it fits easily but especially the 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.830
 true interest is that it is very very 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.590
 delicate 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.050
 I gave you the dimensions so 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:18.290
 when I turn it like these in 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.600
 thickness made seven 9 mm dots 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:23.540
 and then afterwards in terms of dimensions 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:26.920
 on the screen so wait I come back in 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:33.080
 back here is the dimension that makes 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:34.730
 243.1 mm on 171 4 mm she is really 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.680
 fine she is very pleasant to take in 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.060
 hand the speakers are enough 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.910
 intelligently placed on the top for 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.350
 avoid the butcher like on there side 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.320
 like this so there the speakers 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.580
 are here it's pretty good and then for 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.590
 finish last little information 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.620
 about the battery so it's a 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.990
 8220 battery planted in terms 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.880
 used so samsung tells us 9 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:59.060
 hours in internal use is 10 hours in 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.570
 video playback and 122 hours of reading 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.730
 audio 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.260
 good as usual it's 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.690
 information that should be checked after 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.250
 in test last little info I had 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.230
 forgot to talk to you about the networks we have 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.790
 the king at the end he obviously made the 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:15.320
 bluetooth is also one has a chip 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.770
 gps that is embedded in the in the 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.780
 Tablet 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:21.230
 so here is really a tablet hyper 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.970
 complete which virtually at all 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.050
 best technical specifications 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.980
 that we can find now 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.980
 for an android tablet
