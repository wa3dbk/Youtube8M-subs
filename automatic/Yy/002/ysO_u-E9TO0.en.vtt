he can score it on the block he is a big

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.350 
he can score it on the block he is a big
long<00:02:07.560> guy<00:02:08.330> and<00:02:10.129> he's<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.160> really<00:02:11.430> nice<00:02:11.849> kid<00:02:12.209> who

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
long guy and he's a really nice kid who

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.720 
long guy and he's a really nice kid who
wants<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.750> learn<00:02:13.099> he's<00:02:14.099> still<00:02:14.400> very<00:02:14.550> young

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
know it's obviously very early but you

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.320 
know it's obviously very early but you

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
strings and do I have an exact sense no

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.940 
strings and do I have an exact sense no
because<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.269> don't<00:02:36.510> know<00:02:36.660> exactly<00:02:37.170> who<00:02:37.799> will
