November so you're doing a side hinge
can<00:00:15.389> also<00:00:15.509> do<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.719> center<00:00:16.049> hinge<00:00:16.170> but<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.379> want<00:00:16.529> to

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
can also do a center hinge but I want to

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.050 
can also do a center hinge but I want to
make<00:00:16.680> this<00:00:16.800> as<00:00:16.949> hard<00:00:17.100> as<00:00:17.400> possible<00:00:17.520> on<00:00:17.880> myself

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
make this as hard as possible on myself

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.189 
make this as hard as possible on myself
just<00:00:18.930> show<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.230> what<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.590> do<00:00:19.740> now<00:00:20.960> the<00:00:21.960> first

just show you what to do now the first
thing<00:00:22.350> we're<00:00:22.529> going<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.680> do<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:23.220> peel<00:00:24.060> the

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
thing we're going to do is peel the

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.759 
thing we're going to do is peel the
backing<00:00:24.330> off<00:00:24.600> they're<00:00:25.320> gonna<00:00:25.500> lay<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.740> down

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
backing off they're gonna lay it down

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.769 
backing off they're gonna lay it down
it's<00:00:26.220> pretty<00:00:26.490> simple<00:00:26.820> don't<00:00:27.420> need<00:00:27.570> any

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
it's pretty simple don't need any

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.240 
it's pretty simple don't need any
application<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.349> solution<00:00:28.740> or<00:00:28.920> anything<00:00:29.070> like

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
application of solution or anything like

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.400 
application of solution or anything like
that<00:00:29.310> just<00:00:29.640> practice<00:00:30.150> with<00:00:30.269> some<00:00:30.420> scrap<00:00:30.720> this

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
that just practice with some scrap this

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.880 
that just practice with some scrap this
is<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.619> chunk<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:32.390> orakau<00:00:33.390> 7:51<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.410> had<00:00:34.680> laying

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
is a chunk of orakau 7:51 I had laying

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.130 
is a chunk of orakau 7:51 I had laying
around<00:00:37.100> also<00:00:38.100> using<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:39.649> 4075<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.980> high-tech

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
PMS the arcade 47 5 so it's gonna make

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.520 
PMS the arcade 47 5 so it's gonna make
it<00:00:47.460> even<00:00:47.640> more<00:00:47.670> interesting<00:00:48.210> since<00:00:48.450> that's<00:00:49.379> a

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
it even more interesting since that's a

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:58.990 
it even more interesting since that's a
high

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.040 

now<00:01:00.000> it's<00:01:00.150> kind<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.360> hard<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.660> see<00:01:00.810> what<00:01:00.960> I'm

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
now it's kind of hard to see what I'm

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.430 
now it's kind of hard to see what I'm
doing<00:01:01.079> now<00:01:01.500> but<00:01:01.950> soon<00:01:02.910> I'll<00:01:03.060> be<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.330> the<00:01:03.420> dream

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.150 

basically<00:01:07.440> what<00:01:07.560> I'm<00:01:07.650> doing<00:01:07.680> it's<00:01:08.010> just

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
basically what I'm doing it's just

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.820 
basically what I'm doing it's just
swipes<00:01:09.120> back<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.780> forth<00:01:10.020> just<00:01:10.260> moving<00:01:10.620> the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
swipes back and forth just moving the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.600 
swipes back and forth just moving the
edge<00:01:11.240> further<00:01:12.240> now<00:01:12.920> we're<00:01:13.920> just<00:01:14.070> doing<00:01:14.220> side

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
edge further now we're just doing side

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.540 
edge further now we're just doing side
to<00:01:14.790> side<00:01:15.000> swipes<00:01:19.070> now<00:01:20.070> there's<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.340> lot<00:01:20.430> of

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
to side swipes now there's a lot of

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
to side swipes now there's a lot of
reasons<00:01:20.910> to<00:01:20.970> do<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.210> dry<00:01:21.950> number<00:01:22.950> one<00:01:23.570> there's

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
reasons to do it dry number one there's

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.680 
reasons to do it dry number one there's
this<00:01:24.720> some<00:01:24.960> things<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.350> can't<00:01:25.619> do<00:01:25.860> wet<00:01:26.690> for

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
this some things you can't do wet for

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.790 
this some things you can't do wet for
