00:00:03.191 --> 00:00:05.614
 The enemy's eye is moving 

00:00:09.895 --> 00:00:11.603
 The end is near 

00:00:16.297 --> 00:00:19.489
 Every day Frodo is closer to Mordor 

00:00:21.196 --> 00:00:23.387
 How do we know he's still alive? 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:26.682
 What does your heart tell you? 

00:00:32.205 --> 00:00:33.653
 Come on, Master! 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.453
 Come with Smeagol! 

00:00:40.071 --> 00:00:41.773
 This is your test. 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:45.897
 Every track you've traveled from the wilderness to the war 

00:00:46.984 --> 00:00:50.881
 Led us on this path 

00:00:52.687 --> 00:00:55.774
 The enemy will never allow Aragorn to take the throne of Gondor 

00:00:55.938 --> 00:00:57.184
 The time has come! 

00:00:59.792 --> 00:01:01.755
 Give him the king's sword! 

00:01:03.354 --> 00:01:05.341
 Become who you were born to be 

00:01:06.428 --> 00:01:09.605
 My Precious will be ours! 

00:01:09.693 --> 00:01:10.841
 He wants to kill us! 

00:01:11.021 --> 00:01:11.678
 Never! 

00:01:11.923 --> 00:01:13.147
 I will not send it away 

00:01:13.147 --> 00:01:15.690
 Come Smeagol ... 

00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:19.260
 The board is armed 

00:01:20.144 --> 00:01:21.834
 The pieces are moving 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.956
 He is here 

00:01:32.731 --> 00:01:34.581
 We arrived at last 

00:01:37.185 --> 00:01:38.748
 I see it in your eyes 

00:01:38.944 --> 00:01:40.855
 the same fear that once took away my courage 

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:42.523
 This Christmas 

00:01:43.713 --> 00:01:47.418
 Perhaps one day there will be a lack of courage for men 

00:01:47.496 --> 00:01:49.451
 The journey ends 

00:01:49.486 --> 00:01:52.808
 in which we will abandon our friends and betray the friendship 

00:01:52.974 --> 00:01:54.348
 But today is not today 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.773
 Whatever happens, stay with me 

00:01:56.954 --> 00:01:58.851
 Today we will fight! 

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:02.544
 There can be no triumph without loss 

00:02:05.034 --> 00:02:06.651
 What you need to decide 

00:02:06.788 --> 00:02:10.403
 is what to do with the time that was given to you 

00:02:11.903 --> 00:02:13.877
 We'll see the County again. 

00:02:14.023 --> 00:02:15.385
 There is no victory without suffering 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.988
 You have abdicated your eternal life 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:22.729
 I can not protect you anymore 

00:02:22.914 --> 00:02:24.771
 There is no freedom without sacrifice 

00:02:26.216 --> 00:02:29.515
 We will not be able to win by force of arms 

00:02:30.895 --> 00:02:32.274
 Not for ourselves 

00:02:32.438 --> 00:02:34.931
 But we can give Frodo a chance. 

00:02:41.615 --> 00:02:42.842
 NOT! 

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:47.663
 The Lord of the Stars The Return of the King Jedi 

00:02:48.548 --> 00:02:51.684
