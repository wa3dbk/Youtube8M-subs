00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.670
 here all the peculiarity is that it 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.280
 phone from a snapdragon processor to 6 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.280
 years so it's completely bell 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.440
 since he has all the information that 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.660
 are necessary for the use and the 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.340
 tablet she's the elder right there with 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.140
 of the battery to be able to allow 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.140
 to expand all that 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.939
 exactly bigger then it's not 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.890
 it's still not 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.180
 just a zoom we worked on 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.100
 the interface is sure the change in 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.360
 done between the phone and the tablet 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.010
 for not exactly we are really 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.480
 on the android interface that we can 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.879
 find on tablets transform 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.379
 it's jilin and more in 4.2 what I 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.790
 presume that anyway as and when 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.170
 measurement of evolutions 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:01:01.050
 will continue exactly so as I will you 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:03.960
 it was not said whether the eight 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.220
 exactly we do not have an overlayer at 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.510
 strictly speaking but we preferred 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.520
 develop widgets or 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.990
 applications 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.970
 precisely to be able to leave when 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.530
 even hands-free goes to the user 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.510
 we notice the overlouches it's not 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.050
 terrible is not too much appreciated by 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.140
 users 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.500
 so there at least with the widgets we have 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.729
 the choice 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.740
 we can roof the masters be not 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.930
 used at all so there we see you have 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.759
 particular manager is always polaris 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.530
 office 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:32.100
 we also have little widgets on the 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.100
 weather or on the battery always same 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.979
 principle but the docking station for 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.750
 iphone station so reload the 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.670
 phone is triple also 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.750
 autonomy 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.010
 what else to say to look at me more 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.010
 especially the phone 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.909
 connection commission to him she 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:04.250
 phone and gace the kingdom is hyper 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.250
 fluid and it's instantaneous 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.790
 the aluminum finish there you see at 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.680
 the antenna and it is compatible 4g ​​lte and 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.110
 e 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:23.970
 here you have a camera of 3 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:27.510
 megapixels we see there the proof 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:31.500
 for headphones here you have the 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:36.450
 ignition button and volumes there the 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.590
 micro usb and micro rival so 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:44.129
 actually the entrance for the friend 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:44.940
 possible a 5-inch screen or the 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.220
 make 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.710
 so as I told you in 1920 by 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.120
 1080 it's full hd and so it's the 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:55.110
 tablet that they themselves more than full 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.250
 hd since she in 1920 by 1200 and there 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.170
 it's the same we find ourselves on 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.620
 the android interface that we know 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:05.640
 with small additions asus like web 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.900
 storage as especially the manager of 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.450
 tasks and managers of cows 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.800
 sorry here is the manager of the 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.780
 battery always the same 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.730
 operation 30 one inserts into the 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.040
 tablet we find all the tools 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.630
 key widgets left apps that we have 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.790
 on the phone because everything is 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.010
 content in the phone he launches a 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.960
 application on the ground stage 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.090
 to be automatically exactly 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.340
 we can do the test I can maybe 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.340
 even tried to take for example a 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.340
 video 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.340
 if not 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.430
 excellent 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:48.110
 we see that there is a game you are to insert 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.110
 in the tablet 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.269
 but when it's going to work 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:06.769
 dad still not on the French market 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:08.629
 for the moment I believe that at the level of 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:14.209
 taiwan we talked about the month of may it me 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:15.260
 seems I believe anyway it puts 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.260
 always a little more time to arrive 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.290
 in France and the tip of the foot we talked 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.270
 from the 100 999 euros euro dollar 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.620
 that also remains to be confirmed for the 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.620
 exactly
