in<00:05:59.680> a<00:05:59.740> nice<00:05:59.860> big<00:06:00.100> chunk<00:06:00.340> so<00:06:00.460> I'm<00:06:00.520> actually

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:00.640 
in a nice big chunk so I'm actually

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.790 
in a nice big chunk so I'm actually
gonna<00:06:00.850> take<00:06:01.120> this<00:06:01.360> and<00:06:01.900> what<00:06:02.080> I'm<00:06:02.200> gonna<00:06:02.320> do<00:06:02.620> is

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
gonna take this and what I'm gonna do is

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.620 
gonna take this and what I'm gonna do is
I'm<00:06:02.950> gonna<00:06:03.010> spread<00:06:03.580> it<00:06:03.730> out<00:06:03.820> even<00:06:04.120> more<00:06:04.150> so<00:06:04.570> we

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
I'm gonna spread it out even more so we

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:05.880 
I'm gonna spread it out even more so we
can<00:06:04.660> just<00:06:04.870> send<00:06:05.050> a<00:06:05.080> runner<00:06:05.200> show<00:06:05.500> that<00:06:05.710> where

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:05.890 
can just send a runner show that where

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.800 
can just send a runner show that where
it<00:06:06.010> was<00:06:06.160> where<00:06:06.340> it<00:06:06.430> was<00:06:06.460> real<00:06:06.760> thick<00:06:07.090> and<00:06:07.720> I

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
it was where it was real thick and I

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.200 
it was where it was real thick and I
noticed<00:06:08.200> that<00:06:08.710> it<00:06:08.740> was<00:06:08.830> growing<00:06:09.340> in<00:06:09.520> this<00:06:09.880> way

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
noticed that it was growing in this way

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.820 
noticed that it was growing in this way
meaning<00:06:10.900> you<00:06:11.050> see<00:06:11.200> a<00:06:11.230> little<00:06:11.380> runner<00:06:11.620> there<00:06:11.800> I

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
meaning you see a little runner there I

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.180 
meaning you see a little runner there I
was<00:06:11.980> heading<00:06:12.250> inland<00:06:13.590> with<00:06:14.590> the<00:06:14.740> shallower

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
was heading inland with the shallower

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.860 
was heading inland with the shallower
water<00:06:15.550> growing<00:06:16.030> just<00:06:16.120> more<00:06:16.420> naturally<00:06:16.750> that

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
water growing just more naturally that

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.170 
water growing just more naturally that
way<00:06:16.990> so<00:06:17.110> what<00:06:17.200> I've<00:06:17.350> done<00:06:17.640> so<00:06:18.640> taken<00:06:19.000> I<00:06:19.060> hope

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
way so what I've done so taken I hope

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.130 
way so what I've done so taken I hope
you<00:06:19.270> guys<00:06:19.360> can<00:06:19.540> see<00:06:19.660> with<00:06:19.780> the<00:06:19.840> glare<00:06:20.050> I've

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.140 
you guys can see with the glare I've

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.890 
you guys can see with the glare I've
taken<00:06:20.380> all<00:06:20.620> these<00:06:20.830> little<00:06:21.040> individual<00:06:21.900> pieces

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
taken all these little individual pieces

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.110 
taken all these little individual pieces
of<00:06:23.620> jungle<00:06:23.830> vial<00:06:24.100> and<00:06:24.310> I've<00:06:24.430> spread<00:06:24.820> them<00:06:25.000> out

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
of jungle vial and I've spread them out

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.320 
of jungle vial and I've spread them out
all<00:06:25.450> along<00:06:25.960> the<00:06:26.200> shore<00:06:26.470> here<00:06:26.940> so<00:06:27.940> that<00:06:28.150> they

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
all along the shore here so that they

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.300 
all along the shore here so that they
can<00:06:28.660> grow<00:06:28.870> and<00:06:28.900> spread<00:06:29.440> out<00:06:29.590> in<00:06:29.830> the<00:06:29.920> shallower

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 
can grow and spread out in the shallower

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.430 
can grow and spread out in the shallower
water<00:06:30.610> shallower<00:06:31.210> water<00:06:31.540> equals<00:06:32.140> more

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.440 
water shallower water equals more

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.880 
water shallower water equals more
sunlight<00:06:32.710> equals<00:06:33.280> more<00:06:33.520> growth<00:06:33.820> for<00:06:34.090> D<00:06:34.300> so

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:34.890 
sunlight equals more growth for D so

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:37.170 
sunlight equals more growth for D so
we're<00:06:35.890> paused<00:06:36.220> about<00:06:36.550> that<00:06:36.730> and<00:06:36.910> then<00:06:37.000> also

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.180 
we're paused about that and then also

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.330 
we're paused about that and then also
I'll<00:06:37.900> show<00:06:37.990> you<00:06:38.200> guys<00:06:38.380> this<00:06:38.650> this<00:06:38.830> is<00:06:39.010> Elodie

about this guy's is that it's got like

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.050 
about this guy's is that it's got like
narrower<00:06:44.230> leaf<00:06:44.710> growth<00:06:45.220> on<00:06:45.460> it<00:06:45.490> Alex<00:06:45.910> you<00:06:45.970> know

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.060 
narrower leaf growth on it Alex you know

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.550 
narrower leaf growth on it Alex you know
the<00:06:46.150> leaves<00:06:46.330> are<00:06:46.540> a<00:06:46.570> little<00:06:46.720> more<00:06:46.930> narrow<00:06:47.230> in

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 
the leaves are a little more narrow in

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.170 
the leaves are a little more narrow in
there<00:06:47.770> look<00:06:48.400> when<00:06:48.520> I<00:06:48.580> planted<00:06:48.910> it<00:06:49.000> there<00:06:49.150> a

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180 
there look when I planted it there a

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.340 
there look when I planted it there a
little<00:06:49.240> thicker<00:06:49.600> so<00:06:49.720> I'm<00:06:49.900> not<00:06:50.020> really<00:06:50.140> sure

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:50.350 
little thicker so I'm not really sure

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.110 
little thicker so I'm not really sure
but<00:06:50.470> I'll<00:06:50.560> show<00:06:50.740> you<00:06:50.770> how<00:06:50.890> that's<00:06:51.160> this<00:06:51.910> is

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 
but I'll show you how that's this is

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.110 
but I'll show you how that's this is
probably<00:06:52.750> half<00:06:53.460> this<00:06:54.460> is<00:06:54.520> where<00:06:54.820> it's<00:06:54.910> growing

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 
probably half this is where it's growing

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.490 
probably half this is where it's growing
right<00:06:55.330> here<00:06:55.390> I'll<00:06:55.630> put<00:06:55.810> it<00:06:55.900> up<00:06:55.990> close<00:06:56.230> to<00:06:56.410> the

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:56.500 
right here I'll put it up close to the

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.890 
right here I'll put it up close to the
shore<00:06:56.740> now<00:06:57.160> my<00:06:57.340> goal<00:06:57.610> a<00:06:57.880> couple<00:06:58.420> things<00:06:58.510> I<00:06:58.690> want
