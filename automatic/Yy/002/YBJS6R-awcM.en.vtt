it's a pretty good game and I think that
it's<00:01:45.210> really<00:01:45.479> helped<00:01:45.720> boost<00:01:45.930> captain<00:01:46.439> toads

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
it's really helped boost captain toads

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
long time and I think the captain toad

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.240 
long time and I think the captain toad
is<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.149> perfect<00:01:54.659> opportunity<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:55.619> include<00:01:56.100> the

I've made a list of some of the move set
ideas<00:02:05.180> that<00:02:05.450> they<00:02:05.570> could<00:02:05.720> include<00:02:06.110> for

captain<00:02:09.650> toad<00:02:09.830> lacks<00:02:10.130> the<00:02:10.280> ability<00:02:10.460> to<00:02:10.970> jump

captain toad lacks the ability to jump

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.270 
captain toad lacks the ability to jump
so<00:02:11.960> I'd<00:02:12.050> imagine<00:02:12.470> him<00:02:12.590> is<00:02:12.710> a<00:02:12.740> very<00:02:12.980> bulky

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
so I'd imagine him is a very bulky

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.520 
so I'd imagine him is a very bulky
character<00:02:13.910> with<00:02:14.450> a<00:02:14.480> really<00:02:14.840> weak<00:02:14.990> jump<00:02:15.380> in

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
character with a really weak jump in

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.010 
character with a really weak jump in
recovery<00:02:16.040> very<00:02:16.670> similar<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.150> Little<00:02:17.540> Mac<00:02:17.720> in<00:02:17.930> a

recovery very similar to Little Mac in a

recovery very similar to Little Mac in a

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
way as for his regular attacks I'd

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.330 
way as for his regular attacks I'd
assumed<00:02:21.380> that<00:02:21.530> they<00:02:21.650> would<00:02:21.770> be<00:02:21.830> a<00:02:21.950> combination

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
assumed that they would be a combination

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.760 
assumed that they would be a combination

pickaxe<00:02:27.590> is<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:27.950> weapon<00:02:28.840> for<00:02:29.840> his<00:02:29.960> special

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
pickaxe is a weapon for his special

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.500 
pickaxe is a weapon for his special
moves<00:02:30.650> I<00:02:30.980> think<00:02:31.310> that<00:02:31.460> its<00:02:31.610> side<00:02:31.880> special

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
moves I think that its side special

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.260 
moves I think that its side special
should<00:02:32.870> be<00:02:32.930> him<00:02:33.290> riding<00:02:33.770> in<00:02:33.950> a<00:02:34.040> minecart<00:02:34.520> the

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
should be him riding in a minecart the

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.940 
should be him riding in a minecart the
minecart<00:02:35.720> levels<00:02:36.080> and<00:02:36.320> treasure<00:02:36.590> tracker

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
minecart levels and treasure tracker

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.310 
minecart levels and treasure tracker
were<00:02:37.400> among<00:02:37.640> my<00:02:37.820> favorites<00:02:38.390> even<00:02:39.050> though<00:02:39.170> they

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
were among my favorites even though they

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.620 
were among my favorites even though they
were<00:02:39.380> rather<00:02:39.650> short<00:02:40.070> and<00:02:40.250> easy<00:02:40.400> I<00:02:40.910> think<00:02:41.510> the

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
were rather short and easy I think the

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.270 
were rather short and easy I think the
captain<00:02:42.020> toad<00:02:42.200> writing<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.650> minecart<00:02:43.130> would

captain toad writing the minecart would

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.580 
captain toad writing the minecart would
function<00:02:43.580> very<00:02:43.880> similarly<00:02:44.360> to<00:02:44.570> Bowser<00:02:45.080> Jr's

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590

into a car captain toe could spawn a

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.090 
into a car captain toe could spawn a

for Captain totes neutral be I think
that<00:02:58.340> him<00:02:58.490> throwing<00:02:58.820> the<00:02:58.970> super<00:02:59.420> pickaxe

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
that him throwing the super pickaxe

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.900 
that him throwing the super pickaxe
would<00:03:00.200> function<00:03:00.500> pretty<00:03:00.770> well<00:03:01.070> this<00:03:01.760> is<00:03:01.880> a

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
would function pretty well this is a

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.940 
would function pretty well this is a
very<00:03:02.000> basic<00:03:02.390> and<00:03:02.840> kind<00:03:03.200> of<00:03:03.290> a<00:03:03.380> boring<00:03:03.590> moved

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
for a neutral special but I honestly

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.180 
for a neutral special but I honestly
can't<00:03:06.350> think<00:03:06.410> of<00:03:06.590> anything<00:03:06.800> that<00:03:07.010> would

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
can't think of anything that would

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.330 
can't think of anything that would
better<00:03:07.430> suit<00:03:07.790> him<00:03:08.500> for<00:03:09.500> Captain<00:03:09.830> toads<00:03:10.040> down

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340
