okay<00:00:05.330> after<00:00:05.660> we<00:00:05.750> do<00:00:05.899> our<00:00:05.930> delivery<00:00:06.500> drills<00:00:06.740> we

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:06.920 
okay after we do our delivery drills we

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.789 
okay after we do our delivery drills we
want<00:00:07.100> to<00:00:07.189> tie<00:00:07.430> it<00:00:07.490> all<00:00:07.670> together<00:00:07.850> and<00:00:08.590> one<00:00:09.590> way

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:09.799 
want to tie it all together and one way

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:12.280 
want to tie it all together and one way
to<00:00:09.830> get<00:00:10.280> a<00:00:10.520> lot<00:00:11.090> of<00:00:11.120> repetitions<00:00:11.929> in<00:00:12.110> our

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290 
to get a lot of repetitions in our

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.980 
to get a lot of repetitions in our
pitching<00:00:12.530> motion<00:00:13.130> is<00:00:13.420> take<00:00:14.420> the<00:00:14.570> ball<00:00:14.750> out<00:00:14.780> of

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
pitching motion is take the ball out of

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.890 
pitching motion is take the ball out of
the<00:00:15.200> equation<00:00:15.530> and<00:00:15.920> just<00:00:16.219> use<00:00:16.369> the<00:00:16.520> towel<00:00:16.900> it's

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
the equation and just use the towel it's

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.510 
the equation and just use the towel it's
very<00:00:18.140> difficult<00:00:18.470> for<00:00:18.860> a<00:00:19.009> pitcher<00:00:19.220> to<00:00:19.400> throw

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
very difficult for a pitcher to throw

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.279 
very difficult for a pitcher to throw
over<00:00:20.000> and<00:00:20.390> over<00:00:20.510> and<00:00:20.660> over<00:00:20.750> again<00:00:20.930> with<00:00:21.260> a

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289 
over and over and over again with a

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.910 
over and over and over again with a
baseball<00:00:21.910> because<00:00:22.910> of<00:00:23.150> the<00:00:23.350> so<00:00:24.350> much<00:00:24.560> pressure

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
baseball because of the so much pressure

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.980 
baseball because of the so much pressure
put<00:00:25.250> on<00:00:25.279> the<00:00:25.490> elbow<00:00:25.820> and<00:00:26.000> the<00:00:26.090> shoulder<00:00:26.119> so<00:00:26.930> you

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
put on the elbow and the shoulder so you

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.650 
put on the elbow and the shoulder so you
only<00:00:27.199> have<00:00:27.380> so<00:00:27.590> many<00:00:27.680> bullets<00:00:28.180> so<00:00:29.180> we<00:00:29.330> use<00:00:29.510> the

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
only have so many bullets so we use the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.509 
only have so many bullets so we use the
towel<00:00:29.900> to<00:00:30.199> take<00:00:30.380> a<00:00:30.410> little<00:00:30.650> bit<00:00:30.859> of<00:00:30.920> stress<00:00:31.250> off

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:31.519 
towel to take a little bit of stress off

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.790 
towel to take a little bit of stress off
the<00:00:31.670> arm<00:00:31.880> and<00:00:32.150> give<00:00:32.989> us<00:00:33.110> the<00:00:33.260> ability<00:00:33.350> to

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
the arm and give us the ability to

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.280 
the arm and give us the ability to
repeat<00:00:34.129> that<00:00:34.280> motion<00:00:34.519> over<00:00:35.150> and<00:00:35.269> over<00:00:35.449> another

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
repeat that motion over and over another

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.799 
repeat that motion over and over another
purpose<00:00:36.739> of<00:00:36.890> the<00:00:36.980> towel<00:00:37.250> is<00:00:37.579> to<00:00:38.390> make<00:00:38.570> sure

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
purpose of the towel is to make sure

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.770 
purpose of the towel is to make sure
that<00:00:39.320> when<00:00:39.829> we<00:00:39.980> finish<00:00:40.399> we<00:00:40.880> got<00:00:41.059> the<00:00:41.210> snap<00:00:41.510> out

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
that when we finish we got the snap out

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.290 
that when we finish we got the snap out
here<00:00:42.350> instead<00:00:42.890> of<00:00:43.309> dragging<00:00:43.790> the<00:00:44.059> towel

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
here instead of dragging the towel

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.209 
here instead of dragging the towel
through<00:00:44.690> and<00:00:44.930> we<00:00:45.290> don't<00:00:45.410> hear<00:00:45.739> it<00:00:45.770> so

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
through and we don't hear it so

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:47.680 
through and we don't hear it so
hopefully<00:00:46.760> we'll<00:00:47.090> be<00:00:47.210> able<00:00:47.239> to<00:00:47.390> hear<00:00:47.600> the

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
hopefully we'll be able to hear the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.840 
hopefully we'll be able to hear the
towel<00:00:47.930> snapping<00:00:48.289> out<00:00:48.620> here<00:00:48.829> late<00:00:49.129> when<00:00:49.579> Chris

does<00:00:50.120> this<00:00:50.329> drill<00:00:50.660> here<00:00:50.899> bed<00:00:51.800> Chris<00:00:57.250> that<00:00:58.250> was

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
does this drill here bed Chris that was

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.069 
does this drill here bed Chris that was
good<00:00:58.550> continue<00:00:59.090> to<00:00:59.180> go<00:00:59.329> Chris<00:00:59.600> as<00:00:59.780> you<00:00:59.899> can

hear<00:01:00.289> it<00:01:00.410> out<00:01:00.530> here<00:01:01.000> snapping<00:01:02.000> now<00:01:02.449> some<00:01:02.780> guys

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
hear it out here snapping now some guys

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.249 
hear it out here snapping now some guys
if<00:01:03.350> their<00:01:04.100> motion<00:01:04.520> isn't<00:01:04.820> proper<00:01:05.300> or<00:01:05.479> if<00:01:05.990> their

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
if their motion isn't proper or if their

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:09.010 
if their motion isn't proper or if their
arm<00:01:06.770> swing<00:01:07.250> is<00:01:07.520> a<00:01:07.580> little<00:01:08.030> too<00:01:08.180> tight<00:01:08.479> you

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
arm swing is a little too tight you

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.560 
arm swing is a little too tight you
might<00:01:09.200> hear<00:01:09.500> it<00:01:09.590> dragon<00:01:10.130> too<00:01:10.490> soon<00:01:10.820> but<00:01:11.450> we

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
might hear it dragon too soon but we

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:18.300 
might hear it dragon too soon but we
want<00:01:11.750> to<00:01:11.810> hear<00:01:11.930> that<00:01:12.140> tile<00:01:12.409> right<00:01:12.680> out<00:01:12.860> here

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.280 

now<00:01:19.310> Chris<00:01:19.610> is<00:01:19.640> incorporating<00:01:20.600> all<00:01:20.840> the

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
now Chris is incorporating all the

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.289 
now Chris is incorporating all the
drills<00:01:21.560> we've<00:01:21.770> done<00:01:21.979> previously<00:01:22.250> during<00:01:23.210> our

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
drills we've done previously during our

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.080 
drills we've done previously during our
warm<00:01:23.630> up<00:01:23.840> into<00:01:24.740> this<00:01:25.100> drill<00:01:25.430> and<00:01:25.460> this<00:01:25.790> is<00:01:25.970> his

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
warm up into this drill and this is his

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.060 
warm up into this drill and this is his
pitching<00:01:26.450> mechanics<00:01:26.780> that<00:01:27.200> he<00:01:27.439> would<00:01:27.619> use<00:01:27.860> as

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
pitching mechanics that he would use as

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.730 
pitching mechanics that he would use as
if<00:01:28.460> he<00:01:28.580> had<00:01:28.729> a<00:01:28.759> baseball<00:01:29.030> in<00:01:29.450> hand<00:01:29.750> okay<00:01:30.530> let's

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
if he had a baseball in hand okay let's

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:46.190 
if he had a baseball in hand okay let's
try<00:01:30.890> a<00:01:30.950> couple<00:01:31.220> from<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:31.520> wind<00:01:31.729> up

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.690 

okay<00:01:47.200> another<00:01:47.439> way<00:01:47.649> we<00:01:47.829> could<00:01:47.979> use<00:01:48.189> this<00:01:48.369> drill

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
okay another way we could use this drill

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.359 
okay another way we could use this drill
is<00:01:48.939> that<00:01:49.869> say<00:01:50.079> we<00:01:50.259> see<00:01:50.439> a<00:01:50.469> flaw<00:01:50.829> on<00:01:50.859> a<00:01:50.979> pitcher's

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
is that say we see a flaw on a pitcher's

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.300 
is that say we see a flaw on a pitcher's
mechanic<00:01:51.909> or<00:01:52.030> we<00:01:52.420> want<00:01:52.659> to<00:01:52.840> possibly<00:01:53.710> improve

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
mechanic or we want to possibly improve

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.889 
mechanic or we want to possibly improve
his<00:01:54.549> stride<00:01:54.909> length<00:01:55.240> to<00:01:55.479> improve<00:01:55.780> his

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
his stride length to improve his

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.109 
his stride length to improve his
mechanics<00:01:56.469> we<00:01:57.070> can<00:01:57.250> use<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.549> towel<00:01:57.789> and<00:01:57.820> we're

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
mechanics we can use the towel and we're

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:59.399 
mechanics we can use the towel and we're
not<00:01:58.299> worried<00:01:58.689> about<00:01:58.780> where<00:01:59.079> the<00:01:59.200> ball<00:01:59.380> is

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
not worried about where the ball is

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.249 
not worried about where the ball is
going<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.649> be<00:01:59.799> going<00:02:00.159> so<00:02:00.670> Chris<00:02:01.450> on<00:02:01.719> this<00:02:02.020> time

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
going to be going so Chris on this time

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:03.899 
going to be going so Chris on this time
I<00:02:02.469> want<00:02:02.770> you<00:02:02.890> to<00:02:02.979> increase<00:02:03.310> your<00:02:03.429> stride

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
I want you to increase your stride

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.940 
I want you to increase your stride
another<00:02:04.299> two<00:02:04.569> inches<00:02:04.780> and<00:02:05.170> this<00:02:05.619> will<00:02:05.799> give<00:02:05.829> us

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
another two inches and this will give us

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.770 
another two inches and this will give us
a<00:02:06.189> little<00:02:06.340> bit<00:02:06.520> more<00:02:06.700> momentum<00:02:07.299> towards<00:02:07.659> the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
a little bit more momentum towards the

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:20.120 
a little bit more momentum towards the
plate

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.550 

very<00:02:21.130> good<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:22.180> that's<00:02:22.810> our<00:02:23.020> tall<00:02:23.260> drill

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
very good and that's our tall drill

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.580 
very good and that's our tall drill
which<00:02:24.370> we<00:02:24.550> use<00:02:24.760> pretty<00:02:25.630> much<00:02:25.720> two<00:02:26.110> three<00:02:26.380> times
