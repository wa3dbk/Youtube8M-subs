attachments<00:00:21.869> we<00:00:22.289> need<00:00:22.410> three<00:00:22.590> attachments

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
attachments we need three attachments

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.950 
attachments we need three attachments
all<00:00:23.279> together<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.269> first<00:00:24.510> one<00:00:24.689> should<00:00:24.869> be

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
all together and the first one should be

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.839 
all together and the first one should be
the<00:00:25.019> silence<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.619> course<00:00:25.920> which<00:00:26.490> keeps<00:00:26.730> you

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
the silence of course which keeps you

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.570 
the silence of course which keeps you
out<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.090> mini-map<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.660> hard<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.590> spot<00:00:28.859> the

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
out of the mini-map and hard to spot the

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.189 
out of the mini-map and hard to spot the
second<00:00:29.970> attachment<00:00:30.179> we're<00:00:30.599> going<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.779> take<00:00:30.990> is

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
second attachment we're going to take is

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.740 
second attachment we're going to take is
the<00:00:31.230> FMJ<00:00:31.980> because<00:00:32.640> when<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.000> silencer<00:00:33.510> it

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
the FMJ because when the silencer it

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.840 
the FMJ because when the silencer it
decreases<00:00:34.079> both<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.829> rage<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.430> damage

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
decreases both the rage and the damage

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.569 
decreases both the rage and the damage
so<00:00:36.329> when<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.570> take<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.840> FMJ<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.579> increases

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
so when you take the FMJ it increases

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.119 
so when you take the FMJ it increases
the<00:00:38.610> damage<00:00:38.850> by<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.270> actually<00:00:39.930> buy<00:00:40.410> three<00:00:40.710> so

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
the damage by to actually buy three so

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.639 
the damage by to actually buy three so
that's<00:00:41.219> going<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.460> be<00:00:41.579> really<00:00:41.700> good<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.649> for

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
that's going to be really good and for

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.220 
that's going to be really good and for
grip<00:00:43.860> because<00:00:44.100> as<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.149> told<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.510> when<00:00:46.200> you

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
grip because as I told you when you

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.410 
grip because as I told you when you
choose<00:00:46.469> silencer<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.219> decreases<00:00:47.610> even<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
choose silencer it decreases even the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.020 
choose silencer it decreases even the
acura<00:00:49.200> in<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.559> range<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.640> will<00:00:50.760> get

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
acura in the range so this will get

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.180 
acura in the range so this will get
better<00:00:51.300> accuracy<00:00:51.690> for<00:00:52.170> when<00:00:52.320> you're<00:00:52.500> aiming

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
better accuracy for when you're aiming

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.950 
better accuracy for when you're aiming
really<00:00:53.489> down<00:00:53.940> when<00:00:54.420> you're<00:00:54.539> aiming<00:00:54.809> down

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
really down when you're aiming down

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.010 
really down when you're aiming down
sights<00:00:55.020> for<00:00:55.500> long<00:00:55.680> ranges<00:00:56.129> though<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.870> aim

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
sights for long ranges though in the aim

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.720 
sights for long ranges though in the aim
will<00:00:58.260> not<00:00:58.410> move<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:59.100> that's<00:00:59.280> really<00:00:59.609> useful

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
will not move so that's really useful

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.069 
will not move so that's really useful
and<00:01:00.120> all<00:01:00.239> together<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.629> think<00:01:00.930> these<00:01:01.020> are

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
and all together I think these are

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.680 
and all together I think these are
perfect<00:01:01.620> attachments<00:01:02.579> for<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.820> scar-h<00:01:03.059> now

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
perfect attachments for the scar-h now

perfect attachments for the scar-h now

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
especially keep an ad for the nuclear

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.160 
especially keep an ad for the nuclear
and<00:01:35.240> for<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.299> third<00:01:36.360> street<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.020> need

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
dexterity because when you're running

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.999 
dexterity because when you're running
you<00:01:38.490> need<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.700> pull<00:01:38.880> your<00:01:39.000> gun<00:01:39.240> up<00:01:39.360> fast<00:01:39.630> or<00:01:40.009> you

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
you need to pull your gun up fast or you

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.530 
you need to pull your gun up fast or you
can<00:01:41.189> go<00:01:41.340> really<00:01:41.729> quickly<00:01:42.000> through<00:01:42.360> those

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
can go really quickly through those

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.620 
can go really quickly through those
windows<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.860> climb<00:01:44.579> really<00:01:44.850> fast<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.479> all

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
windows and climb really fast so all

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.210 
windows and climb really fast so all
together<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:46.020> think<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.680> good<00:01:46.799> build<00:01:47.040> as

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
together I think this is a good build as
