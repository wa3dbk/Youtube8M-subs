 it's the work of the body 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.269
 when rhodes 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.269

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:26.310
 lack of agreement m 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.189
 with afp 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.189
 free but this solidarity action 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.860
 will leave will not leave 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.980
 why take a little bit everywhere 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.980
 as for her 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.830

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.210
 problem 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.210
 if you have passed but it will not be long 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.950
 That could be 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.850
 that's what she's talking about she's lying down turning the tide 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.850
 the owner 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.010
 the music 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.010
 abrams 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.770
 certainly the crisis 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.840
 I just signed my native country 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.840
 as to the results of the group 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.650
 it's like that 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.070
 three years after the facts 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.030
 the mayor of lille 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.200
 if you want to get over it 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.930
 update the 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.930
 I do think that 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.790
 syrians 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.960
 michÃ¨le alliot-marie 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.439
 the group n and bluetooth 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:14.699
 jean-claude magendie plunges a few larger figures of the crisis that mine

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:27.919
 current units 

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:30.919
 But this is not true 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:36.539
 the first time 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:38.519
 yesterday didier deschamps 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.449
 the room is full 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:44.449
 I do not see any leftover 

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:48.379

 March 12 announced the INSEE Thursday 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.309

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:08.529
 the supermarket 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.599
 in the spirit 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.599
 but it's around 10 o'clock in the night 

00:03:18.429 --> 00:03:19.819
 for me alone 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.819
