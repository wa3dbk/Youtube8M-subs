many videos i would have had to make if
double<00:04:27.300> double<00:04:27.930> XP<00:04:28.320> weekend<00:04:28.770> wasn't<00:04:29.040> going<00:04:29.430> on

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
double double XP weekend wasn't going on

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.960 
double double XP weekend wasn't going on
just<00:04:30.120> imagine<00:04:30.360> that<00:04:30.600> would<00:04:30.810> have<00:04:30.930> been<00:04:31.970> i've

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
just imagine that would have been i've

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.620 
just imagine that would have been i've
been<00:04:33.830> probably<00:04:34.830> another<00:04:35.130> extra<00:04:35.520> 20<00:04:36.030> videos<00:04:36.210> i

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
been probably another extra 20 videos i

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.080 
been probably another extra 20 videos i
mean<00:04:36.840> it<00:04:37.530> because<00:04:38.010> it<00:04:38.130> takes<00:04:38.280> so<00:04:38.370> long<00:04:38.580> rank<00:04:38.910> up

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
mean it because it takes so long rank up

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.959 
mean it because it takes so long rank up
in<00:04:39.180> this<00:04:39.300> game<00:04:39.510> in<00:04:39.690> my<00:04:39.840> opinion

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:40.969 
in this game in my opinion

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:44.319 
in this game in my opinion
and<00:04:41.659> that<00:04:42.439> would<00:04:42.559> have<00:04:42.589> been<00:04:43.179> you<00:04:44.179> know<00:04:44.299> I

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:44.329 
and that would have been you know I

00:04:44.329 --> 00:04:46.959 
and that would have been you know I
probably<00:04:44.509> would<00:04:44.749> if<00:04:45.079> it<00:04:45.769> if<00:04:45.979> there<00:04:46.639> wasn't

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:46.969 
probably would if it if there wasn't

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:48.459 
probably would if it if there wasn't
double<00:04:47.089> XP<00:04:47.479> weekend<00:04:47.809> going<00:04:47.959> on<00:04:48.110> and<00:04:48.259> probably

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:48.469 
double XP weekend going on and probably

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:50.199 
double XP weekend going on and probably
would<00:04:48.589> have<00:04:48.649> taken<00:04:48.860> me<00:04:49.069> like<00:04:49.189> a<00:04:49.219> week<00:04:49.549> to

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:50.209 
would have taken me like a week to

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:52.869 
would have taken me like a week to
finish<00:04:50.779> off<00:04:51.049> this<00:04:51.199> prestige<00:04:51.619> master<00:04:51.919> and<00:04:52.309> you

00:04:52.869 --> 00:04:52.879 
finish off this prestige master and you

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:54.459 
finish off this prestige master and you
know<00:04:52.969> I<00:04:52.999> definitely<00:04:53.299> can't<00:04:53.659> spend<00:04:54.199> a<00:04:54.289> week
