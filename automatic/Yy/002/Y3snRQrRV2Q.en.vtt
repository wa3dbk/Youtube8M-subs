00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
take a little longer to grow so those

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.660 
take a little longer to grow so those
might<00:02:26.620> be<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:26.860> while<00:02:27.070> but<00:02:27.510> no<00:02:28.510> rational<00:02:28.900> knows

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
might be a while but no rational knows

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.370 
might be a while but no rational knows
got<00:02:30.670> some<00:02:30.850> of<00:02:30.940> our<00:02:31.090> tomato<00:02:31.420> cages<00:02:31.810> for<00:02:32.260> when

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
got some of our tomato cages for when

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.370 
got some of our tomato cages for when
the<00:02:32.440> tomatoes<00:02:32.860> come<00:02:33.100> up<00:02:33.480> bag<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.780> leaves<00:02:34.930> for

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
the tomatoes come up bag the leaves for

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.890 
the tomatoes come up bag the leaves for
our<00:02:35.470> compost<00:02:36.330> this<00:02:37.330> is<00:02:37.450> our<00:02:37.570> organic

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
our compost this is our organic

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.840 
our compost this is our organic
materials<00:02:38.530> compost<00:02:39.010> pile<00:02:39.250> this<00:02:39.400> is<00:02:39.550> actually

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
materials compost pile this is actually

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.800 
materials compost pile this is actually
basically<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:40.420> pile<00:02:40.630> that<00:02:40.900> uh<00:02:42.450> is<00:02:43.450> going<00:02:43.720> to

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
basically the pile that uh is going to

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.580 
basically the pile that uh is going to
just<00:02:43.959> compost<00:02:44.410> in<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.680> song<00:02:44.890> without<00:02:45.069> worms

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
just compost in the song without worms

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.050 
just compost in the song without worms
so<00:02:47.590> we<00:02:47.709> probably<00:02:47.920> need<00:02:48.130> to<00:02:48.190> add<00:02:48.310> some<00:02:48.549> green<00:02:48.790> to

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
so we probably need to add some green to

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.539 
so we probably need to add some green to
it<00:02:49.209> to<00:02:49.560> get<00:02:50.560> a<00:02:50.620> little<00:02:50.980> hot<00:02:51.160> or<00:02:51.340> hotter

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
it to get a little hot or hotter

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.000 
it to get a little hot or hotter
basically<00:02:52.090> means<00:02:52.299> you<00:02:52.480> as<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:53.500> organism

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
basically means you as the organism

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.220 
basically means you as the organism
start<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.370> break<00:02:54.579> it<00:02:54.730> down<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.299> pile<00:02:55.600> heats<00:02:55.989> up

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
start to break it down the pile heats up

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.740 
start to break it down the pile heats up
and<00:02:56.500> really<00:02:57.430> starts<00:02:57.760> cooking<00:02:58.000> underneath<00:02:58.390> you

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
and really starts cooking underneath you

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.270 
and really starts cooking underneath you
can't<00:02:58.900> really<00:02:59.170> sell<00:02:59.410> fan<00:02:59.560> outside<00:02:59.980> but<00:03:00.190> it

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
can't really sell fan outside but it

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.789 
can't really sell fan outside but it
gets<00:03:00.340> real<00:03:00.579> hot<00:03:01.140> once<00:03:02.140> you<00:03:02.230> get<00:03:02.410> within<00:03:02.590> that

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
gets real hot once you get within that

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.490 
gets real hot once you get within that
pile<00:03:03.040> of<00:03:03.160> leaves<00:03:03.280> so<00:03:04.200> hopefully<00:03:05.200> if<00:03:05.290> we<00:03:05.380> add

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
pile of leaves so hopefully if we add

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.170 
pile of leaves so hopefully if we add
some<00:03:05.739> green<00:03:05.950> some<00:03:06.250> nitrogen<00:03:06.610> to<00:03:06.880> it<00:03:07.000> it<00:03:07.120> will

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
some green some nitrogen to it it will

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.970 
some green some nitrogen to it it will
start<00:03:07.480> cooking<00:03:07.630> and<00:03:08.440> this<00:03:08.590> is<00:03:08.709> our<00:03:08.799> other

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
start cooking and this is our other

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.710 
start cooking and this is our other
compost<00:03:09.549> bin<00:03:09.730> this<00:03:09.880> is<00:03:10.000> actually<00:03:10.329> what<00:03:10.450> we<00:03:10.540> had

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
compost bin this is actually what we had

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.430 
compost bin this is actually what we had
the<00:03:10.870> worms<00:03:11.079> in<00:03:11.350> last<00:03:11.590> year<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:13.200> we<00:03:14.200> didn't

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
the worms in last year and we didn't

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.020 
the worms in last year and we didn't
insulate<00:03:14.829> it<00:03:14.920> too<00:03:15.040> well<00:03:15.250> so<00:03:15.519> when<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.850> winter

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
insulate it too well so when the winter

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.270 
insulate it too well so when the winter
came<00:03:16.329> and<00:03:16.360> killed<00:03:16.690> them<00:03:16.840> all<00:03:17.019> so<00:03:17.950> now<00:03:18.100> we<00:03:18.160> have

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
came and killed them all so now we have

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.699 
came and killed them all so now we have
our<00:03:18.400> worms<00:03:18.730> inside<00:03:19.090> of<00:03:19.269> a<00:03:19.709> Rubbermaid

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
our worms inside of a Rubbermaid

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.670 
our worms inside of a Rubbermaid
container

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.240 

that's<00:03:24.370> about<00:03:24.609> it<00:03:24.640> right<00:03:24.909> now<00:03:26.010> we'll<00:03:27.010> have

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
that's about it right now we'll have

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.589 
that's about it right now we'll have
another<00:03:27.489> update<00:03:27.909> actually<00:03:28.239> let<00:03:28.329> me<00:03:28.420> show<00:03:28.569> you

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.699 
year came back and legs going to get out
of<00:03:36.370> control<00:03:36.459> so<00:03:36.939> you<00:03:36.969> might<00:03:37.299> want<00:03:37.569> to<00:03:37.709> find

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
of control so you might want to find

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.059 
of control so you might want to find
another<00:03:39.040> place<00:03:39.280> to<00:03:39.340> put<00:03:39.640> it<00:03:39.670> and<00:03:39.939> actually

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
beans and we actually have these poles

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.119 
beans and we actually have these poles
one<00:03:48.760> on<00:03:48.879> each<00:03:48.909> side<00:03:49.260> I'm<00:03:50.260> going<00:03:50.469> to<00:03:50.560> tie<00:03:50.680> string

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:51.129 
one on each side I'm going to tie string

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:53.550 
one on each side I'm going to tie string
from<00:03:51.400> one<00:03:51.609> end<00:03:51.909> to<00:03:51.969> the<00:03:52.090> other<00:03:52.209> and<00:03:52.629> the<00:03:53.349> pole

from one end to the other and the pole

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.149 
from one end to the other and the pole
bean<00:03:53.739> to<00:03:53.889> climb<00:03:54.099> up<00:03:54.129> the<00:03:54.400> string<00:03:55.950> so<00:03:56.950> we<00:03:57.010> got

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:57.159 
bean to climb up the string so we got

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.690 
bean to climb up the string so we got
everything<00:03:57.489> worked<00:03:57.700> out<00:03:57.849> just<00:03:58.150> need<00:03:58.450> to<00:03:59.700> hope

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700

warmer<00:04:03.480> or<00:04:04.480> else<00:04:04.750> is<00:04:04.900> going<00:04:05.109> to<00:04:05.169> be<00:04:05.290> a<00:04:05.319> longer

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
warmer or else is going to be a longer

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.430 
warmer or else is going to be a longer
time<00:04:06.010> for<00:04:06.280> these
