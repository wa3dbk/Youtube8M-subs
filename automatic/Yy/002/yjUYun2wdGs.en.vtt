and<00:03:48.970> I<00:03:49.480> did<00:03:49.900> this<00:03:50.019> because<00:03:50.230> really<00:03:50.829> I<00:03:50.950> added<00:03:51.459> to

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
and I did this because really I added to

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.400 
and I did this because really I added to
be<00:03:51.850> honest<00:03:52.090> I<00:03:52.239> didn't<00:03:52.390> even<00:03:52.510> noticed<00:03:52.989> that<00:03:53.170> it

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
be honest I didn't even noticed that it

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.380 
be honest I didn't even noticed that it
was<00:03:53.709> taking<00:03:53.920> that<00:03:54.160> long<00:03:54.340> I<00:03:54.400> think<00:03:54.790> each<00:03:55.000> game

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
was taking that long I think each game

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.710 
was taking that long I think each game
mode<00:03:55.660> is<00:03:55.870> about<00:03:56.220> 30<00:03:57.220> minutes<00:03:57.640> 20<00:03:57.940> minutes<00:03:57.970> or

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
mode is about 30 minutes 20 minutes or

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.560 
mode is about 30 minutes 20 minutes or
so<00:03:58.750> and<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:59.530> time<00:03:59.769> just<00:04:00.040> flied<00:04:00.340> because<00:04:00.880> i<00:04:01.209> was

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
so and the time just flied because i was

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.750 
so and the time just flied because i was
uploading<00:04:01.810> a<00:04:02.110> video<00:04:02.290> as<00:04:02.590> i<00:04:03.190> was<00:04:03.340> playing<00:04:03.579> this
