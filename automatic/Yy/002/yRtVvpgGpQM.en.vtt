00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.990
 hello fifth day of this 34th 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.330
 cup of america between americans and 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.010
 neo z and Hollywood scenario in 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.920
 this bay of san francisco today 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:24.310
 look at it starts with if it cleared 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.079
 sun 19 to 23 knots and boat committee to 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.880
 backwards and yes today the current 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.919
 comes out the wind comes in the back of the boat 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.060
 committee is rather than sob to talk 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:33.760
 several important points 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.890
 let's go step by step the scenario 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.880
 was perfect and just before you 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.470
 bring in the regattas 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.260
 know that today both 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.240
 certificate of measurement have been changed the 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
 boats re georges and I do not know what 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.490
 we change and the neo z 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.200
 but we can see very well what we change 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.940
 and the Americans they cut their 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.900
 butt out there is wind that is expected 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.060
 today 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.170
 no gennaker so the cursor is a 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.880
 little changed in balance 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.100
 that means that the neo z will surely 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.930
 to be a little slower with a little 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.820
 faster downwind and on the contrary 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.170
 the fastest Americans with is 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.299
 slower downwind that means 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.189
 surely a lot of first contacts 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.500
 regatta of the day so number 8 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:11.110
 a lot of wind looking from the front 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.610
 neo z chose the very fast exterior 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.130
 they are well launched two seconds 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.600
 before arrives at the reach buoy 4 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.370
 seconds ahead of the Americans and a 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.560
 incredible back wind edge at 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.450
 contact and especially big news the 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.960
 Americans to make the bet will do the 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.700
 split 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.830
 look they have the right dumpling 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.479
 downstairs they have their turn in starboard they 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.580
 are seven seconds behind but it's going 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.650
 to be hot close edge so the 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.030
 americans have starboard watch the 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.530
 here they are doing so well today 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.540
 I was coming from panic me they 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.190
 struggling to hold back their boats case the 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.810
 crowd in the air a delay tacking 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.070
 they have the bows in the air they live 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.430
 on the rudders they saw better 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.100
 better 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.350
 the contact looks hot first 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.970
 contact who are behind 2nd 3rd 4th 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.010
 incredible crossing look at what's 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.990
 passes over the neo z turns to 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.920
 cover vire monte monte monte mounts 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.810
 mounted 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.400
 phew they do not go it's really very 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.510
 limits look now put 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.299
 behind Americans view it's 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.130
 incredible it happens to 22.26 do not throw 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.350
 upwind and he sees these neo z who 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.299
 rises who rises who rises who rises oh 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.500
 la la it's horrible but like a 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.879
 only in match racing what is 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.689
 pass had watched now seen from 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.819
 what is happening 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:14.140
 starboard port I have a boat that has 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.730
 not finished his maneuver that is not 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.410
 priority the neo-z so very 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.910
 clearly blue penalty for kiwi 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.010
 because the Americans were starboard 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.880
 and now better than that look from 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.860
 inside for 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.480
 what are you listening to what's going to happen? 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.640
 are we on the oz bÃ¢tonnier who goes up who 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.630
 go up where you get helpo is a 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.580
 hydraulic problem 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.870
 they pumped so much to the touch in 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.760
 the pump they have little oil close 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.290
 of them for the duo camper of the ale and 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.520
 that they show too much and now 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.580
 look what's on the side of 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.290
 american side american it's right 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.740
 above right I live re-listen 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.350
 if they want to tack and they 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.660
 end up coming back to watch the 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.030
 incredible speed we are in full 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.980
 match racing Hollywood scenario and 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.230
 final victory of the Americans in 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.640
 this round that are finally at zero point 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.350
 and what happens now after 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.360
 this incredible scenario it would take 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.270
 check the boat from a to z and not 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.280
 all these neo z are breakable soon 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.260
 lost six rounds so soon fell from 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.690
 horse I go back on board and it's gone 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.040
 for the regatta number 2 the limit before 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.750
 escoula very close I watched 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.750
 a lot of wind on the start line 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.040
 the kiwis mark before it is enormously 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.510
 of match racing the halls makes 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.810
 Americans are strained to try to 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.880
 pass 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.710
 it does not happen the kiwis are 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.510
 interiors to keep the commitment 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:32.350
 that they have besides to reach boad 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:35.230
 and flies off 42 42 knots of speed for 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.030
 important anthology to split contact 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.260
 at the buoy under the wind is here and there 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.540
 it's the wind that decides how 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.800
 usually by boat the committee stops the 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.240
 race because we have beyond the 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.220
 limit of 23 9 of the day 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.200
 conclusion of this scenario 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.510
 incredible first conclusions 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.190
 should we talk about this American committee 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.020
 who stop a regatta while 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.430
 Americans are behind I do not believe 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.100
 at all it's not that so it takes 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.740
 talk about it we have to talk about this back in 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.480
 American form that drives the neo 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.280
 z in their last retrenchments 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.140
 what has never happened to them in the 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.880
 night falls and we discover problems 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.280
 of their boat for example hydraulic 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.360
 word of the day from below because in my war 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.459
 of transfer they do not arrive at 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.600
 reload enough to adjust the 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.740
 top of their wings which is him 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.910
 hydraulic, but it gives them 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.220
 very complicated issues of transfers 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.530
 and finally what is it about knowing 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.960
 if these six points in advance are going to be a 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.120
 enough mattress to withstand a 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.760
 very strong return from the Americans 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.030
 we'll see that tonight your day and 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.030
 good luck
