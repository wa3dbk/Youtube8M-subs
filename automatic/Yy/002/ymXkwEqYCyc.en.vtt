00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:15.910 
so important thing to know on a 4 by 4

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.190 
so important thing to know on a 4 by 4
and<00:00:16.630> a<00:00:16.750> promotion<00:00:17.230> selectable<00:00:17.920> manual<00:00:18.930> if<00:00:19.930> you

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:20.200 
and a promotion selectable manual if you

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.019 
and a promotion selectable manual if you
engage<00:00:20.439> the<00:00:20.800> diff<00:00:20.980> lock<00:00:21.220> in<00:00:21.430> the<00:00:21.550> VA<00:00:21.730> it

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:22.029 
engage the diff lock in the VA it

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:24.660 
engage the diff lock in the VA it
suspends<00:00:22.509> abs<00:00:23.020> and<00:00:23.259> ESP<00:00:23.380> and<00:00:23.830> therefore<00:00:24.550> a

other apperal features on other value

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.769 
other apperal features on other value
and<00:00:28.390> war<00:00:28.980> with<00:00:29.980> an<00:00:30.099> automatic<00:00:30.430> it<00:00:31.000> works<00:00:31.270> see

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
and war with an automatic it works see

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.030 
and war with an automatic it works see
doesn't<00:00:32.110> look<00:00:32.200> as<00:00:32.349> here<00:00:32.529> because<00:00:32.710> it's<00:00:32.860> not<00:00:32.980> a

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
doesn't look as here because it's not a

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.690 
doesn't look as here because it's not a
locked<00:00:33.220> in<00:00:33.489> a<00:00:33.520> case<00:00:33.760> so<00:00:34.120> can<00:00:34.420> work<00:00:34.649> yeah<00:00:35.649> it<00:00:36.520> is

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:36.700 
locked in a case so can work yeah it is

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.250 
locked in a case so can work yeah it is
locked<00:00:37.000> in<00:00:37.270> the<00:00:37.360> river<00:00:37.840> the<00:00:37.870> sender's

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
locked in the river the sender's

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.229 
locked in the river the sender's
notebook<00:00:38.620> exactly<00:00:39.399> and<00:00:39.820> that's<00:00:40.000> the<00:00:40.120> reason

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
notebook exactly and that's the reason

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.470 
notebook exactly and that's the reason
why<00:00:40.420> okay<00:00:41.110> so<00:00:41.770> um<00:00:42.070> it<00:00:42.520> is<00:00:42.640> still<00:00:42.850> work<00:00:43.120> it's

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
why okay so um it is still work it's

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.850 
why okay so um it is still work it's
still<00:00:43.630> working<00:00:43.870> the<00:00:44.260> only<00:00:44.470> thing<00:00:44.620> that<00:00:44.770> you

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
still working the only thing that you

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.410 
still working the only thing that you
need<00:00:45.040> to<00:00:45.160> know<00:00:45.220> to<00:00:45.640> to<00:00:45.790> the<00:00:45.880> wheels<00:00:46.210> being

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
need to know to to the wheels being

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.050 
need to know to to the wheels being
clocked<00:00:46.690> from<00:00:46.930> mud<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:48.460> could<00:00:48.670> be<00:00:48.820> on<00:00:49.030> a

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:49.060 
clocked from mud it could be on a

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.110 
clocked from mud it could be on a
concrete<00:00:49.320> slope<00:00:50.320> like<00:00:50.980> here<00:00:51.250> or<00:00:51.550> if<00:00:51.970> it's

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
concrete slope like here or if it's

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.560 
concrete slope like here or if it's
coarse<00:00:52.450> gravel<00:00:52.750> that's<00:00:53.680> the<00:00:54.130> the<00:00:54.820> wheels<00:00:55.090> on<00:00:55.510> a

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
coarse gravel that's the the wheels on a

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.450 
coarse gravel that's the the wheels on a
steep<00:00:56.170> decline<00:00:56.410> like<00:00:56.829> this<00:00:57.010> to<00:00:57.130> the<00:00:57.220> wheels

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
steep decline like this to the wheels

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.300 
steep decline like this to the wheels
tend<00:00:57.850> to<00:00:58.240> block<00:00:58.510> a<00:00:58.720> to<00:00:58.930> lock<00:00:59.110> all<00:00:59.530> of<00:00:59.950> them<00:01:00.100> for

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.310 
tend to block a to lock all of them for

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.840 
tend to block a to lock all of them for
so<00:01:01.090> it<00:01:01.450> could<00:01:01.780> be<00:01:01.810> that<00:01:01.990> you<00:01:02.320> as<00:01:02.530> a<00:01:02.739> as<00:01:03.430> a<00:01:03.489> tribe

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
so it could be that you as a as a tribe

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:13.830 
so it could be that you as a as a tribe
have<00:01:04.420> to<00:01:04.659> to<00:01:05.110> a<00:01:05.470> control<00:01:06.250> vehicle<00:01:07.000> manually

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.220 

to<00:01:14.289> keep<00:01:14.500> it

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.230 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:27.020 

at<00:01:19.710> last<00:01:25.220> those<00:01:26.220> rear<00:01:26.460> wheels<00:01:26.670> are<00:01:26.880> just

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
at last those rear wheels are just

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.000 
at last those rear wheels are just
simply<00:01:27.240> not<00:01:27.420> an<00:01:27.540> option<00:01:27.630> oh<00:01:29.390> no<00:01:30.390> did<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.690> go<00:01:31.010> they
