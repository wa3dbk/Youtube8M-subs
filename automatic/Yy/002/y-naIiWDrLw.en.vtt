00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.967
 Hello everyone, I am Luke, you are watching the "victory equation" 

00:00:08.067 --> 00:00:10.600
 This is a program dedicated to the "team battle" mode. 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.967
 We continue to have topics about commenting on the basics of this form. 

00:00:14.067 --> 00:00:19.633
 Powerslide, a member of the Na`Vi team who won numerous major competitions, came to the scene to help us 

00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.167
 Today, let’s talk about heavy tanks. 

00:00:30.267 --> 00:00:33.867
 Even if you are not an expert, everyone knows that these chariots are the main body of a team. 

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:37.533
 They should be the main chariots to attack the enemy. 

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:43.000
 Some experienced players may not agree with it and propose to be a medium-sized chariot or even an expelled chariot. 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:51.067
 We will discuss these next time. If you are inexperienced, you should not experiment with your team's battle lineup. 

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:55.900
 Therefore, three or four good heavy tanks in the team should be fine. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.367
 First of all, what do we mean by "good heavy tanks"? 

00:00:58.467 --> 00:01:01.733
 Currently, there are 15 kinds of 8-level heavy tanks in the game. 

00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:05.767
 So, which heavy-duty chariot is more suitable for team combat mode? 

00:01:05.867 --> 00:01:13.133
 Experienced players, including Powerslide, believe that the AMX 50 100, IS-3 and T32 are good heavy tanks. 

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:14.567
 Let's see why this is. 

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:15.900
 Let’s talk about this French chariot first. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.467
 This chariot is very flexible 

00:01:17.567 --> 00:01:20.067
 It is even more flexible than some medium-sized vehicles. 

00:01:20.167 --> 00:01:26.867
 In addition, it can inflict 1800 damage to your opponent in 12 seconds. 

00:01:26.967 --> 00:01:28.700
 It is the only one in the same class that can do this! 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.600
 The disadvantage of this chariot is that it has almost no armor, and its elevation angle is the lowest among its class. 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.533
 However, the scope of this chariot is far away. 

00:01:37.433 --> 00:01:39.867
 IS-3 is completely different 

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:43.333
 Its field of view is only 350 meters 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.400
 Although the armor of the Soviet chariot is better than the French chariot 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.100
 Plus its main gun - BL-9 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.800
 It can cause up to 488 damage in one shot, and only the US T34 can outperform it! 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.367
 Of course, we have to mention the armor of IS-3, although the thickness of the armor is not amazing. 

00:02:00.467 --> 00:02:05.167
 But its well-known arrow-shaped front armor is very effective. 

00:02:05.267 --> 00:02:08.933
 Its turret armor is also one of the best in its class. 

00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:11.700
 So, what kind of tank turret armor is the thickest? 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.100
 T32! 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.400
 In general, this chariot is quite balanced. 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.400
 It has a field of view of 400 meters, a good elevation angle and a good aiming time. 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.500
 The fly in the ointment is the lack of flexibility 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.567
 American tanks are much slower than other tanks, but this is very important. 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.900
 So what about other chariots? 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.333
 From the parameter point of view, you may choose KV-5 

00:02:33.433 --> 00:02:38.000
 It has the best durability, the highest damage per minute, and the armor is also very good. 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.000
 And in terms of numbers, the KV-5 is faster than the IS-3. 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.267
 It seems to be the perfect chariot in the dream... but this is just an illusion 

00:02:44.367 --> 00:02:46.700
 In fact, its mobility is very low 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.733
 Coupled with lower armor penetration, poor field of view and poor radio range, it makes it less 

00:02:51.833 --> 00:02:55.533
 So in general, this chariot is not really necessary on all maps. 

00:02:55.633 --> 00:03:00.167
 Another chariot that is worth mentioning when talking about team battle is T34. 

00:03:00.267 --> 00:03:03.433
 Its single shot damage and armor penetration are very good 

00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:06.600
 Its turret armor is second only to T32 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.933
 And it has a good elevation angle 

00:03:09.033 --> 00:03:11.467
 However, these are the only ones that are only a bit 

00:03:11.567 --> 00:03:15.533
 Because it has a slower rate of fire and lower damage per minute 

00:03:15.633 --> 00:03:17.167
 Its body armor is very weak 

00:03:17.267 --> 00:03:20.900
 Its flexibility is close to T32, but a little bit worse 

00:03:23.433 --> 00:03:28.033
 Another Soviet heavyweight, the KV-4, is very similar to the gold coin chariot of its class. 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.433
 Excellent armor and durability, but the field of view is very poor 

00:03:32.533 --> 00:03:40.367
 Due to poor flexibility and low damage per minute, you will find that this tank is less suitable for team combat mode than KV-5. 

00:03:41.267 --> 00:03:43.933
 Chinese chariots are also worth mentioning 

00:03:44.033 --> 00:03:46.867
 Chinese tanks are very similar to IS-3 

00:03:46.967 --> 00:03:51.867
 Their durability levels are very close, but the field of view and damage per minute are better. 

00:03:51.967 --> 00:03:56.100
 The flexibility of 110 and 112 is close to that of the Soviet Union. The highest speed of Chinese tanks is higher. 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.467
 However, due to the low thrust, their acceleration is worse than IS-3. 

00:04:02.567 --> 00:04:05.167
 Therefore, the flexibility is also poor 

00:04:05.267 --> 00:04:10.367
 In addition, you can operate the turret very efficiently when driving the IS-3, which is very important for team operations. 

00:04:10.467 --> 00:04:14.533
 We will no longer waste time talking about other 8 levels of heavy tanks. 

00:04:14.633 --> 00:04:20.833
 To sum up, each chariot has its advantages compared to the AMX 50 100, IS-3 and T32. 

00:04:20.933 --> 00:04:23.200
 But they are not omnipotent 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.800
 For example, German chariot 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.167
 The German cannon's cannon is very precise, but the armor flexibility is insufficient. 

00:04:29.267 --> 00:04:36.700
 Of course, many people will disagree. Some people will say that these chariots are sometimes destroyed by cars that we think are not suitable for team operations. 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.833
 Of course, professional players can successfully compete with any 8th-order chariot. 

00:04:41.967 --> 00:04:47.400
 Some of them use these opportunities to upgrade their tanks, and some use gold coins to get extra points. 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.933
 But I don't recommend that you do it at first. 

00:04:50.033 --> 00:04:53.167
 Using a certain method is the formula of victory! 

00:04:55.033 --> 00:04:57.267
 Therefore, the experience value is obtained through the fully upgraded chariot, 

00:04:57.367 --> 00:04:59.700
 Only play the best chariots to master new tactics 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.800
 Yes, when you win more and more times, you can try to choose different chariots to change the team lineup. 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.233
 But first you have to learn to use the lineup recommended by experienced players to win. 

00:05:10.967 --> 00:05:13.933
 I hope most people can learn some useful new knowledge. 

00:05:14.033 --> 00:05:16.333
 Tell us what you want to know from us in the comments. 

00:05:16.433 --> 00:05:19.133
 We will read every comment from everyone and try to satisfy everyone’s wishes. 

00:05:19.233 --> 00:05:22.467
 By the way, we will discuss medium-sized vehicles in the next episode. 

00:05:22.567 --> 00:05:27.467
 That's it today, we are Luke and Powerslide, remember to subscribe to our new channel to learn more! 

00:05:27.567 --> 00:05:29.367
 Goodbye!
