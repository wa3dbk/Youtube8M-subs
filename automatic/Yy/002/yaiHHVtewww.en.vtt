00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
think this entire game and the lag is

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.080 
think this entire game and the lag is
just<00:00:17.670> ridiculous<00:00:18.330> I<00:00:18.539> mean<00:00:19.189> I'll<00:00:20.189> just<00:00:20.400> wait

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
that on a four bar that shouldn't be

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.750

is<00:00:53.670> one<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.360> reasons<00:00:54.780> why<00:00:55.020> Treyarch<00:00:55.890> needs

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
is one of the reasons why Treyarch needs

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.229 
is one of the reasons why Treyarch needs
dedicated<00:00:57.270> servers<00:00:57.780> um<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.800> don't<00:00:59.640> understand

dedicated servers um I don't understand

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.760 
dedicated servers um I don't understand
how<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.420> can<00:01:00.510> make<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.780> billion<00:01:01.079> dollars<00:01:01.230> off<00:01:01.739> a

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
how you can make a billion dollars off a

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.399 
how you can make a billion dollars off a
game<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.670> such<00:01:03.120> shitty<00:01:03.390> servers<00:01:04.229> like

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
game and that such shitty servers like

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.679 
game and that such shitty servers like
look<00:01:04.559> at<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:05.180> the<00:01:06.180> one<00:01:06.299> thing<00:01:06.450> they<00:01:06.570> are

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
look at this the one thing they are

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.000 
look at this the one thing they are
doing<00:01:06.930> good<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.380> good<00:01:07.619> with<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.430> though<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
doing good is good with is though is the

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.609 
doing good is good with is though is the
patches<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.220> mean<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.790> was<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.930> thought<00:01:13.229> on<00:01:13.380> modern

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
patches I mean I was I thought on modern

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.350 
patches I mean I was I thought on modern
warfare<00:01:13.770> two<00:01:14.040> when<00:01:14.220> they<00:01:14.310> wouldn't<00:01:14.520> patch<00:01:14.880> it

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
warfare two when they wouldn't patch it

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.179 
warfare two when they wouldn't patch it
except<00:01:15.780> for<00:01:15.810> like<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.110> javelin<00:01:16.619> glitch<00:01:16.650> and

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
except for like the javelin glitch and

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.789 
except for like the javelin glitch and
the<00:01:17.340> care<00:01:18.060> package<00:01:18.450> glitch<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:19.020> thought<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.710> was

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
the care package glitch I thought it was

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.219 
the care package glitch I thought it was
Activision<00:01:20.549> but<00:01:20.790> now<00:01:21.299> with<00:01:21.540> treyarch<00:01:21.990> patch

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
Activision but now with treyarch patch

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.020 
Activision but now with treyarch patch
and<00:01:22.439> everything<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.920> guess<00:01:23.100> infinity<00:01:23.850> words

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
and everything I guess infinity words

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.620 
and everything I guess infinity words
just<00:01:24.240> too<00:01:24.420> lazy<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.869> too<00:01:25.110> cheap<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.439> hire

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
just too lazy and too cheap to hire

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.700 
just too lazy and too cheap to hire
programmers<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:28.200> fix<00:01:28.439> their<00:01:28.650> mistakes<00:01:29.630> um
