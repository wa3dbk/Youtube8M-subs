photograph will take you get the picture

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.160 
photograph will take you get the picture
size<00:01:13.679> so<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.609> can<00:01:14.729> then<00:01:14.850> select<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.659> change

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
size so you can then select that change

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.139 
size so you can then select that change
it<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:17.100> any<00:01:17.579> size<00:01:18.270> from<00:01:18.569> 2<00:01:18.810> 5<00:01:19.200> 9<00:01:19.889> 10<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.670> 12<00:01:20.909> and

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
it to any size from 2 5 9 10 and 12 and

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:23.359 
it to any size from 2 5 9 10 and 12 and
then<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.439> will<00:01:22.560> also<00:01:22.709> change<00:01:23.069> the<00:01:23.189> aspect

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
then that it will also change the aspect

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.449 
then that it will also change the aspect
ratio<00:01:23.729> as<00:01:24.569> well<00:01:24.749> so<00:01:25.469> if<00:01:25.529> we<00:01:25.649> select<00:01:25.829> name<00:01:26.219> for

00:01:26.449 --> 00:01:26.459 
ratio as well so if we select name for

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:28.580 
ratio as well so if we select name for
example<00:01:26.909> you've<00:01:27.509> also<00:01:27.689> got<00:01:27.929> the<00:01:28.020> focused<00:01:28.409> tape

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
example you've also got the focused tape

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.429 
example you've also got the focused tape
so<00:01:28.920> whether<00:01:29.219> that's<00:01:29.310> infinite<00:01:30.029> auto<00:01:30.439> mackerel

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
so whether that's infinite auto mackerel

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.239 
so whether that's infinite auto mackerel
or<00:01:31.560> even<00:01:32.159> face<00:01:32.399> detection<00:01:33.979> you<00:01:34.979> can<00:01:35.130> also

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:35.249 
or even face detection you can also

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:38.029 
or even face detection you can also
change<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.670> white<00:01:35.880> balance<00:01:36.709> to<00:01:37.709> different

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
change the white balance to different

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:43.339 
change the white balance to different
lighting<00:01:38.189> situations<00:01:41.630> you<00:01:42.630> can<00:01:42.779> also<00:01:42.899> scroll

00:01:43.339 --> 00:01:43.349 
lighting situations you can also scroll

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:46.160 
lighting situations you can also scroll
through<00:01:44.240> tunnel<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.299> things<00:01:45.569> like<00:01:45.749> the<00:01:45.929> image

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
through tunnel on things like the image

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.620 
through tunnel on things like the image
stabilizer<00:01:46.909> effects<00:01:47.909> as<00:01:48.029> well<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.569> can

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
stabilizer effects as well so you can

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.739 
stabilizer effects as well so you can
have<00:01:48.869> as<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> negative<00:01:49.759> solarized<00:01:50.759> sepia<00:01:51.359> black

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:51.749 
have as a negative solarized sepia black

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:53.989 
have as a negative solarized sepia black
and<00:01:51.929> white<00:01:52.109> for<00:01:52.679> example<00:01:53.039> if<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.219> site<00:01:53.520> back<00:01:53.819> and

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:53.999 
and white for example if I site back and

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:56.029 
and white for example if I site back and
wait<00:01:54.179> you'll<00:01:54.779> see<00:01:54.840> around<00:01:55.139> the<00:01:55.289> outside<00:01:55.679> that

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
wait you'll see around the outside that

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:57.800 
wait you'll see around the outside that
the<00:01:56.189> image<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.520> now<00:01:56.669> changed<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.299> black<00:01:57.599> and

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
the image is now changed to black and

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.479 
the image is now changed to black and
white<00:01:57.990> you<00:02:00.709> can<00:02:01.709> also<00:02:01.829> change<00:02:02.099> the<00:02:02.219> shutter

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:02.489 
white you can also change the shutter

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:05.629 
white you can also change the shutter
sound<00:02:02.880> as<00:02:03.060> well<00:02:03.619> if<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.739> then<00:02:04.889> click<00:02:05.130> on<00:02:05.310> video

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:05.639 
sound as well if I then click on video

very<00:02:18.659> last<00:02:18.989> you<00:02:19.709> have<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.950> main<00:02:20.129> set<00:02:20.459> up<00:02:20.700> so

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
very last you have the main set up so

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.550 
very last you have the main set up so
whether<00:02:21.659> you<00:02:21.780> want<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:21.989> review<00:02:22.409> the

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
whether you want to review the

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.860 
whether you want to review the
photograph<00:02:23.010> after<00:02:23.489> it's<00:02:23.640> been<00:02:23.790> taken<00:02:24.209> the

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
photograph after it's been taken the

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.899 
photograph after it's been taken the
best<00:02:25.140> pack<00:02:25.560> speed<00:02:25.920> so<00:02:26.220> this<00:02:26.430> is<00:02:26.459> when<00:02:26.700> it'll

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
best pack speed so this is when it'll

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.750 
best pack speed so this is when it'll
take<00:02:27.060> seven<00:02:27.959> shots<00:02:28.230> in<00:02:28.440> quick<00:02:28.590> succession<00:02:28.920> and

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
take seven shots in quick succession and

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.430 
take seven shots in quick succession and
you<00:02:29.849> can<00:02:30.030> choose<00:02:30.209> how<00:02:30.360> fast<00:02:30.690> or<00:02:30.930> slow<00:02:30.989> you<00:02:31.260> want

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
you can choose how fast or slow you want

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.100 
you can choose how fast or slow you want
that<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.739> be<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.670> can't<00:02:32.879> um<00:02:33.030> geotag<00:02:33.569> on<00:02:33.840> and

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
that to be you can't um geotag on and

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.380 
that to be you can't um geotag on and
off<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:34.440> what<00:02:34.560> this<00:02:34.680> will<00:02:34.860> do<00:02:34.980> is<00:02:35.010> use<00:02:35.400> GPS<00:02:36.360> to

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
off so what this will do is use GPS to

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.420 
off so what this will do is use GPS to
pinpoint<00:02:37.110> exactly<00:02:37.620> where<00:02:37.890> in<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.069> waddle<00:02:38.310> the

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
pinpoint exactly where in the waddle the

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.309 
pinpoint exactly where in the waddle the
photograph<00:02:38.849> was<00:02:38.879> taken<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.930> then<00:02:40.170> obviously

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
photograph was taken and then obviously

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.500 
photograph was taken and then obviously
auto-rotate<00:02:40.950> will<00:02:41.730> allow<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.090> change<00:02:42.390> the

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
auto-rotate will allow you to change the
