00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
much of the free throw line more than we

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.720 
much of the free throw line more than we
wanted<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.649> but<00:01:01.949> those<00:01:02.100> guys<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.340> great

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.870 
he I think for him you know it's easy
you<00:01:43.020> know<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.409> he<00:01:43.890> got<00:01:44.340> there<00:01:44.549> in<00:01:44.640> at<00:01:44.729> their

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
you know and he got there in at their

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.480 
you know and he got there in at their
court<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.270> he<00:01:45.329> just<00:01:45.509> went<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.780> work<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.490> again

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
court and he just went to work and again

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.340 
court and he just went to work and again
he<00:01:47.610> did<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:47.939> when<00:01:48.540> we're<00:01:48.659> at<00:01:48.810> home<00:01:48.840> against

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
he did that when we're at home against

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.859 
he did that when we're at home against
Philly<00:01:50.189> he<00:01:51.000> helped<00:01:51.299> us<00:01:51.360> win<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.720> ballgame

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
Philly he helped us win that ballgame

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.480 
Philly he helped us win that ballgame
there<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.560> think<00:01:52.680> it's<00:01:52.950> just<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.189> matter<00:01:53.310> of

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
there so I think it's just a matter of

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.359 
there so I think it's just a matter of
him<00:01:53.820> getting<00:01:54.420> some<00:01:54.630> more<00:01:54.750> touches<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.500> feel

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
him getting some more touches and feel

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.069 
him getting some more touches and feel
uncomfortable<00:01:56.850> no<00:01:57.240> one<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.570> locker<00:01:57.840> room
