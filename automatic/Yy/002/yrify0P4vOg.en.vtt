00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 youtube hall welcome new to a 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.400
 singing to box i've just been around 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.550
 Frozen appointment but against the camera 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.650
 but you are still live 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.059
 The package was not up yet 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.559
 it does not come from amazon 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.910
 strikes and we can already here 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:23.130
 pull something out and that's all tata 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:25.830
 tata logitech keyboard mini now thinks 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.480
 you all want wtf that technology 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.099
 sloth falling in love with me 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.840
 yes you have correctly reminded that the 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.680
 black version is here 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.710
 already in front of me 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.329
 with whom I have so last week 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.000
 played and still use them 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.410
 Of course you can do that daily 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.120
 no conclusions about quality 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.280
 processing and whether you even at all 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.980
 However, this little thing can type 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.890
 I have a white ipad and like that 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.329
 big with the black one 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.449
 not disturbed so far 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.920
 and I say so far I have 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.379
 now just the white version 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:11.130
 Naturally seen and must say that is 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:13.350
 but visually something else to me too 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.729
 would say and that's why I have 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.729
 just slammed again 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:30.390
 the adhesive strips on the edge once and 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.369
 have to be on twice and that was it 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.270
 then 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.189
 Funny enough, it is different 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.439
 packaging and I do not believe in that 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.979
 but on the black one that is 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.659
 black thing on it so and have now 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.229
 we learned last time 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:52.860
 we can easily pull that out 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:55.079
 sexy and lift and that was it 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.670
 already that was the main keyboard under 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.250
 the cover is nothing more and 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.710
 we still have ours up here 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.049
 manual hidden with 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.530
 manual important and one 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:10.130
 Micro USB cable for loading no 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.470
 logitech sticker with you 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.690
 Of course, the keyboard itself does not 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:21.620
 difference to the black except in the 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:22.820
 color the race short model and we 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.360
 You can spend time together next to each other 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:29.930
 because there is no difference to see 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.350
 but now with the white ipad 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.840
 it looks like a whole corner 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.000
 more chic as I think again 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:44.600
 magnets 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:46.850
 and if it then works then looks 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.240
 that's right here with the 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:54.220
 silver backs it fits better 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:57.260
 to the white device than that's exactly what 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.700
 black from black so that like me 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
 say that I'm not quite here 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.120
 black this is black as when 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.510
 ipad mini from the back is pretty 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.520
 good but the silver tells me 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.570
 Nevertheless I hope for better then 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.670
 also less fingerprints and the one 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.560
 or other scratches you can see 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.050
 probably less worries that's it 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.090
 Thanks for watching it makes it good 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.090
 and bye video bye
