get it out of your way that's probably

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.830 
get it out of your way that's probably
one<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.610> key<00:01:50.820> things<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.299> managing<00:01:51.810> your

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
one of the key things is managing your

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.780 
one of the key things is managing your
glue<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.890> then<00:01:53.100> I'm<00:01:53.189> going<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.369> just<00:01:53.520> give<00:01:53.670> this

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
glue so then I'm going to just give this

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.940 
glue so then I'm going to just give this
a<00:01:53.939> quick<00:01:53.970> rub<00:01:54.390> down<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:55.020> then<00:01:55.470> I'm<00:01:55.590> just<00:01:55.619> going

a quick rub down and then I'm just going
to<00:01:56.210> trim<00:01:57.210> my<00:01:57.240> corners<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:58.110> do<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.290> fold<00:01:58.649> in<00:01:59.000> quick

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
to trim my corners to do a fold in quick

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.630 
to trim my corners to do a fold in quick
trim<00:02:00.450> it's<00:02:01.200> usually<00:02:01.500> two<00:02:01.710> board<00:02:02.009> thicknesses

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
trim it's usually two board thicknesses

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.920 
trim it's usually two board thicknesses
away<00:02:02.939> I'm<00:02:03.450> just<00:02:03.509> kind<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:03.930> estimating<00:02:04.560> now

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
away I'm just kind of estimating now

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.859 
away I'm just kind of estimating now
okay<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.259> then<00:02:08.250> get<00:02:08.759> those<00:02:08.910> all<00:02:09.119> away<00:02:09.420> and

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
again I work right on top of a whole

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.660 
again I work right on top of a whole
of<00:02:12.989> newsprint<00:02:13.799> that<00:02:14.129> way<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.310> don't<00:02:14.430> have<00:02:14.549> to

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
of newsprint that way I don't have to

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.309 
of newsprint that way I don't have to
get<00:02:14.909> up<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.209> move<00:02:15.360> things<00:02:15.659> so<00:02:16.079> I'm<00:02:16.140> going<00:02:16.260> to

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
little corners just use your bone folder

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.339 
little corners just use your bone folder
it'll<00:02:26.430> drag<00:02:26.700> in<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:27.689> is<00:02:27.900> I'm<00:02:28.049> just<00:02:28.079> going

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.539 
parallel with the book board it drags in
that<00:02:30.450> side<00:02:30.689> just<00:02:31.500> enough<00:02:31.859> and<00:02:32.189> then<00:02:32.430> I'm

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
that side just enough and then I'm

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.830 
that side just enough and then I'm
folding<00:02:33.590> again<00:02:34.590> drag<00:02:35.549> in<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.849> side<00:02:36.120> just

folder<00:02:49.230> but<00:02:49.920> I<00:02:50.010> check<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:50.609> see<00:02:50.790> if<00:02:51.060> there's<00:02:51.239> any

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
folder but I check to see if there's any

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.270 
folder but I check to see if there's any
wrinkles<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.230> then<00:02:52.349> I<00:02:52.470> just<00:02:52.680> smooth<00:02:52.950> them<00:02:53.099> out

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
wrinkles and then I just smooth them out

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.869 
wrinkles and then I just smooth them out
so<00:02:53.909> that's<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:55.319> basic<00:02:55.769> tip<00:02:56.040> on<00:02:56.250> gluing<00:02:56.760> you

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
so that's the basic tip on gluing you

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.259 
so that's the basic tip on gluing you
need<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.150> use<00:02:57.329> enough<00:02:57.659> to<00:02:58.019> get<00:02:58.169> an<00:02:58.290> even<00:02:58.560> story

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
need to use enough to get an even story

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.360 
need to use enough to get an even story
just<00:03:00.269> take<00:03:00.450> your<00:03:00.629> time<00:03:00.840> but<00:03:01.230> also<00:03:01.409> have<00:03:01.829> a<00:03:02.099> good

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
brush and a wet paper towel so you can
