one<00:00:00.630> day<00:00:00.810> you<00:00:00.870> might<00:00:01.199> come<00:00:01.439> out<00:00:01.560> to<00:00:01.740> discover

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
one day you might come out to discover

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.059 
one day you might come out to discover
that<00:00:02.850> the<00:00:03.240> antenna<00:00:03.600> on<00:00:03.689> your<00:00:04.049> car<00:00:04.259> has<00:00:04.799> been

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
that the antenna on your car has been

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.220 
that the antenna on your car has been
damaged<00:00:05.580> either<00:00:05.790> through<00:00:06.450> an<00:00:06.839> active

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
damaged either through an active

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.370 
damaged either through an active
vandalism<00:00:07.919> or<00:00:08.160> an<00:00:08.730> unfortunate<00:00:09.389> mishap<00:00:10.019> with

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
vandalism or an unfortunate mishap with

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.890 
vandalism or an unfortunate mishap with
a<00:00:10.469> tree<00:00:10.710> limb<00:00:10.950> perhaps<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.820> we're<00:00:12.630> gonna<00:00:12.780> take

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
a tree limb perhaps and we're gonna take

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.690 
a tree limb perhaps and we're gonna take
a<00:00:12.960> look<00:00:13.049> at<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.290> procedure<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:14.250> might<00:00:14.549> be

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
a look at the procedure that might be

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.980 
a look at the procedure that might be
typical<00:00:15.210> for<00:00:15.260> changing<00:00:16.260> out<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.250> antenna<00:00:17.990> the

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
typical for changing out the antenna the

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.939 
typical for changing out the antenna the
first<00:00:19.199> thing<00:00:19.320> we're<00:00:19.439> going<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.590> do<00:00:19.710> in<00:00:19.859> this

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
first thing we're going to do in this

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.550 
first thing we're going to do in this
case<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.430> we're<00:00:21.090> going<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.390> remove<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.260> mast

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
case is we're going to remove the mast

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.400 
case is we're going to remove the mast
and<00:00:23.060> many<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.240> your<00:00:24.390> mass<00:00:24.689> today<00:00:24.960> are

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
and many of your mass today are

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.279 
and many of your mass today are
removable<00:00:26.330> separate<00:00:27.330> from<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.720> rest<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.109> the

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
removable separate from the rest of the

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.960 
removable separate from the rest of the
antenna<00:00:28.680> unit<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.220> it's<00:00:29.490> just<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.699> matter<00:00:29.880> of

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
antenna unit and it's just a matter of

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.729 
antenna unit and it's just a matter of
taking<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.390> wrench<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.980> unthreading<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.279> unit

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.619 

and<00:00:37.739> if<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.460> was<00:00:38.670> all<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:39.000> was<00:00:39.149> damaged

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
and if this was all that was damaged

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.959 
and if this was all that was damaged
it's<00:00:40.530> possible<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.640> could<00:00:41.760> simply

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
it's possible that you could simply

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.150 
it's possible that you could simply
thread<00:00:42.329> another<00:00:42.660> one<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.079> there<00:00:43.290> but<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:44.040> many

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
thread another one in there but in many

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.970 
thread another one in there but in many
cases<00:00:44.719> the<00:00:45.719> threads<00:00:46.050> could<00:00:46.200> be<00:00:46.320> damaged<00:00:46.800> as

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
cases the threads could be damaged as

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.330 
cases the threads could be damaged as
well<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.460> one<00:00:47.690> the<00:00:48.690> base<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.649> has<00:00:49.829> female

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
well this one the base of it has female

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.689 
well this one the base of it has female
threads<00:00:50.910> but<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:51.300> many<00:00:51.510> cases<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.579> faces<00:00:53.579> have

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
threads but in many cases the faces have

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.100 
threads but in many cases the faces have
male<00:00:53.969> threads<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.449> they<00:00:54.570> can't<00:00:54.780> become

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
male threads and they can't become

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.549 
male threads and they can't become
broken<00:00:55.350> off<00:00:55.710> if<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.760> antenna<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.329> damaged<00:00:57.840> so

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
broken off if the antenna is damaged so

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.110 
broken off if the antenna is damaged so
if<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.739> needed<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.070> replace<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.640> lower<00:00:59.789> part

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
if you needed to replace the lower part

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.849 
if you needed to replace the lower part
of<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.359> we<00:01:00.719> need<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.899> do<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.170> little<00:01:01.379> more<00:01:01.559> work

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
of it we need to do a little more work

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.340 
of it we need to do a little more work
in<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.670> case<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.690> antenna<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.019> mounted<00:01:04.140> on

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
in this case the antenna is mounted on

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.170 
in this case the antenna is mounted on
the<00:01:04.439> back<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.860> car<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.339> we'll<00:01:05.790> start<00:01:06.030> on

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
the back of the car and we'll start on

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.100 
the back of the car and we'll start on
the<00:01:06.240> inside<00:01:06.420> by<00:01:07.140> removing<00:01:08.270> first<00:01:09.270> off<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
the inside by removing first off the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:24.170 
the inside by removing first off the
ground<00:01:10.650> screw<00:01:20.750> and<00:01:22.220> then<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.520> nut<00:01:23.939> that

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
ground screw and then the nut that

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:34.840 
ground screw and then the nut that
supports<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.840> lower<00:01:24.990> part<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.710> bracket

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:41.540 

then<00:01:35.850> we<00:01:36.060> will<00:01:36.240> remove<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:37.770> antenna<00:01:38.070> lead<00:01:40.550> if

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
then we will remove the antenna lead if

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.110 
then we will remove the antenna lead if
I<00:01:41.640> point<00:01:41.910> it<00:01:42.150> out<00:01:43.370> removing<00:01:44.370> that<00:01:44.520> from<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
I point it out removing that from the

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.170 
I point it out removing that from the
bracket<00:01:45.540> as<00:01:45.750> well<00:01:47.690> then<00:01:48.690> back<00:01:49.200> at<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.440> top

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
bracket as well then back at the top

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.980 
bracket as well then back at the top
will<00:01:51.180> remove<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:52.020> nut<00:01:52.910> that<00:01:53.910> holds<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.660> to<00:01:54.840> the

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
will remove the nut that holds it to the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:07.389 
will remove the nut that holds it to the
fender<00:01:58.580> that's<00:01:59.580> reading<00:02:00.030> it

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.020 

remove<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:10.220> discussion<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.400> gas<00:02:11.610> gets<00:02:11.910> out

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
remove the discussion and gas gets out

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.290 
remove the discussion and gas gets out
of<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.180> way<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:13.160> then<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.700> antenna<00:02:15.000> base

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
of the way and then the antenna base

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.300 
of the way and then the antenna base
will<00:02:16.230> come<00:02:16.410> out<00:02:18.590> antennas<00:02:19.590> that<00:02:19.800> are<00:02:19.890> on<00:02:20.040> the

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
will come out antennas that are on the

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.240 
will come out antennas that are on the
front<00:02:20.940> of<00:02:21.120> an<00:02:21.240> automobile<00:02:21.570> are<00:02:22.380> typically<00:02:23.010> not

front of an automobile are typically not
as<00:02:23.490> easy<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.650> lead<00:02:25.650> that<00:02:25.830> we<00:02:26.010> have<00:02:26.250> here<00:02:26.580> is

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
as easy the lead that we have here is

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.820 
as easy the lead that we have here is
fairly<00:02:27.000> short<00:02:27.510> typically<00:02:28.380> on<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.590> front<00:02:28.800> of

the car to the back of the stereo and

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.320 
the car to the back of the stereo and
that<00:02:37.830> can<00:02:37.950> complicate<00:02:38.310> things<00:02:38.670> first<00:02:39.000> off<00:02:39.180> you

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
that can complicate things first off you

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.840 
that can complicate things first off you
have<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.510> fish<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.500> cable<00:02:40.860> through<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.430> in

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
have to fish the cable through and in

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.490 
have to fish the cable through and in
many<00:02:41.970> cases<00:02:42.390> you<00:02:42.540> will<00:02:42.570> have<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:42.900> remove<00:02:43.230> the

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
many cases you will have to remove the

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.460 
many cases you will have to remove the
radio<00:02:45.050> and<00:02:46.310> actually<00:02:47.310> remove<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:48.120> cable<00:02:48.630> and

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
radio and actually remove the cable and

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.979 
radio and actually remove the cable and
from<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.160> back<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.790> stereo<00:02:51.239> itself<00:02:51.720> and

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
from the back of the stereo itself and

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.670 
from the back of the stereo itself and
so<00:02:52.500> that<00:02:52.709> can<00:02:52.800> be<00:02:52.890> somewhat<00:02:53.340> more<00:02:53.520> involved<00:02:54.680> to

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
so that can be somewhat more involved to

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.460 
so that can be somewhat more involved to
reinstall<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.730> new<00:02:56.970> one<00:02:57.180> in<00:02:57.450> his<00:02:57.750> opposite<00:02:58.290> of

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
reinstall a new one in his opposite of

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.920 
reinstall a new one in his opposite of
the<00:02:59.220> removal<00:02:59.670> procedure<00:03:00.060> just<00:03:00.390> reverse<00:03:00.750> the

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
the removal procedure just reverse the

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:09.010 
the removal procedure just reverse the
process<00:03:02.000> so<00:03:03.000> in<00:03:03.090> this<00:03:03.180> case<00:03:03.390> we<00:03:03.840> will

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.140 

let's<00:03:10.020> stall<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:14.160> bass<00:03:14.370> through<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.819> fender

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
let's stall the bass through the fender

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:28.759 
let's stall the bass through the fender
and<00:03:16.370> reinstall<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.580> discussion<00:03:27.440> and<00:03:28.440> we'll

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
and reinstall the discussion and we'll

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.309 
and reinstall the discussion and we'll
start<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.310> nut<00:03:29.870> but<00:03:30.870> we<00:03:30.989> won't<00:03:31.170> actually

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
start the nut but we won't actually

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:38.120 
start the nut but we won't actually
tighten<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.099> all<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.250> way<00:03:32.519> as<00:03:32.819> of<00:03:33.090> yet<00:03:37.130> and

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
then we will re install the stud through

00:03:42.680 --> 00:04:00.259 
then we will re install the stud through
the<00:03:43.680> support<00:03:53.660> and<00:03:54.660> install<00:03:54.989> them<00:03:55.170> nut<00:03:59.269> and
