00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
the holes in it and if I back out for a

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.070 
the holes in it and if I back out for a
second<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.939> spin<00:01:09.150> around<00:01:09.240> as<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.840> can<00:01:09.869> see

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
second and I spin around as you can see

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.899 
second and I spin around as you can see
here<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.590> actually<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.100> short<00:01:11.460> cloak<00:01:11.700> so

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
here it is actually a short cloak so

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.070 
here it is actually a short cloak so
it's<00:01:12.000> not<00:01:12.090> actually<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.720> know<00:01:12.810> as<00:01:12.900> long<00:01:13.020> as

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
it's not actually you know as long as

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.780 
it's not actually you know as long as
say<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.350> vault<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.650> glass<00:01:13.710> one<00:01:14.159> or<00:01:14.670> anything

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
say the vault of glass one or anything

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.170 
say the vault of glass one or anything
like<00:01:14.970> that

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
like that

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.539 
like that
but<00:01:15.420> if<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.570> check<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.840> out<00:01:15.900> in<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.320> game<00:01:17.310> world

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
but if I check it out in the game world

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.070 
but if I check it out in the game world
with<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.970> lighting<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.630> does<00:01:18.810> look<00:01:18.990> quite

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
with the lighting it does look quite

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.420 
with the lighting it does look quite
cool<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.439> probably<00:01:19.740> doesn't<00:01:19.890> suit<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.220> shader

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
cool it probably doesn't suit the shader

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.039 
cool it probably doesn't suit the shader
that<00:01:20.580> I've<00:01:20.670> got<00:01:20.850> but<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.420> do<00:01:21.509> just<00:01:21.780> like<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
that I've got but I do just like the

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.300 
that I've got but I do just like the
sort<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.229> distressed<00:01:22.650> look<00:01:22.830> with<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.220> I've

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
sort of distressed look with it and I've

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.679 
sort of distressed look with it and I've
received<00:01:23.460> by<00:01:23.729> water<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.150> some<00:01:24.360> armor<00:01:24.600> that

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
received by water of some armor that

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.690 
received by water of some armor that
doesn't<00:01:24.930> look<00:01:25.020> quite<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.259> sore<00:01:25.650> pristine<00:01:26.100> then

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
doesn't look quite so sore pristine then

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.649 
doesn't look quite so sore pristine then
it<00:01:26.759> would<00:01:26.850> probably<00:01:26.970> look<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.360> hell<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.570> lot

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
it would probably look a hell of a lot

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.090 
it would probably look a hell of a lot
better<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:28.200> fact<00:01:28.380> let<00:01:28.619> me<00:01:28.680> just<00:01:28.829> quickly<00:01:28.920> go

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
better in fact let me just quickly go

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.980 
better in fact let me just quickly go
and<00:01:29.369> change<00:01:29.640> my<00:01:29.729> shader<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.720> actually

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
and change my shader you actually

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.359 
and change my shader you actually
probably<00:01:31.229> see<00:01:31.350> what<00:01:31.500> looks<00:01:31.650> like<00:01:31.740> let's<00:01:32.159> pick

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
probably see what looks like let's pick

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.800 
probably see what looks like let's pick
something<00:01:32.610> like<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.909> cryptographic<00:01:33.270> that

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
something like the cryptographic that

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.569 
something like the cryptographic that
seems<00:01:34.020> like<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.259> optimal<00:01:34.530> soph<00:01:34.770> shader<00:01:35.430> for

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
seems like it optimal soph shader for

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.010 
seems like it optimal soph shader for
that<00:01:35.700> one<00:01:35.820> there<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.329> go<00:01:36.450> doesn't<00:01:36.810> looks<00:01:36.930> like

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
that one there you go doesn't looks like

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.980 
that one there you go doesn't looks like
about<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.290> time<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.390> hard<00:01:39.720> case

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
about the time so that is the hard case

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.219 
about the time so that is the hard case
cloak<00:01:40.320> now<00:01:40.799> let's<00:01:40.950> move<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.369> number<00:01:41.640> four

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
cloak now let's move on to number four

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.649 
cloak now let's move on to number four
this<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.860> H<00:01:44.100> OD<00:01:44.460> star<00:01:44.790> Winer<00:01:45.030> cloak<00:01:45.360> this

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
this is the H OD star Winer cloak this

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.330 
this is the H OD star Winer cloak this
was<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.930> cloak<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.500> could<00:01:46.680> buy<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:46.920> from

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
was a cloak that you could buy it from

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.190 
was a cloak that you could buy it from
the<00:01:47.759> vanguard<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.570> from<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.810> crucible

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
the vanguard and from the crucible

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.590 
the vanguard and from the crucible
vendors<00:01:50.040> back<00:01:50.369> before<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.090> doc<00:01:51.210> below<00:01:51.420> came

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
vendors back before the doc below came

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.940 
vendors back before the doc below came
out<00:01:51.750> they<00:01:51.869> have<00:01:52.079> obviously<00:01:52.320> refreshed<00:01:52.799> their

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
out they have obviously refreshed their

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.200 
out they have obviously refreshed their
stock<00:01:53.130> since<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.579> they<00:01:53.670> do<00:01:53.729> now<00:01:54.000> sell

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
stock since and they do now sell

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.850 
stock since and they do now sell
different<00:01:54.600> folks<00:01:54.780> but<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.380> was<00:01:55.590> for<00:01:55.770> sale

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
different folks but this was for sale

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.590 
different folks but this was for sale
back<00:01:56.100> then<00:01:56.280> from<00:01:56.490> those<00:01:56.729> guys<00:01:56.939> now<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.450> looks

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
back then from those guys now this looks

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.760 
back then from those guys now this looks
really<00:01:57.869> really<00:01:58.049> cool<00:01:58.200> it's<00:01:58.380> got<00:01:58.469> this<00:01:58.560> cool

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
really really cool it's got this cool

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.050 
really really cool it's got this cool
design<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.159> back<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.729> if<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.000> actually

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
design on the back and if I actually

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.609 
design on the back and if I actually
jump<00:02:00.390> out<00:02:00.479> for<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.659> seconds<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.049> can<00:02:01.170> see<00:02:01.200> that

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
jump out for a seconds you can see that

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.530 
jump out for a seconds you can see that
it<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.829> really<00:02:02.130> long<00:02:02.340> cloak<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:03.149> does<00:02:03.299> join

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
it is a really long cloak it does join

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.969 
it is a really long cloak it does join
at<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.689> bottom<00:02:03.960> which<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.380> only<00:02:04.649> kind<00:02:04.890> of

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
at the bottom which is the only kind of

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:05.929 
at the bottom which is the only kind of
sort<00:02:05.130> of<00:02:05.159> negative<00:02:05.460> thing<00:02:05.579> about<00:02:05.610> this<00:02:05.820> it

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
sort of negative thing about this it

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:06.980 
sort of negative thing about this it
looks<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.119> little<00:02:06.180> bit<00:02:06.360> weird<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.750> way<00:02:06.840> this

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
looks a little bit weird the way this

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.260 
looks a little bit weird the way this
all<00:02:07.110> like<00:02:07.290> tied<00:02:07.680> together<00:02:07.860> but<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.819> does<00:02:09.030> look

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
all like tied together but it does look

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.460 
all like tied together but it does look
pretty<00:02:09.300> damn<00:02:09.690> cool<00:02:09.959> when<00:02:10.229> you're<00:02:10.289> start

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
pretty damn cool when you're start

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.650 
pretty damn cool when you're start
running<00:02:10.679> around<00:02:10.940> especially<00:02:11.940> again<00:02:12.330> if<00:02:12.540> you

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
running around especially again if you

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.140 
running around especially again if you
have<00:02:12.810> so

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
have so

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.369 
have so
slightly<00:02:13.329> more<00:02:13.480> distressed<00:02:13.900> looking<00:02:14.140> shader

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
slightly more distressed looking shader

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.559 
slightly more distressed looking shader
so<00:02:14.680> I<00:02:15.069> particularly<00:02:15.519> like<00:02:15.730> this<00:02:15.849> one<00:02:16.060> with<00:02:16.390> the

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
so I particularly like this one with the

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.229 
so I particularly like this one with the
God<00:02:16.810> of<00:02:16.840> War<00:02:17.019> shader<00:02:17.290> on<00:02:17.500> just<00:02:18.040> because<00:02:18.239> he

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
God of War shader on just because he

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.229 
God of War shader on just because he
looks<00:02:19.420> all<00:02:19.569> red<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.079> cool<00:02:20.310> like<00:02:21.310> so<00:02:21.519> you<00:02:22.120> can

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
looks all red and cool like so you can

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:23.789 
looks all red and cool like so you can
see<00:02:22.390> obviously<00:02:22.840> my<00:02:23.170> goal<00:02:23.349> is<00:02:23.470> don't<00:02:23.620> change

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
see obviously my goal is don't change

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.350 
see obviously my goal is don't change
color<00:02:24.010> but<00:02:24.310> that<00:02:24.459> does<00:02:24.790> look<00:02:24.939> pretty<00:02:25.000> damn

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
color but that does look pretty damn

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.259 
color but that does look pretty damn
cool<00:02:26.189> then<00:02:27.189> moving<00:02:27.430> on<00:02:27.549> to<00:02:27.579> number<00:02:27.730> three<00:02:28.090> you

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
cool then moving on to number three you

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.569 
cool then moving on to number three you
have<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.689> red<00:02:28.959> Eclipse<00:02:29.379> cloak<00:02:29.650> now<00:02:29.829> this<00:02:30.010> is<00:02:30.370> I

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
have the red Eclipse cloak now this is I

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:31.830 
have the red Eclipse cloak now this is I
was<00:02:30.760> kinda<00:02:30.939> like<00:02:31.000> torn<00:02:31.269> between<00:02:31.510> whether<00:02:31.629> to

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
was kinda like torn between whether to

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.539 
was kinda like torn between whether to
put<00:02:31.930> their<00:02:32.049> second<00:02:32.290> or<00:02:32.379> third<00:02:32.439> but<00:02:33.129> this<00:02:33.370> is

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
put their second or third but this is

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.160 
put their second or third but this is
still<00:02:34.120> one<00:02:34.209> of<00:02:34.239> my<00:02:34.329> favorite<00:02:34.629> cloaks<00:02:34.840> it<00:02:35.019> just

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
still one of my favorite cloaks it just

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.599 
still one of my favorite cloaks it just
looks<00:02:35.319> really<00:02:35.530> really<00:02:35.769> awesome<00:02:35.859> and<00:02:36.159> this<00:02:36.280> is

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:36.609 
looks really really awesome and this is

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:37.710 
looks really really awesome and this is
one<00:02:36.730> of<00:02:36.819> the<00:02:36.879> ones<00:02:37.000> you<00:02:37.150> can<00:02:37.269> buy<00:02:37.390> from<00:02:37.540> both

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
one of the ones you can buy from both

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.630 
one of the ones you can buy from both
the<00:02:37.870> Vanguard<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.409> the<00:02:38.829> crucible<00:02:39.310> vendors

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
the Vanguard and the crucible vendors

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
communication on the shoulder which I

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.970 
communication on the shoulder which I
kind<00:02:52.720> of<00:02:52.750> like<00:02:52.810> but<00:02:53.290> you<00:02:53.409> can<00:02:53.620> get<00:02:53.769> a<00:02:53.799> version

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
kind of like but you can get a version

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.670 
kind of like but you can get a version
without<00:02:54.250> that<00:02:54.579> so<00:02:55.329> if<00:02:55.389> you<00:02:55.480> see<00:02:55.629> what<00:02:56.530> looks

cool<00:02:58.239> I<00:02:58.450> think<00:02:58.480> this<00:02:58.780> one<00:02:58.959> probably<00:02:59.290> looks

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
cool I think this one probably looks

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.710 
cool I think this one probably looks
best<00:02:59.709> when<00:02:59.920> I<00:02:59.980> use<00:03:00.280> Eris's<00:03:01.150> first<00:03:01.480> shader

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
best when I use Eris's first shader

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.399 
best when I use Eris's first shader
which<00:03:02.379> is<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:03.069> pre-dawn<00:03:03.549> one<00:03:04.290> because<00:03:05.290> then

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
which is the pre-dawn one because then

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:06.809 
which is the pre-dawn one because then
it<00:03:05.500> comes<00:03:05.650> out<00:03:05.739> red<00:03:05.980> with<00:03:06.250> us<00:03:06.340> or<00:03:06.459> like<00:03:06.609> green

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
it comes out red with us or like green

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.000 
it comes out red with us or like green
beyond<00:03:07.030> there<00:03:07.180> looks<00:03:07.420> really<00:03:07.870> cool<00:03:08.019> so<00:03:08.470> that

a<00:03:34.900> lot<00:03:35.019> different<00:03:35.560> and<00:03:35.769> again<00:03:35.889> it<00:03:36.099> was<00:03:36.190> one<00:03:36.310> of

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
a lot different and again it was one of

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.649 
a lot different and again it was one of
those<00:03:36.459> rare<00:03:36.669> cloaks<00:03:36.909> that<00:03:37.000> I<00:03:37.120> was<00:03:37.329> just<00:03:37.480> ready

those rare cloaks that I was just ready

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:39.030 
those rare cloaks that I was just ready
to<00:03:37.750> solve<00:03:38.049> like<00:03:38.169> hit<00:03:38.349> delete<00:03:38.590> or<00:03:38.769> not<00:03:38.919> hate

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
to solve like hit delete or not hate

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.619 
to solve like hit delete or not hate
it's<00:03:39.129> all<00:03:39.220> like<00:03:39.340> dismantle<00:03:39.819> but<00:03:40.389> again<00:03:40.599> I

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:40.629 
it's all like dismantle but again I

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:41.879 
it's all like dismantle but again I
double<00:03:40.930> checked<00:03:41.109> it<00:03:41.260> and<00:03:41.379> in<00:03:41.620> fact<00:03:41.739> that's

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
double checked it and in fact that's

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:43.319 
double checked it and in fact that's
what<00:03:41.979> we<00:03:42.129> like<00:03:42.280> a<00:03:42.310> point<00:03:42.819> to<00:03:42.909> know<00:03:43.030> make<00:03:43.299> sure

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
what we like a point to know make sure

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.059 
what we like a point to know make sure
even<00:03:43.810> if<00:03:44.019> you<00:03:44.109> get<00:03:44.260> rare<00:03:44.440> items<00:03:44.769> especially

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:18.849 
the second plug so I think you had to be

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:21.240 
the second plug so I think you had to be
ranked<00:04:19.150> four<00:04:19.659> or<00:04:20.079> three<00:04:20.109> or<00:04:20.560> four<00:04:20.709> with

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
ranked four or three or four with

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.769 
ranked four or three or four with
crucible<00:04:21.700> and<00:04:22.090> you<00:04:22.270> can<00:04:22.389> actually<00:04:22.479> buy<00:04:22.719> this

00:04:22.769 --> 00:04:22.779 
crucible and you can actually buy this

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:25.620 
crucible and you can actually buy this
from<00:04:23.289> them<00:04:23.500> but<00:04:24.010> I<00:04:24.219> actually<00:04:24.669> got<00:04:24.940> this<00:04:25.210> from<00:04:25.510> a

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
from them but I actually got this from a

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.560 
from them but I actually got this from a
legendary<00:04:25.990> angry

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
legendary angry

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.900 
legendary angry
so<00:04:26.900> that<00:04:27.260> being<00:04:27.470> said<00:04:27.710> I<00:04:27.920> would<00:04:28.340> imagine<00:04:28.640> you

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
so that being said I would imagine you

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.250 
so that being said I would imagine you
can<00:04:29.060> still<00:04:29.300> get<00:04:29.420> this<00:04:29.540> from<00:04:29.840> a<00:04:29.960> legendary

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
can still get this from a legendary

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.440 
can still get this from a legendary
Engram<00:04:30.650> but<00:04:31.250> unfortunately<00:04:31.940> that<00:04:32.030> does<00:04:32.210> still

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
Engram but unfortunately that does still

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.970 
Engram but unfortunately that does still
mean<00:04:32.630> that<00:04:32.750> you<00:04:32.810> can<00:04:32.900> have<00:04:33.260> to<00:04:33.410> rely<00:04:33.740> on<00:04:33.770> a

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
mean that you can have to rely on a

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.680 
mean that you can have to rely on a
random<00:04:34.370> luck<00:04:34.580> as<00:04:34.760> opposed<00:04:35.180> to<00:04:35.300> being<00:04:35.450> able<00:04:35.570> to

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
random luck as opposed to being able to

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.390 
random luck as opposed to being able to
buy<00:04:35.900> it<00:04:35.960> but<00:04:36.500> this<00:04:36.710> is<00:04:36.890> the<00:04:37.010> cloak<00:04:37.160> I'll<00:04:37.310> be
