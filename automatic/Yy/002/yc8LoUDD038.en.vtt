00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:08.429
 I already tried to hit another guy that you're there. 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.530
 beauty gal who spoke of today bringing 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.799
 to you another minecraft video in a 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.039
 server that is well-known that is the lightning 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.710
 it gets point and occupy you can see is 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.960
 a European server and so I have 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.880
 a certain disadvantage but nothing that 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.340
 stop playing what I'm going to play 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.420
 You are here today in the arcade area and 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.849
 server here 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.679
 are several mini games several mini games 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.620
 and I'm going to play a mini game that is mine. 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.960
 preferred calling the year in December 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.030
 Let's go and find a room while I 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.340
 I explain to you basically how it is 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.559
 This mini game works 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.059
 if you already played the car with the puppy 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.120
 mobile f3 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:52.440
 maybe you remember that name man 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.199
 of tiber because neither w3 had a mode of 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.890
 game in private I called the tim 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.050
 burton 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.469
 What is the meaning of this is basically 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.989
 a trigger bullet would not be on the trigger 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.290
 It would be like a bullet in the gun I do not know 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.090
 what does timber mean to me but I 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.619
 I think it 's a gun I forget the name 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.080
 of tim but if you know what it means 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.659
 Timber tell me in the comments 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.680
 the real meaning of a year in de tiber 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:22.500
 but it's something of a bullet in the owner's 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.229
 of the cei balloon side what is this 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.100
 business, but then how does it work in 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.549
 number 3 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.600
 you had a gun with a single bullet and 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.420
 this bullet 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.479
 You can not kill any guy. 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.820
 with one shot this is basically 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.320
 basically did not work and if you 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.869
 rip your bullet 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.820
 You had a knife, you had. 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.920
 you could kill the guys too then 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.899
 how it worked when you kill a guy 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.540
 you get a bullet no matter whether it's with 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.509
 bow or arrow or with the sword in case 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.759
 Here the game is basically it there you 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.490
 has your number six lives you can 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.040
 use in the deaths six times over for 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.619
 You and your goal is to kill the most of 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.590
 every possible way to stay there in the best 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.690
 possible position is a very difficult game is 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.190
 difficult to hit arrow 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.379
 This is good for you too. 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.830
 which is to train the pvp without soup why not 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.440
 it's fault 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.630
 it is obvious that is the following you have a 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.200
 bow and arrow that kills a hit and you have 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.660
 the wooden sword that kills in 34 gone 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.280
 then this difficulty if you are a 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.260
 wooden sword never had a bow and 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.510
 arrow he will give a hit jack flash 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.520
 You're not even going to shoot me and you'll 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.470
 however the goal is if you 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.420
 have taken care not to 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.570
 be closed does not lead to close on the knee 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.480
 and kill the guys with the sword let's see 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.940
 Here there are less than 15 minutes to 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.720
 start the game are several maps 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.580
 cool is the goal is very cool and 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:55.110
 Come on, I hope I can make a 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.790
 Good luck. 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.920
 deported here 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.320
 This is one of the maps I do not like very much. 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.450
 from this map I do not like the other map 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.390
 which is a bit more open but last longer 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.400
 that he already gave them the guy today 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.959
 who started by still killing him with 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.140
 the flash 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.720
 now the sword play ayew of server 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.820
 European that gladdens me I steer drug 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.700
 I started badly the ace 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:24.060
 Oh, man, I believe the king has a 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.420
 swap in the fucking sword for fuck bill 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.580
 Shit, I'm coming back here, my face. I hate it. 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.200
 Oleg da europa 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:40.950
 I will take this crazy also arrested 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:43.920
 that the flash here I got p &amp; p to 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.260
 playing there and the guy turns behind him 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.390
 face with the band and captain kills kills and 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.640
 have another arrow besides trying to kill 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.580
 a face that dilates the map 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.720
 I got what to kill here, let's drink and 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.420
 play and play 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.880
 damn empt the image plus one for the 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.450
 The face that passed on, no, I have a 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:08.430
 arrow has to use flash fucking shit 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:10.769
 to get a good job. 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.459
 strike I think I do not know which one I answered 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.320
 made 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:18.299
 Let's look more expensive than the attacker. 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:20.880

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.640

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.410
 back closure does not like you compare 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.470
 for two guys he had no beard and drug 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.260
 I'm six kilos 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:33.050
 It's until good, the guys try 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.470

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:39.410

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.240
 that the opinion mw face b seems rather 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.310
 and gave about three months that in 1993 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.960
 the recital is rubbish and you can 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.580
 This guy had seen this guy. 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.140
 had three flashes from where he took so much 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.360

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.730
