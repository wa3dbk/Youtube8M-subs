so we're going to build this I'll get it
ready<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.630> build<00:01:16.400> and<00:01:17.400> with<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> lot<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.630> these

sits from the early 70s the instructions

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.670 
sits from the early 70s the instructions
are<00:01:22.860> very<00:01:23.330> simplistic<00:01:24.330> there's<00:01:24.600> only<00:01:24.720> three

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
are very simplistic there's only three

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.390 
are very simplistic there's only three
steps<00:01:26.659> well<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.930> few<00:01:28.350> parts<00:01:28.710> as<00:01:28.920> easy<00:01:29.100> as<00:01:29.220> you

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
steps well a few parts as easy as you

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.920 
steps well a few parts as easy as you
could<00:01:29.549> just<00:01:29.729> build<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.090> pretty<00:01:30.570> much<00:01:30.689> by

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
could just build it pretty much by

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.090 
could just build it pretty much by
looking<00:01:30.960> at<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.619> box<00:01:33.439> so<00:01:34.439> I'll<00:01:34.500> just<00:01:34.680> go<00:01:34.829> ahead

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
looking at the box so I'll just go ahead

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.490 
looking at the box so I'll just go ahead
and<00:01:35.310> build<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.909> on<00:01:36.060> camera<00:01:36.420> here<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:36.869> boria<00:01:37.290> to

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
and build it on camera here and boria to

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.039 
and build it on camera here and boria to
get<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.400> thing<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:39.299> was<00:01:39.600> going<00:01:39.900> through

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
get the thing that I was going through

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.440 
get the thing that I was going through
kind<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.710> organized<00:01:41.100> my<00:01:41.280> inventory<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.240> saw

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
this in some other small sets I want to

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.960 
this in some other small sets I want to
go<00:01:44.939> ahead<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.180> build<00:01:45.740> and<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.610> thing<00:01:47.850> that

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
go ahead and build and the thing that

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.289 
go ahead and build and the thing that
caught<00:01:48.149> my<00:01:48.299> eye<00:01:48.329> is<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.530> step<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.520> dude<00:01:50.850> just

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
driving this baggage cart I thought that

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.090 
driving this baggage cart I thought that

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.709 
was funny looking
there's<00:01:56.399> many<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.790> many<00:01:56.969> will<00:01:57.180> sets

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
there's many of the many will sets

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.280 
there's many of the many will sets
really<00:01:58.079> have<00:01:58.409> any<00:01:58.799> people<00:01:59.689> built<00:02:00.689> around<00:02:01.020> them

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
really have any people built around them

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.060 
really have any people built around them
there<00:02:01.890> were<00:02:01.979> no<00:02:02.149> minifigures<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.420> any<00:02:03.689> type

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.619 
there were no minifigures of any type
back<00:02:05.070> then<00:02:06.200> so<00:02:07.700> it<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.910> unusual

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
back then so it is unusual

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.440

shiny<00:04:05.950> this<00:04:06.160> is<00:04:06.220> pretty<00:04:06.550> much<00:04:06.640> new<00:04:07.360> out<00:04:07.510> of<00:04:07.540> the

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
shiny this is pretty much new out of the

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.020 
shiny this is pretty much new out of the
box<00:04:09.210> so<00:04:10.210> it's<00:04:10.740> almost<00:04:11.740> in<00:04:11.950> mint<00:04:12.190> condition<00:04:12.250> I

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
box so it's almost in mint condition I

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.300 
box so it's almost in mint condition I
guess<00:04:13.900> it<00:04:14.110> really<00:04:14.230> is<00:04:14.440> mint<00:04:14.860> condition

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.670 

so<00:04:18.310> that's<00:04:18.519> the<00:04:18.840> the<00:04:19.840> baggage<00:04:20.200> carts<00:04:20.500> we'll

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
so that's the the baggage carts we'll

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.200 
so that's the the baggage carts we'll
hook<00:04:20.830> them<00:04:21.010> together<00:04:21.160> now<00:04:21.549> this<00:04:21.730> is<00:04:21.910> the

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
hook them together now this is the

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.960 
hook them together now this is the
dangerous<00:04:22.630> part<00:04:22.780> even<00:04:23.680> though<00:04:23.770> this<00:04:23.920> set<00:04:24.760> has

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
dangerous part even though this set has

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.900 
dangerous part even though this set has
really<00:04:25.300> never<00:04:25.480> been<00:04:26.020> used<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:27.430> parts<00:04:27.730> are

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
really never been used the parts are

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.750 
really never been used the parts are
like<00:04:28.060> new<00:04:28.390> they<00:04:29.290> can<00:04:29.500> still<00:04:29.770> break<00:04:30.070> being

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
like new they can still break being

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.780 
like new they can still break being
brittle<00:04:31.120> from<00:04:31.330> age<00:04:31.540> I'm<00:04:32.050> go<00:04:32.230> ahead<00:04:32.440> and<00:04:32.790> when

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
brittle from age I'm go ahead and when

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.640 
brittle from age I'm go ahead and when
you<00:04:33.820> connect<00:04:34.240> them<00:04:34.420> so<00:04:34.450> they<00:04:34.660> go<00:04:34.780> to<00:04:34.840> that

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
you connect them so they go to that

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.220 
you connect them so they go to that
female<00:04:36.460> openings<00:04:37.120> gotta<00:04:37.390> open<00:04:37.660> up<00:04:37.930> a<00:04:38.050> little

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
female openings gotta open up a little

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.990 
female openings gotta open up a little
bit<00:04:38.790> there<00:04:39.790> we<00:04:39.910> go<00:04:41.280> that's<00:04:42.280> the<00:04:42.340> baggage<00:04:42.700> cart

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
bit there we go that's the baggage cart

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.740 
bit there we go that's the baggage cart
so<00:04:43.780> that<00:04:43.810> apparently<00:04:44.500> is<00:04:44.770> some<00:04:45.010> kind<00:04:45.250> of<00:04:45.310> dude

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
so that apparently is some kind of dude

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.230 
so that apparently is some kind of dude
riding<00:04:46.750> on<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.050> baggage<00:04:47.380> cart<00:04:47.940> it's<00:04:48.940> a<00:04:49.000> really

riding on the baggage cart it's a really

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.220 
riding on the baggage cart it's a really
simple<00:04:49.600> set<00:04:50.100> you<00:04:51.100> will<00:04:51.280> not<00:04:51.460> fit<00:04:51.790> in<00:04:51.820> the<00:04:52.060> box

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
simple set you will not fit in the box

and each time I look at this we get to

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:24.900 
and each time I look at this we get to
the<00:05:23.740> point<00:05:23.950> where<00:05:24.160> we<00:05:24.250> have<00:05:24.430> less<00:05:24.669> and<00:05:24.850> less

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
the point where we have less and less

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.380 
the point where we have less and less
sets<00:05:25.419> left<00:05:25.750> for<00:05:26.020> me<00:05:26.110> to<00:05:26.140> build<00:05:26.880> we've<00:05:27.880> built<00:05:28.210> a
