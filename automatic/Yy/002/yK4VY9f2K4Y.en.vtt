the<00:00:00.210> images<00:00:00.599> of<00:00:00.750> viruses<00:00:01.199> that<00:00:01.439> we<00:00:01.589> see<00:00:01.860> in<00:00:02.040> the

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
the images of viruses that we see in the

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.670 
the images of viruses that we see in the
media<00:00:02.460> in<00:00:03.300> newspapers<00:00:04.020> and<00:00:04.230> on<00:00:04.470> television

have<00:00:05.460> been<00:00:05.609> artificially<00:00:05.910> colored<00:00:06.500> virus<00:00:07.500> is

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:07.790 
have been artificially colored virus is

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.390 
have been artificially colored virus is
transparent<00:00:08.809> so<00:00:10.070> somewhere<00:00:11.070> along<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.340> way

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
transparent so somewhere along the way

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.810 
transparent so somewhere along the way
you<00:00:11.700> know<00:00:11.820> scientists<00:00:12.750> or<00:00:12.960> journalists<00:00:13.590> or

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 
you know scientists or journalists or

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.310 
you know scientists or journalists or
perhaps<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:15.089> science<00:00:15.420> photo<00:00:15.599> library<00:00:15.960> they

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
perhaps the science photo library they

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.769 
perhaps the science photo library they
doctor<00:00:16.830> them<00:00:16.980> they<00:00:17.220> color<00:00:17.490> them<00:00:17.779> artificially

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
doctor them they color them artificially

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.689 
doctor them they color them artificially
just<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.710> produce<00:00:19.890> an<00:00:20.220> emotional<00:00:20.609> response

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
just to produce an emotional response

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.200 
just to produce an emotional response
perhaps<00:00:21.119> in<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.720> viewer<00:00:21.900> so<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:23.820> can<00:00:23.970> end<00:00:24.119> up

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
perhaps in the viewer so you can end up

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.120 
perhaps in the viewer so you can end up
with<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.420> public

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
with the public

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.830 
with the public
believing<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:26.269> viruses<00:00:27.269> are<00:00:27.660> actually

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
believing that viruses are actually

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.320 
believing that viruses are actually
these<00:00:28.140> brightly<00:00:28.470> colored<00:00:28.949> things<00:00:29.789> so<00:00:30.119> my

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
these brightly colored things so my

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.659 
these brightly colored things so my
sculptures<00:00:31.109> were<00:00:31.590> three-dimensional<00:00:32.399> and

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
sculptures were three-dimensional and

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.180 
sculptures were three-dimensional and
they're<00:00:33.180> transparent<00:00:33.920> well<00:00:34.920> we'll<00:00:35.040> have<00:00:35.130> a

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
they're transparent well we'll have a

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.100 
they're transparent well we'll have a
look<00:00:35.940> at<00:00:36.090> them<00:00:36.239> now<00:00:36.270> but<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.690> mean<00:00:36.809> just<00:00:36.930> before

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
look at them now but I mean just before

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.290 
look at them now but I mean just before
we<00:00:37.469> look<00:00:38.250> specifically<00:00:38.790> at<00:00:38.910> them<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.239> should

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
we look specifically at them I should

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.150 
we look specifically at them I should
say<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.840> general<00:00:40.050> impression<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.920> just

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
say that the general impression is just

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.569 
say that the general impression is just
very<00:00:42.120> lovely<00:00:42.750> some<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.770> them<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.040> for

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
very lovely some of them this for

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.520 
very lovely some of them this for
they're<00:00:44.850> on<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> lightbox<00:00:45.899> which<00:00:46.200> are<00:00:46.350> about

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
they're on a lightbox which are about

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.290 
they're on a lightbox which are about
the<00:00:46.680> size<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:47.160> well<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> bit<00:00:47.910> smaller<00:00:48.149> than

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
the size of well a bit smaller than

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.840 
the size of well a bit smaller than
footballs<00:00:48.780> but<00:00:48.989> these<00:00:49.140> cylindrical<00:00:50.129> or<00:00:50.550> globe

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
footballs but these cylindrical or globe

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.330 
footballs but these cylindrical or globe
shaped<00:00:51.570> things<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.170> they<00:00:52.230> look<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.500> bit<00:00:52.920> like

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
shaped things and they look a bit like

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.889 
shaped things and they look a bit like
they<00:00:53.550> have<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.699> crystalline<00:00:54.329> beauty<00:00:54.719> of

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
they have that crystalline beauty of

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.380 
they have that crystalline beauty of
snowflakes<00:00:55.680> for<00:00:55.890> instance<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.670> we're

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
snowflakes for instance and we're

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.670 
snowflakes for instance and we're
dealing<00:00:57.750> here<00:00:57.899> with<00:00:57.960> things<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.469> are

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
dealing here with things that are

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.500 
dealing here with things that are
killing<00:00:58.949> people<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.789> hundreds<00:01:00.300> of

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
killing people in the hundreds of

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.990 
killing people in the hundreds of
thousands<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.530> mean<00:01:01.859> isn't<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.219> some<00:01:02.460> kind<00:01:02.910> of

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
thousands I mean isn't the some kind of

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.969 
thousands I mean isn't the some kind of
rather<00:01:03.210> dreadful<00:01:03.780> irony<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.559> making<00:01:04.830> such

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
rather dreadful irony and making such

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.950 
rather dreadful irony and making such
beautiful<00:01:05.250> things<00:01:05.640> out<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.060> such<00:01:06.299> lethal

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
beautiful things out of such lethal

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.289 
beautiful things out of such lethal
things<00:01:07.650> yeah<00:01:08.010> that's<00:01:08.820> part<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.180> problem

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
things yeah that's part of the problem

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.450 
things yeah that's part of the problem
by<00:01:09.600> taking<00:01:09.990> away<00:01:10.080> all<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.320> color<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.860> making

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
by taking away all the color and making

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.370 
by taking away all the color and making
glass<00:01:12.150> sculptures<00:01:12.720> I've<00:01:13.049> made<00:01:13.229> these

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
glass sculptures I've made these

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.730 
glass sculptures I've made these
incredibly<00:01:13.799> beautiful<00:01:14.240> objects<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.439> and<00:01:16.439> so

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
incredibly beautiful objects and and so

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.740 
incredibly beautiful objects and and so
I<00:01:16.770> replaced<00:01:17.189> one<00:01:17.430> problem<00:01:17.880> with<00:01:18.000> another<00:01:18.210> you

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
I replaced one problem with another you

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.510 
I replaced one problem with another you
know<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.320> now<00:01:19.500> there's<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:19.890> kind<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.189> curious

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
know so now there's this kind of curious

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.210 
know so now there's this kind of curious
tension<00:01:21.030> between<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.619> beauty<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
tension between the the beauty of the

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.469 
tension between the the beauty of the
object<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.700> then<00:01:23.820> what<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.150> what<00:01:24.450> it

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
object and then what it what it

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.929 
object and then what it what it
represents<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:25.680> one<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.159> left<00:01:26.369> right

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
represents this one on the left right

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.310 
represents this one on the left right
more<00:01:27.150> like<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> rugby<00:01:27.570> ball<00:01:27.720> than<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.110> football

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
more like a rugby ball than a football

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.910 
more like a rugby ball than a football
it's<00:01:29.250> very<00:01:30.240> complicated<00:01:30.810> shape<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.590> kind<00:01:31.799> of

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
it's very complicated shape the kind of

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.100 
it's very complicated shape the kind of
intricate<00:01:32.340> spiral<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.299> center<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.960> then

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
intricate spiral in the center and then

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.090 
intricate spiral in the center and then
little<00:01:34.409> growths<00:01:34.920> coming<00:01:35.430> out<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.790> end

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
little growths coming out of the end

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.530 
little growths coming out of the end
what<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.840> this<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.799> virus<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:42.150> swine<00:01:42.509> flu

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
what is it this is a virus of swine flu

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.160 
what is it this is a virus of swine flu
so<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.310> inside<00:01:44.850> you've<00:01:45.299> got<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.720> genetic

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
so on the inside you've got the genetic

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.560 
so on the inside you've got the genetic
material<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:46.950> then<00:01:47.579> on<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.820> outside<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.540> that

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
material and then on the outside of that

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.600 
material and then on the outside of that
form<00:01:49.340> proteins

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
form proteins

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.810 
form proteins
it<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.509> incredibly<00:01:52.020> intricate<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:53.070> designed<00:01:53.610> it

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
it is incredibly intricate I designed it

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.510 
it is incredibly intricate I designed it
it's<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.750> kind<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:54.960> combination<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.680> looking

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
it's a kind of combination of looking

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.920 
it's a kind of combination of looking
through<00:01:56.729> an<00:01:56.790> electron<00:01:57.090> microscope<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.750> what

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.800 
through an electron microscope of what
you<00:01:58.290> actually<00:01:58.439> see<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.310> then<00:02:00.060> what<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.630> also

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
you actually see and then what you also

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.069 
you actually see and then what you also
know<00:02:01.200> through<00:02:01.560> looking<00:02:02.399> at<00:02:02.520> diagrams<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.990> the

know through looking at diagrams so the

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.050 
know through looking at diagrams so the

cone that is made of glass that's got

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.330 
cone that is made of glass that's got
maybe<00:02:39.629> a<00:02:39.720> hundred<00:02:39.959> little<00:02:40.379> beads<00:02:40.620> attached<00:02:41.159> to

maybe a hundred little beads attached to

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.580 
maybe a hundred little beads attached to

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
it and that's embedded in another glass

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.729 
it and that's embedded in another glass
sphere<00:02:44.569> again<00:02:45.569> with<00:02:45.930> proteins<00:02:46.409> on<00:02:46.620> the

outside<00:02:47.129> of<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.310> this<00:02:47.640> is<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.819> first

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
outside of it this is the first

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.619 
outside of it this is the first
sculpture<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.599> made<00:02:48.659> back<00:02:49.409> in<00:02:49.620> 2004<00:02:50.599> with<00:02:51.599> a

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
sculpture I made back in 2004 with a

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.690 
sculpture I made back in 2004 with a
glass<00:02:51.870> blower<00:02:52.170> called<00:02:52.440> King<00:02:52.680> George<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.549> it

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
glass blower called King George and it

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.720 
glass blower called King George and it
was<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.879> first<00:02:54.120> kind<00:02:54.389> of<00:02:54.510> experiment<00:02:55.379> really

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
was the first kind of experiment really

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.170 
was the first kind of experiment really
and<00:02:56.730> I<00:02:57.180> made<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.900> think<00:02:58.799> about<00:02:59.040> how<00:02:59.310> images

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
and I made it to think about how images

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.199 
and I made it to think about how images
of<00:03:00.599> viruses<00:03:01.109> are<00:03:01.739> portrayed<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.670> presented

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
of viruses are portrayed and presented

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.780 
of viruses are portrayed and presented
through<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.870> media<00:03:04.170> but<00:03:04.650> also<00:03:04.829> to<00:03:05.069> as<00:03:05.609> an

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
through the media but also to as an

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.699 
through the media but also to as an
object<00:03:05.940> to<00:03:06.180> hold<00:03:06.389> really<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.109> contemplate

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
object to hold really and contemplate

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.270 
object to hold really and contemplate
the<00:03:07.889> global<00:03:08.280> issues<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.379> HIV<00:03:10.379> and<00:03:10.920> what<00:03:11.099> that

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
the global issues of HIV and what that

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.550 
the global issues of HIV and what that
means<00:03:11.519> to<00:03:11.760> humanity<00:03:12.269> do<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.900> glassblowers

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
means to humanity do the glassblowers

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.039 
means to humanity do the glassblowers
ever<00:03:13.709> say<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.040> you<00:03:14.450> okay<00:03:15.450> there's<00:03:15.780> a<00:03:15.840> lovely

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
ever say to you okay there's a lovely

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.740 
ever say to you okay there's a lovely
design<00:03:16.470> but<00:03:16.739> frankly<00:03:17.099> it<00:03:17.190> can't<00:03:17.459> be<00:03:17.669> made<00:03:17.940> yeah

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
design but frankly it can't be made yeah

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.240 
design but frankly it can't be made yeah
I<00:03:18.780> mean<00:03:19.109> that<00:03:19.260> this<00:03:19.379> is<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.739> we're<00:03:20.010> kind<00:03:20.220> of

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
I mean that this is it we're kind of

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.650 
I mean that this is it we're kind of
pushing<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.639> boundaries<00:03:21.000> of<00:03:21.120> glassblowing

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
pushing the boundaries of glassblowing

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.089 
pushing the boundaries of glassblowing
as<00:03:21.870> well<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:22.199> coming<00:03:22.470> up<00:03:22.590> with<00:03:22.709> designs

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
as well and coming up with designs

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.069 
as well and coming up with designs
sometimes<00:03:23.370> that<00:03:24.239> really<00:03:24.690> won't<00:03:24.870> hold

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
sometimes that really won't hold

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.479 
sometimes that really won't hold
together<00:03:25.319> with<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:25.859> forces<00:03:26.250> of<00:03:26.280> gravity

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
together with the forces of gravity

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.799 
together with the forces of gravity
there<00:03:27.269> just<00:03:27.449> be<00:03:27.540> too<00:03:27.780> fragile<00:03:28.049> to<00:03:28.290> create
