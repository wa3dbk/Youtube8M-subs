00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.110
 and appears 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:21.390
 It is very much the truth to me I like it 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:25.590

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.109
 and it is that font d'aixa is that there is skin of 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.039
 there is a Jurassic one and now 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.930
 the historical so good 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:37.690
 we'll see 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:42.219
 a machine looks so good 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:45.660
 just like rest then new that good 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:45.660
 let's see them 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.269
 in each table the name finally we are going to 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.269
 do what 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:11.220
 dance and while and all that so just 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:13.980
 change what is the appearance the laughter 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.640
 she is very cool she is very beautiful i like 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:22.320
 a lot we are going to go up to level 6 and I am going to 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:26.120
 teach each phase of the last of the 6 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.120
 I'll show you all the accumulations 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.310
 good that level 6 if you can teach 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.310
 a few small things is worth first 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.580
 this I think I would say change it 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:41.820
 Then there is the w 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.630
 this does not change in theory and then they are 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.060
 the principles of e 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:50.340
 so you can see a little 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.340
 they are next 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.240
 ah 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.560
 to this the skewers 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:02.590
 I would say that the change something 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.869
 I would say yes, not to poetry what 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.240
 I had planned to do was the 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.899
 Last last is the teaching complex 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.850
 because the young man has I will facilitate 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.930
 then now I would start by 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.930
 The first phase 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.660
 programmed 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.790
 well we have given I have eaten 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.810
 as vice but in the end it has been seen to grow 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.510
 not true 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.349
 because nothing we continue 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.349
 a load 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.340
 to this one 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.340
 according to the load 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.300
 it's a little 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.300
 third charge 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.430
 to this one 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.330
 fourth charge 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.410
 let's see more 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.440
 fifth career 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.890
 there is one more 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:10.280
 and to finish last charge and sixth there 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:13.180
 is maximum chat size with your 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.660
 last six charges 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.090
 and finally this is 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.600
 that classic cat is your best state 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.600
 I suppose 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:29.740
 It's a fucking monster 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:32.690
 here is more is better textures 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:36.410
 and the host and all the design and all that 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:39.040
 and nothing touches to die and that time it touches us 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.040
 die 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.700
 the truth is a pass in the design of 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.440
 the last thing the truth 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.230
 all right 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.750
 We're going to die 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.760
 well i can talk 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.680
 another thing a little complicated 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.190
 i 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.560
 let's die 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.560
 well someday I'm sure 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.489
 for this 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.980
 so cool who are very cool me 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:15.299
 I like it so I like nothing else 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.299
 speak in fact nothing
