00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:07.950
 hello good friends and carlos as afternoon 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.889
 you know that as a general rule we 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.900
 we focus on the future of mini s &amp; p and 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.770
 more specifically in the scalping of 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.770
 intraday 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.380
 today 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.580
 and we keep insisting on the 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.880
 importance of knowing how to understand 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.110
 that is to relate 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.800
 the price 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:35.160
 and the volume and for that the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.329
 historical gold 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.329
 It is a weekly chart 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:48.500
 these are the maxima that have formed us 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.500
 the final price of 2011 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.190
 maximums that makes them above 1900 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.230
 but eye 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.460
 from where the price is rising 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:21.020
 final 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.020
 of 2001 we had it below 300 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:29.620
 and as has been said in 2011 exceeds 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.620
 1900 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:36.060
 that's 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.060
 x 6 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.970
 that is 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:44.690
 it's a tour 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.310
 tremendously significant a great 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:51.840
 bullish development 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:54.470
 and upon reaching the maximum happens 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.470
 this 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.310
 this is a tremendous volume a volume 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.550
 soaring 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.450
 the price at the top 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.450
 they are candles 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.890
 in weekly chart 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.450
 with a lot of volume and also without 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.450
 price displacement 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.810
 but as has been said in so many 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.940
 occasions 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.940
 so many times we have crushed 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:38.260
 while the market is dialing an address 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.750
 while the market goes in the direction 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.940
 bullish 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:47.760
 you have to keep betting 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.510
 in the direction that goes to the price 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.510
 However 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.070
 when after all that volume 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.080
 I repeat it is a very high volume 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.200
 several weeks several weeks sorry with 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.230
 a very high volume 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.360
 and the last candles that mark us 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.360
 maximums do not move 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.470
 it is true that then the price stays 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.590
 on one side 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.130
 but 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:29.720
 this 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:31.990
 It is there and that can not be passed by 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.990
 high 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.409
 when 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:41.760
 the price tries to return to the maximum 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:45.480
 from the side 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:49.939
 it runs out of volume so it's what 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:55.210
 the demand clearly disappears 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:59.210
 in all the attempts that the price 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:06.700
 try to go up 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:06.700
 it runs out of volume at all once 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:17.299
 came out all this barbarism of volume 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:22.490
 and then it runs out of demand 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:25.940
 the market falls under its own weight 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.910
 from there once the 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:32.530
 demand 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:34.660
 is when you have to start looking for the 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.870
 bearish side 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:41.530
 the damage is done the damage by calling it 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.870
 in some way benefit to those who 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.820
 they go in the right direction of the market 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.350
 in the short sense in the sense 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.020
 bass guitarist 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.720
 in the market they also open 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.970
 positions to the downside and you have to 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:05:00.200
 take advantage of it you have to 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:06.300
 take advantage especially if we understand 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:11.090
 that after a development like this 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:14.100
 since the end of 2001 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:17.610
 ten years of his life 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:20.900
 in a significant way 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.900
 and that on the top 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:27.290
 happen all this 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:30.980
 it's just a matter of time in the market 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:35.450
 you have to be calm to wait for 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:38.750
 that comes out and once it is confirmed there 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:40.090
 look how the side has been said before 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.500
 Right 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.350
 in conclusion 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.570
 the volume tells us clearly where 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.570
 are placed the big ones of the market 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:52.790
 and in the direction that they are what 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:56.860
 enjoy it has been a pleasure many 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.860
 thank you all and happy afternoon
