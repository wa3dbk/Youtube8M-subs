00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:09.540
What’s up, party people?

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.139
Naomi here with your Fix for Tuesday, October
18th.

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.879
Before we get started, I gotta throw out a
quick birthday shout-out to the Nintendo Entertainment

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:16.879
system.

00:00:16.879 --> 00:00:19.570
The little, grey console that saved gaming
from the crash of ‘83 turned 26 today, so

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.760
happy birthday big guy.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.410
We owe you one.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.599
Today also marks the birthday of a little
game called Batman: Arkham City.

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.910
No joke -- it just came out this morning -- so
pick it up, fire it up, and then tell us how

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.630
you’re likin’ it in the comments section
below.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.580
File this next one under, “rumors that absolutely
must come true”!

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.320
Joystiq is reporting that an anonymous tipster
sent them a picture of the Beta version of

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.699
Soul Calibur 5 from a recent fighting game
tournament.

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:41.034
The picture reveals that joining the Soul
Calibur 5 roster is none other than Assassin’s

00:00:41.034 --> 00:00:43.780
Creed hero Ezio Auditore de Firenze.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.750
Obviously, this news is totally rumor-central,
but we’ve got our fingers crossed nonetheless.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.530
In the mood for some more Deus Ex?

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.530
Yes?

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.530
No?

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.000
Well, regardless, “The Missing Link” DLC
became available for download today.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.520
As it’s a story-driven, five-hour campaign,
this add-on is worth the some attantion.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.820
It’ll run you $15 bucks.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.820
In other DLC news, it turns out Frank West
is secretly a Terminator.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.530
No, not really, but he could be if you download
the Dead Rising 2: Off the Record Cyborg skills

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.369
pack, which releases next week.

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.940
It gives Frank greater melee strength and
the ability to inflict electric damage.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:14.940
Couple that with the hidden Proto Man Easter
egg, and you’ll be as robotic as Arnold

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:15.940
himself.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.280
The Cyborg pack will cost you 2 bucks when
it releases Tuesday, October 25th on PC and

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.280
Xbox 360.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.070
PS3 users can pick it up the next day, on
Wednesday the 26th.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.740
Also, don’t forget that at 7PM pacific today,
Google and Samsung are expected to announce

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.950
what they’re calling Android 4.0 Ice Cream
Sandwich and the new Nexus phone.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.829
Keep your eyes on IGN for any announcements.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.380
And if you do, you won’t find the info on
the Gear page.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.470
IGN Gear is getting a bit of a makeover today,
being relaunched as IGN Tech.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.780
You can find all of the latest gear and technology
news there including the big Android announcements

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.080
later today.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.579
And that’s your Fix for October 18th, 2011.

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:04.990
I’m Naomi Kyle and be sure to get your Fix
anytime online here, at IGN.com.
