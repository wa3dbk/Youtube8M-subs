doesn't<00:00:58.390> doesn't<00:01:00.310> create<00:01:01.310> that<00:01:01.520> kind<00:01:01.700> of

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
doesn't doesn't create that kind of

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.450 
doesn't doesn't create that kind of
impact<00:01:02.240> but<00:01:02.390> that<00:01:02.630> but<00:01:02.870> this<00:01:03.050> whole<00:01:03.230> is<00:01:03.980> like

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
impact but that but this whole is like

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.480 
impact but that but this whole is like
an<00:01:04.580> instrument<00:01:05.030> and<00:01:05.920> I<00:01:06.920> think<00:01:07.130> it's<00:01:07.250> going<00:01:07.400> to

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
an instrument and I think it's going to

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.030 
an instrument and I think it's going to
be<00:01:07.840> really<00:01:08.840> important<00:01:09.439> like<00:01:09.470> a<00:01:09.590> historic

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
be really important like a historic

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.910 
be really important like a historic

the whole so families have started to

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.980 
the whole so families have started to
move<00:02:05.830> in<00:02:06.069> more<00:02:06.520> and<00:02:06.610> more<00:02:06.789> and<00:02:07.179> there<00:02:07.390> are<00:02:07.479> more

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
move in more and more and there are more

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.990 
move in more and more and there are more
restaurants<00:02:08.560> more<00:02:08.709> hotels<00:02:09.039> more<00:02:09.549> services

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
restaurants more hotels more services

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.580 
restaurants more hotels more services
and<00:02:10.799> everything<00:02:11.799> because<00:02:12.670> of<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:13.590> magnetism

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
and everything because of the magnetism

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.410 
and everything because of the magnetism
of<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.920> new<00:02:15.160> building<00:02:15.459> and<00:02:15.819> I<00:02:15.850> think<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.239> same

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
of the new building and I think the same

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.250 
of the new building and I think the same
thing<00:02:16.600> is<00:02:16.690> going<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:16.959> happen<00:02:17.019> here<00:02:17.590> that<00:02:19.260> this

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
thing is going to happen here that this

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.750 
thing is going to happen here that this
kind<00:02:20.530> of<00:02:20.620> concert<00:02:20.920> hall<00:02:21.130> where<00:02:21.160> you<00:02:21.370> can<00:02:21.519> have

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
kind of concert hall where you can have

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.600 
kind of concert hall where you can have
this<00:02:21.910> sort<00:02:22.239> of<00:02:22.299> experience<00:02:23.220> it's<00:02:24.220> going<00:02:24.459> to<00:02:24.489> be

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
this sort of experience it's going to be

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.539 
this sort of experience it's going to be
a<00:02:24.640> magnet<00:02:24.850> and<00:02:25.299> and<00:02:26.049> I<00:02:26.410> think<00:02:26.440> this<00:02:26.829> area<00:02:27.340> will

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
a magnet and and I think this area will

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.630 
a magnet and and I think this area will
become<00:02:27.670> like<00:02:28.239> a<00:02:28.500> new<00:02:29.500> center<00:02:30.040> of<00:02:30.190> Paris

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
become like a new center of Paris

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.380 
become like a new center of Paris
eventually<00:02:31.510> from<00:02:32.470> time<00:02:32.709> to<00:02:32.859> time<00:02:33.120> these<00:02:34.120> kind

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
eventually from time to time these kind

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.330 
eventually from time to time these kind
of<00:02:34.480> things<00:02:34.720> are<00:02:35.109> necessary<00:02:35.560> that<00:02:35.799> you<00:02:35.829> you

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
of things are necessary that you you

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.310 
of things are necessary that you you
create<00:02:36.880> an<00:02:37.000> important<00:02:37.420> building<00:02:37.600> in<00:02:37.900> a<00:02:38.049> part

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
create an important building in a part

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.849 
create an important building in a part
of<00:02:38.410> town<00:02:39.220> which<00:02:39.670> is<00:02:39.820> not<00:02:39.970> central<00:02:40.209> and<00:02:40.859> that

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:41.859 
of town which is not central and that

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:43.620 
of town which is not central and that
will<00:02:42.040> change<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.730> chemistry<00:02:43.060> of<00:02:43.239> the<00:02:43.420> city

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
will change the chemistry of the city

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.110 
will change the chemistry of the city
and<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:43.930> think<00:02:44.170> for<00:02:44.350> the<00:02:44.470> better<00:02:44.700> well<00:02:45.700> even

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
and I think for the better well even

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.150 
and I think for the better well even
people<00:02:46.390> who<00:02:46.420> are<00:02:46.810> not<00:02:47.440> familiar<00:02:47.650> with

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
people who are not familiar with

people who are not familiar with
classical<00:02:48.609> music<00:02:48.910> when<00:02:49.060> they<00:02:49.180> come<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:49.600> hear

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
classical music when they come to hear

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.520 
classical music when they come to hear
music<00:02:50.590> in<00:02:50.920> a<00:02:51.040> space<00:02:51.579> like<00:02:51.609> this<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:53.140> will<00:02:53.350> have

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
music in a space like this it will have

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.940 
music in a space like this it will have
a<00:02:53.560> great<00:02:53.890> great<00:02:54.160> impact<00:02:54.670> on<00:02:54.850> them<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.709> I<00:02:56.709> think

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
a great great impact on them and I think

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.740 
a great great impact on them and I think
the<00:02:57.190> decisions<00:02:58.060> that<00:02:58.150> have<00:02:58.390> been<00:02:58.420> made<00:02:58.600> in

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
the decisions that have been made in

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.680 
the decisions that have been made in
Paris<00:02:59.370> I've<00:03:00.370> been<00:03:00.640> the<00:03:00.940> right<00:03:01.060> ones<00:03:01.299> to<00:03:01.540> keep

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
Paris I've been the right ones to keep

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.539 
Paris I've been the right ones to keep
the<00:03:01.840> ticket<00:03:02.320> prices<00:03:02.680> low<00:03:03.569> to<00:03:04.569> open<00:03:04.989> up<00:03:05.549> the

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
the ticket prices low to open up the

the ticket prices low to open up the

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.819 
programming to to be inviting not
exclusive<00:03:09.640> but<00:03:09.819> but<00:03:10.329> open<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:10.989> welcoming<00:03:11.620> I

exclusive but but open and welcoming I

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.220 
exclusive but but open and welcoming I
think<00:03:12.010> this<00:03:12.100> is<00:03:12.160> exactly<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.900> way<00:03:14.049> it<00:03:14.170> should

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
think this is exactly the way it should

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.960 
think this is exactly the way it should
be<00:03:14.350> done<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:14.709> I'm<00:03:14.799> sure<00:03:15.459> this<00:03:15.640> would<00:03:15.790> be<00:03:15.940> a

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
be done and I'm sure this would be a

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:24.240 
be done and I'm sure this would be a
great<00:03:16.120> success

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.820
