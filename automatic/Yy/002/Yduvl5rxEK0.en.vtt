keychain<00:02:09.270> let's<00:02:10.080> check

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.950 

should<00:02:22.460> be<00:02:22.610> easier<00:02:22.880> I<00:02:23.030> think<00:02:23.090> they<00:02:23.780> should

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
should be easier I think they should

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.220 
should be easier I think they should
have<00:02:23.990> made<00:02:24.110> this<00:02:24.410> and<00:02:25.780> this<00:02:26.780> ball<00:02:27.640> screw<00:02:28.640> eyes

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
have made this and this ball screw eyes

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.360 
have made this and this ball screw eyes
because<00:02:30.230> if<00:02:30.500> you<00:02:30.590> have<00:02:30.710> to<00:02:30.800> take<00:02:30.950> this<00:02:31.070> after

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
because if you have to take this after

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.760 
because if you have to take this after
keychain<00:02:31.760> each<00:02:31.910> time<00:02:35.440> actually<00:02:36.440> gotta<00:02:36.590> put<00:02:36.740> a

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
keychain each time actually gotta put a

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.720 
keychain each time actually gotta put a
bike<00:02:36.920> on<00:02:37.010> right<00:02:39.010> maybe<00:02:40.010> taking<00:02:40.370> it<00:02:40.460> off<00:02:40.550> as

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
bike on right maybe taking it off as
