00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
a little misleading but you know

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.520 
a little misleading but you know
whatever<00:01:52.399> so<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:54.299> did<00:01:54.869> watch<00:01:55.049> one<00:01:55.289> of<00:01:55.409> his

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
videos and he had watched here he had

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.410

said<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:59.069> he<00:01:59.250> wanted<00:01:59.459> his<00:01:59.610> plan<00:01:59.849> to<00:02:00.030> be<00:02:00.179> like

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
said that he wanted his plan to be like

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.359 
said that he wanted his plan to be like
one<00:02:00.599> of<00:02:00.689> those<00:02:00.780> clans<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.829> everybody's

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
one of those clans that everybody's

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.319 
one of those clans that everybody's

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:08.329 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:11.780 

so<00:02:09.329> maybe<00:02:09.539> one<00:02:09.810> day<00:02:10.049> his<00:02:10.920> clan<00:02:11.250> will<00:02:11.430> be<00:02:11.549> that

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
didn't quite meet the standards so it

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.680
