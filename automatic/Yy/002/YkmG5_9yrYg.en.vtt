00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:15.309
 for everyone and today we will have a list 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:17.800
 quite large of basic accessories 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.380
 for the ipad so in this video is 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.660
 that is also really is this 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.270
 person who asked me if I could do 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.279
 this video so good here is this 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.770
 so let's start with the number 1 on 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.719
 first accessory basic some stickers 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.660
 go is because it turns out that the ipad has 

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:35.800
 a good sound but it is so loud or has 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.480
 so much volume for when one is 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.399
 well then I do not need any 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.010
 speaker solution so there are two 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.360
 ways to have speakers blood is like 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.739
 this one that is here that is connected by 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.960
 bluetooth turns on and has a 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:50.640
 internal battery so one can have 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.230
 our necessary moments with 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.610
 bluetooth or direct connection as 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.470
 publishable landmark that is back here that 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.550
 it sticks on this same side it connects 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.760
 direct like has an internal battery 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.930
 that is charged by means of a microusb cable 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.160
 all the things that they had studied at 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.140
 be down in the description so that 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.140
 they can buy directly directly 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.200
 to amazon.com so the number two are 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.210
 these stadiums meetings I have several 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.340
 options this are the ones that I used 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.350
 more are the ones that I liked the most 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.180
 of pencil the one that already speaks 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.600
 to our videos 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.370
 depends on praising the brand of this style 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.630
 is that this is both a styles for a 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.240
 side where it is unpopulated as a 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.270
 pen for the other and the third is the 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.430
 adonis touch script that has a 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.020
 very fine tip as you can see rain to 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.479
 difference of this Peruvian team of 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.220
 advantages and disadvantages that equal true 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.200
 yes that those three will be in the 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.719
 what would i say 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.189
 and then it was on wifi and if I do not have it 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:47.630
 here but not since made a video that 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.640
 you can see here at this moment 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.860
 video speaks very well of how to connect 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.960
 to google by white white in any 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.759
 moment with this accessory yes they were going to 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.600
 have others in the description is the little 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:03.229
 wireframe keyboard keyboards like this 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.950
 that anyone is this option that is 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:10.310
 the link 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.840
 cover of logitech there are versions for 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.730
 all ipads so do not worry 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.660
 about the ipad has no version because it does not 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.380
 image has the idea is that all 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.450
 they close 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.070
 and close as one thing this not 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.590
 it's for this seer act but that's the 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.880
 idea and then when they open it to another puts 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.210
 here and it stays stuck with the magnets 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.860
 of the ipad and that little thing is virtue 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.240
 so for more that the ipad does not enter 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.830
 position will be with any device that 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.960
 sortu until although they have brought what 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.450
 let it be for you to have that 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.820
 confrontation any keyboard your les 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:46.140
 the next option will work 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:50.310
 it would be the philis are controllers for 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:54.600
 videogames this are in this little bag and 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.750
 so let's open the first ones to 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.690
 buy online for your by the way are 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:04.280
 two this is of joysticks bernanke it 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.280
 stick on the suction cup 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.820
 they already have a stylus a joystick that 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.070
 be able to use and with video games in the 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.530
 country like that is an option there is 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.360
 ipad controls as well as controls 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.400
 videogames that exist and work 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.610
 perfectly 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.790
 to recommend the charges and then and 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.560
 usb batteries I do not have parents options 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.939
 I've had in life let's say this 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.739
 it was one of the first that I had that is a 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:33.959
 battery like a solar panel so that it 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.120
 recharge that way too but take 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.430
 hitman for a pure usb there has 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.319
 for the cable has only one USB output 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.700
 and live upload 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.989
 what are we going to leave this in the car and 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.790
 which is charged and when I need it 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.470
 emergency I have it ready but the one 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:51.180
 use of truth is this the jack reacher 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.799
 agent already wanting this is a battery 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.120
 they go there tells the car to one how much 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.620
 battery has to give the flashlight 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.269
 installed but put a little arms 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:03.030
 and has two outputs one 5.5 volts 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.650
 other than 5 volts and 2.1 amps as well 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.420
 that is a load of ipad and the 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.400
 cellular angles you need more power 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.340
 and the other one loads any kind of 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.139
 usb device and it is charged by micro usb and 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.909
 has a very large capacity I think that 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:17.190
 it's like 10,000 thousand amps which is a 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:18.959
 gift of or 18 thousand I do not remember has 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.280
 a lot of capacity what they recommend together 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.199
 with this is this case a cable like 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.880
 this is like the one I have because more 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.620
 colorful has for 30 pins for 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.320
 lightning for micro usb 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.919
 normal cable to all these are 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.760
 here 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.200
 efe 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.910
 and last but then we 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.290
 adapters like these of that has already 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.880
 talked about in another video how 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.940
 connect anything to any 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.070
 camera sorry to the iPad those actors are 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:48.300
 super used actuators dsd a 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:51.570
 lightning from usb to lightning and from hdmi 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.220
 lighting notice there are versions of 30 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.380
 pins of these three things and that is not 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.200
 feel bad there are versions for ipads 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.790
 previous to install things the 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.740
 your serves for example to connect 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:06.200
 an ordinary usb keyboard to the 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:08.520
 ipad and function or usb cards and keys 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.650
 western so do not worry about that 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.630
 they have a solution also for that and 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.090
 the last one I show you in this also 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.740
 at this moment it is a dock in which one 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.240
 you can put the cable that you want this one 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.500
 put so much for an ipad that for a 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.930
 iphone as for any device 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.610
 Android also because the cables that 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.290
 they go there where it does not connect to the spaces 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.060
 previous connects is a cable that one 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.190
 but know that it comes with the device 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.190
 they do not put it and it connects it down and ready 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.550
 I have two boxes that is the error of the tube 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.910
 I believe it's called 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.970
 these good people can see everything is 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.320
 down everything is down in the description 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.180
 all are by the categories of this 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.660
 ex speaker style own wifi 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.160
 keyboard print batteries adapters and top 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.230
 so you can see it in the order that 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.790
 I said below in the description itself 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.430
 they want to buy any of the things 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:56.140
 it's me if they have more questions send 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:00.480
 the comments below here or until 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.480
 what point fm the successes
