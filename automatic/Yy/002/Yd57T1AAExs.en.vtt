00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
want to look at the Pro Circuit

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.180 
want to look at the Pro Circuit
controller<00:00:37.989> and<00:00:38.679> see<00:00:38.920> it's<00:00:39.070> very<00:00:39.219> glossy<00:00:39.670> and

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
controller and see it's very glossy and

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.040 
controller and see it's very glossy and

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
it's a very very nice feel to the

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.829 
it's a very very nice feel to the
buttons<00:00:44.350> and<00:00:45.010> the<00:00:45.039> joysticks<00:00:45.670> and<00:00:45.909> everything

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 
buttons and the joysticks and everything

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:48.360 
buttons and the joysticks and everything
about<00:00:46.989> the<00:00:47.170> person<00:00:47.499> to<00:00:47.559> notice<00:00:47.739> really<00:00:47.980> is<00:00:48.159> the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
about the person to notice really is the

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.160 
about the person to notice really is the
start<00:00:48.609> and<00:00:48.760> select<00:00:48.909> buttons<00:00:49.420> or<00:00:49.569> back<00:00:49.809> button

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
start and select buttons or back button

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.299 
start and select buttons or back button
up<00:00:50.739> here<00:00:51.039> and<00:00:51.960> also<00:00:52.960> its<00:00:53.469> wire<00:00:53.769> time<00:00:54.100> will<00:00:54.219> come

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
up here and also its wire time will come

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.840 
up here and also its wire time will come
on<00:00:54.460> in<00:00:54.699> a<00:00:54.760> minute<00:00:54.909> on<00:00:55.780> the<00:00:56.379> back<00:00:56.639> it's<00:00:57.639> a

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
on in a minute on the back it's a

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.729 
on in a minute on the back it's a
difficult<00:00:58.629> to<00:00:58.839> describe<00:00:59.079> the<00:00:59.260> material<00:00:59.679> but

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
difficult to describe the material but

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.899 
difficult to describe the material but
it<00:00:59.829> feels<00:01:00.729> extremely<00:01:01.479> nice<00:01:02.229> and<00:01:02.589> this<00:01:03.399> where

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909 
it feels extremely nice and this where

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:06.960 
it feels extremely nice and this where
the<00:01:03.969> battery<00:01:04.269> pack<00:01:04.299> would<00:01:04.690> be<00:01:04.870> is<00:01:05.310> in<00:01:06.310> fact<00:01:06.580> a

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
the battery pack would be is in fact a

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.670 
the battery pack would be is in fact a
weighting<00:01:07.780> system<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:09.460> you<00:01:09.520> can<00:01:09.610> see<00:01:09.970> the<00:01:10.680> two

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
weighting system so you can see the two

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.670 
weighting system so you can see the two
different<00:01:12.100> weights<00:01:12.610> in<00:01:12.850> there<00:01:13.060> which<00:01:13.300> are<00:01:13.680> 3.5

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
different weights in there which are 3.5

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.370 
different weights in there which are 3.5
grams<00:01:15.160> each<00:01:15.660> obviously<00:01:16.660> you<00:01:16.810> can't<00:01:17.050> feel<00:01:17.350> it

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
grams each obviously you can't feel it

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.490 
grams each obviously you can't feel it
quite<00:01:18.010> heavy<00:01:18.310> without<00:01:18.700> it<00:01:19.030> what<00:01:19.900> you<00:01:20.020> can<00:01:20.230> do

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
quite heavy without it what you can do

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.100 
quite heavy without it what you can do
is<00:01:21.220> if<00:01:21.280> you<00:01:21.490> don't<00:01:21.520> want<00:01:21.820> the<00:01:21.910> weight<00:01:22.120> you<00:01:22.990> can

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
is if you don't want the weight you can

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.030 
is if you don't want the weight you can
just<00:01:23.320> I'm<00:01:23.470> not<00:01:23.560> even<00:01:23.800> going<00:01:23.890> to<00:01:23.950> bother

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
just I'm not even going to bother

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.200 
just I'm not even going to bother
putting<00:01:24.280> all<00:01:24.400> the<00:01:24.460> way<00:01:24.580> on<00:01:24.640> but<00:01:24.790> you<00:01:24.850> can<00:01:25.000> put

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
putting all the way on but you can put

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.700 
putting all the way on but you can put
that<00:01:25.300> on<00:01:25.420> there<00:01:25.600> and<00:01:25.810> take<00:01:26.410> the<00:01:26.530> way<00:01:26.650> to

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
that on there and take the way to

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.080 
that on there and take the way to
completely<00:01:27.100> out<00:01:27.250> of<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:27.460> equation<00:01:27.670> but<00:01:28.030> I

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
completely out of the equation but I

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.750 
completely out of the equation but I
like<00:01:28.300> a<00:01:28.330> nice<00:01:28.510> heavy<00:01:28.720> controller<00:01:29.200> and<00:01:29.580> it<00:01:30.580> goes

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
like a nice heavy controller and it goes

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.560 
like a nice heavy controller and it goes
bang<00:01:31.500> now<00:01:32.500> if<00:01:33.460> you<00:01:33.880> might<00:01:34.060> notice<00:01:34.270> here<00:01:34.480> it

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
bang now if you might notice here it

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.360 
bang now if you might notice here it
looks<00:01:34.840> very<00:01:35.230> much<00:01:35.530> like<00:01:35.560> an<00:01:35.920> Xbox<00:01:36.160> controller

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
looks very much like an Xbox controller

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.010 
looks very much like an Xbox controller
obviously<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.120> buttons<00:01:37.390> are<00:01:37.510> color-coded

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
obviously the buttons are color-coded

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.590 
obviously the buttons are color-coded
cuz<00:01:38.110> it's<00:01:38.260> 360<00:01:38.890> version<00:01:39.370> but<00:01:40.360> with<00:01:40.510> this

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
cuz it's 360 version but with this

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.390 
cuz it's 360 version but with this
controller<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:42.490> all<00:01:42.700> comes<00:01:42.910> apart<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:46.450> this<00:01:46.630> is

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
controller it all comes apart so this is

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.560 
controller it all comes apart so this is
just<00:01:48.400> hold<00:01:48.610> this<00:01:48.730> up<00:01:48.910> this<00:01:49.030> is<00:01:49.090> the<00:01:49.300> sort<00:01:49.480> of

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
just hold this up this is the sort of

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.240 
just hold this up this is the sort of
glossy<00:01:50.050> finish<00:01:50.380> that<00:01:50.620> you<00:01:50.740> get<00:01:50.890> on<00:01:50.980> the<00:01:51.070> newer

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
glossy finish that you get on the newer

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.600 
glossy finish that you get on the newer

bit<00:03:07.360> stiff<00:03:07.739> pretty<00:03:08.739> much<00:03:08.890> turning<00:03:09.310> in<00:03:09.489> to<00:03:10.120> a

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
bit stiff pretty much turning in to a

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.050 
bit stiff pretty much turning in to a
ps3<00:03:10.900> theme<00:03:11.290> in<00:03:11.410> control<00:03:11.739> I<00:03:11.980> prefer<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.550> d-pad

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
ps3 theme in control I prefer the d-pad

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
on a ps3 controller that the sticks I do

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.270 
on a ps3 controller that the sticks I do
have<00:03:16.030> further<00:03:16.239> to<00:03:16.890> watch<00:03:17.890> once<00:03:18.130> they've

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
have further to watch once they've

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.830

xbox and it has got the disconnect there

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.160 
xbox and it has got the disconnect there
but<00:03:51.360> it's<00:03:51.540> it's<00:03:51.930> such<00:03:52.260> a<00:03:52.290> short<00:03:52.530> length<00:03:52.880> that

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170

but it's it's such a short length that
it's<00:03:55.170> not<00:03:55.319> gonna<00:03:55.500> it's<00:03:55.770> just<00:03:56.130> safety<00:03:56.730> really<00:03:57.150> I

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
it's not gonna it's just safety really I

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.890 
it's not gonna it's just safety really I
suppose<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:58.790> aside<00:03:59.790> from<00:03:59.819> that<00:04:00.060> that's
