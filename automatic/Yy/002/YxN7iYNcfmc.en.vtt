00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
chickens and if your turn off it's going

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.339 
chickens and if your turn off it's going
to<00:00:29.039> produce<00:00:29.340> eggs<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:30.150> can<00:00:30.539> see<00:00:30.720> writing<00:00:30.929> in<00:00:31.199> the

to produce eggs I can see writing in the
chest<00:00:31.619> but<00:00:32.520> then<00:00:32.850> now<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.480> second<00:00:33.809> feature<00:00:33.960> is

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
chest but then now the second feature is

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.560 
chest but then now the second feature is
something<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.980> don't<00:00:35.309> see<00:00:35.520> on<00:00:35.760> chicken<00:00:36.210> farms

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
something I don't see on chicken farms

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.740 
something I don't see on chicken farms
but<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.410> something<00:00:37.590> very<00:00:37.800> useful<00:00:38.399> it's

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
but it is something very useful it's

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.170 
but it is something very useful it's
their<00:00:39.750> own<00:00:39.930> art<00:00:40.260> an<00:00:40.530> off<00:00:40.710> switch<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.670> if<00:00:42.000> you

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
their own art an off switch so if you

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.330 
their own art an off switch so if you
have<00:00:42.390> unchaste<00:00:42.989> full<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.379> stuff<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.980> you

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
have unchaste full of stuff and you

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.729 
have unchaste full of stuff and you
don't<00:00:44.550> want<00:00:44.700> these<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.090> produce<00:00:45.300> anymore<00:00:46.079> you

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
don't want these to produce anymore you

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.950 
don't want these to produce anymore you
can<00:00:47.070> just<00:00:47.309> turn<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.640> off<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.539> will<00:00:48.719> start

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
can just turn it off and it will start

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.830 
can just turn it off and it will start
stop<00:00:49.469> producing<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.489> eggs<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
stop producing the eggs that the

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.740 
stop producing the eggs that the
chickens<00:00:52.350> all<00:00:52.530> day<00:00:52.710> will<00:00:53.039> be<00:00:53.670> destroyed<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.210> it

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
chickens all day will be destroyed so it

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.310 
chickens all day will be destroyed so it
won't<00:00:55.020> take<00:00:55.559> space<00:00:55.860> on<00:00:56.160> your<00:00:56.190> chest<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.320> once

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
won't take space on your chest and once

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.729 
won't take space on your chest and once
you<00:00:58.559> once<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.460> want<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.510> farm<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.469> start

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
you once you want the the farm to start

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.830 
you once you want the the farm to start
producing<00:01:01.980> again<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.609> can<00:01:02.789> just<00:01:03.030> turn<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.690> on

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
producing again you can just turn it on

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.170 
producing again you can just turn it on
and<00:01:04.080> that's<00:01:05.010> pretty<00:01:05.309> nice<00:01:05.460> because<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.970> don't

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
and that's pretty nice because you don't

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.000 
and that's pretty nice because you don't
have<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.360> kill<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.780> chickens<00:01:07.110> or<00:01:07.290> destroyed

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
have to kill the chickens or destroyed

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.480 
have to kill the chickens or destroyed
the<00:01:08.130> farm<00:01:08.369> if<00:01:08.580> if<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.479> if<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.619> have<00:01:11.189> more<00:01:11.430> than

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
the farm if if the if you have more than

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.090 
the farm if if the if you have more than
you<00:01:11.700> need<00:01:12.000> but<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:12.960> tell<00:01:13.229> now<00:01:13.439> that's<00:01:13.740> basically

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
you need but I tell now that's basically

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.800 
you need but I tell now that's basically
it<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.460> now<00:01:14.790> let's<00:01:15.060> just<00:01:15.240> go<00:01:15.390> with<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.630> red

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
it so now let's just go with the red

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.920 
it so now let's just go with the red
stone<00:01:16.460> so<00:01:17.460> here's<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.060> whole<00:01:18.210> red<00:01:18.420> stone<00:01:18.689> and

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
stone so here's the whole red stone and

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.109 
stone so here's the whole red stone and
as<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.259> can<00:01:19.350> see<00:01:19.380> it's<00:01:20.130> not<00:01:20.460> super<00:01:20.820> compact

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
as you can see it's not super compact

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.240 
as you can see it's not super compact
for<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.479> chicken<00:01:21.780> farm<00:01:22.020> but<00:01:22.590> for<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> while<00:01:23.130> it

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
for a chicken farm but for a while it

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.100 
for a chicken farm but for a while it
does<00:01:23.430> it's<00:01:23.729> pretty<00:01:24.240> compact<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:24.720> my<00:01:24.810> opinion

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
does it's pretty compact in my opinion

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.270 
does it's pretty compact in my opinion
and<00:01:25.979> yeah<00:01:26.670> now<00:01:27.000> um<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:28.320> can<00:01:28.500> see<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.860> there

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
and yeah now um you can see that there

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.490 
and yeah now um you can see that there
are<00:01:29.520> there<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.180> some<00:01:30.450> space<00:01:30.720> over<00:01:31.079> here<00:01:31.110> on<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
are there is some space over here on the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.289 
are there is some space over here on the
top<00:01:31.680> but<00:01:32.340> that's<00:01:32.700> because<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:34.130> left<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:36.030> if

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
top but that's because I I left it so if

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.710 
top but that's because I I left it so if
you<00:01:36.450> want<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.810> expand<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.030> hopper<00:01:39.030> space<00:01:39.299> for

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
you want to expand the hopper space for

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.080 
you want to expand the hopper space for
the<00:01:39.840> chickens<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.710> look<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.100> also<00:01:41.280> pretty

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
the chickens you look and also pretty

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.090 
the chickens you look and also pretty
easily<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.810> don't<00:01:43.170> like<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:43.770> much<00:01:43.829> because

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
easily I don't like it so much because

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.130 
easily I don't like it so much because
the<00:01:44.549> chickens<00:01:44.700> will<00:01:45.090> start<00:01:45.360> running<00:01:45.659> around

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
the chickens will start running around

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.429 
the chickens will start running around
but<00:01:46.860> if<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.340> are<00:01:47.399> if<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.240> like<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.630> can<00:01:48.990> do

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
but if you are if you like it you can do

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.179 
but if you are if you like it you can do
it<00:01:49.850> well<00:01:50.850> now<00:01:51.090> that's<00:01:51.810> basically<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.590> as<00:01:52.920> you

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189

it well now that's basically it as you
can<00:01:53.250> see<00:01:53.520> leads<00:01:54.329> it's<00:01:55.049> just<00:01:55.259> like<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.790> if<00:01:56.790> you

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
can see leads it's just like that if you
