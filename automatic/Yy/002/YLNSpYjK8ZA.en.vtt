shape WrestleMania my thought was to

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.550 
shape WrestleMania my thought was to
have<00:02:53.110> it<00:02:53.290> on<00:02:53.380> this<00:02:53.650> wall<00:02:54.270> so<00:02:55.350> everybody<00:02:56.350> could

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
have it on this wall so everybody could

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.590 
have it on this wall so everybody could
see<00:02:56.620> it<00:02:57.040> but<00:02:57.670> I'm<00:02:57.790> really<00:02:57.940> liking<00:02:58.180> it<00:02:58.390> on<00:02:58.510> the

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
see it but I'm really liking it on the

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.240 
see it but I'm really liking it on the
ground<00:02:58.810> I<00:02:59.020> want<00:02:59.170> to<00:02:59.230> know<00:02:59.320> what<00:03:00.070> you<00:03:00.220> guys
