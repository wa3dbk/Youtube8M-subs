now<00:00:16.350> before<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:16.740> begin<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.250> do<00:00:17.310> want<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.580> point

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
now before I begin I do want to point

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.670 
now before I begin I do want to point
out<00:00:17.970> that<00:00:18.150> I'm<00:00:18.270> not<00:00:18.300> an<00:00:18.600> expert<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.199> this<00:00:19.529> is

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
out that I'm not an expert and this is

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.810 
out that I'm not an expert and this is
purely<00:00:19.949> an<00:00:20.220> amateur<00:00:20.640> cyclists<00:00:21.390> perspective

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
purely an amateur cyclists perspective

purely an amateur cyclists perspective
one<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.000> first<00:00:24.240> things<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.600> notice<00:00:24.900> is

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
one of the first things you notice is

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.689 
one of the first things you notice is
that<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.439> bike<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.650> equipped<00:00:26.189> with<00:00:26.369> an

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
that the bike is equipped with an

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.120 
that the bike is equipped with an
internal<00:00:27.060> hub<00:00:27.449> gear<00:00:27.750> I'm<00:00:28.500> used<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.980> more

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
internal hub gear I'm used to the more

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.830 
internal hub gear I'm used to the more
traditional<00:00:29.279> derailleur<00:00:30.150> gears<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.750> was

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
traditional derailleur gears so I was

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.440 
traditional derailleur gears so I was
fairly<00:00:31.050> skeptical<00:00:31.470> first<00:00:32.000> but<00:00:33.000> after<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.270> few

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
fairly skeptical first but after a few

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.900 
fairly skeptical first but after a few
rides<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.930> will<00:00:34.110> say<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.590> enjoy<00:00:35.370> these<00:00:35.579> gears

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
rides I will say I enjoy these gears

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.299 
rides I will say I enjoy these gears
quite<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.210> bit<00:00:36.620> now<00:00:37.620> with<00:00:37.680> three<00:00:38.010> speed

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
quite a bit now with three speed

quite a bit now with three speed
selections<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.030> don't<00:00:39.180> get<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.420> wider<00:00:39.629> range

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
selections you don't get the wider range

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.810 
selections you don't get the wider range
you<00:00:40.140> do<00:00:40.260> with<00:00:40.440> traditional<00:00:40.559> gears<00:00:41.219> but<00:00:41.700> that

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
you do with traditional gears but that

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.580 
you do with traditional gears but that
really<00:00:42.120> hasn't<00:00:42.390> been<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.690> problem<00:00:42.930> at<00:00:43.170> all<00:00:43.200> I

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
really hasn't been a problem at all I

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.440 
really hasn't been a problem at all I
did<00:00:44.250> notice<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.760> use<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:44.940> first<00:00:45.300> and

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
did notice that I use the first and

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.869 
did notice that I use the first and
second<00:00:45.870> much<00:00:46.800> more<00:00:47.070> than<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.340> ever<00:00:47.370> use<00:00:47.760> it

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
second much more than I ever use it

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.630 
second much more than I ever use it
third<00:00:48.090> gear<00:00:48.980> another<00:00:49.980> thing<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.430> like

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
third gear another thing that I like

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.310 
third gear another thing that I like
about<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.969> road<00:00:51.149> runner<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.719> frame<00:00:52.020> I

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
about the road runner is the frame I

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.290 
about the road runner is the frame I
would<00:00:52.710> say<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> majority<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.520> cyclists<00:00:53.969> andhaka

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
would say a majority of cyclists andhaka

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.569 
would say a majority of cyclists andhaka
prefer<00:00:54.840> mountain<00:00:55.289> bike<00:00:55.469> but<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.250> really

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
prefer mountain bike but I really

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.189 
prefer mountain bike but I really
haven't<00:00:56.760> had<00:00:57.000> any<00:00:57.180> issues<00:00:57.480> with<00:00:57.510> taça<00:00:57.930> roads

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
haven't had any issues with taça roads

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.680 
haven't had any issues with taça roads
with<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.559> bike<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:59.070> have<00:01:00.059> had<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.270> few<00:01:00.480> bumps

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
with this bike I have had a few bumps

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.569 
with this bike I have had a few bumps
and<00:01:00.870> potholes<00:01:00.960> or<00:01:01.500> decent<00:01:01.800> speeds<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
and potholes or decent speeds and the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.640 
and potholes or decent speeds and the
bike<00:01:02.760> perform<00:01:03.180> fairly<00:01:03.480> well<00:01:03.660> that's

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
bike perform fairly well that's

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.440 
bike perform fairly well that's
obviously<00:01:05.040> not<00:01:05.250> gonna<00:01:05.430> be<00:01:05.580> as<00:01:05.700> versatile<00:01:06.180> as<00:01:06.240> a

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
obviously not gonna be as versatile as a

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.030 
obviously not gonna be as versatile as a
mountain<00:01:06.810> bike<00:01:07.020> but<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.650> road<00:01:07.799> runner

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
mountain bike but the road runner

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:18.800 
mountain bike but the road runner
definitely<00:01:08.490> does<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.670> good<00:01:08.880> job

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.679 

I<00:01:18.899> also<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.040> pedal<00:01:20.369> it's<00:01:20.670> wide<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.390> has

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
I also like the pedal it's wide and has

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.260 
I also like the pedal it's wide and has
a<00:01:21.720> good<00:01:22.079> amount<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.470> grip<00:01:22.729> now<00:01:23.729> for<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.060> things

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
a good amount of grip now for the things

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.810 
a good amount of grip now for the things
that<00:01:24.450> I'm<00:01:24.540> not<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.720> big<00:01:24.930> fan<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.399> the<00:01:26.399> placement

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
that I'm not a big fan of the placement

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.490 
that I'm not a big fan of the placement
of<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.000> kickstand<00:01:27.450> sometimes<00:01:27.930> conflicts

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
of the kickstand sometimes conflicts

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.340 
of the kickstand sometimes conflicts
with<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.070> left<00:01:29.310> pedal<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:30.299> gets<00:01:30.539> wedged<00:01:30.930> in<00:01:31.289> a

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
with the left pedal it gets wedged in a

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.960 
with the left pedal it gets wedged in a
position<00:01:31.649> where<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.009> can't<00:01:32.340> move<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.700> stand

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
position where I can't move the stand

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:33.499 
position where I can't move the stand
back

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
back

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.990 
back
without<00:01:33.750> moving<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.289> pedal<00:01:34.560> first<00:01:34.850> to<00:01:35.850> get

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
without moving the pedal first to get

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.830 
without moving the pedal first to get
the<00:01:36.119> stand<00:01:36.360> back

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
the stand back

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.690 
the stand back
I<00:01:36.869> would<00:01:37.080> have<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.320> pick<00:01:37.500> up<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:38.189> rear<00:01:38.399> tire

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
I would have to pick up the rear tire

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.029 
I would have to pick up the rear tire
and<00:01:39.000> move<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.360> pedal<00:01:39.630> that's<00:01:40.409> obviously<00:01:40.860> not

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
and move the pedal that's obviously not

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:42.560 
and move the pedal that's obviously not
a<00:01:41.070> major<00:01:41.280> problem<00:01:41.670> but<00:01:42.090> it's<00:01:42.210> just<00:01:42.329> one<00:01:42.539> of

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
a major problem but it's just one of

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.940 
a major problem but it's just one of
those<00:01:42.750> small<00:01:43.020> inconveniences<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:45.950> don't

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
those small inconveniences I don't

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.279 
those small inconveniences I don't
really<00:01:47.130> like<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.490> handlebar<00:01:48.000> grips<00:01:48.289> they

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
really like the handlebar grips they

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.850 
really like the handlebar grips they
look<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.649> feel<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> bit<00:01:50.130> cheap<00:01:50.479> however

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
look and feel a bit cheap however

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.169 
look and feel a bit cheap however
420,000<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:52.950> probably<00:01:53.459> shouldn't<00:01:53.850> expect

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
420,000 I probably shouldn't expect

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.649 
420,000 I probably shouldn't expect
top-of-the-line<00:01:54.690> parts<00:01:56.119> in<00:01:57.119> all<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.569> think

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
top-of-the-line parts in all I think

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.840 
top-of-the-line parts in all I think
this<00:01:58.020> bike<00:01:58.289> isn't<00:01:58.590> going<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.220> blow<00:01:59.429> your<00:01:59.580> mind

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
this bike isn't going to blow your mind

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.029 
this bike isn't going to blow your mind
but<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.539> definitely<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.380> very<00:02:01.709> good<00:02:01.860> value

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
but it definitely is a very good value

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:03.100 
but it definitely is a very good value
for<00:02:02.220> money

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
for money

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.199 
for money
$420,000<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.500> think<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.340> guys<00:02:05.520> at<00:02:05.549> Magna<00:02:06.060> and

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
$420,000 I think the guys at Magna and

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:07.940 
$420,000 I think the guys at Magna and
Seeley<00:02:06.630> will<00:02:06.840> try<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.049> come<00:02:07.259> up<00:02:07.289> with<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.560> second

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
Seeley will try to come up with a second

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.469 
Seeley will try to come up with a second
version<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.519> bike<00:02:08.789> in<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.119> near<00:02:09.299> future

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
version of this bike in the near future

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.509 
version of this bike in the near future
so<00:02:09.899> keep<00:02:10.470> an<00:02:10.619> eye<00:02:10.709> out<00:02:10.739> for<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:13.099> on<00:02:14.099> a<00:02:14.190> side

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
so keep an eye out for that on a side

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.100 
so keep an eye out for that on a side
note<00:02:14.549> I<00:02:14.940> was<00:02:15.120> having<00:02:15.390> an<00:02:15.510> issue<00:02:15.630> with<00:02:15.810> the

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
note I was having an issue with the

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.080 
note I was having an issue with the
change<00:02:16.380> falling<00:02:16.650> off<00:02:16.920> constantly<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:17.970> took

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
change falling off constantly so I took

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.720 
change falling off constantly so I took
it<00:02:18.299> back<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.690> Cle<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.380> they<00:02:20.130> said<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.340> small

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
it back to Cle and they said a small

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.520 
it back to Cle and they said a small
errand<00:02:21.209> was<00:02:21.450> an<00:02:21.569> attachment<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:22.230> build<00:02:22.410> the

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
errand was an attachment to build the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.319 
errand was an attachment to build the
bike<00:02:22.680> for<00:02:22.890> me<00:02:23.040> they<00:02:23.700> were<00:02:23.760> nice<00:02:24.000> enough<00:02:24.180> to

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
bike for me they were nice enough to

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.720 
bike for me they were nice enough to
attach<00:02:24.690> that<00:02:24.959> on<00:02:25.109> for<00:02:25.530> free<00:02:25.680> or<00:02:25.799> charge<00:02:26.010> if

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
attach that on for free or charge if

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.460 
attach that on for free or charge if
you're<00:02:27.329> having<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.720> same<00:02:27.870> problem<00:02:28.320> with<00:02:28.410> the

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
you're having the same problem with the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.870 
you're having the same problem with the
chain<00:02:28.709> I<00:02:28.890> would<00:02:28.980> suggest<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.459> take<00:02:29.609> it<00:02:29.670> back

to<00:02:30.030> Cle<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.810> shouldn't<00:02:31.230> take<00:02:31.410> more<00:02:31.739> than

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
to Cle and it shouldn't take more than

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.180 
to Cle and it shouldn't take more than
ten<00:02:32.040> minutes<00:02:33.319> so<00:02:34.319> that's<00:02:34.440> my<00:02:34.680> review<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.100> the
