strings so you're going to have this
stop<00:01:55.119> coming<00:01:55.420> nice<00:01:55.570> and<00:01:55.810> close<00:01:55.960> so<00:01:56.170> you<00:01:56.259> can

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
stop coming nice and close so you can

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.660 
stop coming nice and close so you can
see<00:01:56.409> it<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:59.020> that's<00:01:59.259> the<00:01:59.439> call<00:01:59.619> Det<00:01:59.890> so<00:02:00.549> we've

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
see it so that's the call Det so we've

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.910 
see it so that's the call Det so we've
got<00:02:00.820> two<00:02:00.970> calls<00:02:01.180> we've<00:02:01.420> got<00:02:01.570> this<00:02:01.689> cord<00:02:01.960> is

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
got two calls we've got this cord is

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.219 
got two calls we've got this cord is
this<00:02:03.340> it's<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:03.850> C<00:02:04.030> chord<00:02:04.240> and<00:02:04.479> then<00:02:05.020> we've<00:02:05.200> got

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
this it's the C chord and then we've got

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.029 
this it's the C chord and then we've got
this<00:02:05.590> d<00:02:05.920> suspended<00:02:06.490> chord<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.899> from<00:02:08.349> that<00:02:08.380> to

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
this d suspended chord so from that to

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.339 
this d suspended chord so from that to
that<00:02:09.479> then<00:02:10.479> you're<00:02:10.630> going<00:02:10.750> to<00:02:10.840> go<00:02:10.929> to<00:02:11.050> this

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
that then you're going to go to this

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.050 
that then you're going to go to this
show<00:02:11.590> p<00:02:11.769> which<00:02:11.920> is<00:02:11.950> a<00:02:12.099> G<00:02:12.400> chord<00:02:12.610> but<00:02:12.790> it's<00:02:12.940> going

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
show p which is a G chord but it's going

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.360 
show p which is a G chord but it's going
to<00:02:13.150> be<00:02:13.269> like<00:02:13.420> like<00:02:13.720> Annie<00:02:14.019> shape<00:02:14.290> so<00:02:15.190> you've

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
to be like like Annie shape so you've

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.100 
to be like like Annie shape so you've
got<00:02:15.400> that<00:02:15.790> cord<00:02:16.239> that'll<00:02:16.540> them<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.019> we're

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
got that cord that'll them and we're

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.660 
got that cord that'll them and we're
going<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.319> do<00:02:17.410> a<00:02:17.440> little<00:02:17.470> run<00:02:17.860> over<00:02:18.069> there<00:02:18.220> but

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
going to do a little run over there but

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.059 
going to do a little run over there but
let<00:02:19.030> me<00:02:19.060> just<00:02:19.209> sort<00:02:19.630> of<00:02:19.660> show<00:02:19.870> you<00:02:19.930> how<00:02:20.170> I'm<00:02:20.800> go

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
let me just sort of show you how I'm go

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.420 
let me just sort of show you how I'm go
so<00:02:21.370> we've<00:02:21.519> got<00:02:21.700> that<00:02:21.880> core<00:02:22.420> there<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:24.130> then<00:02:24.400> it

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
so we've got that core there and then it

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.410 
so we've got that core there and then it
sits<00:02:24.760> so<00:02:24.970> you<00:02:25.720> mute<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.380> so<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.760> then<00:02:28.239> there's

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
sits so you mute it so and then there's

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.600 
sits so you mute it so and then there's
a<00:02:28.510> little<00:02:28.750> run<00:02:28.989> which<00:02:29.350> is<00:02:29.680> going<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:30.010> go<00:02:30.130> it's

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
a little run which is going to go it's

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.960 
a little run which is going to go it's
really<00:02:30.819> picking<00:02:32.069> it's<00:02:33.069> going<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.340> go<00:02:35.700> so<00:02:36.700> all

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
really picking it's going to go so all

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.110 
really picking it's going to go so all
I'm<00:02:37.120> doing<00:02:37.150> there<00:02:37.750> holding<00:02:38.709> that<00:02:38.739> cord<00:02:39.130> as<00:02:39.910> you

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
I'm doing there holding that cord as you
