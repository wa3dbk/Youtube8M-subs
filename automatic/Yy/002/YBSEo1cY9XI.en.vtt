printed<00:01:37.229> one<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:38.400> then<00:01:38.850> we're<00:01:39.000> designing<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
printed one and then we're designing the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.230 
printed one and then we're designing the
insight<00:01:39.840> on<00:01:40.049> these<00:01:40.170> also<00:01:40.880> which<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.030> really

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
insight on these also which is really

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.420 
insight on these also which is really
cool<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:43.200> takes<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.530> little<00:01:43.680> longer<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.130> design

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
cool it takes a little longer to design

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.830 
cool it takes a little longer to design
and<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.670> need<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.970> put<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.210> into<00:01:45.479> your<00:01:45.570> price

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
and you need to put that into your price

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.350 
and you need to put that into your price
point<00:01:45.869> too<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.460> need<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.759> go<00:01:47.850> back<00:01:47.880> through

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
point too so you need to go back through

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.850 
point too so you need to go back through
you<00:01:48.780> know<00:01:48.899> if<00:01:48.990> you're<00:01:49.170> doing<00:01:49.290> these<00:01:49.500> before

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
you know if you're doing these before

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.350 
you know if you're doing these before
and<00:01:49.890> you're<00:01:50.159> going<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.340> design<00:01:50.490> stuff<00:01:50.939> you

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
and you're going to design stuff you

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.310 
and you're going to design stuff you
need<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.600> actually<00:01:51.689> go<00:01:51.930> back<00:01:52.049> through<00:01:52.290> and

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
need to actually go back through and

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.630 
need to actually go back through and
raise<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.680> price<00:01:52.890> on<00:01:53.009> them<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.220> little<00:01:53.399> bit

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
raise the price on them a little bit

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.740 
raise the price on them a little bit
because<00:01:53.820> it's<00:01:54.090> going<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.299> take<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.600> more

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
because it's going to take you more

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.980 
because it's going to take you more
design<00:01:55.140> time<00:01:55.409> on<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.920> time<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.670> money

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
design time on that and time is money

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.760 
design time on that and time is money
and<00:01:57.990> then<00:01:58.770> we've<00:01:59.189> also<00:01:59.340> got<00:01:59.729> now<00:02:00.030> we're<00:02:00.360> doing

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
and then we've also got now we're doing

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.080 
and then we've also got now we're doing
wallet<00:02:01.770> boxes<00:02:02.219> too<00:02:02.430> because<00:02:02.670> we<00:02:02.759> just<00:02:02.909> think

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
wallet boxes too because we just think

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.670 
wallet boxes too because we just think
it's<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.240> cool<00:02:03.420> little<00:02:03.630> way<00:02:03.840> because<00:02:04.380> we<00:02:04.530> were

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
it's a cool little way because we were

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.289 
it's a cool little way because we were
just<00:02:04.740> doing<00:02:05.040> like<00:02:05.250> sheets<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.610> wallets<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.180> we

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
just doing like sheets of wallets and we

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.089 
just doing like sheets of wallets and we
just<00:02:06.479> think<00:02:06.659> this<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:06.930> really<00:02:07.079> cool<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.979> be

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
just think this is really cool to be

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.889 
just think this is really cool to be
able<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.340> upsell<00:02:09.000> them<00:02:09.149> on<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.690> know<00:02:09.780> we

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
able to upsell them on that you know we

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.350 
able to upsell them on that you know we
can<00:02:10.020> sell<00:02:10.200> like<00:02:10.349> 50<00:02:10.739> 50<00:02:11.489> wallets<00:02:11.849> in<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.120> box

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
can sell like 50 50 wallets in a box

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.460 
can sell like 50 50 wallets in a box
like<00:02:12.510> this<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:12.780> we<00:02:13.050> make

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
like this and we make

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.720 
like this and we make
money<00:02:13.590> we<00:02:13.770> would<00:02:13.920> have<00:02:14.040> just<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.340> few<00:02:14.370> sheets

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
money we would have just a few sheets

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.090 
money we would have just a few sheets
and<00:02:15.090> then<00:02:15.720> one<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.590> things<00:02:16.740> we<00:02:16.860> have<00:02:16.950> this

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
and then one of the things we have this

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.310 
and then one of the things we have this
year<00:02:17.160> we<00:02:17.430> always<00:02:17.670> do<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:17.880> gallery<00:02:18.360> wraps<00:02:18.600> but

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
year we always do a gallery wraps but

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.200 
year we always do a gallery wraps but
then<00:02:19.500> we<00:02:19.650> added<00:02:19.860> these<00:02:20.130> new<00:02:20.700> frames<00:02:21.000> these

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
then we added these new frames these

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.880 
then we added these new frames these
luxe<00:02:21.420> frames<00:02:21.720> which<00:02:21.930> are<00:02:22.080> really<00:02:22.320> cool<00:02:22.620> these

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
luxe frames which are really cool these

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.570 
luxe frames which are really cool these
are<00:02:22.950> from<00:02:23.250> amp<00:02:23.850> xpro<00:02:24.680> which<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:26.280> know<00:02:26.400> that's

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
are from amp xpro which you know that's

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.370 
are from amp xpro which you know that's
our<00:02:26.730> lab<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.150> they<00:02:27.600> do<00:02:27.660> just<00:02:27.990> really

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
our lab and they do just really

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.780 
our lab and they do just really
beautiful<00:02:28.530> stuff<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.220> we<00:02:29.310> think<00:02:29.520> these<00:02:29.610> are

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
beautiful stuff and we think these are

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
reps have been around for a long time

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.130 
reps have been around for a long time
and<00:02:35.850> now<00:02:36.120> they're<00:02:36.300> actually<00:02:36.630> selling<00:02:36.780> them<00:02:37.050> on

and now they're actually selling them on
Facebook<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.830> stuff<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.250> can<00:02:38.370> see<00:02:38.550> on<00:02:38.700> the

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
Facebook and stuff you can see on the

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.490 
Facebook and stuff you can see on the
side<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.240> other<00:02:39.390> you<00:02:39.990> know<00:02:40.020> so<00:02:40.350> they're

side the other you know so they're

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.230 
side the other you know so they're
become<00:02:41.130> consumer<00:02:41.580> so<00:02:41.700> you<00:02:41.760> want<00:02:42.060> something

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
become consumer so you want something

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.790 
become consumer so you want something
different<00:02:42.600> that<00:02:42.930> they<00:02:43.050> can't<00:02:43.260> get<00:02:43.470> everywhere

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
different that they can't get everywhere

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.410 
different that they can't get everywhere
so<00:02:44.100> this<00:02:44.580> is<00:02:44.730> kind<00:02:44.940> of<00:02:44.970> a<00:02:45.060> cool<00:02:45.210> little

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
so this is kind of a cool little

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.660 
so this is kind of a cool little
addition<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:46.080> there<00:02:46.770> are<00:02:47.010> some<00:02:47.190> little<00:02:47.459> tips

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
addition so there are some little tips

addition so there are some little tips
on<00:02:48.000> things<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:49.500> can<00:02:49.650> put<00:02:49.860> in<00:02:49.950> your<00:02:50.010> studio

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
on things you can put in your studio

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.680 
on things you can put in your studio
you've<00:02:50.670> got<00:02:50.850> to<00:02:50.940> switch<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.270> up<00:02:51.330> over<00:02:51.510> your

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
you've got to switch it up over your

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.150 
you've got to switch it up over your
hint<00:02:51.990> do<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.170> same<00:02:52.350> stuff<00:02:52.560> year<00:02:52.830> after<00:02:53.130> year

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
hint do the same stuff year after year

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.310 
hint do the same stuff year after year
after<00:02:53.400> year<00:02:53.520> you<00:02:54.090> need<00:02:54.330> new<00:02:54.480> products<00:02:54.990> and<00:02:55.140> you

need to be on trend with that too so you

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.570
