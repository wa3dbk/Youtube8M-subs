00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.690
 beautiful girls are aid and today come back with 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.930
 a new video is a very nice shot 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.970
 different from the usual because it is seen 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.710
 from above and allows me to do this 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.380
 best tutorial for 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.990
 explain it as clearly as possible 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.510
 but what do I want to offer you today as 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.400
 second channel tutorial I want 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.770
 offer you a little flowering as well 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.270
 false mixing with fake 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.370
 mixing on mixing 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.520
 where in the end though the viewer 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.750
 will believe that the cards are completely 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.670
 messed up the order really isn't 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.820
 changed the mix I want 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.400
 to offer you this ok not too much 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.120
 difficult but nice to see and look at 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:00.870
 well if over or a 10 of diamonds and below 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.300
 or a 6 of hearts and I'm going to mix in 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.880
 so that I just showed you above 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.890
 will continue to remain in ten of cadres 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:13.020
 and then under the 6 of hearts therefore in short a 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.540
 first and real tutorial on how to deceive 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.430
 partly the audience in front of you 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.710
 continuing to check the cards of 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.170
 deck let's see how to do this 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.850
 false flowering blending 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.380
 then first of all you have to challenge 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.330
 the must is very important that the 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.580
 hold with the thumb and the middle and the 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.950
 other fingers to follow when done 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.500
 This must leave the index and Leisure 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.300
 raise a small screed from the deck of 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.350
 card and you make more or less a third of 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.320
 carter ok 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.909
 in this way and not to pass into 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.820
 left hand 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.830
 see again at the fairies a bit of cards was born 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.390
 to pass into the other hand 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.090
 once this step is done a lot 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.220
 simple you still have to get up in March 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.500
 with the index in this way 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.180
 ok divide the screed and go to 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.729
 put the deck that was above first 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.600
 under the 2 screeds to do it you have to 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:06.960
 go get the bunch with the ring finger 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.239
 and keep it between ring finger and thumb here 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.439
 below you now have three screeds 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:15.810
 let's go back to review the first bunch 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:17.580
 I put in this hand a throw on the bunches 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.340
 the second is the last one told me that 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.680
 put underneath between thumb and ring finger in 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.410
 so that now you have three bunches in your hand 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.750
 ok let's see the last time quickly 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.090
 first screed in this hand I divide 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.340
 again and again with the lunar note 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.350
 inch the middle that was above 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.600
 in fact this comes the second 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.670
 part of the trick you have to go with 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.200
 left hand again a 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.610
 take the march this time 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:48.880
 central ok so let's review so i 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.200
 enters well in the head tac I'm going to hold the 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.910
 central deck 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.850
 once the central mass is taken , there is the 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:59.130
 a bit more difficult point 8 of the dl 3 which 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:01.270
 we can call it you have to with your thumb 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.040
 put the thumb of the hand where you have it 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.610
 just taken an affection 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.820
 on the corner of the madman on top to make a pivot 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.870
 with the thumb below the right hand 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.100
 turn it by turning this way e 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.700
 put it back in place 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.290
 ok let's review the stars from the deck and 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.660
 I take with but heard with the other hand 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.360
 I still see you and put you down in the morning 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.130
 I'm going to get the mass and half pin 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.800
 with the two thumbs around and I go to 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.220
 place here over the last March 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.820
 filming is here we go to review how 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.060
 slower 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.850
 we were affected in this dividing hand 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.220
 still ringing thumbs and take again 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.459
 the screed that above was above I go to 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.140
 take the central pivot bunch with the two 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.690
 inches this way 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.070
 ok i run it i make it fall but 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.510
 over it 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.030
 currently it is done fast it comes 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.220
 better and the last March the support above 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.410
 as you have seen 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.850
 if you have understood the order of the 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.620
 cards does not change because the first one 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.170
 screed that you take them to 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.360
 put under and it will be the last screed 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.010
 which you position over by doing 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.920
 so that the first card does not change 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.680
 not even the last to learn it better 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.440
 take good care of the video and try it 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.359
 many times it would obviously be wrong 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.709
 in short it is not simple at the beginning but 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.770
 see that sooner or later it will come and be 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:23.340
 really a nice blending for 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:25.390
 I want to end the video too 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.580
 apply it the magic trick you can 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.470
 make your friends very simple and 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.740
 you can say stop when they want 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.440
 or to choose a card 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.300
 the house and you really show it yourself 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.849
 you don't see it like this in this case 5 of 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:41.660
 teora paintings do not put on 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:43.280
 ok i'm going to mix the deck up ok 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.190
 put the screed and a half under the 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.460
 bunch only above under the bunch 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.530
 upside down 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.330
 actually to you with your skill 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.220
 you know with this mixing that 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.910
 the order has not changed therefore with one 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.740
 snap of fingers 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.440
 you can make his card 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.139
 come back the party food of the gloomy 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.630
 very simply a person a little 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.979
 more awake he can understand it soon though 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.150
 however the flowering you can do 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.300
 also for anti-stress 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.710
 anyway to mix the cards a bit 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.650
 alternating maybe a nice mixed one 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.949
 American style that I showed in 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.690
 last tutorial and nothing with which after al 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:19.550
 video I hope the tutorial has been there 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.500
 useful if you enjoyed it so much better 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.060
 which I like a lot 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.699
 subscribe to the channel if you are not 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.530
 subscribers if you want to comment 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:30.710
 sorry share the video if you want 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.659
 teach someone mixing a 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.460
 fake mixing and nothing see you 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:37.870
 with the next video to the next trick of 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.870
 magic or beautiful tutorial
