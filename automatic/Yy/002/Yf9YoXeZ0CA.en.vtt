00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
be a super admin to become job okay here

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.700 
be a super admin to become job okay here
we<00:03:10.590> have<00:03:12.170> whether<00:03:13.170> they<00:03:13.380> have<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.740> vote<00:03:13.980> or<00:03:14.670> not

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
we have whether they have to vote or not

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.010 
we have whether they have to vote or not
so<00:03:16.710> if<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:17.340> have<00:03:17.460> that<00:03:17.610> as<00:03:17.730> a<00:03:17.760> zero<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.480> job<00:03:18.810> is

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
so if you have that as a zero the job is

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.890 
so if you have that as a zero the job is
an<00:03:19.500> unknown<00:03:20.220> voting<00:03:20.730> job<00:03:21.000> so<00:03:21.570> if<00:03:21.630> we<00:03:21.750> just

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
an unknown voting job so if we just

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.470 
an unknown voting job so if we just
change<00:03:22.170> that<00:03:22.260> variable<00:03:22.860> to<00:03:23.010> one<00:03:23.220> it<00:03:23.730> will<00:03:24.300> make

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
change that variable to one it will make

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.690 
change that variable to one it will make
you<00:03:24.630> so<00:03:24.930> you<00:03:24.990> have<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.350> vote<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.310> become<00:03:26.670> the
