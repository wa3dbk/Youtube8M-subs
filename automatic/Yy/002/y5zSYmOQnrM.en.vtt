lining<00:03:58.390> the<00:03:58.840> top<00:03:59.140> of<00:03:59.290> my<00:03:59.440> brow<00:03:59.650> and<00:03:59.890> this<00:04:00.069> is

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
lining the top of my brow and this is

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.760 
lining the top of my brow and this is
just<00:04:00.550> gonna<00:04:00.790> define<00:04:01.240> that<00:04:01.450> eyebrows<00:04:02.050> extra

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
just gonna define that eyebrows extra

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.830 
just gonna define that eyebrows extra
and<00:04:02.980> it's<00:04:03.459> gonna<00:04:03.610> make<00:04:03.940> those<00:04:04.180> edges<00:04:04.690> look

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
and it's gonna make those edges look

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:29.000 
and it's gonna make those edges look
very<00:04:05.230> nice<00:04:05.500> and<00:04:05.800> clean

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.910
