00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
difference in curvature was very easy to

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.650 
difference in curvature was very easy to
put<00:01:37.690> on<00:01:38.610> fix<00:01:39.610> to<00:01:39.790> the<00:01:39.880> same<00:01:40.090> mounting<00:01:40.479> holes

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.539 

I'm<00:02:02.450> doing<00:02:02.780> this<00:02:02.900> we<00:02:03.650> actually<00:02:03.710> have<00:02:03.950> three

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
I'm doing this we actually have three

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.609 
I'm doing this we actually have three
different<00:02:04.700> colors<00:02:05.570> for<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.840> shield<00:02:06.110> this<00:02:06.560> is

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
different colors for the shield this is

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.320 
different colors for the shield this is
the<00:02:06.890> light<00:02:07.130> tint<00:02:07.460> which<00:02:07.640> is<00:02:07.790> a<00:02:07.909> very<00:02:08.090> light

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
the light tint which is a very light

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.449 
the light tint which is a very light
gray<00:02:08.630> we<00:02:09.319> also<00:02:09.380> have<00:02:09.679> a<00:02:09.709> clear<00:02:10.009> shield<00:02:10.280> which

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
gray we also have a clear shield which

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.910 
gray we also have a clear shield which
is<00:02:10.489> completely<00:02:11.030> cleared<00:02:11.360> and<00:02:11.780> we<00:02:12.530> have<00:02:12.650> it<00:02:12.800> in

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
is completely cleared and we have it in

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.610 
is completely cleared and we have it in
adopting<00:02:13.310> which<00:02:13.850> is<00:02:14.000> about<00:02:14.239> a<00:02:14.270> 70<00:02:14.989> percent<00:02:15.170> tip

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
adopting which is about a 70 percent tip

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:42.940 
adopting which is about a 70 percent tip
so<00:02:39.250> there<00:02:40.250> we<00:02:40.310> go<00:02:40.430> out<00:02:40.970> there<00:02:41.180> it's<00:02:41.690> a<00:02:42.200> it's<00:02:42.890> a

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
so there we go out there it's a it's a

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.710 
so there we go out there it's a it's a
big<00:02:43.100> improvement<00:02:43.340> over<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:43.790> stock<00:02:44.000> one<00:02:44.239> I've

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
big improvement over the stock one I've

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.120 
big improvement over the stock one I've
written<00:02:44.930> this<00:02:45.110> back<00:02:45.319> of<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.560> shield<00:02:45.800> on<00:02:45.980> it

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
written this back of the shield on it

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.979 
written this back of the shield on it
makes<00:02:46.310> a<00:02:46.430> huge<00:02:46.850> difference<00:02:46.880> to<00:02:47.360> it<00:02:47.569> it<00:02:47.690> really

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
makes a huge difference to it it really

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.110 
makes a huge difference to it it really
is<00:02:48.110> it<00:02:48.319> really<00:02:48.530> is<00:02:48.920> a<00:02:49.040> good<00:02:49.250> shoe<00:02:49.459> it's<00:02:49.970> nice

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
is it really is a good shoe it's nice

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
and thick as well see there's no so it

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.370 
and thick as well see there's no so it
doesn't<00:02:54.260> shake<00:02:54.380> doesn't<00:02:54.830> vibrate<00:02:54.980> and<00:02:56.380> cover
