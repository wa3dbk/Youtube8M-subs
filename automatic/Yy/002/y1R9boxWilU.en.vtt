here and the thumb great for holding the
mug<00:01:30.000> but<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:30.930> think<00:01:31.259> another<00:01:31.439> nice<00:01:32.040> design

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
mug but I think another nice design

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.499 
mug but I think another nice design
feature<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.420> how<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.680> human<00:01:35.520> jump<00:01:35.939> is

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
feature is how the human jump is

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.620 
feature is how the human jump is
actually<00:01:37.369> embossed<00:01:38.369> on<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.790> cup<00:01:39.150> which<00:01:39.450> is

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
actually embossed on the cup which is

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.370 
actually embossed on the cup which is
kind<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.900> nice

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
kind of nice

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.340 
kind of nice
and<00:01:40.500> then<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.159> have<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.909> actual

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
and then you have the actual

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.160 
and then you have the actual
proclamation<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.590> hunga<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.909> says<00:01:45.270> that

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
proclamation in hunga that says that

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.460 
proclamation in hunga that says that
king<00:01:46.560> sejong<00:01:46.860> craved<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.820> Hangul<00:01:48.149> alphabet

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
king sejong craved the Hangul alphabet

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.359 
king sejong craved the Hangul alphabet
because<00:01:50.899> Chinese<00:01:51.899> script<00:01:52.290> didn't<00:01:52.770> really<00:01:52.979> mix

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
because Chinese script didn't really mix

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.209 
because Chinese script didn't really mix
well<00:01:53.670> with<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.630> way<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.990> Koreans<00:01:55.470> spoke<00:01:55.950> and

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
well with the way the Koreans spoke and

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.249 
well with the way the Koreans spoke and
that<00:01:56.759> if<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.149> weren't<00:01:57.360> educated<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:58.110> had<00:01:58.229> a

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
that if you weren't educated you had a

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.980 
that if you weren't educated you had a
hard<00:01:58.560> time<00:01:58.880> expressing<00:01:59.880> yourself<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:00.810> the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
hard time expressing yourself in the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.630 
hard time expressing yourself in the
written<00:02:01.259> language<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.890> he<00:02:01.920> created<00:02:02.490> the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
written language so he created the

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.880 
written language so he created the
alphabet<00:02:03.149> so<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.509> everyone<00:02:04.020> could<00:02:04.590> express

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
alphabet so that everyone could express

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.730 
alphabet so that everyone could express
themselves<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.670> written<00:02:06.090> form<00:02:06.509> now<00:02:07.079> as<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.680> said

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
themselves in written form now as I said

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.300 
themselves in written form now as I said
