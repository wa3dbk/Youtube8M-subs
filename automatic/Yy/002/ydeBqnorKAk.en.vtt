this<00:00:34.350> year<00:00:34.680> but<00:00:35.280> as<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.820> guys<00:00:36.030> probably<00:00:36.059> know

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
this year but as you guys probably know

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.479 
this year but as you guys probably know
if<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.200> watch<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.590> win<00:00:37.739> show<00:00:38.040> on<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.219> fairly

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
if you watch the win show on a fairly

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.430 
if you watch the win show on a fairly
regular<00:00:38.730> basis<00:00:39.390> one<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.050> things<00:00:40.260> I'm

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
regular basis one of the things I'm

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.380 
regular basis one of the things I'm
really<00:00:40.469> excited<00:00:41.219> about<00:00:41.430> for<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.879> future<00:00:42.059> is

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
really excited about for the future is

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.660 
really excited about for the future is
invidious<00:00:42.690> grid<00:00:43.170> technology<00:00:43.430> maybe<00:00:44.430> not

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
invidious grid technology maybe not

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.100 
invidious grid technology maybe not
necessarily<00:00:45.360> from<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.600> cloud<00:00:45.870> gaming

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
necessarily from the cloud gaming

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.660 
necessarily from the cloud gaming
perspective<00:00:46.739> because<00:00:46.890> I'm<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.129> Canada<00:00:47.520> where

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
perspective because I'm in Canada where

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.790 
perspective because I'm in Canada where
internet<00:00:48.059> connections<00:00:48.510> are<00:00:48.660> still<00:00:48.930> basically

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
internet connections are still basically

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.920 
internet connections are still basically
Stone<00:00:50.219> Age<00:00:50.489> but<00:00:51.059> from<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.449> what<00:00:51.719> this

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
Stone Age but from a what this

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.650 
Stone Age but from a what this
technology<00:00:52.590> enables<00:00:53.420> perspective<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:54.539> I've

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
technology enables perspective so I've

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.660 
technology enables perspective so I've
got<00:00:54.809> Andrew<00:00:55.230> fear<00:00:55.469> with<00:00:55.649> me<00:00:55.800> here<00:00:56.039> from<00:00:56.190> Nvidia

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
got Andrew fear with me here from Nvidia

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.810 
got Andrew fear with me here from Nvidia
to<00:00:57.180> talk<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.570> us<00:00:57.719> about<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.620> device<00:00:59.070> which<00:00:59.640> is

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
to talk to us about this device which is

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.819 
to talk to us about this device which is
being<00:01:00.000> shown<00:01:00.359> off<00:01:00.539> here<00:01:01.109> in<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.350> public<00:01:01.739> and

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
being shown off here in the public and

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.219 
being shown off here in the public and
I'm<00:01:01.920> just<00:01:02.039> gonna<00:01:02.129> oh<00:01:02.520> yes<00:01:03.390> ok<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:03.870> tell<00:01:04.110> me

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
I'm just gonna oh yes ok so tell me

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.140 
I'm just gonna oh yes ok so tell me
about<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.589> what<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.850> grid

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
about it what is this so this is grid

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.670 
about it what is this so this is grid
and<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.479> for<00:01:06.630> grid<00:01:06.780> for<00:01:06.960> us<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.320> we<00:01:07.470> built

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
and so for grid for us is we built

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.950 
and so for grid for us is we built
custom-made<00:01:08.400> cloud<00:01:08.760> graphics<00:01:09.270> cards<00:01:09.630> so

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
custom-made cloud graphics cards so

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.450 
custom-made cloud graphics cards so
instead<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.290> putting<00:01:10.439> one<00:01:10.740> chip<00:01:11.040> on<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> board

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
instead of putting one chip on a board

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.539 
instead of putting one chip on a board
we<00:01:11.640> put<00:01:11.820> four<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.479> then<00:01:12.900> we<00:01:12.990> put<00:01:13.290> up<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.770> three

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
we put four and then we put up to three

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.219 
we put four and then we put up to three
of<00:01:14.670> those<00:01:14.790> cards<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.330> server<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.810> any<00:01:15.960> one<00:01:16.140> of

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
of those cards in a server so any one of

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.620 
of those cards in a server so any one of
these<00:01:16.320> servers<00:01:16.560> can<00:01:17.220> have<00:01:17.400> 12<00:01:17.759> GPUs<00:01:18.390> all

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
these servers can have 12 GPUs all

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.330 
these servers can have 12 GPUs all
running<00:01:18.930> at<00:01:18.990> once<00:01:19.229> if<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.680> imagine<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:20.130> full

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
running at once if you imagine a full

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.020 
running at once if you imagine a full
rack<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.790> it's<00:01:21.000> about<00:01:21.470> 360<00:01:22.470> GPUs<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.850> can

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
rack of this it's about 360 GPUs it can

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.330 
rack of this it's about 360 GPUs it can
stream<00:01:24.299> about<00:01:24.509> 720<00:01:25.409> concurrent<00:01:25.830> users<00:01:26.130> from<00:01:26.310> a

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
stream about 720 concurrent users from a

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.460 
stream about 720 concurrent users from a
single<00:01:26.700> server<00:01:26.970> Rajko<00:01:27.240> grid<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.320> whole

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
single server Rajko grid and the whole

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.380 
single server Rajko grid and the whole
idea<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:29.009> we<00:01:29.700> render<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.060> game<00:01:30.210> like

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
idea is that we render a game like

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.179 
idea is that we render a game like
normal<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:31.049> rendering<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.500> game<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.979> then<00:01:32.070> in

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
normal just rendering a game and then in

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.310 
normal just rendering a game and then in
real<00:01:32.340> time<00:01:32.610> very<00:01:32.939> very<00:01:33.180> fast<00:01:33.450> we<00:01:33.720> encoded<00:01:34.200> as<00:01:34.290> a

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
real time very very fast we encoded as a

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.140 
real time very very fast we encoded as a
video<00:01:34.590> stream<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.189> then<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.640> can<00:01:35.790> send<00:01:36.090> it

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
video stream and then you can send it

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.370 
video stream and then you can send it
out<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.420> any<00:01:36.509> device<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.780> want<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.140> can<00:01:37.259> set

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
out to any device you want you can set

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.330 
out to any device you want you can set

so that's what you guys are showing off
here<00:01:48.180> right<00:01:48.360> all<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.780> these<00:01:48.930> shields<00:01:49.290> are

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
here right all of these shields are

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.219 
here right all of these shields are
actually<00:01:50.430> legitimately<00:01:51.180> being<00:01:51.509> powered<00:01:51.990> off

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
actually legitimately being powered off

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.050 
actually legitimately being powered off
of<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.740> grid<00:01:52.950> behind<00:01:53.310> me<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.759> correct

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
of the grid behind me is that correct

back here we didn't bring a full rack we

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.649 
back here we didn't bring a full rack we
only<00:01:59.219> needed<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.520> couple<00:01:59.700> servers<00:02:00.119> but<00:02:00.570> we're

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
personally get really excited about is

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.890 
personally get really excited about is
more<00:03:12.280> like<00:03:12.460> a<00:03:12.490> local<00:03:12.970> installation<00:03:13.570> of<00:03:13.660> grid

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
more like a local installation of grid

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.530 
more like a local installation of grid
now<00:03:14.410> I'm<00:03:14.770> not<00:03:14.950> a<00:03:14.980> general<00:03:15.370> consumer<00:03:15.910> I<00:03:16.120> have<00:03:16.510> a

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
now I'm not a general consumer I have a

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.570 
now I'm not a general consumer I have a

that has a two thousand dollar rate card
in<00:03:20.500> it<00:03:20.530> so<00:03:21.130> to<00:03:21.520> put<00:03:21.670> that<00:03:21.820> in<00:03:21.940> perspective<00:03:22.120> if<00:03:22.990> I

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
in it so to put that in perspective if I

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.050 
in it so to put that in perspective if I
was<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.770> kind<00:03:23.890> of<00:03:24.040> person<00:03:24.220> who<00:03:24.520> was<00:03:24.670> crazy

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
was the kind of person who was crazy

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.780 
was the kind of person who was crazy
enough<00:03:25.360> to<00:03:25.780> buy<00:03:26.260> something<00:03:26.980> like<00:03:27.130> a<00:03:27.160> second<00:03:27.670> or

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
enough to buy something like a second or

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.520 
enough to buy something like a second or
a<00:03:27.850> third<00:03:27.880> or<00:03:28.180> a<00:03:28.240> fourth<00:03:28.450> generation<00:03:28.570> grid<00:03:29.320> and

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
a third or a fourth generation grid and

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.710 
a third or a fourth generation grid and
deploy<00:03:29.800> that<00:03:29.830> or<00:03:30.430> if<00:03:30.580> a<00:03:30.700> land<00:03:30.970> center<00:03:31.420> were<00:03:31.570> to

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
deploy that or if a land center were to

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.840 
deploy that or if a land center were to
technically<00:03:32.230> were<00:03:32.770> to<00:03:32.890> deploy<00:03:33.160> that<00:03:33.400> it's

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
technically were to deploy that it's

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.449 
technically were to deploy that it's
technologically<00:03:34.780> possible<00:03:35.140> correct<00:03:35.920> yeah<00:03:36.430> I

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
technologically possible correct yeah I

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.280 
technologically possible correct yeah I
mean<00:03:36.700> there's<00:03:36.940> nothing<00:03:37.480> stopping<00:03:37.930> us<00:03:38.200> right

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
mean there's nothing stopping us right

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.170 
mean there's nothing stopping us right
now<00:03:38.410> for<00:03:39.100> going<00:03:39.280> like<00:03:39.459> a<00:03:39.490> game<00:03:39.730> Saturday<00:03:39.970> I

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
now for going like a game Saturday I

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.880 
now for going like a game Saturday I
could<00:03:40.660> easily<00:03:40.780> imagine<00:03:41.020> a<00:03:41.380> game<00:03:41.530> center

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
could easily imagine a game center

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.710 
could easily imagine a game center
buying<00:03:42.130> a<00:03:42.250> couple<00:03:42.459> of<00:03:42.610> servers<00:03:43.030> putting<00:03:43.630> in

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
buying a couple of servers putting in

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.850 
buying a couple of servers putting in
their<00:03:43.810> server<00:03:44.080> room<00:03:44.320> and<00:03:44.530> then<00:03:44.650> they<00:03:44.770> don't

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
their server room and then they don't

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.740 
their server room and then they don't
need<00:03:45.040> to<00:03:45.100> have<00:03:45.250> you<00:03:45.760> know<00:03:45.850> sixteen<00:03:46.330> computers

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
need to have you know sixteen computers

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
need to have you know sixteen computers
lying<00:03:46.959> around<00:03:47.080> they<00:03:47.260> gonna<00:03:47.410> have<00:03:47.560> just

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
lying around they gonna have just

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.650 
lying around they gonna have just
sixteen<00:03:48.160> monitors<00:03:48.640> is<00:03:48.790> very<00:03:48.970> very<00:03:49.180> simple

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
sixteen monitors is very very simple

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.690 
sixteen monitors is very very simple
you<00:03:49.990> know<00:03:50.080> $50<00:03:50.530> device<00:03:50.830> that<00:03:51.070> was<00:03:51.160> decoding

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
you know $50 device that was decoding

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.610 
you know $50 device that was decoding
the<00:03:51.760> video<00:03:52.000> playing<00:03:52.330> cloud<00:03:52.570> gaming<00:03:52.780> obviously

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
the video playing cloud gaming obviously

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.140 
the video playing cloud gaming obviously
it's<00:03:53.770> possible<00:03:54.220> you<00:03:54.580> know<00:03:54.670> we're<00:03:54.790> talking<00:03:54.940> to

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
it's possible you know we're talking to

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.370 
it's possible you know we're talking to
me<00:03:55.240> all<00:03:55.300> about<00:03:55.390> it<00:03:55.630> I<00:03:55.810> think<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:56.050> initial

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
me all about it I think the initial

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.720 
me all about it I think the initial
deployment<00:03:56.560> without<00:03:56.800> gaming<00:03:57.310> receipt

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
deployment without gaming receipt

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.430 
deployment without gaming receipt
probably<00:03:58.450> more<00:03:58.570> than<00:03:58.660> the<00:03:58.750> national<00:03:59.260> level

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
probably more than the national level

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.380 
probably more than the national level
for<00:03:59.860> more<00:04:00.010> service<00:04:00.459> providers<00:04:00.880> but<00:04:01.060> it's

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
for more service providers but it's

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.520 
for more service providers but it's
certainly<00:04:01.720> I<00:04:01.780> think<00:04:01.870> a<00:04:02.020> couple<00:04:02.260> years<00:04:02.500> down

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
certainly I think a couple years down

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.960 
certainly I think a couple years down
the<00:04:02.740> road<00:04:02.800> you<00:04:03.040> can<00:04:03.070> see<00:04:03.310> it<00:04:03.430> showing<00:04:03.700> up<00:04:03.850> the

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
the road you can see it showing up the

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.060 
the road you can see it showing up the
game<00:04:04.180> centers<00:04:04.570> speaking<00:04:05.260> of<00:04:05.380> showing<00:04:05.770> up<00:04:05.950> I

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
game centers speaking of showing up I

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.650 
game centers speaking of showing up I
mean<00:04:06.220> is<00:04:06.340> this<00:04:06.430> really<00:04:06.490> that<00:04:06.940> different<00:04:07.570> from

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
mean is this really that different from

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.120 
mean is this really that different from
the<00:04:07.810> technology<00:04:08.380> you<00:04:08.500> guys<00:04:08.650> have<00:04:08.860> been<00:04:08.920> able

III create a software program that
emulates<00:05:27.220> my<00:05:27.580> GPU<00:05:27.940> I<00:05:28.180> load<00:05:28.660> it<00:05:28.810> into<00:05:28.930> a<00:05:29.080> giant

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
emulates my GPU I load it into a giant

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.530 
emulates my GPU I load it into a giant
datacenter<00:05:29.920> and<00:05:29.950> I<00:05:30.250> run<00:05:30.490> doom<00:05:30.730> it<00:05:31.060> may<00:05:31.420> only

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 
datacenter and I run doom it may only

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.090 
datacenter and I run doom it may only
run<00:05:31.780> it<00:05:31.870> one<00:05:32.020> frame<00:05:32.260> per<00:05:32.440> second<00:05:32.800> but<00:05:32.920> at<00:05:33.040> least

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
run it one frame per second but at least

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.230 
run it one frame per second but at least
I<00:05:33.280> can<00:05:33.340> know<00:05:33.490> that<00:05:33.610> it<00:05:33.730> works

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
I can know that it works

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.720 
I can know that it works
so<00:05:34.660> we<00:05:35.440> developed<00:05:35.830> technology<00:05:36.400> from<00:05:36.580> that

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 
so we developed technology from that

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.730 
so we developed technology from that
learning<00:05:37.120> how<00:05:37.240> to<00:05:37.300> remote<00:05:37.780> into<00:05:38.200> debug

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
learning how to remote into debug

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.010 
learning how to remote into debug
