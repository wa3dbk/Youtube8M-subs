00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.889
 and he won Spanish and starts dreaming about 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:10.650
 the possibility of European the next 

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:13.050
 season after winning in the coliseum 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.990
 alfonso pérez el getafe in a match 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.490
 marked by the policy the arbitration of 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.100
 fernando in fernando teixiera vitienes 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.010
 very very questioned and with don vicente 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.930
 of the forest in the box of this coliseum 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.400
 alfonso pérez watching some of the 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.350
 Spanish players that has both 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.210
 getafe as Spanish that was the first 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.359
 possibility of the match for paco 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.000
 Alcácer slipped Cristian Álvarez the 

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:38.309
 goalkeeper who was a surprise 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.170
 Kiko box on the bench finished 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.290
 snatching the ball and the Argentinian 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.130
 forward of the valencia the Spanish that 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.510
 marked first with this great combination 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.460
 Verdú started the play 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.280
 Stuani raised the ball so that the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.590
 mischievous and with the sergio garcía head and 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.960
 the same green ended up finishing off 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.270
 masterly way great goal 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.640
 combinative on the part of Spanish that 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.570
 It gave a joy to fans parakeets 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.390
 displaced to getafe 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.970
 and we see how the action starts and 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.220
 how do you look for a goal area? 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.470
 It really is beautiful on the part of 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.080
 parrots that accumulate their third day 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.280
 consecutively winning at home by the 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.280
 same result 0 to 2 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.150
 He tried to tie the getafe and got it 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.500
 but this action was canceled out 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.210
 crazy game 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.730
 and the players of espanyol that 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.820
 congratulated for having thrown the out of 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.550
 game in a good way and we see the action 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.680
 in which indeed the wolf was 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.750
 more advanced than the last defender 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.660
 parakeet came to rest with that 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.400
 provisional result from 0 to 1 in the 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.710
 second part everything would be complicated after 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.720
 this error of borja had seen the 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.090
 first yellow card in the first 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.940
 part and here I saw the second after 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.430
 slip and hold the ball with the 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.650
 hands 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.600
 and questionable this yellow card 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.270
 for borja that came to the path of 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.130
 wardrobe relatively soon with all 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.860
 the second half to be played and with a 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.490
 Spanish that beat 0 to 1 the action did not 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.490
 offers doubts 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.060
 the getafe who had a good chance 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.880
 with this shot that ended up in the hands 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.730
 of a goalkeeper who was already injured 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.980
 cristian álvarez shortly after it would be 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.620
 replaced to enter kiko box 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.090
 and we see it annoyed the goalkeeper 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.400
 Argentine who has few possibilities 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.160
 of playing lately and once I 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.690
 he gets hurt just is not a 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.270
 good news, far from it for the 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.380
 came in the usual holder kiko box 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.650
 to the field of play 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.490
 and in that action I was going to see the second 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.490
 yellow card 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.680
 fede fernández the Argentine central who 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.510
 had seen the first card in the 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.090
 first part more than unfair 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.190
 there would be the second with this play 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.220
 in which I made you vitienes finished 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.710
 teaching the direct red 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.470
 we will see the lack on sergio garcía and 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.660
 the referee that ejected the second 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.760
 footballer of getafe and in that same 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.760
 missing or perhaps put the ball to 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.450
 colotto and this a golden ball so that 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.879
 Christian Stuani mark 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.220
 great action worked strategy by 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:23.980
 part of Javier Aguirre there 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:28.019
 the match was definitely over 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.019
 and I celebrated it that way this year 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:36.130
 we have the great assistance of colotto 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:38.530
 what quality to send that ball of that 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.500
 way to get it down and put the work very 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.660
 very easy to christian stuani 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.740
 from there naturally it seemed 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.600
 a matter of time that the 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.010
 third although the espanyol little bit 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.720
 tried this was one of the best 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.110
 options already at the last minute 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.560
 Tasty simao put the quality to the test 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.030
 of the getafe goalkeeper of codina 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.310
 avoided the third one however he could not 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.130
 avoid defeat because he had to paddle 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.630
 always against the current the getafe with 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.910
 the events that were happening in 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.680
 the match at the end great victory for 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.120
 the Spanish who starts dreaming about 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.300
 Europe next season 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.720
 getafe 0 espanyol 2 marked verdú and 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.720
 stuani
