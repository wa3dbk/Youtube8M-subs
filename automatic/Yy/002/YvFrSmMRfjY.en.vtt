sometimes<00:05:04.479> I<00:05:04.840> use<00:05:05.350> the<00:05:05.830> S<00:05:06.039> Curl<00:05:06.400> as<00:05:06.580> a

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
sometimes I use the S Curl as a

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.850 
sometimes I use the S Curl as a
moisturizer<00:05:07.060> but<00:05:07.870> I<00:05:07.930> find<00:05:08.260> that<00:05:08.350> you<00:05:08.620> know<00:05:08.740> the

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
moisturizer but I find that you know the

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.279 
moisturizer but I find that you know the
escrow<00:05:09.280> had<00:05:09.610> this<00:05:09.789> like<00:05:10.090> real<00:05:10.330> sticky<00:05:10.810> feel<00:05:11.020> to

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:11.289

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:13.800 
escrow had this like real sticky feel to
it<00:05:11.380> so<00:05:11.979> I<00:05:12.010> tend<00:05:12.820> not<00:05:12.910> to<00:05:13.210> use<00:05:13.240> that<00:05:13.630> to

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.390 
it so I tend not to use that to
moisturize<00:05:14.289> um<00:05:14.919> all<00:05:15.850> the<00:05:16.180> time<00:05:16.419> so<00:05:17.340> I'll<00:05:18.340> use
