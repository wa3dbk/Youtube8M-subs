00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
these pools in the tank will also help

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.350 
these pools in the tank will also help
keep<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.400> moisture<00:02:42.549> up<00:02:42.849> as<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.180> water

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
keep the moisture up as the water

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.020 
keep the moisture up as the water
evaporates<00:02:43.510> in<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:43.989> pools<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:45.340> here<00:02:45.819> is<00:02:45.940> the

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
evaporates in the pools so here is the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.149 
evaporates in the pools so here is the
first<00:02:46.209> one<00:02:46.379> the<00:02:47.379> first<00:02:47.590> kind<00:02:47.769> of<00:02:47.890> water<00:02:48.040> you

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159 
first one the first kind of water you

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:49.949 
first one the first kind of water you
need<00:02:48.310> is<00:02:48.459> fresh<00:02:48.700> water<00:02:48.939> it's<00:02:49.390> pretty<00:02:49.599> simple

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
need is fresh water it's pretty simple

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.839 
need is fresh water it's pretty simple
it's<00:02:50.109> easiest<00:02:50.379> one<00:02:50.560> to<00:02:50.590> do<00:02:50.799> you<00:02:51.400> can<00:02:51.579> use<00:02:51.730> your

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
it's easiest one to do you can use your

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.699 
it's easiest one to do you can use your
regular<00:02:52.030> tap<00:02:52.420> water<00:02:52.450> for<00:02:52.900> it<00:02:53.049> and<00:02:53.140> then<00:02:53.650> you

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
regular tap water for it and then you

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.890 
regular tap water for it and then you
just<00:02:53.950> use<00:02:54.190> a<00:02:54.220> dechlorinator<00:02:55.090> to<00:02:55.510> get<00:02:55.750> the

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
just use a dechlorinator to get the

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.330 
just use a dechlorinator to get the
chlorine<00:02:56.170> and<00:02:56.440> other<00:02:56.530> chemicals<00:02:57.010> from<00:02:57.129> your

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
chlorine and other chemicals from your

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.240 
chlorine and other chemicals from your
tap<00:02:57.519> out<00:02:57.760> I<00:02:58.030> would<00:02:58.900> suggest<00:02:59.079> getting<00:02:59.889> some

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
tap out I would suggest getting some

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.339 
tap out I would suggest getting some
kind<00:03:00.430> of<00:03:00.549> bottle<00:03:00.790> that<00:03:01.359> tells<00:03:01.659> you<00:03:01.870> how<00:03:02.139> many

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
kind of bottle that tells you how many

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.710 
kind of bottle that tells you how many
Ounces<00:03:02.829> are<00:03:02.859> on<00:03:03.250> there<00:03:03.489> so<00:03:04.120> that<00:03:04.269> it's<00:03:04.359> easier

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
Ounces are on there so that it's easier

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.140 
Ounces are on there so that it's easier
to<00:03:04.780> measure<00:03:05.079> how<00:03:05.440> many<00:03:05.500> drops<00:03:05.889> you<00:03:06.040> need<00:03:06.190> you

to measure how many drops you need you

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.849 
to measure how many drops you need you
can<00:03:07.329> use<00:03:07.480> any<00:03:07.750> dechlorinator<00:03:08.440> that's<00:03:08.650> used

hermit crabs or if you're not just
starting<00:06:07.870> out<00:06:07.960> your<00:06:08.080> tank<00:06:08.290> this<00:06:08.770> gallon<00:06:09.190> will

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
starting out your tank this gallon will

my last gallon of this lasted me easily

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.210 
my last gallon of this lasted me easily
ten<00:06:12.550> days<00:06:13.110> so<00:06:14.110> it's<00:06:14.410> a<00:06:14.470> good<00:06:14.560> investment<00:06:14.620> I

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
ten days so it's a good investment I

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.380 
ten days so it's a good investment I
think<00:06:15.490> it's<00:06:15.580> the<00:06:15.700> notion<00:06:16.000> was<00:06:16.090> like<00:06:16.210> ten

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:16.390 
think it's the notion was like ten

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:19.670 
think it's the notion was like ten
dollars<00:06:16.720> so<00:06:17.070> it's<00:06:18.070> not<00:06:18.190> that<00:06:18.550> expensive<00:06:18.790> and

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
dollars so it's not that expensive and

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
dollars so it's not that expensive and
there<00:06:20.680> you<00:06:20.740> go<00:06:20.860> that's<00:06:21.310> your<00:06:21.400> saltwater

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:23.700 
there you go that's your saltwater

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.860 
there you go that's your saltwater
you're<00:06:24.700> going<00:06:24.940> to<00:06:25.060> need<00:06:25.240> to<00:06:25.330> have<00:06:25.450> two<00:06:25.660> pools

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 
you're going to need to have two pools

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.540 
you're going to need to have two pools
of<00:06:26.110> water<00:06:26.350> at<00:06:26.530> least<00:06:26.830> in<00:06:27.070> your<00:06:27.190> tank

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
of water at least in your tank

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.430 
of water at least in your tank
keeping<00:06:28.450> this<00:06:28.510> pools<00:06:28.750> of<00:06:28.840> water<00:06:28.870> in<00:06:29.110> tank<00:06:29.260> it

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
keeping this pools of water in tank it

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.690 
keeping this pools of water in tank it
keeps<00:06:29.620> the<00:06:29.710> moisture<00:06:29.830> up<00:06:30.130> in<00:06:30.220> the<00:06:30.280> air<00:06:30.400> because

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:30.700 
keeps the moisture up in the air because

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.580 
keeps the moisture up in the air because
the<00:06:30.790> water<00:06:30.940> evaporates<00:06:31.420> it<00:06:32.080> also<00:06:32.260> allows<00:06:32.470> you

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.590 
the water evaporates it also allows you

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:33.840 
the water evaporates it also allows you
to<00:06:32.650> give<00:06:32.830> both<00:06:33.010> fresh<00:06:33.370> and<00:06:33.400> saltwater

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:33.850

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:56.620 
want in their shell water this is just

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.590 
want in their shell water this is just
like<00:06:56.740> they<00:06:56.860> would<00:06:56.950> do<00:06:57.100> in<00:06:57.220> nature<00:06:57.520> and<00:06:58.420> it

like they would do in nature and it

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.610 
like they would do in nature and it
makes<00:06:58.720> them<00:06:58.840> much<00:06:58.960> healthier<00:06:59.380> and<00:06:59.410> live
