why<00:03:04.090> not<00:03:05.190> then<00:03:06.190> we<00:03:06.370> run<00:03:06.519> one<00:03:06.819> BLS<00:03:07.209> BLS<00:03:08.079> was<00:03:08.319> a

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
why not then we run one BLS BLS was a

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.030 
why not then we run one BLS BLS was a

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
around with BLS and I mean it seems to

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.699 
around with BLS and I mean it seems to
work<00:03:14.019> really<00:03:14.170> well<00:03:14.790> I<00:03:16.230> just<00:03:17.230> need<00:03:17.620> more

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.850 
three to three and then I just decided
three<00:04:28.960> histories<00:04:29.760> just<00:04:30.760> a<00:04:30.790> basic<00:04:31.060> number

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
three histories just a basic number

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.090 
three histories just a basic number
these<00:04:32.860> are<00:04:32.919> pretty<00:04:33.880> much<00:04:34.030> why<00:04:34.240> this<00:04:34.300> deck<00:04:35.100> can

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
these are pretty much why this deck can

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.400 
these are pretty much why this deck can
just<00:04:36.310> keep<00:04:36.850> up<00:04:37.030> with<00:04:37.270> keep<00:04:37.870> up<00:04:38.020> with<00:04:38.139> the<00:04:38.229> meta

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
just keep up with keep up with the meta

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.850 
just keep up with keep up with the meta
somewhat<00:04:39.479> it's<00:04:40.479> just<00:04:40.690> because<00:04:41.410> this<00:04:41.560> deck<00:04:41.710> has

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
somewhat it's just because this deck has

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.190 
somewhat it's just because this deck has
maxed<00:04:42.190> raw<00:04:42.310> power<00:04:42.550> it<00:04:43.120> has<00:04:43.330> your<00:04:43.960> blue<00:04:44.169> eyes

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
maxed raw power it has your blue eyes

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.140 
maxed raw power it has your blue eyes
and<00:04:44.770> then<00:04:45.010> you're<00:04:45.280> what<00:04:45.460> sort<00:04:45.639> of<00:04:45.669> legends

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
and then you're what sort of legends

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.670 
and then you're what sort of legends
just<00:04:47.050> because<00:04:47.560> you<00:04:47.770> know<00:04:48.000> you<00:04:49.000> need<00:04:49.120> to<00:04:49.680> get

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
just because you know you need to get

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.800 
just because you know you need to get
them<00:04:50.830> in<00:04:50.919> the<00:04:51.010> graveyard<00:04:51.190> and<00:04:51.580> get<00:04:52.150> some<00:04:52.690> good
