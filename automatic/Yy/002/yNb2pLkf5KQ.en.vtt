purple metallic luster colorway but
there's<00:00:08.670> actually<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:09.150> few<00:00:09.360> changes<00:00:09.570> with

there's actually a few changes with

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.499 
there's actually a few changes with
these<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.670> as<00:00:11.670> you<00:00:11.820> know<00:00:11.940> they<00:00:12.120> don't<00:00:12.269> have<00:00:12.360> to

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
these and as you know they don't have to

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:13.999 
these and as you know they don't have to
slipcover<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.170> don't<00:00:13.410> know<00:00:13.469> if<00:00:13.559> it's<00:00:13.650> only<00:00:13.769> my

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
slipcover I don't know if it's only my

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.490 
slipcover I don't know if it's only my
pair<00:00:14.280> but<00:00:14.790> I'm<00:00:15.360> guessing<00:00:15.599> they<00:00:15.929> just<00:00:16.230> aren't

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
pair but I'm guessing they just aren't

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.980 
pair but I'm guessing they just aren't
gonna<00:00:16.680> put<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.160> anymore<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:18.300> from<00:00:18.720> what<00:00:18.960> I

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
gonna put it anymore and from what I

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.540 
gonna put it anymore and from what I
know<00:00:19.080> these<00:00:19.470> are<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.800> last<00:00:19.980> two<00:00:20.130> colorways

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
know these are the last two colorways

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.720 
know these are the last two colorways
for<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.029> Lee<00:00:21.270> series<00:00:21.720> for<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.080> vapors<00:00:22.580> or<00:00:23.580> the

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
for the Lee series for the vapors or the

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.089 
for the Lee series for the vapors or the
mercurial<00:00:24.269> line<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.449> guess<00:00:24.830> but<00:00:25.830> here's

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
mercurial line I guess but here's

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.560 
mercurial line I guess but here's
another<00:00:26.160> change<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.849> can<00:00:26.970> see<00:00:27.119> has<00:00:27.359> like<00:00:27.539> a
