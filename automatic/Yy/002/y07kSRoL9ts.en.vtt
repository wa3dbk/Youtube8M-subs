00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
was not touching it I was not making any

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.200 
was not touching it I was not making any
physical<00:00:43.530> contact<00:00:43.590> with<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.520> cellular<00:00:45.149> device

and<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.200> just<00:00:46.379> slid<00:00:46.620> off<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.770> roof<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.280> onto

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
and it just slid off the roof and onto

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.229 
and it just slid off the roof and onto
the<00:00:47.879> pavement<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.510> smash<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.760> figured

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
the pavement and smash so I figured

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.939 
the pavement and smash so I figured
since<00:00:51.360> it's<00:00:51.750> not<00:00:51.899> really<00:00:52.140> my<00:00:52.260> fault<00:00:52.469> maybe

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
since it's not really my fault maybe

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.580 
since it's not really my fault maybe
that<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.430> could<00:00:53.730> have<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.149> replaced<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.960> don't

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
that I could have it replaced I don't

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.930 
that I could have it replaced I don't
think<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:55.829> accident<00:00:56.280> qualifies<00:00:56.730> is

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
think this accident qualifies is

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.760 
think this accident qualifies is
something<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.329> can<00:00:57.510> wear<00:00:58.050> your<00:00:58.170> iPhone<00:00:58.559> can

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
something that can wear your iPhone can

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.950

this<00:01:01.260> it's<00:01:01.649> not<00:01:01.829> my<00:01:02.100> fault<00:01:02.160> why<00:01:02.850> can't<00:01:03.239> i<00:01:03.420> have

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
this it's not my fault why can't i have
