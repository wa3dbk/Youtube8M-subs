00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.180

 important and sensitive to preserve

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.100
 it's very clean has rooms to wait and 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.920
 is more comfortable than the provisional one that was 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.170
 before and it's better for the development of 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.390
 our country I feel proud of 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.820
 have an airport like this 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.619
 like other countries the execution of these 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.740
 works consisted in the extension 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.930
 of the terminal building of three thousand 842 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.200
 square meters as well as a new 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.180
 reinforced concrete technical block of 3 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.969
 square meters that currently looks 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.560
 a polycarbonate cover the 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:24.289
 remodeling the service hangar 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.289
 against fire of 335 square meters 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:29.509
 parking and exterior works the 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.020
 Current Galapagos Airport I 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.039
 surprised what they of her 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.720
 facilities are much more modern 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.520
 Of course I'm comparing it, it 's like 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.189
 airports that I experienced 17 years ago 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.860
 with we even had a strike for which 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.539
 I can not leave the island 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.549
 now I am everything much more organized 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.560
 much more fattening was not about a 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:52.640
 comprehensive work carried out since October 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.110
 2012 to November 2014 the improvements 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.270
 they were also for the control area 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.429
 a conveyor luggage 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.970
 both for the check-in section and for 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:03.770
 arrival they give agility to the process besides 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.929
 they implemented access networks 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.780
 closed circuit flight information 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:11.390
 of television and natural air conditioning in 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.670
 all areas of the air terminal my 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.340
 first impression of the airport was that 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.230
 it's a pretty modern airport for 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.450
 what I thought they had on the island 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.510
 I found it very organized and very pretty 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.400
 the visit here to san cristóbal without a doubt 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.260
 it's a complete transformation that 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.569
 improves safety in the 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.030
 flights user connectivity 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.519
 of the islands and power to Galapagos as 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.920
 a tourist destination of the equator of this 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.959
 way the Ecuadorian state guarantees the 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.160
 ecosystem protection and good 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.160
 live of the inhabitants
