00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.040
 now that you've seen the big picture 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.259
 Overall the mountain bike if you have not yet 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.000
 You know, just click here on this link. 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.599
 Let's talk about the specific parts. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.599
 of this bicycle 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.199
 I'll talk about the transmission system 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.900
 of the bicycle 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.849
 I'll tell you first, I think that whoever sees 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.940
 now the first thing that people 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.100
 see is what it reveals these people have 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.079
 two crowns 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.870
 it is part of the transmission system of the 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.480
 bicycle present for you in by 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:47.100
 one for you to better understand what it is 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:50.219
 each front-end component it 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.899
 has the function of passing current from a 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.899
 crown to another of peti beautiful 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:02.360
 it pushes current current will 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:09.020
 search for 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:10.940
 The steam has the same rear 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:16.570
 similar function 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:20.750
 She pushes sick this time never 77 is 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.190
 This party here is a set of 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.490
 reviews 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.759
 we have 10 million together 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:33.619
 he is the sport of shape the cassette then 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:40.160
 the rear is only one - fifth the other 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:43.580
 this makes you leave the 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:48.800
 heavier or lighter pedal you are 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.940
 there I wanted to talk now to the 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.210
 brakes 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:56.840
 this is the hydraulic brake 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:02:02.569
 I extremely have the hose where 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:06.880
 pass the oil and also the tweezers the tweezers 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:11.590
 It has two clamping inserts 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:15.519
 the motor rotor and that disk which are 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:18.819
 Sales in the center of the wheel it the 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:25.989
 matches will tighten control and make 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:27.550
 bike for mountain bike frame 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.860
 huh 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.380
 you can see that speech mounts max 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:36.430
 usually a more strengthened framework 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:40.000
 You can also see that it 's a 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:43.510
 that mud does not accumulate in it 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:49.709
 so opening it close to the time is 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.709
 big in front and back 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:57.880
 you can also see that the pedal your foot 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:02.590
 clean will pick up the front are the tire 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:06.040
 front another thing is also that the 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.750
 frame covers the compact are you to ask 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.870
 agility in the daughter 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.890
 so you at the time of buying it packs 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.350
 of montain bike you have to choose one 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.740
 frame with pact for you to have more 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.690
 agility on the track a bicycle 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.500
 mountain bike also generally has a 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.340
 with his role absorbed the 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.000
 impact 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.670
 You 're in the shingle you're coming down that 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.920
 descent full of stone it will absorb 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.840
 the impacts to you you will not fall 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.930
 will not skid 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:45.460
 you will keep a line only the 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:48.700
 any stage any glows 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:52.250
 some bikes you can catch the 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:55.520
 bumper for you to give up 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:58.190
 so you do not waste energy 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:01.490
 you can pedal standing on the strength of the 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:05.350
 handlebars that your strength will not be 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.350
 wasted a buffer stroke 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:16.660
 I'm going to tell you the tire has a difference now 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:20.989
 between tire has is this special is a tire 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:24.710
 on earth and besides being the earth he is a 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:28.010
 tire for dry weather ie it is not 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:31.040
 indicated for mud because his slaves 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:34.400
 but you can see that they are close together 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.990
 then the mud comes in easily to see 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.180
 one thing only 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:42.830
 then these slaves actually have the 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:46.370
 function to enter the earth with a 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.440
 loose or loose gravel for you to have 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:52.400
 greater stability in the issue of 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:55.820
 tire has also the width of you have a 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.130
 wider tire you have more friction 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:01.000
 more also have more comfort have more 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.000
 stability too
