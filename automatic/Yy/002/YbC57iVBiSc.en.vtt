free<00:00:04.680> bot<00:00:04.859> and<00:00:05.130> you<00:00:05.759> noticed<00:00:06.240> i<00:00:06.299> started<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.690> bit

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
free bot and you noticed i started a bit

free bot and you noticed i started a bit
late<00:00:06.899> that's<00:00:07.350> because<00:00:07.620> i<00:00:07.649> was<00:00:07.830> eating<00:00:08.010> my

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
late that's because i was eating my

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.790 
late that's because i was eating my
carrots<00:00:08.370> right<00:00:08.519> now<00:00:08.670> and<00:00:08.910> so<00:00:09.840> I<00:00:10.260> just<00:00:10.500> wanted

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
carrots right now and so I just wanted

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.020 
carrots right now and so I just wanted
to<00:00:10.830> finish<00:00:10.980> up<00:00:11.160> my<00:00:11.250> carrots<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.820> then<00:00:11.910> I

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
to finish up my carrots and then I

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.249 
to finish up my carrots and then I
started<00:00:12.330> commentating<00:00:12.840> because<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.049> didn't

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
started commentating because I didn't

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.810 
started commentating because I didn't
want<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.469> eat<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:13.920> comes<00:00:14.250> at<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.490> same<00:00:14.519> time

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
want to eat and comes at the same time

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.859 
want to eat and comes at the same time
because<00:00:15.080> that<00:00:16.080> would<00:00:16.199> just<00:00:16.230> be<00:00:16.470> too<00:00:16.859> hard<00:00:17.520> and

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
because that would just be too hard and

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.590 
because that would just be too hard and
yeah<00:00:18.869> so<00:00:19.140> anyways<00:00:19.970> as<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.029> can<00:00:21.210> see<00:00:21.390> i<00:00:21.420> am

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
yeah so anyways as you can see i am

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.509 
yeah so anyways as you can see i am
getting<00:00:22.140> my<00:00:22.260> gas<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:22.710> my<00:00:22.890> builder<00:00:23.250> right<00:00:23.369> now

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
getting my gas so my builder right now

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.910 
getting my gas so my builder right now
is<00:00:23.670> 10<00:00:23.880> gate<00:00:24.090> 12<00:00:24.390> gasps<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.990> with<00:00:25.109> this<00:00:25.289> it's<00:00:25.619> a

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
is 10 gate 12 gasps and with this it's a

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.830 
is 10 gate 12 gasps and with this it's a
pretty<00:00:26.400> standard<00:00:26.760> real<00:00:26.939> writer<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:27.810> I

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
pretty standard real writer so I

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.390 
pretty standard real writer so I
sometimes<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.410> get<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.650> sometimes<00:00:29.039> do<00:00:29.189> this

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
sometimes to get I sometimes do this

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.919 
sometimes to get I sometimes do this
protesters<00:00:30.210> brought<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.480> us<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:30.689> can<00:00:30.840> do

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
protesters brought to us you can do

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.179 
protesters brought to us you can do
billions<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.320> strategies<00:00:31.740> they<00:00:31.890> all<00:00:32.009> work

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
billions of strategies they all work

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.889 
billions of strategies they all work
against<00:00:32.550> each<00:00:32.640> other<00:00:32.820> it's<00:00:33.390> just<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.660> matter<00:00:33.690> of

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
against each other it's just a matter of

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.420 
against each other it's just a matter of
whoever<00:00:34.230> does<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.559> better<00:00:34.710> strategy<00:00:35.190> and

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
whoever does the better strategy and

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.850 
whoever does the better strategy and
it's<00:00:35.760> all<00:00:35.880> about<00:00:36.000> micro<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.510> VP<00:00:36.840> VP<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.380> so

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
it's all about micro and VP VP and so

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.110 
it's all about micro and VP VP and so
this<00:00:38.010> game<00:00:38.190> i<00:00:38.309> probably<00:00:38.370> going<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.760> be<00:00:38.820> doing<00:00:38.940> a

this game i probably going to be doing a

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.150 
this game i probably going to be doing a

ten<00:03:58.739> percent<00:03:59.099> that<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.250> match<00:03:59.489> would<00:03:59.639> go<00:03:59.790> to

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
ten percent that the match would go to

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.059 
ten percent that the match would go to
me<00:04:00.060> because<00:04:00.319> well<00:04:01.319> yeah<00:04:01.470> at<00:04:01.680> ninety<00:04:01.980> percent

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
me because well yeah at ninety percent

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:03.710 
me because well yeah at ninety percent
so<00:04:02.370> if<00:04:02.489> basically<00:04:02.819> 400<00:04:03.299> out<00:04:03.389> of<00:04:03.480> those<00:04:03.569> five

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
so if basically 400 out of those five

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.729 
so if basically 400 out of those five
hundred<00:04:03.989> dollars<00:04:04.230> would<00:04:04.349> probably<00:04:04.620> go

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
hundred dollars would probably go

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.460 
hundred dollars would probably go

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.500 
see he does not have karen's morph so
these<00:06:02.250> DTS<00:06:02.640> are<00:06:02.850> gonna<00:06:03.030> do<00:06:03.180> a<00:06:03.210> lot<00:06:03.330> of<00:06:03.360> damage

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669 
and now i'm gonna make my DTS go forward

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:07.010 
and now i'm gonna make my DTS go forward
because<00:06:05.790> he<00:06:06.030> did<00:06:06.180> get<00:06:06.330> cannons<00:06:06.690> up<00:06:06.840> and<00:06:06.990> I

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
because he did get cannons up and I

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.270 
because he did get cannons up and I
don't<00:06:07.169> want<00:06:07.290> to<00:06:07.410> tension<00:06:07.740> and<00:06:07.890> I<00:06:08.100> don't<00:06:08.130> even

don't want to tension and I don't even

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.890 
don't want to tension and I don't even
think<00:06:08.400> he<00:06:08.520> has<00:06:08.640> enough<00:06:08.669> to<00:06:08.940> kill<00:06:09.120> me<00:06:09.270> even

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900
