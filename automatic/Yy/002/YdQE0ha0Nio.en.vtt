page in a book in last video I talked

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.170 
page in a book in last video I talked
about<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.769> Circle<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.250> Willis<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.849> how<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
about the Circle of Willis and how the

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.130 
about the Circle of Willis and how the
blood<00:00:27.539> comes<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:29.130> circle<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.240> now<00:00:30.990> I'm

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
blood comes to this circle and now I'm

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.310 
blood comes to this circle and now I'm
going<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.410> talk<00:00:31.590> how<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.980> blood<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:33.260> supply<00:00:34.260> to

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
going to talk how the blood is supply to

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.130 
going to talk how the blood is supply to
bring<00:00:34.920> from<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.520> Circle<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.180> Willis<00:00:36.210> okay<00:00:37.079> so

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
bring from that Circle of Willis okay so

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.190 
bring from that Circle of Willis okay so
that<00:00:37.440> circle<00:00:37.890> villus<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.430> like<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> circle<00:00:39.450> made

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
that circle villus is like a circle made

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.709 
that circle villus is like a circle made
up<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.440> arteries<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.520> if<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.149> don't<00:00:42.660> know

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
up of arteries and if you don't know

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.000 
up of arteries and if you don't know
what<00:00:42.870> I'm<00:00:42.960> talking<00:00:43.140> about<00:00:43.379> right<00:00:43.770> now<00:00:43.800> you

Willis now I will illustrate that Circle

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.060 
Willis now I will illustrate that Circle
of<00:00:52.649> Willis<00:00:52.680> on<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:54.090> brain<00:00:54.780> from<00:00:55.110> basal<00:00:55.710> point

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
of Willis on the brain from basal point

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.779 
of Willis on the brain from basal point
of<00:00:56.190> view<00:00:56.370> here's<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.180> brain<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:58.520> then<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.609> will

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
of view here's the brain and then I will

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.389 
of view here's the brain and then I will
show<00:01:00.090> how<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.660> looks<00:01:00.690> like<00:01:01.230> on<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.890> lateral

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
show how it looks like on the lateral

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.429 
show how it looks like on the lateral
side<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.760> course<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.539> arteries<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.019> go<00:01:04.260> to

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
side of course the arteries that go to

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.550 
side of course the arteries that go to
lateral<00:01:05.220> side<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.790> I'm<00:01:05.909> gonna<00:01:06.150> show<00:01:07.140> how<00:01:07.409> it

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
lateral side and I'm gonna show how it

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.910 
lateral side and I'm gonna show how it
looks<00:01:07.590> like<00:01:07.950> on<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.220> medial<00:01:08.700> side<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.330> rain

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
looks like on a medial side of the rain

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.890 
looks like on a medial side of the rain
there<00:01:10.920> are<00:01:11.040> two<00:01:11.250> important<00:01:12.000> arteries<00:01:12.510> were

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
there are two important arteries were

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.760 
there are two important arteries were
going<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.470> show<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.189> how<00:01:14.970> they<00:01:15.150> branch<00:01:15.619> on<00:01:16.619> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
going to show and how they branch on the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.580 
going to show and how they branch on the
medial<00:01:17.100> side<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.729> there<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.150> one<00:01:18.390> artery<00:01:18.720> here

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
medial side of there is one artery here

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.190 
medial side of there is one artery here
that<00:01:19.830> costs<00:01:20.100> from<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.369> lateral<00:01:20.729> sulcus<00:01:21.200> we're

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
that costs from the lateral sulcus we're

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.039 
that costs from the lateral sulcus we're
gonna<00:01:22.409> illustrate<00:01:22.700> on<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.939> lateral<00:01:24.360> side<00:01:24.990> of

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
gonna illustrate on the lateral side of

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.600 
gonna illustrate on the lateral side of
the<00:01:25.259> brain<00:01:26.659> okay<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:27.770> first<00:01:28.770> we<00:01:28.890> have<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.340> two

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
the brain okay so first we have the two

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.969 
the brain okay so first we have the two
vertebral<00:01:30.329> arteries<00:01:30.990> entering<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.650> skull

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
vertebral arteries entering the skull

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.560 
vertebral arteries entering the skull
Rudy<00:01:32.790> foramen<00:01:33.450> magnum<00:01:34.040> magnum<00:01:35.040> foramen<00:01:35.670> okay

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
Rudy foramen magnum magnum foramen okay

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.850 
Rudy foramen magnum magnum foramen okay
these<00:01:37.500> two<00:01:37.560> arteries<00:01:38.310> they<00:01:38.640> join<00:01:39.000> here<00:01:39.600> and

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
these two arteries they join here and

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.760 
these two arteries they join here and
create<00:01:40.860> one<00:01:41.570> artery<00:01:42.570> called<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.200> basilar

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
create one artery called the basilar

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.609 
create one artery called the basilar
artery

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
artery

pulse<00:02:17.540> okay<00:02:18.080> so<00:02:18.260> this<00:02:18.470> is<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.740> basilar<00:02:19.250> artery

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
pulse okay so this is the basilar artery

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.740 
pulse okay so this is the basilar artery
now<00:02:21.470> before<00:02:21.860> they<00:02:22.010> joined<00:02:22.340> they<00:02:22.970> gave<00:02:23.210> two

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
now before they joined they gave two

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.430 
now before they joined they gave two
branches<00:02:24.410> of<00:02:24.740> arteries<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:26.450> joint<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:27.110> then

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
branches of arteries the joint and then

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.940 
branches of arteries the joint and then
down<00:02:28.040> there<00:02:28.370> they<00:02:29.240> create<00:02:30.020> the<00:02:30.320> anterior

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
down there they create the anterior

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.890 
down there they create the anterior
spinal<00:02:31.220> artery<00:02:32.030> okay

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
spinal artery okay

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.830 
spinal artery okay
the<00:02:33.320> basilar<00:02:33.950> artery<00:02:34.400> gives<00:02:34.790> some<00:02:35.270> pontine

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
the basilar artery gives some pontine

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.730 
the basilar artery gives some pontine
arteries<00:02:36.350> here<00:02:36.740> and<00:02:37.720> it<00:02:38.720> also<00:02:38.900> gives<00:02:39.380> the

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
arteries here and it also gives the

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.170 
arteries here and it also gives the
inferior<00:02:40.630> anterior<00:02:41.860> cerebellar<00:02:42.860> artery<00:02:43.460> the

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
inferior anterior cerebellar artery the

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.280 
inferior anterior cerebellar artery the
branches<00:02:44.690> of<00:02:45.080> their<00:02:45.950> own<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.490> cerebellum

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
branches of their own the cerebellum

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.730 
branches of their own the cerebellum
same<00:02:48.290> on<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.650> other<00:02:48.830> side<00:02:49.570> and<00:02:50.570> this<00:02:51.350> was<00:02:51.590> the

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
same on the other side and this was the

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.850 
same on the other side and this was the
inferior<00:02:52.340> cerebellar<00:02:53.030> artery<00:02:53.600> there<00:02:54.560> is<00:02:54.680> also

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
inferior cerebellar artery there is also

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.190 
inferior cerebellar artery there is also
a<00:02:56.020> superior<00:02:57.020> cerebellar<00:02:57.770> artery<00:02:58.280> that<00:02:59.200> goes

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
a superior cerebellar artery that goes

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.100 
a superior cerebellar artery that goes
above<00:03:00.890> the<00:03:01.100> cerebellum<00:03:01.760> up<00:03:01.940> there<00:03:02.210> between

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
above the cerebellum up there between

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.770 
above the cerebellum up there between
the<00:03:03.680> brain<00:03:04.070> and<00:03:04.100> cerebellum<00:03:04.580> between<00:03:05.270> these

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
the brain and cerebellum between these

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:12.060 
the brain and cerebellum between these
down<00:03:06.080> Cephalon<00:03:06.830> and<00:03:07.820> cerebellum<00:03:09.070> here<00:03:10.210> okay

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070

to read it comes from the boss terrier
served<00:04:33.760> up<00:04:33.970> the<00:04:34.000> serial<00:04:34.660> artery<00:04:35.430> first<00:04:36.430> the

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
served up the serial artery first the

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.740 
served up the serial artery first the
artery<00:04:37.150> starts<00:04:37.630> here<00:04:38.110> and<00:04:38.680> it<00:04:39.550> goes<00:04:39.970> like<00:04:40.240> this

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
artery starts here and it goes like this

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.360 
artery starts here and it goes like this
okay

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
okay

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.630 
okay
now<00:04:42.940> first<00:04:43.270> there<00:04:43.480> is<00:04:43.510> an<00:04:44.020> anterior<00:04:44.800> temporal

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
now first there is an anterior temporal

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.640 
now first there is an anterior temporal
artery<00:04:46.920> it<00:04:47.920> goes<00:04:48.310> something<00:04:48.790> like<00:04:49.030> this<00:04:49.650> and

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
artery it goes something like this and

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.700 
artery it goes something like this and
there<00:04:50.980> is<00:04:51.160> an<00:04:51.780> intermediate<00:04:53.430> temporal<00:04:54.430> branch

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
there is an intermediate temporal branch

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.960 
there is an intermediate temporal branch
here<00:04:56.710> and<00:04:57.120> the<00:04:58.120> posterior<00:04:58.960> temporal<00:04:59.970> branch

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
here and the posterior temporal branch

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:07.800 
here and the posterior temporal branch
here<00:05:05.010> so<00:05:06.010> this<00:05:06.160> was<00:05:06.370> the<00:05:06.490> posterior<00:05:07.030> temporal

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
here so this was the posterior temporal

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.950 
here so this was the posterior temporal
branch<00:05:08.500> this<00:05:09.280> is<00:05:09.340> the<00:05:09.610> intermediate<00:05:09.960> temporal

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
branch this is the intermediate temporal

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.770 
branch this is the intermediate temporal
branch<00:05:11.350> and<00:05:11.950> this<00:05:12.730> was<00:05:12.940> the<00:05:13.120> lateral

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
branch and this was the lateral

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.070 
branch and this was the lateral
occipital<00:05:14.230> artery<00:05:14.920> and<00:05:15.280> then<00:05:16.120> this<00:05:16.690> branch

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
occipital artery and then this branch

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.909 
occipital artery and then this branch
over<00:05:17.320> here<00:05:17.800> was<00:05:18.520> the<00:05:18.790> anterior<00:05:19.450> temporal

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
over here was the anterior temporal

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:25.080 
over here was the anterior temporal
branch<00:05:21.390> then<00:05:22.390> we<00:05:22.570> have<00:05:22.780> the<00:05:23.080> medial<00:05:24.090> occipital

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
branch then we have the medial occipital

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.850 
branch then we have the medial occipital
artery<00:05:25.720> remember<00:05:26.320> that<00:05:26.470> this<00:05:26.560> was<00:05:26.800> the

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
artery remember that this was the

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.770 
artery remember that this was the
lateral<00:05:27.520> occipital<00:05:27.940> artery

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
lateral occipital artery

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.230 
lateral occipital artery
we<00:05:29.410> had<00:05:29.560> the<00:05:29.680> medial<00:05:30.040> occipital<00:05:30.460> artery<00:05:30.940> that

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
we had the medial occipital artery that

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.760 
we had the medial occipital artery that
goes<00:05:31.480> something<00:05:31.780> like<00:05:31.960> this<00:05:32.290> and<00:05:32.530> then<00:05:32.650> we

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
goes something like this and then we

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.060 
goes something like this and then we
have<00:05:32.980> the<00:05:33.160> dorsal<00:05:33.700> branch<00:05:34.470> here<00:05:35.470> this<00:05:35.830> is<00:05:35.980> the

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
have the dorsal branch here this is the

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.650 
have the dorsal branch here this is the
dorsal<00:05:36.340> branch<00:05:36.910> of<00:05:37.270> the<00:05:38.080> corpus<00:05:38.530> callosum<00:05:39.660> the

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
dorsal branch of the corpus callosum the

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.780 
dorsal branch of the corpus callosum the
main<00:05:41.020> artery<00:05:41.500> continues<00:05:42.130> on<00:05:42.400> in<00:05:42.640> the

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
main artery continues on in the

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.520 
main artery continues on in the
calcarine<00:05:43.240> fissure<00:05:43.390> as<00:05:43.960> the<00:05:44.890> kalkaryn<00:05:45.490> branch

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530

learn to easier learn names of these
arteries<00:06:13.960> you<00:06:14.169> should<00:06:14.350> first<00:06:14.620> learn<00:06:14.890> the

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:14.950 
arteries you should first learn the

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.100 
arteries you should first learn the
surface<00:06:15.520> of<00:06:15.669> the<00:06:15.790> brain<00:06:15.970> there<00:06:16.630> is<00:06:16.750> a<00:06:16.780> lesson

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
surface of the brain there is a lesson

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.070 
surface of the brain there is a lesson

you can purchase my soft fur flash brain
anatomy<00:06:20.320> calm<00:06:21.100> and<00:06:21.340> there<00:06:21.460> is<00:06:21.580> a<00:06:21.610> lesson

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
anatomy calm and there is a lesson

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.630 
anatomy calm and there is a lesson
especially<00:06:22.930> explaining<00:06:23.530> the<00:06:23.710> surface<00:06:24.250> of<00:06:24.460> the

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:24.640 
especially explaining the surface of the

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.300 
especially explaining the surface of the
brain<00:06:24.940> it's<00:06:25.630> a<00:06:25.720> sulci<00:06:26.169> and<00:06:26.200> gyri<00:06:26.410> and<00:06:26.950> then

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
brain it's a sulci and gyri and then

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.890 
brain it's a sulci and gyri and then
learning<00:06:27.700> these<00:06:28.030> names<00:06:28.330> is<00:06:28.690> way<00:06:29.440> way<00:06:29.800> easier

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
learning these names is way way easier

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.719 
learning these names is way way easier
so<00:06:31.900> this<00:06:32.050> was<00:06:32.200> the<00:06:32.320> posterior<00:06:33.010> cerebral

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:33.729 
so this was the posterior cerebral

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:35.519 
so this was the posterior cerebral
artery

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:35.529 
artery

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:39.719 
artery
it's<00:06:36.449> same<00:06:37.449> on<00:06:37.629> the<00:06:37.719> other<00:06:37.839> side<00:06:38.339> so<00:06:39.339> remember

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:39.729 
it's same on the other side so remember

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:42.719 
it's same on the other side so remember
we<00:06:39.879> had<00:06:40.059> main<00:06:40.689> branch<00:06:41.079> here<00:06:41.589> and<00:06:41.799> then<00:06:42.459> we<00:06:42.579> had

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:42.729 
we had main branch here and then we had

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:45.029 
we had main branch here and then we had
all<00:06:42.879> these<00:06:43.119> little<00:06:43.749> branches<00:06:44.409> at<00:06:44.559> arteries

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 
all these little branches at arteries

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:48.029 
all these little branches at arteries
strictly<00:06:45.549> and<00:06:46.539> then<00:06:46.719> comes<00:06:47.049> the<00:06:47.319> posterior

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:48.039 
strictly and then comes the posterior

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:54.989 
strictly and then comes the posterior
communicating<00:06:49.619> artery<00:06:52.109> and<00:06:53.249> from<00:06:54.249> basil<00:06:54.759> side

00:06:54.989 --> 00:06:54.999 
communicating artery and from basil side

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:58.529 
communicating artery and from basil side
we<00:06:55.239> have<00:06:55.449> the<00:06:56.489> internal<00:06:57.489> carotid<00:06:57.789> artery

00:06:58.529 --> 00:06:58.539 
we have the internal carotid artery

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:02.009 
we have the internal carotid artery
coming<00:06:59.139> to<00:06:59.559> rain<00:06:59.859> okay<00:07:00.249> and<00:07:00.489> then<00:07:00.669> it<00:07:00.819> joins<00:07:01.149> on

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:02.019 
coming to rain okay and then it joins on

00:07:02.019 --> 00:07:05.789 
coming to rain okay and then it joins on
this<00:07:02.379> posterior<00:07:03.099> communicating<00:07:03.579> artery<00:07:04.799> so

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:05.799 
this posterior communicating artery so

00:07:05.799 --> 00:07:07.799 
this posterior communicating artery so
that<00:07:05.949> it's<00:07:06.309> coming<00:07:06.669> from<00:07:06.879> basil<00:07:07.389> when<00:07:07.659> are<00:07:07.749> you

00:07:07.799 --> 00:07:07.809 
that it's coming from basil when are you

00:07:07.809 --> 00:07:09.959 
that it's coming from basil when are you
just<00:07:07.989> like<00:07:08.139> just<00:07:08.529> like<00:07:08.679> the<00:07:08.739> vertebral<00:07:09.579> artery

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:09.969 
just like just like the vertebral artery

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:12.209 
just like just like the vertebral artery
is<00:07:10.179> entering<00:07:10.569> the<00:07:10.749> skull<00:07:11.019> it<00:07:11.769> brings<00:07:12.009> the

00:07:12.209 --> 00:07:12.219 
is entering the skull it brings the

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:14.759 
is entering the skull it brings the
blood<00:07:12.429> to<00:07:13.029> the<00:07:13.179> brain<00:07:13.299> the<00:07:14.169> internal<00:07:14.619> carotid

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:14.769 
blood to the brain the internal carotid

00:07:14.769 --> 00:07:19.969 
blood to the brain the internal carotid
artery<00:07:16.949> now<00:07:17.949> I<00:07:17.979> will<00:07:18.279> illustrate<00:07:18.609> the<00:07:19.359> middle

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:19.979 
artery now I will illustrate the middle

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:24.869 
artery now I will illustrate the middle
cerebellar<00:07:20.979> artery<00:07:22.259> it<00:07:23.259> comes<00:07:23.679> here<00:07:24.189> from<00:07:24.519> a

00:07:24.869 --> 00:07:24.879 
cerebellar artery it comes here from a

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:27.749 
cerebellar artery it comes here from a
corrupt<00:07:25.209> well<00:07:25.839> after<00:07:26.229> joint<00:07:26.649> after<00:07:27.039> carotid

00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:27.759 
corrupt well after joint after carotid

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:29.939 
corrupt well after joint after carotid
artery<00:07:28.179> joins<00:07:28.539> the<00:07:28.809> posterior<00:07:29.499> communicating

00:07:29.939 --> 00:07:29.949 
artery joins the posterior communicating
