00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 on the counter because the bra developed 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.450
 an innovative methodology to use the 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.000
 internet and information technology 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.440
 organizing our interest has been up to 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.929
 now especially in the areas of 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.600
 mathematics physics chemistry and biology 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.170
 they have a little kiss 600 some 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.269
 available exercises 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.280
 doctors and we entered into a partnership with 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.910
 foundation is translated 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.800
 the foundation has made an experience 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.320
 specific 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.660
 schools in this way are now 200 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.510
 schools to stimulate teachers 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.250
 technology that, in addition to each 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.290
 student who is interested may 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.329
 enter develop your learning 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.000
 because individualized pace of each 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.829
 exercise classes in your work 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.420
 this methodology allows the teacher 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.730
 has a tool 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.610
 it accompanies how the students are 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.350
 using up to where the students were who 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.750
 the more advanced you have the talent to 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.329
 was the fifth - but it allows this 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.330
 diversity of rhythms in standardizing a 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.789
 heavy not limit anyone , and support those who 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.240
 more accurate and release and encourage those 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:14.280
 has more potential then the experience 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.920
 this operation has been very positive. 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.030
 our interest is to maximize this 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.800
 tool 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.440
 We are working along the lines of 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.390
 Full time school is seven hours of 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.700
 four-hour workshop 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.100
 regular fucked all of us 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.369
 we provide this tool and 30 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.860
 schools as a complement to training for 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.670
 to enhance learning in science and 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.670
 mathematics 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.280
 In addition, President Dilma put the 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.660
 Teacher who is interested in Brazil 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.929
 which is one of our top priorities 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:48.030
 literacy and learn 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:50.160
 to read and write and interpret a text 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.390
 and combine the first drops of all 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.619
 Brazilian children have even been 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.289
 condemned 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.869
 so we want the teacher to leave 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.940
 of Brazil with this motivation is this 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.679
 concern with this stimulus so that the 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.239
 can make new partnerships in the 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:05.459
 future that helps to develop 

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:06.850
 methodologies for this age group that 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:08.050
 It's not the future yet. 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.600
 the water of the work he has been doing 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.010
 which is a great mission he already has 6 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.140
 millions of students around the clock 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.700
 studying on its platform 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.780
 we want that Brazil is growing and 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.780
 many more people in this statistic
