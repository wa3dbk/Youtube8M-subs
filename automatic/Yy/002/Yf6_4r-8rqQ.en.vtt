hey guys Robert HD here and today just

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.890 
hey guys Robert HD here and today just
basically<00:00:08.189> going<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.429> show<00:00:08.519> you<00:00:08.580> a<00:00:08.910> burst<00:00:09.420> back

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
basically going to show you a burst back

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.039 
basically going to show you a burst back
roll<00:00:10.309> sort<00:00:11.309> of<00:00:11.429> thing<00:00:11.580> I<00:00:11.759> figure<00:00:12.750> out<00:00:12.870> for

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
roll sort of thing I figure out for

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.650 
roll sort of thing I figure out for
battlegrounds<00:00:13.500> arenas<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.009> stuff<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.660> it

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
battlegrounds arenas and stuff and it

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.859 
battlegrounds arenas and stuff and it
will<00:00:15.960> global<00:00:16.410> someone<00:00:16.710> like<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:18.029> nine<00:00:18.630> percent

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
will global someone like a nine percent

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.570 
will global someone like a nine percent
of<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.050> time<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.439> will<00:00:19.560> go<00:00:19.770> below<00:00:20.010> which<00:00:20.400> is

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
of the time it will go below which is

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.640 
of the time it will go below which is
obviously<00:00:21.449> enough<00:00:21.869> for<00:00:22.080> them<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.230> bed<00:00:22.439> because

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
obviously enough for them to bed because

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.420 
obviously enough for them to bed because
it<00:00:22.890> was<00:00:23.010> in<00:00:23.970> some<00:00:24.330> 2.2<00:00:24.720> hearing<00:00:25.109> for<00:00:25.320> us<00:00:25.430> which

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
it was in some 2.2 hearing for us which

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.540 
it was in some 2.2 hearing for us which
is<00:00:26.460> pretty<00:00:26.820> insane<00:00:27.830> so<00:00:28.830> basically<00:00:29.160> what<00:00:29.460> you

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
is pretty insane so basically what you

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.590 
is pretty insane so basically what you
need<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:30.260> the<00:00:31.260> ancestral<00:00:31.710> swiftness<00:00:32.009> time

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:32.600 
need is the ancestral swiftness time

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.360 
need is the ancestral swiftness time
which<00:00:33.600> basically<00:00:34.200> just<00:00:34.320> makes<00:00:34.620> like<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.160> light

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
which basically just makes like a light

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.060 
which basically just makes like a light
and<00:00:35.520> /<00:00:35.640> or<00:00:35.670> he'll<00:00:36.149> hex<00:00:36.780> or<00:00:37.140> something<00:00:37.530> incident

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
and / or he'll hex or something incident

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.869 
and / or he'll hex or something incident
and<00:00:39.020> what<00:00:40.020> was<00:00:40.079> enables<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.530> do<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:41.040> do<00:00:41.550> a

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
and what was enables you to do is do a

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.430 
and what was enables you to do is do a
classic<00:00:42.360> lightning<00:00:42.809> bolt<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.170> then<00:00:43.320> an

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
classic lightning bolt and then an

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.930 
classic lightning bolt and then an
instant<00:00:43.860> lighting<00:00:44.129> bolt<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.489> an<00:00:44.550> instant

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
instant lighting bolt and an instant

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.990 
instant lighting bolt and an instant
Marvis<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.539> then<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.660> seven<00:00:46.020> star<00:00:46.200> formation

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
Marvis and then a seven star formation

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.410 
Marvis and then a seven star formation
which<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.090> just<00:00:48.270> need<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.480> stock<00:00:48.660> up<00:00:48.690> now<00:00:50.420> if

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
which I just need to stock up now if

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.080 
which I just need to stock up now if
mm-hmm<00:00:52.199> really<00:00:54.020> orangey<00:00:55.020> okay<00:00:55.579> then<00:00:56.579> so

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
macro is gonna have unsocial swiftness

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.780 
macro is gonna have unsocial swiftness
your<00:01:03.840> spell<00:01:04.260> card<00:01:04.439> trinket<00:01:04.739> but<00:01:05.369> i'm<00:01:05.460> shooting

your spell card trinket but i'm shooting
for<00:01:05.820> Teen<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.360> then<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.200> volcanic<00:01:07.860> potion<00:01:08.310> to

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
wait for a in some love this proc to

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.399 
wait for a in some love this proc to
happen<00:01:20.630> they're<00:01:21.630> gonna<00:01:21.720> clock<00:01:21.930> on<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.140> and

happen they're gonna clock on it and
then<00:01:22.530> basically<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.340> faceted<00:01:23.759> like<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.000> ball

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
then basically a faceted like the ball

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.310 
then basically a faceted like the ball
into<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:25.049> into<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.580> this<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.880> then<00:01:27.060> this

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
going 60 hey lightning bolts

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:49.460 
going 60 hey lightning bolts
oh<00:01:42.790> my<00:01:43.450> god<00:01:44.610> what<00:01:45.610> is<00:01:45.730> the<00:01:45.850> dumbest<00:01:46.390> class<00:01:46.510> oh

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.790 

and<00:01:51.540> well<00:01:52.540> if<00:01:52.780> you<00:01:52.960> want<00:01:53.140> even<00:01:53.290> more<00:01:53.530> than<00:01:53.740> I

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
and well if you want even more than I

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.130 
and well if you want even more than I
should<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:55.060> could<00:01:55.240> use<00:01:55.450> them<00:01:55.660> storm<00:01:56.020> a<00:01:56.110> storm

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
should you could use them storm a storm

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.730 
should you could use them storm a storm
but<00:01:56.620> I<00:01:56.920> found<00:01:57.250> that<00:01:57.490> if<00:01:57.670> you<00:01:57.760> put<00:01:57.910> this<00:01:58.060> down

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
but I found that if you put this down

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.520 
but I found that if you put this down
even<00:01:59.740> like<00:01:59.890> instantly<00:02:00.490> as<00:02:00.820> it<00:02:01.060> bogs<00:02:01.330> your<00:02:02.260> prop

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
even like instantly as it bogs your prop

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.500 
even like instantly as it bogs your prop
doesn't<00:02:02.920> last<00:02:03.070> long<00:02:03.220> enough<00:02:03.550> en<00:02:03.970> to<00:02:04.210> enable

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
doesn't last long enough en to enable

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.870 
doesn't last long enough en to enable
you<00:02:04.600> to<00:02:04.630> do<00:02:04.840> it<00:02:04.960> at<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:05.080> same<00:02:05.110> time<00:02:05.880> so

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
you to do it at the same time so

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.400 
you to do it at the same time so
basically<00:02:07.180> you'll<00:02:07.450> have<00:02:07.600> to<00:02:07.720> cast<00:02:07.960> the<00:02:08.200> lava

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
basically you'll have to cast the lava

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.580 
basically you'll have to cast the lava
burst<00:02:08.619> which<00:02:09.660> well<00:02:10.660> i<00:02:10.690> don't<00:02:11.050> think<00:02:11.200> i<00:02:11.410> can

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
burst which well i don't think i can

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.180 
burst which well i don't think i can
make<00:02:11.650> into<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.070> burst<00:02:12.310> because<00:02:14.040> it's<00:02:15.040> not

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
make into the burst because it's not

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.020 
make into the burst because it's not
exactly<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.730> shot<00:02:16.450> first<00:02:16.630> time<00:02:17.880> so<00:02:18.880> that's

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
exactly a shot first time so that's

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.110 
exactly a shot first time so that's
basically<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.480> burst<00:02:20.140> that<00:02:20.710> i<00:02:20.950> came<00:02:21.520> up<00:02:21.940> with

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
basically the burst that i came up with

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.690 
basically the burst that i came up with
I<00:02:22.560> mean<00:02:23.560> I<00:02:23.680> think<00:02:23.710> I<00:02:23.920> think<00:02:24.070> that's<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.400> limit

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
I mean I think I think that's to limit

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.330 
I mean I think I think that's to limit
of<00:02:24.790> what<00:02:24.910> we<00:02:25.000> can<00:02:25.150> do<00:02:25.240> right<00:02:25.390> now<00:02:26.070> when<00:02:27.070> we<00:02:27.160> get

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
of what we can do right now when we get

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.660 
of what we can do right now when we get
em<00:02:28.030> on<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.450> bus<00:02:28.690> I<00:02:29.050> love<00:02:29.980> money<00:02:30.160> I<00:02:30.310> think<00:02:30.550> that

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
em on a bus I love money I think that

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.020 
em on a bus I love money I think that
I'll<00:02:30.760> changed<00:02:31.150> quite<00:02:31.300> significantly<00:02:32.490> well<00:02:33.490> ya

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
I'll changed quite significantly well ya

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.700 
I'll changed quite significantly well ya
know<00:02:34.210> something<00:02:34.570> like<00:02:34.690> this<00:02:34.870> cuz<00:02:35.410> oh<00:02:37.500> so<00:02:38.500> bad

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
know something like this cuz oh so bad

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.670 
know something like this cuz oh so bad
and<00:02:39.450> this<00:02:40.450> is<00:02:40.570> done<00:02:40.690> on<00:02:40.780> a<00:02:40.840> level<00:02:40.960> 85<00:02:41.320> character

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
and this is done on a level 85 character

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.990 
and this is done on a level 85 character
so<00:02:41.860> just<00:02:42.190> scale<00:02:43.470> by<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.920> damage<00:02:45.220> as<00:02:45.490> if<00:02:45.910> you

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
so just scale by the damage as if you

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.730 
so just scale by the damage as if you
want<00:02:46.150> any<00:02:46.270> five<00:02:46.510> cards<00:02:46.540> I<00:02:46.900> mean<00:02:47.020> if<00:02:47.110> you<00:02:47.200> on<00:02:47.260> 87

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
want any five cards I mean if you on 87

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.720 
want any five cards I mean if you on 87
they<00:02:47.830> probably<00:02:48.070> hit<00:02:48.220> ten<00:02:48.400> times<00:02:48.580> harder

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
they probably hit ten times harder

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.400 
they probably hit ten times harder
because<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.209> could<00:02:49.360> pop<00:02:49.480> a<00:02:49.510> 70<00:02:49.930> members<00:02:50.050> and

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
because you could pop a 70 members and

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.920 
because you could pop a 70 members and
stuff<00:02:50.790> so<00:02:51.790> those<00:02:51.940> looks<00:02:52.120> like<00:02:52.300> variations<00:02:52.810> you

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
stuff so those looks like variations you

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.590 
stuff so those looks like variations you
can<00:02:52.959> do<00:02:53.200> this<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.880> after<00:02:55.209> this<00:02:55.300> cliff<00:02:55.510> I'll

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
can do this and after this cliff I'll

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.050 
can do this and after this cliff I'll
just<00:02:55.810> basically<00:02:56.080> put<00:02:56.320> on<00:02:56.440> some<00:02:56.760> clips<00:02:57.760> of<00:02:57.880> me

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
just basically put on some clips of me

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.840 
just basically put on some clips of me
by<00:02:58.270> killing<00:02:58.690> some<00:02:58.959> people<00:02:59.610> testing<00:03:00.610> on<00:03:00.700> two

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
by killing some people testing on two

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.460 
by killing some people testing on two
people<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:01.360> then<00:03:01.450> I'll<00:03:01.570> try<00:03:02.080> and<00:03:02.110> get<00:03:02.290> a<00:03:02.350> few
