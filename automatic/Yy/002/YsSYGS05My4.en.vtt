00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
guitars that work better for me and

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.159 
guitars that work better for me and
that's<00:03:41.880> pretty<00:03:42.180> much<00:03:42.299> what<00:03:42.540> it<00:03:42.630> comes<00:03:42.780> down<00:03:42.870> to

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
that's pretty much what it comes down to

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:44.800 
that's pretty much what it comes down to
it<00:03:43.290> doesn't<00:03:43.560> come<00:03:43.680> down<00:03:43.829> to<00:03:43.889> the<00:03:44.190> fact<00:03:44.370> that

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
it doesn't come down to the fact that

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.270 
it doesn't come down to the fact that
this<00:03:45.810> is<00:03:45.989> a<00:03:46.019> bad<00:03:46.260> gets<00:03:46.500> hard<00:03:46.680> at<00:03:46.769> all<00:03:46.859> it's<00:03:47.160> just

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
this is a bad gets hard at all it's just

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.280 
this is a bad gets hard at all it's just
whether<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.120> fact<00:03:48.359> that<00:03:48.450> it<00:03:48.599> doesn't<00:03:48.870> suit<00:03:49.079> me

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
whether the fact that it doesn't suit me

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.759 
whether the fact that it doesn't suit me
I<00:03:49.319> just<00:03:49.470> feel<00:03:49.799> like<00:03:49.829> I<00:03:51.079> had<00:03:52.079> better<00:03:52.260> uses<00:03:52.739> for
