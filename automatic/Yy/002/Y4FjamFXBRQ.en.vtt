00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 for VVV by a goal from sami roda o'leary that is not on the street robbers 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.790
 played because of an injury 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.330
 leave them then gerard weekend no longer wants to play on artificial turf so it does 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.429
 Last week's duel was stolen most back into the base 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.810
 if you score, the routiniers score 25 goals in about 300 ninth games 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.739
 in professional football 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:23.349
 with vice versa ruben chess and ken leemans return to one respectively 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.289
 injury and a suspension that is at the expense of markman group a and the 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:28.499
 site ofrany 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:31.759
 it is so can see funds at the west in veendam and here is his report 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.460
 6 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.510
 anp veendam against ftd two teams 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.870
 own problems with a mess 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.870
 paintings are not stronger yet they especially those five parties 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.700
 a little lost, let them know 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.470
 it's the first option 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.470
 van der pekbuurt may 30 hours with a brief overview 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.050
 think it is nothing 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.050
 heavily in trouble 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.050
 Veendam will turn this rundschau into a real competition 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.620
 choose the attack where possible 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.870
 so excellent played two men for the cabbage 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.860
 there it is e mail 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.860
 two great opportunities for veendam 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.270
 small difference handy 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.350
 but now has to deal with a signal now that there is definitely good 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.110
 also completely calabro 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.110
 he comes the precipitation deficit is a good opening 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.600
 In addition to wanting to buy it from Germany, Kantelberg at Indigo is about 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.060
 everyone benefits 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.780
 this includes the defense of shuttle buses corner kick on the other 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.610
 side 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.610
 that is also the case in our country on the mountain 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:14.639
 at the tourist office while Veendam 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:16.869
 had two big chances 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:19.549
 were the individual qualities of London 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.909
 pays for itself that's in the fantastic goals 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.949
 awkward ball on the road 

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:26.799
 taken according to dico so that the 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.799
 the very first was thirteenth of the season 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:34.279
 timisela 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:37.279
 respond to work already ashore 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.139
 firing a pass from the side of the village only caused the rebound 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:48.149
 potato area overview 

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:50.349
 the two dollars 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.629
 the first duel completely under control and nadyen i call from honda 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:59.419
 reachable from my side and failed 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.049
 VVV did have the union 

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:07.249
 timisela 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:10.699
 long ball towards chess chess violations to make is whistled 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.699
 so can play two then when it comes to you with this performance is one 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:17.019
 2 0 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.249
 petry what goal 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:19.150
 especially the young 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.009
 translate the left striker 

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.929
 ruben chess 

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:24.929
 first of door on the right wants to move for the goal home source 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.729
 may I the first pole the 2 0 too strong for vvv 

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:29.949
 so is 

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:31.999
 it doesn't have to be temporary for the front runner 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:34.999
 after half an hour of soccer 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.769
 zimmerman no offside for simon 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:53.859
 a huge blunder from the assistant referee who is just too quick the 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:56.969
 flag up to the most popular therapeutic paul van dyk deception 

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:57.479
 inhabited 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:58.909
 the supporters a damper 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:01.909
 the chance of a second bid 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:07.199
 winter risk 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:10.819
 takes far too much risk is now in the back mountains must be back very quickly because 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.819
 that is naturally open dutch 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.370
 how much fun does that have 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.870
 because of this shalmashi holland 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.870
 After the relapse the PVV has no problems for you 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.650
 no more consumer counter after two weeks 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:31.379
 keisuke honda no the case law 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:33.699
 nadal number one 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:36.909
 it is a fantastic football player this reactor actually good for that 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:37.740
 premium 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.819
 That shows again minister actions 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:43.210
 so nothing happened in the second half 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.270
 the pvv 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.539
 controls restlessly in this game without making excessive efforts 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.259
 the second album will 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:53.259
 but then simply no longer 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:57.409
 2 how it is from the veendam mole is the dycker the speedboat 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:01.400
 after being sloppy who wants to get rid of the ball, the players go to the case 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.539
 are you a decent opportunity 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:05.589
 although the corner was difficult in the end 

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:09.279
 but she still hurts his old teammate with some regularity this one 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:12.279
 ruben chess 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:20.979
 spyker shot the ball for the goal and a steering group 

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:23.159
 but a penalty kick 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:24.550
 warn veendam 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.550
 both cases of Piet dementia 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.569
 clear about that 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:34.370
 and so he can not get upside down and then had two again absolute 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.370
 have the penalty 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.839
 in combination with the polder 

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:46.089
 to the best round if the leaders chance for third place among others 

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:47.069
 and upset 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:48.779
 who does that 

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:50.529
 it's just about the goal 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:53.529
 but what a wonderful play point is 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.509
 a turning corner kick 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:00.180
 headed away by pottelberge 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.180
 from the distance who is going 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.460
 the last minute of the extra time a fantastic goal from dirk 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.650
 it will be Veendam league
