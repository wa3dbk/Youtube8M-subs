00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:02.449 
it's great to have some amount of

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:04.760 
it's great to have some amount of
success<00:00:03.449> behind<00:00:03.899> us<00:00:04.140> where<00:00:04.410> we've<00:00:04.560> now

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
success behind us where we've now

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.550 
success behind us where we've now
offered<00:00:05.279> this<00:00:05.790> first<00:00:06.089> offering<00:00:06.569> and<00:00:06.930> we've

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
offered this first offering and we've

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.440 
offered this first offering and we've
been<00:00:08.189> able<00:00:08.370> to<00:00:08.490> hear<00:00:08.760> what<00:00:08.940> people<00:00:08.970> thought

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
been able to hear what people thought

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.180 
been able to hear what people thought
about<00:00:09.480> it<00:00:09.960> and<00:00:10.170> then<00:00:10.290> I've<00:00:10.469> benefitted<00:00:11.160> from

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
about it and then I've benefitted from

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.360 
about it and then I've benefitted from
the<00:00:11.940> ability<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.389> use<00:00:12.809> that<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.380> make<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.889> better

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
the ability to use that to make a better

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.060 
the ability to use that to make a better
version<00:00:14.670> of<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.089> game<00:00:15.299> it's<00:00:15.780> flying<00:00:16.440> blind<00:00:16.740> a

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
version of the game it's flying blind a

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.310 
version of the game it's flying blind a
little<00:00:17.279> bit<00:00:17.430> less<00:00:17.670> we've<00:00:18.449> benefited<00:00:19.140> from

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
little bit less we've benefited from

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.950 
little bit less we've benefited from
having<00:00:19.890> solved<00:00:20.520> some<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.090> problems<00:00:21.689> and

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
having solved some of the problems and

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.320 
having solved some of the problems and
now<00:00:22.500> get<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.890> focus<00:00:23.100> on<00:00:23.519> some<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.210> most

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
now get to focus on some of the most

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.210 
now get to focus on some of the most
important<00:00:24.900> things<00:00:25.109> that<00:00:25.289> came<00:00:25.740> out<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:25.949> the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
important things that came out of the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.540 
important things that came out of the
feedback<00:00:26.609> from<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.000> first<00:00:27.210> time<00:00:28.250> we<00:00:29.250> really

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
feedback from the first time we really

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.339 
feedback from the first time we really
set<00:00:29.789> out<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.330> create<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.660> survival<00:00:31.170> action

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
set out to create a survival action

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.970 
set out to create a survival action
experience<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.690> we<00:00:33.690> really<00:00:33.960> want<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.350> push

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
experience and we really want to push

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.799 
experience and we really want to push
those<00:00:35.250> systems<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.120> way<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.630> player

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
those systems in a way that the player

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.459 
those systems in a way that the player
is<00:00:37.820> immersed<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:39.000> these<00:00:39.960> hostile

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
is immersed in these hostile

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.040 
is immersed in these hostile
environments<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.489> they<00:00:41.640> have<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:42.050> leverage

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
environments and they have to leverage

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.869 
environments and they have to leverage
the<00:00:43.320> resources<00:00:43.469> they<00:00:44.100> find<00:00:44.489> in<00:00:44.760> those

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
the resources they find in those

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.700 
the resources they find in those
environments<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.750> order<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.170> overcome<00:00:46.440> the

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
environments in order to overcome the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.279 
environments in order to overcome the
obstacles<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.820> much<00:00:48.270> tighter<00:00:48.629> relationship

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
obstacles so a much tighter relationship

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.060 
obstacles so a much tighter relationship
between<00:00:50.039> those<00:00:50.910> gameplay<00:00:51.420> systems<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.410> your

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
between those gameplay systems and your

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.459 
between those gameplay systems and your
ability<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.520> progress<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.539> just<00:00:55.199> as<00:00:55.350> an

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
ability to progress so just as an

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.040 
ability to progress so just as an
example<00:00:55.559> some<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.550> weapon<00:00:57.360> upgrades<00:00:57.780> are

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
example some of the weapon upgrades are

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.080 
example some of the weapon upgrades are
gonna<00:00:58.199> require<00:00:58.620> hunting<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.609> particular

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
gonna require hunting a particular

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.090 
gonna require hunting a particular
animal<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:01.020> some<00:01:01.199> cases<00:01:01.440> some<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
animal and in some cases some of the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.009 
animal and in some cases some of the
rare<00:01:02.309> upgrades<00:01:02.879> are<00:01:03.510> going<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.809> involve

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
rare upgrades are going to involve

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.500 
rare upgrades are going to involve
tracking<00:01:04.769> down<00:01:04.890> rare<00:01:05.220> animals<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.119> that

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
tracking down rare animals and that

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.609 
tracking down rare animals and that
might<00:01:06.780> be<00:01:06.960> particularly<00:01:08.119> particularly

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
might be particularly particularly

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.590 
might be particularly particularly
particular<00:01:10.619> weather<00:01:10.890> situations<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.390> really

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
particular weather situations so really

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.039 
particular weather situations so really
expanding<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:13.470> idea<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.720> survivalism<00:01:15.720> how

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
expanding this idea of survivalism how

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.080 
expanding this idea of survivalism how
do<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.229> get<00:01:16.350> thrust<00:01:16.710> into<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.220> situation<00:01:17.850> and

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
do you get thrust into the situation and

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.080 
do you get thrust into the situation and
begin<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:19.140> harness<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.369> environment<00:01:20.939> in

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
begin to harness the environment in

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.570 
begin to harness the environment in
order<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.630> survive<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.500> location<00:01:22.920> we

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
order to survive in that location we

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.450 
order to survive in that location we
really<00:01:23.850> want<00:01:24.060> people<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.689> enjoy<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.950> survival

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
really want people to enjoy the survival

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.280 
really want people to enjoy the survival
systems<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.180> have<00:01:27.270> been<00:01:27.360> extended<00:01:28.049> since

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
systems that have been extended since

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.740 
systems that have been extended since
the<00:01:28.409> last<00:01:28.590> time<00:01:28.890> on<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.909> system<00:01:30.240> side<00:01:30.450> we<00:01:30.630> were

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
the last time on the system side we were

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.710 
the last time on the system side we were
really<00:01:30.930> proud<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.579> creating<00:01:32.579> sort<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.509> hub

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
really proud of creating sort of a hub

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.260 
really proud of creating sort of a hub
based<00:01:34.020> game<00:01:34.409> with<00:01:34.770> gear<00:01:35.100> gating<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:36.119> you

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
based game with gear gating that you

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.510 
based game with gear gating that you
could<00:01:36.479> come<00:01:37.079> into<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.350> space<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.710> there<00:01:38.369> were<00:01:38.490> a

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
could come into a space and there were a

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.039 
could come into a space and there were a
lots<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:39.000> things<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.540> didn't<00:01:39.869> have

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
lots of things that you didn't have

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.960 
lots of things that you didn't have
access<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.189> was<00:01:41.310> really<00:01:41.549> through<00:01:41.790> your

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
access to and it was really through your

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.090 
access to and it was really through your
ability<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.600> find<00:01:42.899> gear<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.500> use<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.829> gear

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
ability to find gear and use that gear

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.920 
ability to find gear and use that gear
to<00:01:44.280> progress<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.030> felt<00:01:45.299> much<00:01:45.509> more<00:01:45.750> in

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
to progress that you felt much more in

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.749 
to progress that you felt much more in
control<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.649> experience<00:01:47.159> when<00:01:47.640> we

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
control of that experience when we

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.550 
control of that experience when we
really<00:01:48.030> liked<00:01:48.240> celebrating<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.049> idea<00:01:49.350> that

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
really liked celebrating that idea that

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.499 
really liked celebrating that idea that
this<00:01:49.740> isn't<00:01:50.100> just<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.549> sequence<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.210> scenes

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
this isn't just a sequence of scenes

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.719 
this isn't just a sequence of scenes
that<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.619> world<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.280> can<00:01:53.520> come

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
that this is a world that you can come

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.460 
that this is a world that you can come
back<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.119> explore<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.689> it'll<00:01:54.840> be<00:01:54.960> different

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
back and explore and it'll be different

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.050 
back and explore and it'll be different
times<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:56.100> day<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.310> now<00:01:56.790> there'll<00:01:57.030> be

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
times of day and now there'll be

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.319 
times of day and now there'll be
different<00:01:57.540> weather<00:01:57.750> and

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
different weather and

00:01:58.329 --> 00:01:59.940 
different weather and
enemies<00:01:59.140> might<00:01:59.380> be<00:01:59.560> in<00:01:59.649> different

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
enemies might be in different

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.669 
enemies might be in different
populations<00:02:00.670> and<00:02:01.119> we<00:02:01.509> really<00:02:01.780> create<00:02:02.170> a<00:02:02.320> sense

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
populations and we really create a sense

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:05.580 
populations and we really create a sense
that<00:02:02.979> this<00:02:03.219> world<00:02:03.579> is<00:02:03.939> full<00:02:04.329> of<00:02:04.390> player<00:02:05.229> driven

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
that this world is full of player driven

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.649 
that this world is full of player driven
exploration<00:02:06.460> and<00:02:06.820> part<00:02:07.060> of<00:02:07.119> that<00:02:07.270> is<00:02:07.420> even

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
exploration and part of that is even

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.990 
exploration and part of that is even
giving<00:02:07.929> more<00:02:08.530> rewards<00:02:09.069> for<00:02:09.280> that<00:02:09.340> really

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
giving more rewards for that really

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.570 
giving more rewards for that really
getting<00:02:10.360> more<00:02:10.660> secret<00:02:11.140> tombs<00:02:11.379> and<00:02:11.950> extending

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
getting more secret tombs and extending

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.850 
getting more secret tombs and extending
that<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:13.000> things<00:02:13.209> like<00:02:13.330> crypts<00:02:14.140> or<00:02:14.440> animal

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
that to things like crypts or animal

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.680 
that to things like crypts or animal
bends<00:02:15.099> or<00:02:15.430> other<00:02:15.640> things<00:02:15.940> that<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.209> can<00:02:16.420> find

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
bends or other things that you can find

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.800 
bends or other things that you can find
but<00:02:17.080> then<00:02:17.230> also<00:02:17.379> more<00:02:17.799> skills<00:02:18.489> and<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:19.120> gear

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
but then also more skills and and gear

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:20.970 
but then also more skills and and gear
that<00:02:20.049> can<00:02:20.200> be<00:02:20.290> earned<00:02:20.530> through<00:02:20.709> that

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
that can be earned through that

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.770 
that can be earned through that
exploration<00:02:21.549> so<00:02:21.670> we<00:02:21.790> really<00:02:22.000> liked<00:02:22.239> that<00:02:22.360> game

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
exploration so we really liked that game

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.890 
exploration so we really liked that game
design<00:02:23.200> structure<00:02:23.860> that<00:02:24.069> allow<00:02:24.310> players<00:02:24.610> to

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
design structure that allow players to

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.559 
design structure that allow players to
both<00:02:25.900> experience<00:02:26.560> this<00:02:27.160> riveting<00:02:27.760> narrative

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
both experience this riveting narrative

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.530 
both experience this riveting narrative
but<00:02:28.900> also<00:02:29.099> feel<00:02:30.099> like<00:02:30.129> they're<00:02:30.640> surviving<00:02:31.420> on

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
but also feel like they're surviving on

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.479 
but also feel like they're surviving on
an<00:02:31.690> island<00:02:32.019> or<00:02:32.170> in<00:02:32.200> this<00:02:32.380> case<00:02:32.620> surviving<00:02:33.370> in

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
an island or in this case surviving in

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.380 
an island or in this case surviving in
the<00:02:33.579> hostile<00:02:34.739> Russian<00:02:35.739> wilderness<00:02:36.269> so<00:02:37.269> you're

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
the hostile Russian wilderness so you're

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
the hostile Russian wilderness so you're
doubling<00:02:37.630> down<00:02:37.780> on<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:38.079> metroidvania

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
doubling down on the metroidvania

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.620 
doubling down on the metroidvania
elements<00:02:39.040> we<00:02:39.519> do<00:02:39.700> we<00:02:39.849> I<00:02:39.880> mean<00:02:40.090> we<00:02:40.269> love<00:02:40.480> that

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
elements we do we I mean we love that

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.110 
elements we do we I mean we love that
game<00:02:40.900> structure<00:02:41.319> and<00:02:41.980> I<00:02:42.190> think<00:02:42.400> it<00:02:42.489> I<00:02:42.760> think<00:02:43.060> it

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
game structure and I think it I think it

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.600 
game structure and I think it I think it
that's<00:02:43.329> perfectly<00:02:43.870> for<00:02:44.230> Tomb<00:02:45.069> Raider<00:02:45.099> game

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
that's perfectly for Tomb Raider game

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.880 
that's perfectly for Tomb Raider game

are you a big Metroid fan yourself I am

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.530 
are you a big Metroid fan yourself I am
yeah<00:02:48.280> certainly<00:02:49.000> grew<00:02:49.209> up<00:02:49.329> playing

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
yeah certainly grew up playing

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.750 
yeah certainly grew up playing
Castlevania<00:02:50.079> and<00:02:50.709> Metroid<00:02:51.069> and<00:02:51.459> obviously

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
Castlevania and Metroid and obviously

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.180 
Castlevania and Metroid and obviously
Zelda<00:02:52.329> shares<00:02:52.690> a<00:02:52.780> fair<00:02:53.290> amount<00:02:53.560> of<00:02:53.680> similar

Zelda shares a fair amount of similar

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.920 
Zelda shares a fair amount of similar
structures<00:02:54.700> so<00:02:55.000> those<00:02:55.209> are<00:02:55.329> all<00:02:55.450> some<00:02:55.660> of<00:02:55.750> my

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
structures so those are all some of my

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.000 
structures so those are all some of my
favorite<00:02:56.620> games

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
favorite games

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.130

another<00:02:57.940> thing<00:02:58.150> that's<00:02:58.239> always<00:02:58.510> important<00:02:59.110> to

another thing that's always important to
us<00:02:59.290> and<00:02:59.560> this<00:02:59.680> is<00:02:59.739> exciting<00:03:00.370> in<00:03:00.640> the<00:03:00.730> context

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
us and this is exciting in the context

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.509 
us and this is exciting in the context
of<00:03:01.269> next-gen<00:03:01.989> platforms<00:03:02.590> like<00:03:02.769> the<00:03:02.889> Xbox<00:03:03.280> one

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519

that<00:03:04.180> Lara<00:03:04.450> as<00:03:04.660> a<00:03:04.690> character<00:03:05.260> I<00:03:05.500> love<00:03:05.920> it<00:03:06.069> now

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
that Lara as a character I love it now

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.400 
that Lara as a character I love it now
and<00:03:06.519> you<00:03:06.639> get<00:03:07.180> in<00:03:07.329> close<00:03:07.600> to<00:03:07.630> her<00:03:07.900> face<00:03:08.109> her

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
and you get in close to her face her

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.650 
and you get in close to her face her
eyes<00:03:08.620> are<00:03:08.950> darting<00:03:09.190> around<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:10.000> you<00:03:10.420> see<00:03:10.630> a

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
eyes are darting around and you see a

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.690 
eyes are darting around and you see a
sparkle<00:03:11.200> like<00:03:11.410> she's<00:03:11.620> almost<00:03:11.769> alive<00:03:12.250> and

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
sparkle like she's almost alive and

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.670 
sparkle like she's almost alive and
things<00:03:13.090> like<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.420> hair<00:03:13.600> simulation<00:03:14.350> where

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
things like the hair simulation where

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.789 
things like the hair simulation where
you<00:03:15.250> know<00:03:15.370> each<00:03:15.609> strand<00:03:16.000> is<00:03:16.329> moving<00:03:16.750> based<00:03:17.620> on

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
you know each strand is moving based on

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.770 
you know each strand is moving based on
how<00:03:18.010> she<00:03:18.069> moves<00:03:18.519> but<00:03:18.910> even<00:03:19.150> more<00:03:19.299> importantly

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
how she moves but even more importantly

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.020 
how she moves but even more importantly
than<00:03:20.019> fidelity<00:03:20.560> probably<00:03:21.160> is<00:03:21.370> just<00:03:21.850> the

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
than fidelity probably is just the

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.670 
than fidelity probably is just the
performance<00:03:22.660> side<00:03:22.870> of<00:03:23.079> it<00:03:23.200> and<00:03:23.410> we're<00:03:23.530> doing

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
performance side of it and we're doing

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.890 
performance side of it and we're doing
full<00:03:24.370> motion<00:03:24.670> capture<00:03:25.239> on<00:03:25.329> the<00:03:25.450> face<00:03:25.660> so

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
full motion capture on the face so

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.210 
full motion capture on the face so
you're<00:03:26.049> starting<00:03:26.410> to<00:03:26.560> see<00:03:26.709> a<00:03:26.739> lot<00:03:26.980> more

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
you're starting to see a lot more

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.280 
you're starting to see a lot more
nuanced<00:03:27.880> performance<00:03:28.540> to<00:03:28.959> me<00:03:29.049> it's<00:03:29.200> super

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
nuanced performance to me it's super

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.470 
nuanced performance to me it's super
exciting<00:03:29.650> to<00:03:29.980> see<00:03:30.130> her<00:03:30.340> coming<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:30.849> life<00:03:31.090> even

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
exciting to see her coming to life even

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.270 
exciting to see her coming to life even

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
more grounded in her environment and

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
zero to full fledged combat and we

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.550 
zero to full fledged combat and we

really want to make a rich character
with<00:04:46.800> believable<00:04:47.490> progression<00:04:48.180> and<00:04:48.419> again

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
with believable progression and again

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.270 
with believable progression and again
we're<00:04:48.870> very<00:04:48.900> proud<00:04:49.320> of<00:04:49.380> actually<00:04:49.830> taking<00:04:50.009> on

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
the challenge of making something like

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.930 
the challenge of making something like
the<00:04:52.470> first<00:04:52.710> kill<00:04:52.979> for<00:04:53.250> a<00:04:53.310> video<00:04:53.550> game

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
the first kill for a video game

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.879 
the first kill for a video game
character<00:04:54.210> meaningful<00:04:55.110> but<00:04:55.380> we<00:04:55.500> really<00:04:55.740> also

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
character meaningful but we really also

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.370 
character meaningful but we really also
set<00:04:56.250> out<00:04:56.370> to<00:04:56.669> improve<00:04:57.300> upon<00:04:57.509> our<00:04:57.690> storytelling

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
set out to improve upon our storytelling

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.290 
set out to improve upon our storytelling
and<00:04:58.650> our<00:04:58.740> characterization<00:04:59.160> and<00:04:59.940> things<00:05:00.150> like

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
and our characterization and things like

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.969 
and our characterization and things like
that<00:05:00.539> it's<00:05:00.870> important<00:05:01.320> to<00:05:01.349> me<00:05:01.440> at<00:05:01.560> the<00:05:01.620> end<00:05:01.800> of

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
that it's important to me at the end of

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:03.230 
that it's important to me at the end of
the<00:05:02.070> story<00:05:02.340> that<00:05:02.430> she's<00:05:02.759> a<00:05:02.789> different<00:05:03.090> person

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
the story that she's a different person

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.120 
the story that she's a different person
and<00:05:03.780> she<00:05:03.960> is<00:05:04.050> at<00:05:04.199> the<00:05:04.289> beginning<00:05:04.410> of<00:05:04.740> the<00:05:04.860> story

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
and she is at the beginning of the story

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.219 
and she is at the beginning of the story
and<00:05:05.639> I<00:05:05.729> think<00:05:05.940> we<00:05:06.030> have<00:05:06.360> the<00:05:06.479> opportunity<00:05:07.050> to

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
and I think we have the opportunity to

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.499 
and I think we have the opportunity to
do<00:05:07.380> that<00:05:07.530> again<00:05:07.860> and<00:05:07.889> and<00:05:08.310> I<00:05:08.699> think<00:05:08.970> the<00:05:09.300> goal

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:09.509 
do that again and and I think the goal

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:11.659 
do that again and and I think the goal
is<00:05:09.539> to<00:05:10.020> do<00:05:10.169> it<00:05:10.320> in<00:05:10.500> a<00:05:10.590> way<00:05:10.710> that<00:05:10.949> is<00:05:11.099> grounded

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
is to do it in a way that is grounded

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:13.640 
is to do it in a way that is grounded
and<00:05:11.820> believable<00:05:12.360> and<00:05:12.539> really<00:05:12.780> feel<00:05:13.110> like<00:05:13.380> this

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
and believable and really feel like this

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.649 
and believable and really feel like this
is<00:05:13.800> a<00:05:13.830> person<00:05:14.190> who's<00:05:14.820> thrust<00:05:15.240> into<00:05:15.449> these

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:15.659 
is a person who's thrust into these

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:18.140 
is a person who's thrust into these
situations<00:05:16.320> and<00:05:16.740> dealing<00:05:17.159> with<00:05:17.190> it<00:05:17.490> but<00:05:17.669> this

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
situations and dealing with it but this

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.029 
situations and dealing with it but this
time<00:05:18.360> around<00:05:18.509> it<00:05:18.810> isn't<00:05:19.110> her<00:05:19.320> first<00:05:19.560> time<00:05:19.800> out

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 
time around it isn't her first time out

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:22.879 
time around it isn't her first time out
so<00:05:20.430> we<00:05:21.330> take<00:05:21.509> a<00:05:21.539> character<00:05:22.080> with<00:05:22.320> more

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889 
so we take a character with more

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:24.890 
so we take a character with more
experience<00:05:23.520> put<00:05:23.849> into<00:05:24.060> a<00:05:24.120> situation<00:05:24.360> where

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
experience put into a situation where

00:07:17.829 --> 00:07:17.839 
much gunplay and too much fighting in

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:21.189 
much gunplay and too much fighting in
the<00:07:17.899> last<00:07:18.110> game<00:07:18.289> I<00:07:18.939> mean<00:07:19.939> I<00:07:20.059> I<00:07:20.209> think<00:07:20.539> we<00:07:20.689> try<00:07:21.139> to

00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:21.199 
the last game I mean I I think we try to

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:24.399 
the last game I mean I I think we try to
balance<00:07:21.589> our<00:07:22.300> traversal<00:07:23.300> and<00:07:23.509> exploration

00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:24.409 
balance our traversal and exploration

00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:26.399 
balance our traversal and exploration
and<00:07:24.619> our<00:07:24.769> combat<00:07:25.249> and<00:07:25.490> our<00:07:25.579> puzzle-solving

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:26.409 
and our combat and our puzzle-solving

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:29.439 
and our combat and our puzzle-solving
certainly<00:07:27.409> I<00:07:27.679> think<00:07:27.949> for<00:07:28.639> some<00:07:28.849> people<00:07:28.879> that

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:29.449 
certainly I think for some people that

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.269 
certainly I think for some people that
was<00:07:29.569> more<00:07:29.779> combat<00:07:30.169> than<00:07:30.409> they<00:07:30.529> would<00:07:30.709> like<00:07:30.740> and

00:07:31.269 --> 00:07:31.279 
was more combat than they would like and

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:33.579 
was more combat than they would like and
I<00:07:31.459> think<00:07:31.669> we<00:07:31.789> were<00:07:31.999> sensitive<00:07:32.479> to<00:07:32.749> that<00:07:32.899> but<00:07:33.469> at

00:07:33.579 --> 00:07:33.589 
I think we were sensitive to that but at

00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:36.429 
I think we were sensitive to that but at
the<00:07:33.709> same<00:07:33.889> time<00:07:34.360> it<00:07:35.360> is<00:07:35.419> one<00:07:35.869> of<00:07:35.899> the<00:07:36.169> skills

00:07:36.429 --> 00:07:36.439 
the same time it is one of the skills

00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:38.350 
the same time it is one of the skills
that<00:07:36.679> you<00:07:36.919> have<00:07:36.949> to<00:07:37.249> learn<00:07:37.399> to<00:07:37.729> succeed<00:07:38.179> in

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:38.360 
that you have to learn to succeed in

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.719 
that you have to learn to succeed in
this<00:07:38.509> game<00:07:38.719> and<00:07:38.990> then<00:07:39.349> that's<00:07:39.679> where<00:07:39.949> a<00:07:40.249> lot<00:07:40.669> of

00:07:40.719 --> 00:07:40.729 
this game and then that's where a lot of

00:07:40.729 --> 00:07:43.809 
this game and then that's where a lot of
the<00:07:41.089> optional<00:07:41.990> content<00:07:42.800> things<00:07:43.039> like<00:07:43.369> secret

00:07:43.809 --> 00:07:43.819 
the optional content things like secret

00:07:43.819 --> 00:07:47.049 
the optional content things like secret
tombs<00:07:44.089> that<00:07:44.599> you<00:07:45.110> can<00:07:45.319> start<00:07:45.709> to<00:07:45.949> bias<00:07:46.849> your

00:07:47.049 --> 00:07:47.059 
tombs that you can start to bias your

00:07:47.059 --> 00:07:49.119 
tombs that you can start to bias your
experience<00:07:47.659> towards<00:07:47.989> things<00:07:48.319> that<00:07:48.649> you<00:07:48.860> enjoy

00:07:49.119 --> 00:07:49.129 
experience towards things that you enjoy

00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:52.749 
experience towards things that you enjoy
most<00:07:49.819> and<00:07:50.239> also<00:07:50.779> having<00:07:51.409> more<00:07:51.739> tools<00:07:52.009> to<00:07:52.459> evade

00:07:52.749 --> 00:07:52.759 
most and also having more tools to evade

00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:54.369 
most and also having more tools to evade
combat<00:07:53.300> when<00:07:53.479> you<00:07:53.599> want<00:07:53.809> to<00:07:54.019> that<00:07:54.259> that's

00:07:54.369 --> 00:07:54.379 
combat when you want to that that's

00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:55.829 
combat when you want to that that's
another<00:07:54.679> way<00:07:54.769> that<00:07:55.129> some<00:07:55.339> people<00:07:55.639> enjoy

00:07:55.829 --> 00:07:55.839 
another way that some people enjoy

00:07:55.839 --> 00:07:58.659 
another way that some people enjoy
catering<00:07:56.839> to<00:07:57.019> their<00:07:57.139> own<00:07:57.289> pacing<00:07:58.249> balance
