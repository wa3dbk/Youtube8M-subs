see we generally do a lot of squatting
and<00:01:01.949> bench<00:01:02.309> pressing<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.089> then<00:01:03.780> like<00:01:03.930> pulling

exercises<00:01:04.739> everything<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.670> said<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.570> helps

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
exercises everything that said so helps

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.410 
exercises everything that said so helps
with<00:01:07.350> your<00:01:07.429> set<00:01:08.429> piece<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.910> for<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.149> props

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
with your set piece for it for the props

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.570 
with your set piece for it for the props
and<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:10.170> varies<00:01:10.649> between<00:01:10.800> whether<00:01:11.399> you're

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
and it varies between whether you're

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.249 
and it varies between whether you're
back<00:01:11.729> or<00:01:12.000> forward<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.539> what<00:01:12.720> sort<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.050> exercise

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
back or forward so what sort of exercise

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.440 
back or forward so what sort of exercise
into<00:01:13.649> doing<00:01:16.520> all<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.700> boys<00:01:17.850> will<00:01:18.060> benefit

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
into doing all the boys will benefit

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.830 
into doing all the boys will benefit
from<00:01:18.479> it

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
from it

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.210 
from it
and<00:01:19.050> you<00:01:19.500> know<00:01:19.619> rate<00:01:19.800> rate<00:01:19.979> through

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
and you know rate rate through

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.190 
and you know rate rate through
possessions<00:01:20.909> like<00:01:21.060> scrum-half<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.780> when

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
possessions like scrum-half and when

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.830 
possessions like scrum-half and when
I've<00:01:22.640> seen<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.819> to<00:01:23.940> be<00:01:24.060> more<00:01:24.270> slightly<00:01:24.509> belt

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
I've seen is to be more slightly belt

I've seen is to be more slightly belt
and<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.590> explosiveness<00:01:26.190> for<00:01:26.640> their<00:01:26.759> sprint

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090

and and their running and you know scrum

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.559 
and and their running and you know scrum
has<00:01:29.369> been<00:01:29.640> -<00:01:29.789> don't<00:01:29.970> pack<00:01:30.179> up<00:01:30.300> the<00:01:30.420> ball<00:01:30.539> a

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
that strength plays a massive massive

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.609 
that strength plays a massive massive
role<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.360> terms<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.659> development<00:01:37.020> speed<00:01:37.380> and

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
strength kind of comes into play

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.719 
strength kind of comes into play
generally<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.530> Train<00:01:49.770> put<00:01:49.979> yard<00:01:50.189> on<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.399> Monday

or<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.060> Tuesday<00:01:52.130> and<00:01:53.130> then<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.840> tapers<00:01:54.840> off

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
or a Tuesday and then it it tapers off

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.679 
or a Tuesday and then it it tapers off
towards<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.530> game<00:01:55.789> but<00:01:56.789> on<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:56.939> one<00:01:57.509> we've<00:01:57.659> got

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
towards the game but on a one we've got

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.020 
towards the game but on a one we've got
a<00:01:57.869> week<00:01:58.140> with<00:01:58.289> no<00:01:58.439> game<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:59.130> generally<00:01:59.549> do

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
a week with no game and generally do

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.700 
a week with no game and generally do
quite<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.270> bit<00:02:00.329> ways

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.010 

it<00:02:05.710> becomes<00:02:06.070> a<00:02:06.340> balance<00:02:06.850> between<00:02:06.970> making<00:02:07.840> sure

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
it becomes a balance between making sure

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.440 
it becomes a balance between making sure
to<00:02:08.200> recover<00:02:08.530> for<00:02:08.740> the<00:02:08.800> next<00:02:08.890> game<00:02:09.250> if<00:02:10.209> they

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
to recover for the next game if they

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.970 
to recover for the next game if they
haven't<00:02:10.750> had<00:02:10.869> game<00:02:11.050> time<00:02:11.319> then<00:02:11.590> you<00:02:11.890> know

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
haven't had game time then you know

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.590 
haven't had game time then you know
sessions<00:02:12.430> become<00:02:12.670> a<00:02:12.700> bit<00:02:12.910> tougher<00:02:13.300> so<00:02:13.450> that

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
sessions become a bit tougher so that

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.180 
sessions become a bit tougher so that
when<00:02:13.930> they<00:02:14.020> do<00:02:14.080> come<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.500> play<00:02:14.709> there<00:02:14.980> they're

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
when they do come to play there they're

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.090 
when they do come to play there they're
up<00:02:15.310> at<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.520> required<00:02:16.180> level<00:02:16.590> in<00:02:17.590> pre-season

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
up at the required level in pre-season

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.580 
up at the required level in pre-season
you<00:02:18.459> know<00:02:18.520> that's<00:02:18.700> very<00:02:18.730> tough<00:02:19.150> it's

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
you know that's very tough it's

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.690 
you know that's very tough it's
obviously<00:02:20.590> you've<00:02:20.950> spoke<00:02:21.160> to<00:02:21.280> any<00:02:21.430> players

obviously you've spoke to any players
they<00:02:21.850> dread<00:02:22.300> that<00:02:22.330> period<00:02:22.810> in<00:02:22.900> terms<00:02:23.110> of<00:02:23.290> being

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
they dread that period in terms of being

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.630 
they dread that period in terms of being
an<00:02:23.890> intense<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:24.459> physical<00:02:25.209> period<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:25.690> and

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
an intense and physical period and and

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.490 
an intense and physical period and and
physically<00:02:27.640> very<00:02:28.180> intense<00:02:28.450> but<00:02:28.600> mentally<00:02:29.410> as

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
physically very intense but mentally as

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.800 
physically very intense but mentally as
well<00:02:29.530> just<00:02:29.920> so<00:02:30.010> that<00:02:30.040> you<00:02:31.030> know<00:02:31.090> they<00:02:31.630> know

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
well just so that you know they know

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.750 
well just so that you know they know
what's<00:02:31.989> coming<00:02:32.350> and<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:33.160> it<00:02:33.220> becomes<00:02:33.550> a

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
what's coming and and it becomes a

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.880 
what's coming and and it becomes a
really<00:02:34.360> kind<00:02:34.450> of<00:02:34.569> quite<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.200> hard<00:02:35.380> time<00:02:35.620> for<00:02:35.830> it

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
really kind of quite a hard time for it

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.009 
really kind of quite a hard time for it
for<00:02:36.040> a<00:02:36.069> lot<00:02:36.220> of<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.340> guys<00:02:36.519> who<00:02:36.880> are<00:02:37.360> working<00:02:37.690> in

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
for a lot of the guys who are working in

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.309 
for a lot of the guys who are working in
this<00:02:38.200> in<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.650> swimmer<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:39.810> pretty<00:02:40.810> much<00:02:40.989> that

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
this in the swimmer and pretty much that

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.460 
this in the swimmer and pretty much that
was<00:02:41.440> a<00:02:41.500> real<00:02:42.220> tough<00:02:42.430> season<00:02:43.420> we<00:02:44.050> challenged

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
was a real tough season we challenged

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.860 
was a real tough season we challenged
them<00:02:44.560> in<00:02:44.680> certain<00:02:45.160> ways<00:02:45.459> throughout<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.630> year

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
them in certain ways throughout the year

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.199 
them in certain ways throughout the year
that<00:02:47.050> that<00:02:47.350> they<00:02:47.530> can<00:02:47.590> always<00:02:48.130> improve<00:02:48.550> in<00:02:48.910> a

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
that that they can always improve in a

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.690 
that that they can always improve in a
certain<00:02:49.510> era<00:02:49.690> to<00:02:49.900> perform<00:02:50.560> better<00:02:50.739> in<00:02:51.100> you

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
certain era to perform better in you

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.610 
certain era to perform better in you
know<00:02:51.790> situations<00:02:52.450> certainly<00:02:53.440> from<00:02:53.560> a

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
know situations certainly from a

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.699 
know situations certainly from a
strength<00:02:53.860> perspective<00:02:54.480> that<00:02:55.480> will<00:02:55.750> enable

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
strength perspective that will enable

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.430 
strength perspective that will enable
them<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.299> absorb<00:02:58.299> the<00:02:58.660> forces<00:02:59.049> and<00:02:59.170> almost

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
them to absorb the forces and almost

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.890 
them to absorb the forces and almost
from<00:02:59.799> from<00:03:00.250> our<00:03:00.370> perspective<00:03:00.850> impose<00:03:01.480> that<00:03:01.720> on

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
from from our perspective impose that on

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.360 
from from our perspective impose that on
the<00:03:01.989> opposition<00:03:02.560> they<00:03:03.069> break<00:03:03.340> down

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
the opposition they break down

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.640 
the opposition they break down
situations<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.420> certainly<00:03:05.170> out<00:03:05.319> for<00:03:05.560> our

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
situations and certainly out for our

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.350 
situations and certainly out for our
forwards<00:03:06.100> up<00:03:06.220> in<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.489> scrum<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:06.940> set-pieces

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
forwards up in the scrum and set-pieces

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.199 
forwards up in the scrum and set-pieces
they<00:03:07.630> you<00:03:07.870> know<00:03:07.959> they<00:03:08.079> can<00:03:08.230> use<00:03:08.410> that<00:03:08.560> strength

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
they you know they can use that strength

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:19.580 
they you know they can use that strength
against<00:03:10.209> the<00:03:10.329> opposition

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.730 

that<00:03:20.590> season<00:03:20.950> we've<00:03:21.280> had<00:03:21.310> a<00:03:22.030> strong<00:03:22.270> scrum<00:03:22.740> and

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
that season we've had a strong scrum and

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.949 
that season we've had a strong scrum and
obviously<00:03:24.550> in<00:03:24.640> scrum<00:03:24.970> strength<00:03:25.300> is<00:03:25.540> a<00:03:25.569> massive

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
obviously in scrum strength is a massive

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:36.240 
obviously in scrum strength is a massive
factor<00:03:34.020> some<00:03:35.020> of<00:03:35.080> the<00:03:35.170> exercises<00:03:35.440> we<00:03:35.920> do<00:03:36.070> you

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
factor some of the exercises we do you

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.220 
factor some of the exercises we do you
know<00:03:36.340> some<00:03:36.730> corporate<00:03:36.910> and<00:03:37.270> explosive

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
know some corporate and explosive

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.050 
know some corporate and explosive
movements<00:03:38.860> as<00:03:38.980> well<00:03:39.010> when<00:03:39.400> we<00:03:39.430> faithfully

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
movements as well when we faithfully

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.960 
movements as well when we faithfully
engage<00:03:40.330> in<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:40.600> scrum<00:03:40.840> and<00:03:41.580> if<00:03:42.580> you<00:03:42.760> get<00:03:42.940> a

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
engage in the scrum and if you get a

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.490 
engage in the scrum and if you get a
good<00:03:43.180> strong<00:03:43.420> can<00:03:43.690> it<00:03:43.870> can<00:03:44.020> be<00:03:44.110> the<00:03:44.200> backbone

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
good strong can it can be the backbone

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.620 
good strong can it can be the backbone
of<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:44.739> team<00:03:44.890> and<00:03:45.580> I<00:03:45.760> think<00:03:45.790> we've<00:03:46.270> sure<00:03:46.450> not

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
of the team and I think we've sure not

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:52.350 
of the team and I think we've sure not
last<00:03:46.810> season<00:03:47.080> without<00:03:47.200> scoring<00:03:47.590> a<00:03:51.360> fart

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
last season without scoring a fart

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.270 
last season without scoring a fart
bishop<00:03:52.720> in<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:52.870> clear<00:03:53.170> that<00:03:53.440> encrypt<00:03:53.800> Emma<00:03:54.070> I

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
bishop in the clear that encrypt Emma I

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.310 
bishop in the clear that encrypt Emma I
guess<00:03:54.670> I<00:03:54.790> know<00:03:54.940> you're<00:03:55.209> critical<00:03:55.690> guys<00:03:55.989> good

really really strong guy so that just
makes<00:04:12.600> me<00:04:12.750> want<00:04:12.960> to<00:04:13.020> improve<00:04:13.350> and<00:04:13.560> show<00:04:13.950> me

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
makes me want to improve and show me

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.190 
makes me want to improve and show me
come<00:04:14.370> want<00:04:14.850> to<00:04:14.970> improve<00:04:15.210> more<00:04:15.420> as<00:04:15.570> well<00:04:15.780> say

it's<00:04:16.470> good<00:04:16.680> rivalry<00:04:17.070> of<00:04:17.310> banter<00:04:18.209> between<00:04:18.299> all

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
it's good rivalry of banter between all

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.590 
it's good rivalry of banter between all
the<00:04:18.720> ones<00:04:18.870> really<00:04:19.109> but<00:04:20.040> with<00:04:20.280> me<00:04:20.430> and<00:04:20.459> well<00:04:21.329> she

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
the ones really but with me and well she

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.080 
the ones really but with me and well she
it's<00:04:22.100> just<00:04:23.100> we're<00:04:23.400> pretty<00:04:23.580> similar<00:04:24.000> in

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
it's just we're pretty similar in

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.300 
it's just we're pretty similar in
strength<00:04:24.420> and<00:04:24.810> when<00:04:25.560> we've<00:04:25.680> got<00:04:25.800> no<00:04:25.950> niggles

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
strength and when we've got no niggles

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.550 
strength and when we've got no niggles
and<00:04:26.520> knocks<00:04:26.730> pretty<00:04:27.690> much<00:04:27.780> less<00:04:27.990> the<00:04:28.170> same

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
and knocks pretty much less the same

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.390 
and knocks pretty much less the same
sort<00:04:28.860> of<00:04:28.920> way<00:04:29.040> it's<00:04:29.250> really<00:04:30.950> for<00:04:31.950> me<00:04:31.980> it's<00:04:32.220> a

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400
