now we're close to intercepting the
localizer<00:01:07.380> as<00:01:07.980> the<00:01:08.250> localizer<00:01:08.670> needle<00:01:09.030> starts

remember<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.930> inbound<00:01:13.260> course<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.710> 1<00:01:13.980> 3

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
remember that the inbound course is 1 3

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:22.140 
remember that the inbound course is 1 3
0<00:01:14.280> degrees

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.600

turn right to intersect remember that a

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.250 
turn right to intersect remember that a
localizer<00:01:27.790> is<00:01:28.060> much<00:01:28.360> more<00:01:28.570> sensitive<00:01:29.080> than<00:01:29.200> a
