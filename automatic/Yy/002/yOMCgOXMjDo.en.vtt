haven't made a new top for it yet we
have<00:00:34.670> hot<00:00:35.210> wax<00:00:35.540> in<00:00:35.780> there<00:00:36.020> and<00:00:36.940> I<00:00:37.940> don't<00:00:38.000> know

if<00:00:38.480> we<00:00:39.410> can<00:00:39.560> see<00:00:39.890> it<00:00:39.940> but<00:00:42.340> right<00:00:43.340> now<00:00:43.399> the

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
if we can see it but right now the

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.130 
if we can see it but right now the
temperature<00:00:44.809> of<00:00:44.930> the<00:00:45.079> wax<00:00:45.350> is<00:00:45.940> approaching

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
temperature of the wax is approaching

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.590 
temperature of the wax is approaching
275<00:00:48.140> degrees<00:00:51.609> I've<00:00:52.609> got<00:00:52.820> my<00:00:53.030> pressure

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
275 degrees I've got my pressure

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.459 
275 degrees I've got my pressure
I<00:00:53.949> think<00:00:54.949> up<00:00:55.100> around<00:00:55.309> 40<00:00:56.350> and<00:00:57.609> we're<00:00:58.609> going<00:00:58.910> to

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
I think up around 40 and we're going to

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.930 
I think up around 40 and we're going to
light<00:01:00.469> this<00:01:00.710> bad<00:01:00.949> boy<00:01:03.460> all<00:01:04.460> right<00:01:04.580> we're<00:01:04.790> going

to give you some narration here well I

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.400 
to give you some narration here well I
got<00:01:07.850> my<00:01:08.000> back<00:01:08.210> to<00:01:08.450> the<00:01:08.570> camera<00:01:11.260> this<00:01:12.260> is

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
got my back to the camera this is

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.100 
got my back to the camera this is
actually<00:01:12.800> the<00:01:12.920> second<00:01:13.310> time<00:01:13.369> I<00:01:13.780> started<00:01:14.780> up<00:01:14.960> I

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
actually the second time I started up I

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.230 
actually the second time I started up I
wasn't<00:01:15.320> going<00:01:15.560> to<00:01:15.650> do<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:16.430> first<00:01:16.610> time<00:01:17.030> on

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
wasn't going to do the first time on

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.760 
wasn't going to do the first time on
video<00:01:17.659> like<00:01:17.990> I<00:01:18.579> did<00:01:19.579> the<00:01:19.670> last<00:01:19.880> time<00:01:21.130> and

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
video like I did the last time and

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.999 
video like I did the last time and
interestingly<00:01:24.770> enough<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:26.000> first<00:01:26.210> time<00:01:27.009> this

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
interestingly enough the first time this

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.030 
interestingly enough the first time this
day<00:01:28.280> it<00:01:29.049> started<00:01:30.049> better<00:01:30.229> than<00:01:30.470> it's<00:01:30.619> about<00:01:30.799> to

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
day it started better than it's about to

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.679 
day it started better than it's about to
start

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:45.340 

and<00:01:36.560> a<00:01:36.649> little<00:01:36.859> trouble<00:01:43.689> it's<00:01:44.689> a<00:01:44.840> smoking<00:01:45.170> gun

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
and a little trouble it's a smoking gun

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.719 
and a little trouble it's a smoking gun
and<00:01:46.329> we<00:01:47.329> have<00:01:47.569> fire<00:01:48.280> course<00:01:49.280> it's<00:01:49.490> not<00:01:49.609> going

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
and we have fire course it's not going

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.020 
and we have fire course it's not going
to<00:01:49.819> last<00:01:49.939> long

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.210 

honestly<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.170> was<00:01:55.200> much<00:01:55.740> better<00:01:56.010> and

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
honestly it was much better and

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:03.290 
honestly it was much better and
rehearsal

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.390 

oh<00:02:03.360> don't<00:02:04.170> turn<00:02:06.830> don't<00:02:07.830> turn<00:02:08.040> the<00:02:08.190> propane

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:08.400 
oh don't turn don't turn the propane

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:24.340

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.530 

but<00:02:24.920> amazingly<00:02:25.400> enough<00:02:25.520> did<00:02:26.000> you<00:02:26.150> get<00:02:26.390> it

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
but amazingly enough did you get it

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:34.820 
but amazingly enough did you get it
running

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.800 

trying<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.880> find<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.870> right<00:02:38.300> drip<00:02:39.300> setting

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
trying to find the right drip setting

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.839 
trying to find the right drip setting
here

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.010 

got<00:02:44.390> smoked

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:56.570 

trying<00:02:48.620> to<00:02:48.740> get<00:02:48.890> no<00:02:49.070> smoke

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.490 

[Applause]

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
[Applause]

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.310 
[Applause]
pretty<00:03:03.160> a<00:03:03.220> big<00:03:03.460> flame<00:03:03.790> at<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.030> end<00:03:05.190> I<00:03:07.320> don't

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
pretty a big flame at the end I don't

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.370 
pretty a big flame at the end I don't
think<00:03:08.530> that<00:03:09.490> the<00:03:10.710> air<00:03:11.710> coming<00:03:12.340> out<00:03:12.670> of<00:03:12.850> the

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
think that the air coming out of the

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.370 
think that the air coming out of the
nozzle<00:03:14.700> has<00:03:15.700> a<00:03:15.760> lot<00:03:16.150> of<00:03:16.270> velocity<00:03:16.480> by<00:03:17.050> the<00:03:17.140> time

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
nozzle has a lot of velocity by the time

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.630 
nozzle has a lot of velocity by the time
it<00:03:17.530> gets<00:03:17.680> that<00:03:18.040> last<00:03:18.400> third<00:03:18.730> of<00:03:18.940> the<00:03:19.000> pipe<00:03:19.810> so

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
it gets that last third of the pipe so

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.550 
it gets that last third of the pipe so
we<00:03:21.640> got<00:03:21.790> a<00:03:21.820> much<00:03:22.060> general<00:03:22.540> work<00:03:22.720> gentler<00:03:23.410> flame

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
we got a much general work gentler flame

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.740 
we got a much general work gentler flame
now<00:03:26.560> I'm<00:03:26.770> taking<00:03:27.160> get<00:03:27.970> you<00:03:28.120> a<00:03:28.150> close-up

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.790 

and

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.270 

kind<00:03:35.370> of<00:03:35.460> see<00:03:35.790> inside<00:03:38.210> there's<00:03:39.210> the<00:03:40.280> oil

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
kind of see inside there's the oil

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.860 
kind of see inside there's the oil
that's<00:03:41.550> dripping<00:03:41.880> off<00:03:42.210> of<00:03:42.240> all

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:56.280 

see<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:48.170> air<00:03:49.160> jet<00:03:49.550> canal<00:03:54.489> which<00:03:55.489> is<00:03:55.700> not<00:03:55.910> a

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
see the air jet canal which is not a

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.729 
see the air jet canal which is not a
very<00:03:57.290> good<00:04:00.010> oil<00:04:01.010> that<00:04:01.519> I<00:04:01.580> have<00:04:01.879> right<00:04:02.180> there

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
very good oil that I have right there

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.910 
very good oil that I have right there
not<00:04:03.739> filtered<00:04:04.280> very<00:04:04.519> well<00:04:05.440> but<00:04:06.440> it<00:04:06.590> was<00:04:06.709> good

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
not filtered very well but it was good

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:16.030 
not filtered very well but it was good
enough<00:04:07.129> to<00:04:07.190> test

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.100
