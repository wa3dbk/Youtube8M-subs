00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:13.780
 Platform 1 to 20 25 in the direction of the railway 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:17.470
 future Austria starts from the first stop 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.340
 only from regional railway misere we want 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.890
 be heard 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.859
 we are two valleys the ybbstal that 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.420
 theater we are wonderful 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.820
 tourist areas we would have a lot 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.050
 Much and end of the most important things is 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.050
 the train to it 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.850
 there is a big danger that the Austrian 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.510
 rail network will no longer be in 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.430
 future 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.530
 There is a lot of money for it 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.490
 railway sector would only exist very much 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.550
 unevenly distributed for this alone 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:54.610
 three dark projects semmering koralm 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.590
 and each burner base tunnel thirds 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.800
 of the total money of the infrastructure 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.780
 in and then actually this would have 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.890
 would not be rearranged by 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.630
 big amounts but it really would have to 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.340
 something invested in regional railways 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.140
 and not just such a slow one 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.540
 so be prepared 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.150
 frequency of the regional bank could 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.680
 through books you do not speak 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.190
 wait for three hours for the next train 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:25.380
 should be everything then 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.290
 automatic impersonal me so before 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.020
 that the elderly in vending machines are not 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.530
 can be addressed 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.670
 Next stop extra success examples one 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.979
 has to think about what he wants 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.680
 customer or the customer that is two 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.270
 Components of one the offer that 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.580
 The train must first be there 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.409
 must exist a really attractive 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.190
 So clock drive at least one 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.130
 hour day 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.110
 then the customer that are also on the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.210
 second, it also has a good one 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.729
 customer service and that's where we set 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.410
 Schaffner also ran a big business 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.660
 success model is also our proximity 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.850
 to the politics that means we have the 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.890
 region mayors citizens 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.380
 and citizens really involved and too 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.119
 Fans of our train has done that 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.070
 pinzgau where the train is already set 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.080
 we had to start from zero and 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.300
 now have the pinzgauerin and 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.010
 installations fans made the guess 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.780
 your gang love your train 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.519
 that means it also for the feeling 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:26.459
 and that it is a secret of success 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:29.250
 Success factors were after 15 years 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:32.100
 standstill convinced approached 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.470
 are a basic concept to submit 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.390
 We had to call that one 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.350
 congestion corridor in the 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.700
 landeshauptstadt 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:44.360
 it is therefore especially those too 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.100
 convince because the 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.400
 decision-making power have succeeded 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.600
 if we also have concepts in place 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.470
 submit 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.510
 the convince because the train must in 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.160
 this time will go otherwise she plays with 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.300
 currently 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.390
 Next stop in exter 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.980
 outlook the requirement is like 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.420
 said that we succeed ours 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.580
 achieve strategic goal 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.730
 that means the regional train also partly 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.980
 because part of modern life in the 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.970
 region to do when the timetable 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.620
 if the quality fits the people 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.040
 use the traffic on offer 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.750
 to take 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.180
 then there will be traffic services 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.130
 contracts vain this in the base 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.610
 economic basis for one 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.320
 secured operation of a regional railway 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:35.830
 There are numerous examples of success for 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.660
 Regional railways in Austria started 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.090
 has the attraction of 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.560
 regional railways before the first ten 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.230
 years in Upper Austria with the 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.960
 donauuferbahn but also with the 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.520
 mÃ¼hlkreisbahn we have gas in the east the 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.570
 pannonia railway with electrification 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.230
 between neusiedl and iron city 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.600
 electrification of passenger traffic 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.280
 and could increase by 30 percent 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.190
 similar rates of increase in Vorarlberg 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.630
 between bregenz and st margarethen 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.100
 are represented by the attractiveness 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.170
 The Rosenthal Railway explained where we are 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.140
 increase of more than 100 percent 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:12.520
 through the attraction so there is in 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:14.230
 every federal state the examples of success 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.440
 their very individual 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.110
 but success stories have the 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.640
 ultimately a success are federal if 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.740
 the quality is right when the timetable 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.350
 if people are right 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.480
 We use the transport service 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.360
 Everyone knows that traffic is like 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.250
 number one is the worry child number one thing 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.140
 the greenhouse gases and also the 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.290
 energy consumption and alone the 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:41.860
 Energy consumption is between 1990 and 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:45.520
 2011 increased by 67 percent 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.430
 So there is something to do and that 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.600
 Ministry of the Environment is therefore just one 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.940
 sustainable environmentally friendly 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.420
 transport system is important 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:59.140
 So we offer with our sponsor and 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:01.900
 counseling program climate active mobile even 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.720
 subsidies for accompanying measures to 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.580
 for regional trains it is that 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.550
 you promote yourself to marketing concept 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.520
 let it be a ticket ticket 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:17.350
 whatever I invite you to use 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:20.580
 our offers station train future 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.580
