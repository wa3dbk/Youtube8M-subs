00:00:09.899 --> 00:00:13.149
 well i'm about to introduce you a renowned architect 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:16.049
 international 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.049
 Jobs for Montese projects were considered 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.550
 by the most real revolution 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.349
 progress but above all sustainability 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.720
 I will tell him about his trip from a trip that he will return 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.950
 doomed to use a word than before 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.230
 title in the application a question but corbetta 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.460
 that is 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.910
 towards us 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.280
 mario bearings 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.940
 I have just returned from a trip but 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.150
 especially okay because I took a ride and 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.680
 Palestine and I can assure you that I did not take Jerusalem syndrome 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.690
 that is why a given a home becomes a prophet cake products 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.399
 cream is a bit more difficult than anything else 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:11.830
 ears tomorrow 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.360
 for growth 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.800
 deaprofessionale of competences that is widening more and more and therefore 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.320
 I don't know how long we will receive 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.680
 to hold all of these standing still I started my career enough 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.740
 young 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.850
 because supreme if it is not a question of running away from the university the most 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.930
 quickly possible 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.330
 because it is hard to find in the teaching of 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.080
 of architecture its ram may seem banal to say practicality 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.380
 and here I threw myself into the real and concrete world of architecture for many 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.640
 years and I did the shake 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.760
 the laborious laborer labored disorders worked a nice open day 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.300
 I remember a study 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.960
 tires and I'm in a day is true alone in the office to the pdl 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.000
 I had read in Paris 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.240
 no one phoned and I started saying now how I do what happens 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.129
 then slowly 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.090
 it was always a power all that ours if it has an important role to play 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.929
 cultivate it but then 

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:15.829
 then over time 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:20.629
 cross paths people cross and dentist know it projects projects e 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.329
 I always say above to the youngest even if I still had them 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.139
 young 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:28.409
 those younger than me that 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:34.120
 our practice is also very close to making projects you have to do them 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.120
 nausea farneta I love you as an exercise 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:41.359
 there was no intelligence to do many projects and why 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:46.419
 creative activity is a creativity I often have of police myself 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:48.889
 they say how we do projects 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:52.939
 where we look for many ideas we throw away a lot of work that we can 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.180
 clean it up enough to find the ideas that one does 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:00.349
 fc inter if only through construction 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:01.399
 of a man 

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:04.829
 "If we can put together all the men of a man with penis," he said 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:07.319
 pietro drawings 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.359
 the point of beauty to culture and you together with this construction of many 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.359
 men made so that we can all be together 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:18.139
 then 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:20.809
 actually an architect 

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:24.239
 a beauty creator if I am my mission 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:28.249
 which is also picnik 

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:32.479
 the man who builds is the cost of dreams is a thing is a contradiction 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:35.529
 in proper terms d 

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:39.199
 but no words in time and I realized that 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.379
 one of the most difficult things 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:50.079
 here you are thinking of a building us people of fiesso a man omg a design 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.509
 love 

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:57.529
 oh master plan or then when i thought about it i look and say now i have to do it in 

00:03:57.529 --> 00:04:00.369
 a process I have to involve 

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:02.679
 countless people 

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:07.369
 because I don't do not I don't do it I have to have a client and the jars on 

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:10.299
 first. then I have to have 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.299
 of the engineers that the project no puede who we r 

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:17.499
 of the companies that build it the companies are made by men that everything 

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:19.279
 this process 

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:23.669
 it is a process that tries to achieve my dream physically 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:29.189
 some way of the dream to take more and more materials away from pope thought to arrive 

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:30.999
 then to build it 

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:33.330
 and the thing we learned the most 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.230
 I never go to the cam to see the finished buildings I'm not going marine 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:40.509
 I'm not going back there 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.969
 101 a kind of relationship 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:47.180
 jealousy is not known that its moment that when all this pc is you 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.370
 good your pablo designs and yours when it goes into the yard 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.569
 love to panic workers talk to people all together we do that 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:58.820
 that thing emilia in the sense that it also applies to the people who build it 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:01.379
 I love myself that day is over 

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:04.599
 and someone else's name takes someone else 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:09.099
 if it appropriates it, it becomes a foreigner, copied from what it is 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:13.339
 success for this gives me a certain jump entry cost I find must know 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.030
 I surrender to the buildings myself. because I'm going to talk about conferences with 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.960
 scientists and with politician halfway text talk to you about puffin that yes 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.830
 talk about energy no 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.500
 I go dressed in a viewfinder 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.500
 you are physically 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.870
 an architect who talks about energy what do football have to do with entering 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:37.969
 this is because buildings consume 50% of all energy ahead 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:42.960
 then produced when we talk about consumption we speak of sustainability of 

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:47.229
 done we are basically talking about the built world I never have 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:49.159
 thought 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:53.349
 that an architect can build ugly buildings to make the sea live there 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:56.639
 people who can glass that you can't enjoy creating some way 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.520
 condition of life as space 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.260
 it conditions the life of men I believe that even before if goods born in 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.349
 allows third floor 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:10.110
 it is true that space can condition the quality of space 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.719
 sports, quality of public space, however, become fundamental elements 

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:17.719
 I believe the change in these next few years 

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:21.409
 it will be just like in crm interpret the concept of 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:24.899
 sustainability when I talk about electricity feels the energy 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.240
 euro is a creative opportunity, that is, we will be able to do it through this theme 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.990
 arrives turn of the buildings new names and new ways with which to build nos 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:40.050
 difficult to live in our offices not even say this dictatorship is enough 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:45.069
 regard completed. totally unrelated to farming methods 

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:49.639
 in cultural contexts if a model can no longer be exported 

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:53.599
 of architecture that is the same all over the world but with this we have already done 

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:54.559
 enough damage
