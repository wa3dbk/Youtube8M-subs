00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
these are the rears these are the fronts

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.190 
these are the rears these are the fronts
the<00:00:47.129> Front's<00:00:47.579> that's<00:00:48.360> about<00:00:48.750> how<00:00:48.930> much<00:00:49.110> the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
the Front's that's about how much the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.020 
the Front's that's about how much the
tread<00:00:49.379> pattern<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.800> get<00:00:49.890> stock<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.760> might<00:00:50.940> be

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
tread pattern you get stock it might be

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.130 
tread pattern you get stock it might be
a<00:00:51.059> little<00:00:51.329> bit<00:00:51.449> less<00:00:51.600> on<00:00:51.780> there

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
a little bit less on there

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.200 
a little bit less on there
cuz<00:00:52.500> I've<00:00:52.590> run<00:00:52.739> quite<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.100> bit<00:00:53.309> but<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.910> I

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
cuz I've run quite a bit but this is I

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.959 
cuz I've run quite a bit but this is I
mean<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.260> I've<00:00:55.559> had<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.190> Jada<00:00:56.399> for<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> few

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
mean this is I've had the Jada for a few

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.479 
mean this is I've had the Jada for a few
months<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.500> the<00:00:58.500> tread<00:00:58.800> pattern<00:00:58.829> seems<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.430> be

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
months and the tread pattern seems to be

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.310 
months and the tread pattern seems to be
holding<00:00:59.609> up<00:00:59.760> pretty<00:00:59.820> well<00:01:00.090> all<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.539> spin<00:01:01.140> those

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
holding up pretty well all I spin those

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.189 
holding up pretty well all I spin those
top<00:01:01.590> spin<00:01:02.100> them<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.340> lot<00:01:02.489> though<00:01:03.019> so<00:01:04.019> yeah

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
top spin them a lot though so yeah

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.730 
top spin them a lot though so yeah
that's<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:05.150> life<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.570> I'm<00:01:06.960> gonna<00:01:07.260> predict<00:01:07.619> to

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
that's that life is I'm gonna predict to

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.469 
that's that life is I'm gonna predict to
be<00:01:07.830> really<00:01:08.070> good<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.250> am<00:01:08.430> really<00:01:08.760> run<00:01:09.270> through<00:01:09.450> a

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
be really good I am really run through a

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.230 
be really good I am really run through a
set<00:01:09.720> yet<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.460> yeah<00:01:11.810> that's<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:14.180> they<00:01:15.180> were

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
set yet so yeah that's that they were

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.160 
set yet so yeah that's that they were
all<00:01:15.390> pretty<00:01:15.509> nicely<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:17.030> their<00:01:18.030> stock<00:01:18.900> on<00:01:19.080> the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
all pretty nicely and their stock on the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.580 
all pretty nicely and their stock on the
GT<00:01:19.350> they<00:01:19.560> come<00:01:19.770> on<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.299> all-star<00:01:21.299> chrome<00:01:22.020> rims
