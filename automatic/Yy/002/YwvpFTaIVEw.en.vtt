hi guys today I'm going to be showing
you<00:00:20.160> this<00:00:20.340> prototype<00:00:20.850> sling<00:00:21.270> Expo<00:00:22.040> it<00:00:23.040> is<00:00:23.850> just

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
you this prototype sling Expo it is just

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.880 
you this prototype sling Expo it is just
a<00:00:24.150> prototype<00:00:24.540> so<00:00:25.080> it's<00:00:25.290> not<00:00:25.440> meant<00:00:25.620> to<00:00:25.650> look

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
a prototype so it's not meant to look

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.860 
a prototype so it's not meant to look
good<00:00:26.070> or<00:00:26.190> anything<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.760> it's<00:00:27.480> not<00:00:27.660> got<00:00:27.840> very

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:27.870 
good or anything and it's not got very

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
good or anything and it's not got very
strong<00:00:28.140> bonds<00:00:28.560> on<00:00:28.830> just<00:00:29.100> thera-band<00:00:29.370> black

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
strong bonds on just thera-band black

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.049 
strong bonds on just thera-band black
this<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:31.950> the<00:00:32.219> bolt<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.640> I'm<00:00:32.730> going<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:32.940> be

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
this is the bolt that I'm going to be

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.200 
this is the bolt that I'm going to be
shooting<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.660> made<00:00:34.230> out<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:35.280> thick<00:00:35.820> quite

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
shooting I made out of a thick quite

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.870 
shooting I made out of a thick quite
thick<00:00:36.510> piece<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.930> wooden<00:00:37.170> dowel<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:38.250> then<00:00:38.579> put

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:38.880 
thick piece of wooden dowel and then put

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.050 
thick piece of wooden dowel and then put
a<00:00:38.910> sharp<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.540> nail<00:00:39.750> on<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:39.960> end<00:00:40.550> so<00:00:41.550> with<00:00:41.880> the

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.060 
a sharp and nail on the end so with the

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.660 
a sharp and nail on the end so with the
trigger<00:00:42.270> mechanism<00:00:42.450> works<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.350> there's<00:00:44.130> this

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
trigger mechanism works is there's this

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.140 
trigger mechanism works is there's this
bit<00:00:44.970> of<00:00:45.560> this<00:00:46.560> bit<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.950> metal<00:00:47.310> here<00:00:47.640> which

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
bit of this bit of metal here which

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.630 
bit of this bit of metal here which
slides<00:00:48.630> into<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.200> barrel<00:00:49.560> layer<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.040> then

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
slides into the barrel layer and then

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.160 
slides into the barrel layer and then
when<00:00:50.850> it's<00:00:51.000> locked<00:00:51.270> all<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.570> way<00:00:51.690> up<00:00:51.840> its

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
when it's locked all the way up its

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.080 
when it's locked all the way up its
stopping<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.130> bolt<00:00:53.340> from<00:00:53.550> getting<00:00:53.880> all<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
stopping the bolt from getting all the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.550 
stopping the bolt from getting all the
way<00:00:54.180> out<00:00:54.329> because<00:00:54.540> it's<00:00:54.870> covering<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.290> up<00:00:55.380> you

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:55.560 
way out because it's covering it up you

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.799 
way out because it's covering it up you
can't<00:00:55.739> really<00:00:55.890> see<00:00:56.130> that<00:00:56.340> but<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.450> there

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
can't really see that but it is in there

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.450 
can't really see that but it is in there
and<00:00:58.050> then<00:00:58.410> when<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.649> pull<00:00:58.860> the<00:00:58.950> trigger<00:00:59.160> it

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
and then when you pull the trigger it

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.189 
and then when you pull the trigger it
pulls<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.450> down<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.430> then<00:01:02.450> mix<00:01:03.450> so<00:01:04.049> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
pulls that down and then mix so the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.289 
pulls that down and then mix so the
barrel<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.710> clear<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.309> then<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.850> bulk<00:01:06.030> can

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
barrel is clear and then the bulk can

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.830 
barrel is clear and then the bulk can
fly<00:01:06.659> straight<00:01:06.990> out<00:01:08.240> alright<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.810> how

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
fly straight out alright so this is how

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.110 
fly straight out alright so this is how
I'm<00:01:10.080> going<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.409> load<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.740> weapon<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.640> put<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
I'm going to load the weapon you put the

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.460 
I'm going to load the weapon you put the
thera-band<00:01:12.840> all<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.890> way<00:01:14.010> back<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.610> then<00:01:15.470> put

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
thera-band all the way back and then put

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.620 
thera-band all the way back and then put
the<00:01:16.560> bolt<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:17.030> pull<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.120> trigger<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.570> little

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
the bolt in pull the trigger a little

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.000 
the bolt in pull the trigger a little
bit<00:01:18.990> just<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.350> let<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.680> go<00:01:19.830> all<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.979> way

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
bit just to let it go all the way

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.760 
bit just to let it go all the way
forwards<00:01:20.930> then<00:01:22.010> you<00:01:23.010> put<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:24.060> string<00:01:24.770> just

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
forwards then you put this string just

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.789 
forwards then you put this string just
over<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.190> back<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.580> then<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.570> push<00:01:27.900> and

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
over the back of that then you push and

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.969 
over the back of that then you push and
keep<00:01:28.979> on<00:01:29.190> pushing

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
keep on pushing

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.889 
keep on pushing
and<00:01:31.549> then<00:01:31.700> you<00:01:31.820> need<00:01:31.939> to<00:01:32.000> pull<00:01:32.299> it<00:01:32.420> all<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.659> way

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
and then you need to pull it all the way

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.060 
and then you need to pull it all the way
back<00:01:34.329> until<00:01:35.329> the<00:01:35.570> trigger<00:01:35.840> mechanism<00:01:36.070> engages

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
back until the trigger mechanism engages

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.789 
back until the trigger mechanism engages
and<00:01:37.630> stops<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.810> ball<00:01:38.990> from<00:01:39.200> being<00:01:39.500> able<00:01:39.590> to

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
and stops the ball from being able to

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.749 
and stops the ball from being able to
get<00:01:39.950> out<00:01:40.039> the<00:01:40.159> front<00:01:40.780> then<00:01:41.780> you<00:01:42.140> point<00:01:42.829> it<00:01:43.009> and

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
get out the front then you point it and

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.149 
get out the front then you point it and
shoot<00:01:45.219> like<00:01:46.219> that<00:01:47.619> right<00:01:48.619> so<00:01:48.799> I'm<00:01:48.860> just<00:01:49.009> going

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
shoot like that right so I'm just going

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.590 
shoot like that right so I'm just going
to<00:01:49.189> test<00:01:49.369> it<00:01:49.549> against<00:01:49.759> this<00:01:49.939> thin<00:01:50.299> wooden

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
to test it against this thin wooden

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:58.810 
to test it against this thin wooden
board

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.780 

you

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.540 

now<00:02:02.660> it's<00:02:02.810> ready<00:02:03.050> to<00:02:03.080> fire

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.919 

the<00:02:08.550> ball<00:02:08.700> easily<00:02:08.910> penetrated<00:02:09.660> straight

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
the ball easily penetrated straight

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:18.680 
the ball easily penetrated straight
through<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.229> wooden<00:02:10.500> board

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.330 

one<00:02:19.690> of<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.840> problems<00:02:20.230> with<00:02:20.470> this<00:02:20.620> weapon<00:02:21.100> and

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
one of the problems with this weapon and

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.490 
one of the problems with this weapon and
the<00:02:21.550> reason<00:02:21.880> that<00:02:21.970> it's<00:02:22.150> only<00:02:22.510> a<00:02:22.630> prototype<00:02:22.930> is

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
the reason that it's only a prototype is

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.460 
the reason that it's only a prototype is
because<00:02:24.220> of<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:25.210> barrel<00:02:25.630> being<00:02:25.870> just<00:02:26.320> a

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
because of the barrel being just a

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.040 
because of the barrel being just a
circle<00:02:26.890> like<00:02:27.100> this<00:02:27.370> it<00:02:27.670> doesn't<00:02:27.940> have<00:02:28.150> room

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
circle like this it doesn't have room

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.310 
circle like this it doesn't have room
for<00:02:29.500> any<00:02:29.800> flights<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.910> be<00:02:31.060> on<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.600> bolt<00:02:31.990> so<00:02:32.230> it

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
for any flights to be on the bolt so it

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.810 
for any flights to be on the bolt so it
doesn't<00:02:32.590> really<00:02:32.680> fly<00:02:33.010> very<00:02:33.220> straight<00:02:33.670> I've

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
doesn't really fly very straight I've

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.630 
doesn't really fly very straight I've
done<00:02:34.000> my<00:02:34.150> best<00:02:34.300> to<00:02:34.510> make<00:02:34.660> it<00:02:34.840> top-heavy<00:02:35.220> by<00:02:36.220> I'm

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
done my best to make it top-heavy by I'm

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.870 
done my best to make it top-heavy by I'm
in<00:02:36.850> front<00:02:37.060> heavy<00:02:37.300> by<00:02:37.990> adding<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:39.280> bail<00:02:39.550> to<00:02:39.850> the

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
in front heavy by adding the bail to the

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.520 
in front heavy by adding the bail to the
front<00:02:40.210> also<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.600> give<00:02:40.780> it<00:02:40.900> more<00:02:41.020> penetration

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
front also to give it more penetration

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
front also to give it more penetration
but<00:02:42.310> it<00:02:42.460> still<00:02:42.670> doesn't<00:02:42.850> fly<00:02:43.120> very<00:02:43.180> straight

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
but it still doesn't fly very straight

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.420 
but it still doesn't fly very straight
also<00:02:45.550> the<00:02:45.730> trigger<00:02:46.000> mechanism<00:02:46.210> of<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:47.440> pistol

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
also the trigger mechanism of the pistol

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.850 
also the trigger mechanism of the pistol
is<00:02:48.640> rather<00:02:49.120> hard<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.600> pull<00:02:49.990> because<00:02:50.320> of<00:02:50.680> all

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
is rather hard to pull because of all

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.160 
is rather hard to pull because of all
the<00:02:51.010> weight<00:02:51.190> being<00:02:51.459> pushed<00:02:51.850> forwards<00:02:52.360> against

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
the weight being pushed forwards against

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.600 
the weight being pushed forwards against
the<00:02:53.350> trigger<00:02:53.620> and<00:02:53.890> means<00:02:54.100> that<00:02:54.220> there's<00:02:54.370> a<00:02:54.459> lot

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
the trigger and means that there's a lot

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.900 
the trigger and means that there's a lot
of<00:02:54.700> friction<00:02:54.910> when<00:02:55.300> you<00:02:55.330> pull<00:02:55.600> it<00:02:56.700> also<00:02:57.700> I<00:02:57.730> just

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
of friction when you pull it also I just

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.840 
of friction when you pull it also I just
received<00:02:58.510> my<00:02:58.660> order<00:02:59.020> for<00:02:59.520> some<00:03:00.520> thera-band

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
received my order for some thera-band

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.390 
received my order for some thera-band
gold<00:03:01.300> and<00:03:01.660> it's<00:03:01.900> finally<00:03:02.350> arrived<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:02.980> reason

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
gold and it's finally arrived the reason

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.920 
gold and it's finally arrived the reason
I<00:03:03.459> didn't<00:03:03.730> use<00:03:03.850> it<00:03:03.880> on<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.150> sling<00:03:04.360> Expo<00:03:04.780> is

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
I didn't use it on the sling Expo is

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.360 
I didn't use it on the sling Expo is
because<00:03:05.140> I<00:03:05.290> actually<00:03:05.410> made<00:03:05.830> it<00:03:05.860> before<00:03:06.130> the

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
because I actually made it before the

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.280 
because I actually made it before the
thera-band<00:03:06.610> gold<00:03:07.000> arrived<00:03:07.300> and<00:03:07.660> I'd<00:03:08.140> already

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
thera-band gold arrived and I'd already

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.230 
thera-band gold arrived and I'd already
bounded<00:03:08.740> it<00:03:08.830> up<00:03:08.920> with<00:03:09.130> thera-band<00:03:09.370> black<00:03:09.790> so<00:03:10.060> I

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
bounded it up with thera-band black so I

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.720 
bounded it up with thera-band black so I
decided<00:03:10.870> not<00:03:11.110> to<00:03:11.170> waste<00:03:11.470> a<00:03:11.680> good<00:03:11.709> grant<00:03:12.310> good

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
decided not to waste a good grant good

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.750 
decided not to waste a good grant good
set<00:03:12.910> of<00:03:13.000> buns<00:03:14.100> so<00:03:15.100> this<00:03:15.400> is<00:03:15.520> what<00:03:15.670> the

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
set of buns so this is what the

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.570 
set of buns so this is what the
thera-band<00:03:16.030> shoots<00:03:16.870> like<00:03:17.200> and<00:03:17.470> it's<00:03:18.250> quite

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
thera-band shoots like and it's quite

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.820 
thera-band shoots like and it's quite
tapered<00:03:19.090> but<00:03:19.209> not<00:03:19.360> very<00:03:19.540> tapered<00:03:20.080> and<00:03:20.260> I'm

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
tapered but not very tapered and I'm
