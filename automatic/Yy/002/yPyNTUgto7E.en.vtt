it<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.090> trigger<00:01:57.360> they<00:01:57.509> made<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:57.750> want<00:01:57.899> to

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
it the trigger they made you want to

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.249 
it the trigger they made you want to
move<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.320> New<00:01:58.350> Hampshire<00:01:58.710> Kevin<00:01:59.009> um<00:02:00.200> that's<00:02:01.200> a

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
move to New Hampshire Kevin um that's a

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.510 
move to New Hampshire Kevin um that's a
good<00:02:01.290> question<00:02:01.439> i<00:02:01.770> think<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:02.130> was<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
good question i think it was the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.539 
good question i think it was the
probably<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.299> Ron<00:02:03.450> Paul<00:02:03.479> campaign<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:04.549> so

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
probably the Ron Paul campaign and so

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.950 
probably the Ron Paul campaign and so
much<00:02:05.670> more<00:02:05.729> awareness<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.420> what<00:02:06.540> was<00:02:06.630> going<00:02:06.689> on

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
much more awareness of what was going on

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.460 
much more awareness of what was going on
in<00:02:07.020> other<00:02:07.560> states<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:09.080> some<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.259> people

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
in other states and some of the people

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.290 
in other states and some of the people
that<00:02:10.500> were<00:02:10.649> working<00:02:10.800> on<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.099> project

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
that were working on the project

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.440 
that were working on the project
decided<00:02:12.870> if<00:02:13.260> Ron<00:02:13.530> Paul<00:02:13.800> wasn't<00:02:14.670> didn't<00:02:15.330> make

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
decided if Ron Paul wasn't didn't make

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.790 
decided if Ron Paul wasn't didn't make
it<00:02:15.480> there<00:02:15.780> then<00:02:16.050> they<00:02:16.380> moved<00:02:16.620> in<00:02:16.710> New

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
it there then they moved in New

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.400 
it there then they moved in New
Hampshire<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.190> I<00:02:17.250> said<00:02:17.460> but<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:18.300> know<00:02:18.420> that

a long time it was just sort of came to
a<00:02:25.830> head<00:02:25.980> then<00:02:26.280> when<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:27.210> what's<00:02:27.420> your<00:02:27.540> take<00:02:27.690> on

a head then when I what's your take on
the<00:02:27.930> whole<00:02:28.050> Ron<00:02:28.590> Paul<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.130> situation<00:02:29.550> in<00:02:29.670> New

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
the whole Ron Paul the situation in New

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:30.890 
the whole Ron Paul the situation in New
Hampshire<00:02:30.000> cuz<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.150> lot<00:02:30.360> of<00:02:30.540> folks<00:02:30.690> say<00:02:30.810> they

Hampshire cuz a lot of folks say they

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.360 
Hampshire cuz a lot of folks say they
thought<00:02:31.080> he<00:02:31.170> showed<00:02:31.290> done<00:02:31.500> even<00:02:32.040> better<00:02:32.160> than

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
thought he showed done even better than

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.710 
thought he showed done even better than
a<00:02:32.460> personal<00:02:32.820> I<00:02:32.970> guess<00:02:33.120> that<00:02:33.270> was<00:02:33.390> one<00:02:33.420> of<00:02:33.630> the

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
a personal I guess that was one of the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.920 
a personal I guess that was one of the
best<00:02:33.930> showings<00:02:34.440> in<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.590> primary<00:02:35.660> you<00:02:36.660> feel<00:02:36.840> like

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
best showings in a primary you feel like

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.350 
best showings in a primary you feel like
you<00:02:36.990> did<00:02:37.020> well<00:02:37.260> enough<00:02:37.350> well<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.520> know<00:02:38.640> that<00:02:38.760> um

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
you did well enough well I know that um

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.550 
you did well enough well I know that um
in<00:02:39.800> Washtenaw<00:02:40.800> County<00:02:41.010> in<00:02:41.370> Michigan<00:02:41.850> where<00:02:42.270> he

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
in Washtenaw County in Michigan where he

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.950 
in Washtenaw County in Michigan where he
also<00:02:43.560> got<00:02:43.860> I<00:02:44.490> believe<00:02:45.000> six<00:02:45.180> percent<00:02:45.570> in

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
also got I believe six percent in

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.480 
also got I believe six percent in
Washington<00:02:46.410> County<00:02:46.530> where<00:02:46.800> we<00:02:46.890> campaign<00:02:47.250> for

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
Washington County where we campaign for

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.100 
Washington County where we campaign for
our<00:02:47.580> forum<00:02:48.000> he<00:02:48.150> got<00:02:48.330> eight<00:02:48.540> percent<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.050> in

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
our forum he got eight percent and in

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.810 
our forum he got eight percent and in
the<00:02:49.200> city<00:02:49.440> we<00:02:49.920> campaign<00:02:50.340> for<00:02:50.550> him<00:02:50.640> he<00:02:50.700> got

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
the city we campaign for him he got

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.850 
the city we campaign for him he got
twenty<00:02:51.120> five<00:02:51.270> percent<00:02:51.300> so<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:51.840> think<00:02:51.900> there's<00:02:52.770> a

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
twenty five percent so I think there's a

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.210 
twenty five percent so I think there's a
sort<00:02:53.280> of<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.430> massive<00:02:53.850> effort<00:02:54.830> things<00:02:55.830> could

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
sort of a massive effort things could

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.610 
sort of a massive effort things could
have<00:02:56.310> been<00:02:56.340> better<00:02:56.580> organized<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.480> I<00:02:57.660> think

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
have been better organized and I think

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.450 
have been better organized and I think
there<00:02:58.740> are<00:02:58.800> a<00:02:58.830> lot<00:02:58.920> of<00:02:58.950> people<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.340> just

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
there are a lot of people that just

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.070 
there are a lot of people that just
thought<00:02:59.730> that<00:02:59.970> he<00:03:00.510> wasn't<00:03:00.660> going<00:03:00.840> to<00:03:00.930> make<00:03:01.020> it

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
thought that he wasn't going to make it

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.420 
thought that he wasn't going to make it
so<00:03:01.320> they're<00:03:01.470> going<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:01.680> vote<00:03:01.740> for<00:03:01.860> whoever

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
so they're going to vote for whoever

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.490 
so they're going to vote for whoever
they<00:03:02.670> perceive<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.090> be<00:03:03.240> the<00:03:03.450> more<00:03:04.140> likely

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
they perceive to be the more likely

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.040 
they perceive to be the more likely
candidate<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.550> more<00:03:05.730> moderate<00:03:06.030> now<00:03:06.870> it's

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
candidate the more moderate now it's

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.360 
candidate the more moderate now it's
you're<00:03:07.170> into<00:03:07.380> state<00:03:07.650> in<00:03:07.830> India<00:03:08.100> Hampshire

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
you're into state in India Hampshire

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.310 
you're into state in India Hampshire
what's<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.790> type<00:03:09.000> of<00:03:09.030> Liberty<00:03:09.780> activism<00:03:10.170> that

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
what's the type of Liberty activism that

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.620 
what's the type of Liberty activism that
you're<00:03:10.590> most<00:03:10.740> drawn<00:03:11.160> toward<00:03:11.520> well<00:03:12.240> I<00:03:12.450> think

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
you're most drawn toward well I think

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.500 
you're most drawn toward well I think
probably<00:03:13.350> what<00:03:14.310> I<00:03:14.340> would<00:03:14.430> really<00:03:14.880> like<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.300> see

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
probably what I would really like to see

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.120 
probably what I would really like to see
in<00:03:15.810> New<00:03:15.990> Hampshire<00:03:16.320> and<00:03:16.470> I<00:03:16.560> don't<00:03:16.920> know<00:03:17.010> how

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
in New Hampshire and I don't know how

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.949 
in New Hampshire and I don't know how
difficult<00:03:17.340> this<00:03:17.640> is<00:03:17.700> going<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.000> be<00:03:18.120> but<00:03:18.930> I

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
difficult this is going to be but I

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.479 
difficult this is going to be but I
understand<00:03:19.350> it's<00:03:19.440> very<00:03:19.709> difficult<00:03:19.890> I<00:03:20.250> would

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
understand it's very difficult I would

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:21.680 
understand it's very difficult I would
like<00:03:20.610> to<00:03:20.640> see<00:03:20.850> a<00:03:20.880> referendum<00:03:21.360> process

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
like to see a referendum process

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.600 
like to see a referendum process
developed<00:03:22.470> in<00:03:22.620> New<00:03:22.709> Hampshire<00:03:23.100> because<00:03:23.280> it

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
developed in New Hampshire because it

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.790 
developed in New Hampshire because it
allows<00:03:23.850> you<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.300> get<00:03:24.570> rid<00:03:24.720> of<00:03:24.780> bad<00:03:25.020> laws<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.590> to

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
allows you to get rid of bad laws and to

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.050 
allows you to get rid of bad laws and to
