00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
they don't have that feature I mean I

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.920 
they don't have that feature I mean I
didn't<00:02:20.370> see<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.640> mission<00:02:20.820> once<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:21.600> went<00:02:21.750> back

didn't see the mission once I went back

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.570 
didn't see the mission once I went back
to<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.140> moon<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.470> tried<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:23.010> look<00:02:23.160> for<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.460> it

to the moon and tried to look for it it

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.430 
to the moon and tried to look for it it
wasn't<00:02:23.790> there<00:02:24.060> so<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:24.540> don't<00:02:25.050> think<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.350> can

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
wasn't there so I don't think you can

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.990 
wasn't there so I don't think you can
actually<00:02:25.620> replay<00:02:26.070> this<00:02:26.220> mission<00:02:26.550> until<00:02:26.790> the

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
bounty shows up again and when the

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.590 
bounty shows up again and when the
bounding<00:02:29.460> shows<00:02:29.610> up<00:02:29.760> again<00:02:29.880> I<00:02:30.180> don't<00:02:30.420> think

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
bounding shows up again I don't think

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.550 
bounding shows up again I don't think
you're<00:02:30.660> actually<00:02:30.840> going<00:02:31.050> to<00:02:31.140> get<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.290> treasure

added<00:03:08.100> in<00:03:08.250> where<00:03:08.520> it<00:03:08.640> takes<00:03:08.790> us<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.180> whole

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
added in where it takes us to a whole

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.750 
added in where it takes us to a whole
different<00:03:09.510> type<00:03:10.440> of<00:03:10.500> area<00:03:10.830> like<00:03:11.340> when<00:03:11.520> we<00:03:11.580> go

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
different type of area like when we go

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.070 
different type of area like when we go
to<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:12.090> certain<00:03:12.360> plane<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:12.720> I'm<00:03:12.810> not<00:03:12.959> saying

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
to the certain plane and I'm not saying

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.900 
to the certain plane and I'm not saying
a<00:03:13.260> whole<00:03:13.290> different<00:03:13.800> new<00:03:13.890> planet<00:03:14.370> I'm<00:03:14.640> saying

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
a whole different new planet I'm saying

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.790 
a whole different new planet I'm saying
when<00:03:15.030> we<00:03:15.120> go<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.270> the<00:03:15.480> certain<00:03:15.810> area<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.380> when

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
when we go to the certain area and when

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.870 
when we go to the certain area and when
we<00:03:16.890> go<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.280> mission<00:03:17.610> it's<00:03:17.730> like<00:03:17.850> a

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
we go to the mission it's like a

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.210 
we go to the mission it's like a
completely<00:03:18.600> different<00:03:18.750> new<00:03:19.410> area<00:03:19.980> that<00:03:20.160> would

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
completely different new area that would

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.830 
completely different new area that would
be<00:03:20.340> awesome<00:03:20.459> but<00:03:20.850> I<00:03:21.030> doubt<00:03:21.090> that<00:03:21.390> actually

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
be awesome but I doubt that actually

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.300 
be awesome but I doubt that actually
happened<00:03:22.140> but<00:03:22.260> hopefully<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.709> developers<00:03:23.130> do

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
happened but hopefully the developers do

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.520 
happened but hopefully the developers do
decide<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.940> add<00:03:24.120> in<00:03:24.330> some<00:03:24.570> requests<00:03:25.080> like<00:03:25.230> this

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
decide to add in some requests like this

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.380 
decide to add in some requests like this
because<00:03:25.799> I'm<00:03:25.980> not<00:03:26.640> gonna<00:03:26.730> lie<00:03:26.970> actually

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
literally everything in this area you

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.080 
literally everything in this area you
can<00:03:43.440> annihilate<00:03:43.769> with<00:03:44.160> this<00:03:44.310> turret<00:03:44.760> but<00:03:45.000> you

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
can annihilate with this turret but you

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.699 
can annihilate with this turret but you
have<00:03:45.180> to<00:03:45.299> keep<00:03:45.420> like<00:03:45.630> a<00:03:45.660> burst<00:03:46.019> fire<00:03:46.320> because

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
have to keep like a burst fire because

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.009 
have to keep like a burst fire because
this<00:03:46.890> can<00:03:47.130> overheat<00:03:47.670> so<00:03:48.180> watch<00:03:48.390> how<00:03:48.420> long<00:03:48.840> you

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
this can overheat so watch how long you

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.229 
this can overheat so watch how long you
actually<00:03:49.350> shoot<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:50.040> bullets<00:03:50.400> but<00:03:50.820> ernet

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
actually shoot the bullets but ernet

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.729 
actually shoot the bullets but ernet
this<00:03:51.450> turret<00:03:51.720> works<00:03:51.900> great<00:03:52.170> and<00:03:52.290> if<00:03:52.410> you<00:03:52.500> start

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
this turret works great and if you start

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.320 
this turret works great and if you start
to<00:03:52.769> get<00:03:52.920> low<00:03:53.100> on<00:03:53.130> health<00:03:53.370> I<00:03:53.670> just<00:03:53.880> hop<00:03:54.060> off<00:03:54.269> the

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
to get low on health I just hop off the

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.780 
to get low on health I just hop off the
turret<00:03:54.660> wait<00:03:55.320> till<00:03:55.500> I<00:03:55.860> regenerate<00:03:56.430> and<00:03:56.519> I<00:03:56.610> get

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
turret wait till I regenerate and I get

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.460

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
enemies and whatnot but then I just hop

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.940 
enemies and whatnot but then I just hop

right back on that turd and I go back to
Massacre<00:04:02.580> animal<00:04:02.940> but<00:04:03.150> after<00:04:03.390> that<00:04:03.510> you<00:04:03.660> play
