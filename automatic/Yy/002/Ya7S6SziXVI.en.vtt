00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
assume to strafe side to side of inst

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.760 
assume to strafe side to side of inst
your<00:00:59.640> enemies<00:00:59.940> but<00:01:00.239> it's<00:01:00.930> really<00:01:01.350> up<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.590> you

um<00:01:02.149> the<00:01:03.149> one<00:01:03.300> thing<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.570> noticed<00:01:03.899> with<00:01:04.049> fast<00:01:04.350> mag

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
um the one thing I noticed with fast mag

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.620 
um the one thing I noticed with fast mag
is<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.070> clips<00:01:05.309> only<00:01:05.580> 30<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.210> does<00:01:06.360> shoot

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
is the clips only 30 and it does shoot

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.050 
is the clips only 30 and it does shoot
semi<00:01:07.080> fast<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.650> do<00:01:08.130> run<00:01:08.490> out<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.700> bullets

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
semi fast so you do run out of bullets

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.210 
semi fast so you do run out of bullets
quite<00:01:09.479> quickly<00:01:09.810> but<00:01:10.560> that's<00:01:10.830> why<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.010> have

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
quite quickly but that's why I have

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.250 
quite quickly but that's why I have
scavenger<00:01:11.729> on<00:01:11.820> because<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.840> can<00:01:12.990> pick<00:01:13.140> up

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
scavenger on because you can pick up

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.230 
scavenger on because you can pick up
those<00:01:13.409> extra<00:01:14.040> packs<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.580> easily<00:01:14.939> get<00:01:15.090> that

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
those extra packs and easily get that

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.810 
those extra packs and easily get that
extra<00:01:15.509> ammo<00:01:15.780> but<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.470> also<00:01:16.950> advise<00:01:17.340> if<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.729> ever

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
extra ammo but I also advise if you ever

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.820 
extra ammo but I also advise if you ever
running<00:01:18.090> around<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.540> you'd<00:01:18.659> use<00:01:18.869> managed<00:01:19.680> to

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
running around and you'd use managed to

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.200 
running around and you'd use managed to
see<00:01:19.979> another<00:01:20.189> weapon<00:01:20.430> on<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.790> ground<00:01:20.820> feel

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
see another weapon on the ground feel

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.730 
see another weapon on the ground feel
free<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.479> pick<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.750> up<00:01:21.810> too<00:01:22.080> just<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.680> case

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
free to pick that up too just in case

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.980 
free to pick that up too just in case
because<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.880> weapon<00:01:24.270> does<00:01:24.450> run<00:01:24.630> out<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.750> ammo

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
because this weapon does run out of ammo

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.370 
because this weapon does run out of ammo
quite<00:01:25.350> quickly<00:01:26.180> not<00:01:27.180> too<00:01:27.390> sure<00:01:27.600> why<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:27.930> is

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
quite quickly not too sure why that is

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.660 
quite quickly not too sure why that is
but<00:01:28.680> maybe<00:01:28.950> it's<00:01:29.159> just<00:01:29.220> because<00:01:29.369> I've<00:01:29.640> been

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
but maybe it's just because I've been

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.580 
but maybe it's just because I've been
getting<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.270> many<00:01:30.420> kills<00:01:30.720> without<00:01:30.869> dying<00:01:31.079> with

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
getting so many kills without dying with

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.679 
getting so many kills without dying with
it<00:01:31.740> um<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.280> got<00:01:33.380> 134<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.500> won<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:35.040> game<00:01:35.159> and

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
it um I got 134 and won this game and

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.830 
it um I got 134 and won this game and
this<00:01:36.689> was<00:01:36.900> probably<00:01:37.140> my<00:01:37.650> highest<00:01:38.150> KD<00:01:39.150> game<00:01:39.630> I

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.560 
this was probably my highest KD game I
guess<00:01:39.900> um<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:41.100> haven't<00:01:41.880> really<00:01:42.090> been<00:01:42.329> trying

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
guess um I haven't really been trying

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.240 
guess um I haven't really been trying
because<00:01:42.869> I've<00:01:43.049> been<00:01:43.079> rushing<00:01:43.470> around<00:01:43.740> too

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
because I've been rushing around too

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.889 
because I've been rushing around too
much<00:01:44.430> but<00:01:44.759> I've<00:01:44.939> been<00:01:45.090> getting<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.509> little<00:01:45.689> bit

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
much but I've been getting a little bit

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.249 
much but I've been getting a little bit
more<00:01:46.020> passively<00:01:46.649> I'm<00:01:47.520> still<00:01:47.790> like<00:01:47.970> playing

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
more passively I'm still like playing

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.679 
more passively I'm still like playing
aggressive<00:01:49.259> but<00:01:49.560> it's<00:01:50.340> still<00:01:50.640> like<00:01:50.909> what<00:01:51.600> I'm

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
aggressive but it's still like what I'm

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.100 
aggressive but it's still like what I'm
close<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.930> my<00:01:52.170> streaks<00:01:52.590> when<00:01:53.399> when<00:01:54.240> when<00:01:54.780> stuff

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
close to my streaks when when when stuff

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.990 
close to my streaks when when when stuff
really<00:01:55.409> matters<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.130> one<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.340> actually<00:01:56.430> start

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
really matters is one I actually start

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.289 
really matters is one I actually start
caring<00:01:58.369> basically<00:01:59.369> if<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.820> died<00:01:59.880> a<00:02:00.000> couple

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
caring basically if I died a couple

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.940 
caring basically if I died a couple
times<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.899> beginning<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.290> just<00:02:01.530> know<00:02:01.649> that

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
times in the beginning I just know that

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.670 
times in the beginning I just know that
this<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.430> just<00:02:02.579> win<00:02:02.909> game<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.210> not<00:02:03.680> gameplay

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
this is just win game and not gameplay

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.980 
this is just win game and not gameplay
game<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.100> guess<00:02:05.159> because<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:06.570> got<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.810> have<00:02:06.960> a

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
game I guess because you got to have a

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.290 
game I guess because you got to have a
perfect<00:02:07.259> start<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.860> got<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.129> have<00:02:08.280> it's<00:02:09.030> just

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
perfect start you got to have it's just

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.550 
perfect start you got to have it's just
a<00:02:09.420> perfect<00:02:09.840> way<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.229> go<00:02:10.920> with<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.220> game<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.760> get

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
a perfect way to go with the game to get

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.949 
a perfect way to go with the game to get
really<00:02:12.920> high<00:02:13.069> gameplay<00:02:13.580> um<00:02:13.790> I'm<00:02:14.420> still<00:02:14.720> on<00:02:14.840> the

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
really high gameplay um I'm still on the

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.990 
really high gameplay um I'm still on the
road<00:02:15.110> to<00:02:15.319> a<00:02:15.349> 200<00:02:15.800> plus<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.220> I<00:02:16.280> think<00:02:16.610> this<00:02:16.790> is

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
road to a 200 plus and I think this is

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.900 
road to a 200 plus and I think this is
the<00:02:17.120> weapon<00:02:17.420> that's<00:02:17.540> going<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.750> do<00:02:17.900> it<00:02:18.050> for<00:02:18.230> me

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
the weapon that's going to do it for me

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.940 
the weapon that's going to do it for me
I've<00:02:19.910> been<00:02:20.180> playing<00:02:20.420> multi<00:02:20.870> team<00:02:21.080> with<00:02:21.920> a

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
I've been playing multi team with a

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.860 
I've been playing multi team with a
couple<00:02:22.340> buddies<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.910> we<00:02:23.569> have<00:02:23.690> just

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.960 
couple buddies and we have just
absolutely<00:02:24.349> been<00:02:24.560> destroying<00:02:25.099> as<00:02:25.700> you<00:02:25.819> can

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
absolutely been destroying as you can

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.860 
absolutely been destroying as you can

see I end up getting my dog swarm and
lodestar<00:02:29.870> here<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:30.290> I<00:02:30.769> call<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:31.099> in<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:31.400> I'm

lodestar here and I call it in and I'm
getting<00:02:31.849> another<00:02:32.180> one<00:02:32.390> like<00:02:32.599> to<00:02:32.870> like<00:02:33.620> just

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
getting another one like to like just

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.650 
getting another one like to like just
shortly<00:02:34.340> after<00:02:34.760> it<00:02:34.910> which<00:02:35.480> is<00:02:35.630> just

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
shortly after it which is just

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.410 
shortly after it which is just
absolutely<00:02:36.080> insane<00:02:36.739> because<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.970> playlist

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
absolutely insane because the playlist

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.780 
absolutely insane because the playlist
only<00:02:38.630> has<00:02:38.750> six<00:02:39.050> other<00:02:39.230> opponents<00:02:39.920> and<00:02:40.069> for<00:02:40.700> you

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
only has six other opponents and for you

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.220 
only has six other opponents and for you
to<00:02:40.910> get<00:02:41.030> your<00:02:41.150> streaks<00:02:41.510> that<00:02:41.690> fast<00:02:41.989> is

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
to get your streaks that fast is

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.280 
to get your streaks that fast is
absolutely<00:02:42.739> ridiculous<00:02:42.860> but<00:02:43.989> 200<00:02:44.989> pluses

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
absolutely ridiculous but 200 pluses

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.110 
absolutely ridiculous but 200 pluses
have<00:02:45.470> been<00:02:45.709> done<00:02:45.920> on<00:02:45.950> multi<00:02:46.340> team<00:02:46.519> so<00:02:46.850> I<00:02:46.880> think

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
have been done on multi team so I think

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.240 
have been done on multi team so I think
this<00:02:47.450> may<00:02:47.870> be<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:48.200> playlist<00:02:48.590> I'm<00:02:48.709> doing<00:02:49.010> it<00:02:49.130> in

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
this may be the playlist I'm doing it in

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.539 
this may be the playlist I'm doing it in
I'm<00:02:49.519> not<00:02:50.090> too<00:02:50.299> sure<00:02:50.799> teammates<00:02:51.799> still<00:02:52.069> do<00:02:52.250> quit

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
I'm not too sure teammates still do quit

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.880 
I'm not too sure teammates still do quit
a<00:02:52.580> lot<00:02:52.819> though<00:02:53.030> that's<00:02:53.269> the<00:02:53.450> major<00:02:53.959> issue<00:02:54.319> one

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
a lot though that's the major issue one

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.210 
a lot though that's the major issue one
xbox<00:02:55.819> i<00:02:56.030> think<00:02:56.330> is<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:57.140> fact<00:02:57.410> that<00:02:57.500> every

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
xbox i think is the fact that every

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.009 
xbox i think is the fact that every
single<00:02:58.370> time<00:02:58.670> you<00:02:58.700> end<00:02:59.060> up<00:02:59.150> doing<00:02:59.390> good<00:02:59.599> or<00:02:59.870> the

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
single time you end up doing good or the

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.860 
single time you end up doing good or the
load<00:03:00.230> stock<00:03:00.530> gets<00:03:00.769> in<00:03:00.950> or<00:03:01.190> dogs<00:03:01.610> come<00:03:01.910> in<00:03:01.940> the

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
load stock gets in or dogs come in the

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.380 
load stock gets in or dogs come in the
they<00:03:03.230> just<00:03:03.410> quit<00:03:03.560> it<00:03:03.920> I<00:03:04.250> never<00:03:04.910> really<00:03:05.239> had<00:03:05.269> the

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390
