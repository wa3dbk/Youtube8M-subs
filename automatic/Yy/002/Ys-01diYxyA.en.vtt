and then you

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.410 
and then you
can<00:02:13.590> pick<00:02:13.800> it<00:02:13.920> up<00:02:14.010> again<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.460> bring<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.300> more

up<00:02:15.630> but<00:02:16.560> first<00:02:16.740> he<00:02:16.950> needs<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.280> relax<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.730> little

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.450 
up but first he needs to relax a little
bit<00:02:18.030> more<00:02:18.240> there<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.690> really<00:02:19.350> gives<00:02:20.100> in<00:02:20.280> that

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
bit more there and really gives in that

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
bit more there and really gives in that

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
think okay it was not good enough but

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.110 
think okay it was not good enough but
okay<00:02:37.320> really<00:02:37.830> every<00:02:38.250> time<00:02:38.280> you<00:02:38.580> do<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:38.760> she

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120
