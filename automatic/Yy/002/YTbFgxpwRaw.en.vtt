00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
possibly could and I have so many more

feelings about these books and they

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.110 
feelings about these books and they
definitely<00:04:40.650> don't<00:04:41.070> just<00:04:41.670> stay<00:04:41.880> in<00:04:41.910> that

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
definitely don't just stay in that

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.970 
definitely don't just stay in that
category<00:04:42.780> the<00:04:42.900> majority<00:04:43.410> of<00:04:43.440> them<00:04:43.680> are<00:04:43.830> over

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
category the majority of them are over

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.710 
category the majority of them are over
so<00:04:44.280> many<00:04:44.520> categories<00:04:44.850> which<00:04:45.300> basically

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
so many categories which basically

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.380 
so many categories which basically
proves<00:04:46.140> the<00:04:46.620> point<00:04:46.890> of<00:04:47.100> this<00:04:47.250> video<00:04:47.550> is<00:04:47.730> that

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
proves the point of this video is that

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.750 
proves the point of this video is that
why<00:04:48.660> a<00:04:48.690> is<00:04:49.320> pretty<00:04:49.830> darn<00:04:50.190> good

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
why a is pretty darn good

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.820 
why a is pretty darn good
so<00:04:50.940> what<00:04:51.120> why<00:04:51.330> a<00:04:51.360> books<00:04:51.810> made<00:04:52.080> you<00:04:52.350> think<00:04:52.590> of

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
so what why a books made you think of

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.100 
so what why a books made you think of
some<00:04:53.190> slightly<00:04:53.490> harder<00:04:54.060> and<00:04:54.300> bigger<00:04:54.540> issues

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
some slightly harder and bigger issues
