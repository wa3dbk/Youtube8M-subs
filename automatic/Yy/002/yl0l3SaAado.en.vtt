tried several emails we I actually have

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.700 
tried several emails we I actually have
a<00:00:29.099> context<00:00:29.609> locally<00:00:30.330> here<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.869> works<00:00:31.439> very

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
a context locally here that works very

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.920 
a context locally here that works very
closely<00:00:31.890> with<00:00:32.130> them<00:00:32.340> have<00:00:33.180> not<00:00:33.450> been<00:00:33.660> able<00:00:33.780> to

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
closely with them have not been able to

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.350 
closely with them have not been able to
make<00:00:34.140> any<00:00:34.320> headway<00:00:34.469> on<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:34.980> yet<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:36.239> don't

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
make any headway on that yet so I don't

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.650 
make any headway on that yet so I don't
know<00:00:36.510> if<00:00:37.020> I'm<00:00:37.200> going<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.559> be<00:00:37.770> able<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.100> or<00:00:38.250> not

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
know if I'm going to be able to or not

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.180 
know if I'm going to be able to or not
but<00:00:39.660> I'm<00:00:39.750> going<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:40.260> keep<00:00:40.350> trying<00:00:40.559> on<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.010> so

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
but I'm going to keep trying on that so

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.319 
but I'm going to keep trying on that so
there's<00:00:41.309> no<00:00:41.460> sales<00:00:41.700> update<00:00:42.030> or<00:00:42.120> anything<00:00:42.300> like

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
there's no sales update or anything like

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.600 
there's no sales update or anything like
that<00:00:42.450> or<00:00:42.629> or<00:00:43.379> progress<00:00:43.829> update<00:00:44.190> i<00:00:44.219> should<00:00:44.460> say

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
that or or progress update i should say

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.720 
that or or progress update i should say
on<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.379> the<00:00:46.379> clock<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.860> still<00:00:47.190> here<00:00:47.399> with<00:00:47.550> me

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
on that the clock is still here with me

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.299 
on that the clock is still here with me
and<00:00:48.440> I'll<00:00:49.440> probably<00:00:49.649> actually<00:00:49.920> end<00:00:50.250> up

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
and I'll probably actually end up

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.740 
and I'll probably actually end up
listing<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.760> with<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.969> next<00:00:51.090> week<00:00:51.480> or<00:00:51.629> two

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
listing that with the next week or two

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.410 
listing that with the next week or two
or<00:00:51.899> something<00:00:52.079> like<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.969> so<00:00:53.969> no<00:00:54.210> sales

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
or something like that so no sales

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.660 
or something like that so no sales
update<00:00:54.719> on<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:54.870> either<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:55.860> on<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.399> item

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670

bucks<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:31.320> a<00:03:31.500> lot<00:03:31.910> which<00:03:32.910> I<00:03:33.030> don't<00:03:33.090> think<00:03:33.270> I

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
bucks a a lot which I don't think I

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.300 
bucks a a lot which I don't think I
should<00:03:33.480> have<00:03:33.720> trouble<00:03:34.050> doing<00:03:34.170> and<00:03:35.160> then

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
should have trouble doing and then

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.190 
should have trouble doing and then
