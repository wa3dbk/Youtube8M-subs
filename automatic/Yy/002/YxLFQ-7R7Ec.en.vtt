00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.850
 do not 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.710
 hello today we are going to learn to 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.210
 make a book separator if you want 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.189
 know how it is done 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.060
 let's start the materials that 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:23.720
 we will need a sheet 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:28.689
 parchment or butter 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:32.079
 some impressions images that you like 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:35.100
 scriptures that catch your attention 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:38.239
 a cardboard cardboard 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.239
 a rule 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:47.210
 paintings of leds with which you prefer 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.210
 Brush 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.450
 scissors 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.820
 water and white glue 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.920
 now then we are going to use the 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.780
 I wait and the butter leaf which 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.739
 let's cut the size you want 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.990
 that is your free separator and what 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.170
 we're going to do is trace the whole part of 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.940
 the writing with the spheroid in this case 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.680
 I teach a pen because I did not have 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.270
 a micro tip but in a micro tip 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.200
 they are also very good at work 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.200
 this kind of things 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.560
 this is how we have stayed in this 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.540
 moment then when we cut the 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.000
 butter paper or parchment paper 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.960
 we should leave well on the banks 1 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.960
 centimeter wide 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.190
 when we finish doing all the 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.980
 margins let's cut the edges 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.660
 and let's take the measure of our 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.790
 book separator in the carton 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.790
 cardboard and we are going to cut it 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.990
 now let's cut out the images 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.260
 that we decided to put in our separator 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.260
 from books 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:39.640
 since we have it trimmed 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:43.180
 let's paint one of the two cartons 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.790
 that we have cut previously 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.680
 one of these is going to be used in the 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.409
 front and the other air in the part of 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.750
 back the one that goes in the front 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:54.609
 is the one that is going to be painted in this case 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.620
 I used paints that are diluted in water 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:03:00.420
 because I like it to look like this with a 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.420
 different effect 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.060
 we will let it dry and meanwhile 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.299
 we can make this accessory that is a 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.540
 taste of each person in this case I 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:17.360
 I used wool color who prefer to 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.099
 I like this coral and in a thread greg 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.769
 He cited although it can be done with the same 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:23.330
 wool then let's catch the tip of 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.720
 the money 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:30.610
 and we will need a fork where 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.610
 let's start rolling the wool 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:38.970
 several laps already when we have all the 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.390
 wool rolled on the fork we are going to 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.909
 catch the thread and we're going to tie it up 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.340
 all the center to leave it as if 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:50.959
 we were going to tighten it very very 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.959
 well this way 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.579
 since we have tightened our 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.440
 knot let's remove one of the threads and 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:19.049
 Now what are we going to do with the 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.570
 scissors is that we're going to cut very 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.090
 carefully the edges of our 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.740
 chignon there I apologize because the 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.960
 He does not really ask me how it was that he was 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.970
 recording 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.389
 I think you can see a little what 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.389
 I'm doing 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.110
 and the idea is to cut all the 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.169
 corners of our bun so that 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.630
 are loose or that the wool that 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:45.110
 only in the policies of the wool and we go 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.360
 to go accommodating in the tufts 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:51.380
 so now that we have everything 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:54.500
 clipped let's start rolling it 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.840
 or is combing it so that it starts 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.050
 look like a ball and we 're going to 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.350
 start pairing with scissors like this 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.350
 in this way 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:14.940
 since we have our pompom ready 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:18.060
 What we are going to do is take the cardboard 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.990
 we have already painted and we are going to paste the 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.990
 image that we liked 

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:36.779
 since we have it stuck what we're going to 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:39.269
 do is take the parchment paper and 

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:41.650
 let's start bending the tips very 

00:05:39.269 --> 00:05:45.510
 gently 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:49.200
 and that is straight to the cardboard 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:51.600
 in this way for this job I 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.580
 he liked more to handle the parchment paper than 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:57.120
 butter paper since the paper 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:06:00.360
 butter what it does is that it leaves 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.920
 very ugly wrinkles and is thinner than 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.680
 the parchment paper then for 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:07.280
 ease of handling I decided to use this 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.280
 type of paper 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:25.300
 in this way we should have stayed and 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:28.719
 Now what we're going to do is we're going 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.580
 to take the white glue and we 're going to 

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:33.490
 Spread on all edges of the paper 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:36.159
 parchment so that it sticks to the 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:39.330
 Cardboard cardboard and let's also take 

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:42.969
 the other cardboard to stick it on this 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:46.560
 let's take the marshmallow we did and what 

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:50.370
 We will place between the two cartons 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.370
 that is centered 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.479
 since we have it stuck we have finished 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:59.310
 our work 

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:02.550
 These are several designs of which 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:05.340
 I did and they seemed very nice to me instead 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:08.460
 of using the pompom I also used a type of 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:10.310
 I said gold and a thread called tail 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.020
 of mouse 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.420
 I hope you liked this idea 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.730
 quite as well as to me do not forget 

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:18.850
 subscribe and see you in a next 

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:18.850
 chance
