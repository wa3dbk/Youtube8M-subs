or<00:02:05.600> you<00:02:05.870> know<00:02:05.900> too<00:02:06.230> much<00:02:06.410> of<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.370> car<00:02:07.550> being

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
or you know too much of the car being

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.880 
or you know too much of the car being
standardized<00:02:08.479> is<00:02:08.750> not<00:02:09.140> for<00:02:09.380> me<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.619> one<00:02:09.740> that

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
standardized is not for me the one that

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.700 
standardized is not for me the one that
basically<00:02:10.130> changes<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.780> whole<00:02:11.810> feeling<00:02:12.620> of

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
basically changes the whole feeling of

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.500 
basically changes the whole feeling of
what<00:02:12.920> for<00:02:13.160> money<00:02:13.460> is<00:02:13.670> in<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:14.060> history<00:02:14.480> of

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
what for money is in the history of

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.840 
what for money is in the history of
Formula<00:02:15.020> One<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.560> I<00:02:15.710> think<00:02:16.010> that<00:02:16.250> in<00:02:16.670> this

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
Formula One and I think that in this

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.150 
Formula One and I think that in this
world<00:02:16.910> you<00:02:17.300> know<00:02:17.420> despite<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:18.080> credit<00:02:18.710> crisis

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
world you know despite the credit crisis

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.770

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
i mean let's start with Bernie's you

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.190 
i mean let's start with Bernie's you
know<00:04:43.460> I<00:04:43.610> think<00:04:43.730> it<00:04:43.970> was<00:04:44.060> about<00:04:44.210> 48<00:04:44.840> million

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
know I think it was about 48 million

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.620 
know I think it was about 48 million
dollars<00:04:45.710> or<00:04:45.890> 48<00:04:46.310> million<00:04:46.520> pen<00:04:46.820> to<00:04:47.090> enter<00:04:47.360> a

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630
