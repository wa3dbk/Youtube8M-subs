the foot of the dam was tested under

the foot of the dam was tested under

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.500 

and<00:01:34.750> so<00:01:35.710> this<00:01:35.980> spectacular<00:01:36.460> site<00:01:36.940> will<00:01:37.210> rarely

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:47.639 
and so this spectacular site will rarely

but<00:01:48.649> it<00:01:48.799> is<00:01:48.920> a<00:01:48.950> reminder<00:01:49.310> of<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:49.909> huge<00:01:50.390> power

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
but it is a reminder of the huge power
