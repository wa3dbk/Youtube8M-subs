the reason these errors come up is

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.340 
the reason these errors come up is
because<00:01:34.829> they're<00:01:35.310> referencing<00:01:36.200> classes<00:01:37.200> and

because they're referencing classes and

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
let Eclipse know about them so that it

may notice when you run minecraft in
Eclipse<00:04:32.120> that<00:04:32.300> you<00:04:32.949> run<00:04:33.949> out<00:04:34.069> of<00:04:34.099> memory

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
Eclipse that you run out of memory

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.990 
Eclipse that you run out of memory
really<00:04:35.030> really<00:04:35.240> quickly<00:04:35.740> as<00:04:36.740> because<00:04:37.520> Eclipse

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
really really quickly as because Eclipse

and that number you want to change to a

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.439 
and that number you want to change to a
big<00:04:59.479> number<00:05:00.400> that's<00:05:01.400> how<00:05:01.639> many<00:05:01.789> megabytes<00:05:02.090> it

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
big number that's how many megabytes it

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.890 
big number that's how many megabytes it
assigns<00:05:02.810> to<00:05:03.259> the<00:05:04.129> Java<00:05:04.550> heap<00:05:05.030> space<00:05:05.180> which<00:05:05.719> is

assigns to the Java heap space which is

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.219 
assigns to the Java heap space which is
what<00:05:05.930> runs<00:05:06.229> out<00:05:06.409> of<00:05:06.440> memory<00:05:06.620> all<00:05:06.889> the<00:05:06.979> time<00:05:07.190> so

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
what runs out of memory all the time so

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.339 
what runs out of memory all the time so
I've<00:05:09.229> set<00:05:09.590> mine<00:05:09.770> at<00:05:09.949> 11:24<00:05:10.940> megabytes<00:05:11.389> that's

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:12.349 
I've set mine at 11:24 megabytes that's

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:14.469 
I've set mine at 11:24 megabytes that's
as<00:05:12.469> high<00:05:12.620> as<00:05:12.650> I<00:05:12.830> can<00:05:12.889> go<00:05:13.129> on<00:05:13.250> this<00:05:13.370> machine<00:05:13.580> due

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
as high as I can go on this machine due

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.890 
as high as I can go on this machine due
to<00:05:14.659> various<00:05:15.560> reasons

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
to various reasons

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.269 
to various reasons
minecraft<00:05:17.900> code<00:05:18.110> a<00:05:18.139> pack<00:05:18.379> has<00:05:18.500> a<00:05:18.529> default<00:05:18.979> of

00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:19.279 
minecraft code a pack has a default of

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:23.290 
minecraft code a pack has a default of
1024<00:05:20.199> but<00:05:21.199> in<00:05:22.039> Eclipse<00:05:22.550> Eclipse<00:05:22.789> actually

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
1024 but in Eclipse Eclipse actually

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.360 
1024 but in Eclipse Eclipse actually
uses<00:05:23.629> some<00:05:23.810> of<00:05:23.840> that<00:05:23.990> memory<00:05:24.349> so<00:05:24.590> you<00:05:24.650> need

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
uses some of that memory so you need

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.230 
uses some of that memory so you need
more<00:05:25.639> like<00:05:25.849> 13<00:05:26.330> 1,400<00:05:27.729> although<00:05:28.729> I<00:05:28.759> can't<00:05:29.090> do

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
more like 13 1,400 although I can't do

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.230 
more like 13 1,400 although I can't do
that<00:05:29.449> so<00:05:29.840> put<00:05:30.379> as<00:05:30.500> much<00:05:30.620> memory<00:05:30.889> is<00:05:31.340> in<00:05:32.060> there

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
that so put as much memory is in there

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.510 
that so put as much memory is in there
as<00:05:32.330> you<00:05:32.449> can<00:05:32.599> spare<00:05:32.900> the<00:05:33.830> more<00:05:34.279> the<00:05:34.400> better

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
as you can spare the more the better

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.409 
as you can spare the more the better
basically

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
basically

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:39.450 
basically
once<00:05:35.990> you're<00:05:36.139> done<00:05:36.319> click<00:05:36.590> Save<00:05:38.020> close<00:05:39.020> it<00:05:39.259> and

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
once you're done click Save close it and

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.100 
once you're done click Save close it and
go<00:05:40.460> back<00:05:40.610> into<00:05:40.729> eclipse<00:05:41.150> close<00:05:41.509> Eclipse<00:05:41.930> and

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
go back into eclipse close Eclipse and

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.629 
go back into eclipse close Eclipse and
open<00:05:42.469> it<00:05:42.560> again<00:05:42.650> and<00:05:42.949> then<00:05:43.339> your<00:05:43.490> memory

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:43.639 
open it again and then your memory

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:46.420 
open it again and then your memory
setting<00:05:44.029> is<00:05:44.120> what<00:05:44.240> saved<00:05:45.069> I'm<00:05:46.069> going<00:05:46.370> to

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
setting is what saved I'm going to

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.490 
setting is what saved I'm going to
quickly<00:05:46.639> show<00:05:46.849> you<00:05:47.089> a<00:05:47.270> quick<00:05:47.900> demo<00:05:48.199> of<00:05:48.469> how

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
quickly show you a quick demo of how

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.550 
quickly show you a quick demo of how
this<00:05:48.800> works<00:05:49.129> so<00:05:49.370> I'll<00:05:49.789> go<00:05:50.000> into<00:05:50.330> a<00:05:50.360> class<00:05:50.719> let's

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
this works so I'll go into a class let's

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.140 
this works so I'll go into a class let's
go<00:05:51.710> to<00:05:51.770> the<00:05:51.949> player<00:05:52.219> class<00:05:52.550> and<00:05:52.849> we'll<00:05:53.000> make

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
go to the player class and we'll make

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.909 
go to the player class and we'll make
the<00:05:53.330> player<00:05:53.569> jump<00:05:53.960> twice<00:05:54.229> as<00:05:54.469> high

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 
the player jump twice as high

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:57.879 
the player jump twice as high
so<00:05:55.520> it's<00:05:56.089> entity<00:05:56.509> player<00:05:56.810> or<00:05:57.289> find<00:05:57.560> the<00:05:57.710> method

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:57.889 
so it's entity player or find the method

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:01.420 
so it's entity player or find the method
jump<00:05:58.629> I'm<00:05:59.629> pretty<00:05:59.870> sure<00:06:00.050> this<00:06:00.199> one<00:06:00.409> it<00:06:01.069> doesn't

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
jump I'm pretty sure this one it doesn't

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:07.659 
jump I'm pretty sure this one it doesn't
seem<00:06:01.819> like<00:06:02.000> this<00:06:02.150> one<00:06:02.360> alright<00:06:02.960> so<00:06:06.520> let's<00:06:07.520> do

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
seem like this one alright so let's do

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:12.129 
seem like this one alright so let's do
something<00:06:07.879> else<00:06:08.060> instead<00:06:09.819> we<00:06:10.819> can<00:06:10.969> do<00:06:11.210> or

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:12.139 
something else instead we can do or

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:14.519 
something else instead we can do or
something<00:06:12.440> cool<00:06:12.589> we<00:06:12.770> can<00:06:12.889> do-we<00:06:13.279> can<00:06:13.400> do-we

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:14.529 
something cool we can do-we can do-we

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:21.360 
something cool we can do-we can do-we
can<00:06:15.529> do-we<00:06:15.770> can<00:06:15.949> do-we<00:06:16.190> can<00:06:16.339> do

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.129 

well<00:06:22.060> when<00:06:22.240> the<00:06:22.330> play<00:06:22.509> is<00:06:22.539> created<00:06:23.050> we<00:06:23.110> can

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:23.139 
well when the play is created we can

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:24.600 
well when the play is created we can
just<00:06:23.379> print<00:06:23.590> out<00:06:23.680> a<00:06:23.710> message<00:06:24.069> for<00:06:24.190> example

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
just print out a message for example

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:30.360 
just print out a message for example
your<00:06:25.090> system<00:06:25.530> so<00:06:26.530> I<00:06:26.620> out<00:06:26.919> dot<00:06:27.340> print<00:06:27.669> line<00:06:29.370> and

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370 
your system so I out dot print line and

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.589 
your system so I out dot print line and
go<00:06:30.580> hello<00:06:31.440> world<00:06:32.940> all<00:06:33.940> right<00:06:34.120> and<00:06:34.300> if<00:06:34.479> I<00:06:34.569> just
