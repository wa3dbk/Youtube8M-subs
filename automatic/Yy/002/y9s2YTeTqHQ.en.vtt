00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
okay here I have my IKEA hack I found

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.700 
okay here I have my IKEA hack I found
photo<00:00:13.830> studio<00:00:14.370> for<00:00:14.670> Arduino<00:00:15.420> it's<00:00:16.319> really

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
photo studio for Arduino it's really

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.210 
photo studio for Arduino it's really
simple<00:00:16.949> I'm<00:00:17.429> just<00:00:17.489> hacking<00:00:18.169> this<00:00:19.169> IKEA<00:00:19.890> lamp

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
simple I'm just hacking this IKEA lamp

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.679 
simple I'm just hacking this IKEA lamp
that<00:00:20.669> you<00:00:20.789> have<00:00:20.999> here<00:00:22.999> as<00:00:23.999> you<00:00:24.269> can<00:00:24.329> see<00:00:24.449> I've

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
that you have here as you can see I've

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.829 
that you have here as you can see I've
made<00:00:24.720> other<00:00:25.079> hacks<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:26.300> but<00:00:27.300> right<00:00:27.509> now<00:00:27.659> I

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:27.839 
made other hacks of it but right now I

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:33.310 
made other hacks of it but right now I
attach<00:00:28.319> and<00:00:29.239> iPad<00:00:30.239> iPhone<00:00:30.689> stand

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
attach and iPad iPhone stand

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.100 
attach and iPad iPhone stand
through<00:00:34.320> it

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.729 

in<00:00:37.559> order<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.890> attach<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.340> iPhone<00:00:38.670> here<00:00:39.739> and

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
in order to attach the iPhone here and

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.970 
in order to attach the iPhone here and
take<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.160> pictures<00:00:41.579> here<00:00:42.510> I'm<00:00:43.410> going<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.800> show

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
take the pictures here I'm going to show

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.549 
take the pictures here I'm going to show
you<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.190> little<00:00:44.460> example<00:00:44.699> of<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.930> video<00:00:46.110> and

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
you a little example of the video and

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:56.979 
you a little example of the video and
pictures<00:00:46.890> taken<00:00:48.050> so<00:00:49.050> we<00:00:49.079> enjoy<00:00:49.350> it

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.410 

hello<00:00:57.989> again<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.620> an<00:00:58.859> example<00:00:59.250> using<00:00:59.969> my

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
hello again this is an example using my

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.160 
hello again this is an example using my
new<00:01:01.219> IKEA<00:01:02.219> hack<00:01:03.000> hard<00:01:03.329> we<00:01:03.600> known<00:01:03.809> for<00:01:04.049> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
new IKEA hack hard we known for the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.870 
new IKEA hack hard we known for the
studio<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:07.009> way<00:01:08.009> to<00:01:08.040> improve<00:01:08.610> my

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
studio this is a way to improve my

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.480 
studio this is a way to improve my
tutorials<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.049> am<00:01:10.439> putting<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.280> we

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
tutorials that I am putting in and we

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.810 
tutorials that I am putting in and we
know<00:01:11.549> Art's<00:01:11.850> calm<00:01:12.649> which<00:01:13.649> were<00:01:13.830> very<00:01:14.070> removed

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
know Art's calm which were very removed

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.719 
know Art's calm which were very removed
in<00:01:15.539> the<00:01:15.690> past<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.409> I'm<00:01:16.530> trying<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.890> have<00:01:17.280> both

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
in the past so I'm trying to have both

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.050 
in the past so I'm trying to have both
hands<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:19.380> show<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.680> there's<00:01:20.100> kinetics<00:01:20.880> I

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
hands to show you there's kinetics I

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.910 
hands to show you there's kinetics I
just<00:01:21.299> made<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.539> simple<00:01:22.380> simple<00:01:22.799> simple

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
just made a simple simple simple

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.620 
just made a simple simple simple
schematic<00:01:23.250> note<00:01:23.670> are<00:01:24.000> doing<00:01:24.299> related

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
schematic note are doing related

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.850 
schematic note are doing related
actually<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:26.039> yeah<00:01:26.310> just<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.939> bunch<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.240> leads

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
actually this yeah just a bunch of leads

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.109 
actually this yeah just a bunch of leads
connected<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.100> five<00:01:29.280> bolts<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.819> can<00:01:29.970> see

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
connected to the five bolts you can see

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.620 
connected to the five bolts you can see
all<00:01:30.330> the<00:01:30.810> resistors<00:01:31.350> going<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.940> the<00:01:33.060> positive

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
all the resistors going to the positive

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.919 
all the resistors going to the positive
of<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.929> bread<00:01:34.259> world<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.549> negative<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
of the bread world and the negative the

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:38.899 
of the bread world and the negative the
negative<00:01:36.960> pole<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.830> you<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:38.280> see<00:01:38.580> it's

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
negative pole that you can see it's

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.260 
negative pole that you can see it's
linked<00:01:39.330> in<00:01:39.810> both<00:01:40.080> sides<00:01:40.819> here<00:01:41.819> we<00:01:41.850> have<00:01:42.119> the

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
linked in both sides here we have the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.770 
linked in both sides here we have the
negative<00:01:42.600> posts<00:01:43.520> going<00:01:44.520> through<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.149> leads<00:01:45.360> I

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
negative posts going through the leads I

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.699 
negative posts going through the leads I
am<00:01:46.560> going<00:01:47.039> to<00:01:47.340> show<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> little<00:01:48.659> trick<00:01:49.080> I<00:01:49.200> had<00:01:49.500> I

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:49.709 
am going to show a little trick I had I

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:52.190 
am going to show a little trick I had I
didn't<00:01:50.039> had<00:01:50.250> enough<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.819> jumper<00:01:51.179> wire<00:01:51.330> so<00:01:51.690> I<00:01:51.899> use

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
didn't had enough a jumper wire so I use

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:01.160 
didn't had enough a jumper wire so I use
my<00:01:53.009> stapler<00:01:55.670> and<00:01:57.170> made<00:01:58.170> brand<00:01:59.119> new<00:02:00.170> jumper

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
my stapler and made brand new jumper

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.289 
my stapler and made brand new jumper
wires<00:02:01.609> therefore<00:02:02.609> with<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.090> can<00:02:03.240> have

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
wires therefore with this you can have

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.160 
wires therefore with this you can have
short<00:02:03.840> circuits<00:02:04.399> that<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:06.149> can<00:02:06.359> see<00:02:06.539> how<00:02:07.109> we

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
short circuits that you can see how we

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:17.280 
short circuits that you can see how we
managed<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.590> put<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.869> so<00:02:09.869> if<00:02:10.200> we<00:02:10.410> just

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.530 

that's<00:02:18.290> it
