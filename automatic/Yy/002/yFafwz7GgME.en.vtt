00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
have and that's the ultra clear black or

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.140 
have and that's the ultra clear black or
I<00:01:10.320> believe<00:01:10.830> they<00:01:10.979> just<00:01:11.189> call<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.670> ultra

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
I believe they just call it the ultra

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.870 
I believe they just call it the ultra
black<00:01:12.360> but<00:01:12.780> as<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.200> can<00:01:13.409> see<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:14.280> does<00:01:14.610> have<00:01:14.850> a

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
black but as you can see it does have a

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.850 
black but as you can see it does have a
little<00:01:15.119> bit<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.509> translucent<00:01:16.320> effect<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.830> it

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
little bit of a translucent effect to it

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.100 
little bit of a translucent effect to it
so<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.220> can<00:01:17.490> see<00:01:17.729> through<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.119> it's<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.840> little

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
so you can see through it it's a little

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.679 
so you can see through it it's a little
smoky<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:19.740> color<00:01:20.100> but<00:01:20.549> it's<00:01:20.700> really<00:01:21.060> nice<00:01:21.210> so

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
smoky in color but it's really nice so

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.039 
smoky in color but it's really nice so
again<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.710> gives<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.280> ipad<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.909> very<00:01:24.210> sleek<00:01:24.750> a

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
again it gives the ipad a very sleek a

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.190 
again it gives the ipad a very sleek a
very<00:01:25.680> clean<00:01:26.130> look<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.659> somewhat

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
very clean look and it is somewhat

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.960 
very clean look and it is somewhat
translucent<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.220> can<00:01:29.460> see<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.820> apple

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
translucent so you can see the apple

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.149 
translucent so you can see the apple
logo<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.780> then<00:01:31.200> finally<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.799> I've<00:01:31.890> shown
