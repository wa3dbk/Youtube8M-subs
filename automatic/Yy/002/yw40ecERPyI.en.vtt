some<00:02:08.530> cheesecloth<00:02:09.130> and<00:02:09.399> it's<00:02:09.550> best<00:02:09.759> to<00:02:09.990> dampen

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
some cheesecloth and it's best to dampen

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.400 
some cheesecloth and it's best to dampen
the<00:02:11.020> cheesecloth<00:02:11.560> so<00:02:11.920> that<00:02:12.070> it'll<00:02:12.220> stay

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
the cheesecloth so that it'll stay

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.890 
the cheesecloth so that it'll stay
you<00:02:13.530> put<00:02:13.860> it<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.160> you<00:02:14.580> have<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.760> sieve<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.510> you

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
you put it and you have a sieve and you

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.820 
you put it and you have a sieve and you
pour<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.560> milk<00:02:17.280> mixture<00:02:17.790> into<00:02:18.350> the<00:02:19.350> sieve

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
pour that milk mixture into the sieve

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.110 
pour that milk mixture into the sieve
the<00:02:20.700> way<00:02:21.120> which<00:02:21.660> is<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.170> byproduct<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.460> making

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
the way which is the byproduct of making

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.930 
the way which is the byproduct of making
ricotta<00:02:24.630> will<00:02:25.380> stay<00:02:25.740> in<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.250> bottom<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:26.850> the

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
ricotta will stay in the bottom of the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.910 
ricotta will stay in the bottom of the
bowl<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:28.260> cheese<00:02:28.710> will<00:02:29.370> remain<00:02:29.880> in<00:02:30.920> your

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
bowl and the cheese will remain in your

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.510 
bowl and the cheese will remain in your
sieve

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
sieve

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.640 
sieve
so<00:02:32.970> here<00:02:33.210> we<00:02:33.330> have<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.900> way<00:02:34.080> now<00:02:34.380> we<00:02:34.440> could

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
so here we have the way now we could

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.940 
so here we have the way now we could
actually<00:02:34.860> take<00:02:35.430> this<00:02:35.760> add<00:02:36.260> more<00:02:37.260> milk<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:37.830> it

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
actually take this add more milk to it

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.160 
actually take this add more milk to it
in<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.190> pan<00:02:38.460> cook<00:02:38.820> it<00:02:38.970> again<00:02:39.270> and<00:02:39.540> we<00:02:39.870> would<00:02:39.990> have

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
in a pan cook it again and we would have

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.040 
in a pan cook it again and we would have
more<00:02:40.380> cheese<00:02:40.770> so<00:02:41.460> ricotta<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.300> word<00:02:42.510> itself

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
more cheese so ricotta the word itself

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.240 
more cheese so ricotta the word itself
means<00:02:43.790> we<00:02:44.790> cooked<00:02:45.540> because<00:02:46.410> you're<00:02:46.830> cooking

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
means we cooked because you're cooking

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.890 
means we cooked because you're cooking
the<00:02:47.400> leftovers<00:02:48.030> from<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.330> cheese<00:02:48.600> making

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
the leftovers from the cheese making

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.320 
the leftovers from the cheese making
process<00:02:49.080> to<00:02:49.770> make<00:02:50.370> ricotta

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
process to make ricotta

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.570 
process to make ricotta
you<00:02:51.690> can<00:02:51.840> also<00:02:51.960> flavor<00:02:52.380> this<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:53.310> can<00:02:53.460> buy

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
you can also flavor this you can buy

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.360 
you can also flavor this you can buy
cheese<00:02:53.910> like<00:02:54.120> this<00:02:54.360> it's<00:02:54.540> flavoured<00:02:54.960> with

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
cheese like this it's flavoured with

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.220 
cheese like this it's flavoured with
other<00:02:56.370> cheeses<00:02:57.000> like<00:02:57.030> parmigiano<00:02:57.750> or<00:02:58.140> you

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
other cheeses like parmigiano or you

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.840 
other cheeses like parmigiano or you
could<00:02:58.350> have<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.680> with<00:02:58.830> herbs<00:02:59.100> in<00:02:59.460> it<00:02:59.580> we're

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
could have it with herbs in it we're

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.070 
could have it with herbs in it we're
going<00:02:59.940> to<00:03:00.000> do<00:03:00.180> something<00:03:00.450> different<00:03:00.960> with<00:03:01.050> it

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
going to do something different with it

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.860 
going to do something different with it
today<00:03:01.350> so<00:03:02.250> now<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.490> you<00:03:02.670> know<00:03:02.820> that<00:03:02.850> we<00:03:03.660> can

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
today so now that you know that we can

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.380 
today so now that you know that we can
work<00:03:04.080> with<00:03:04.320> our<00:03:04.590> cheese<00:03:05.460> so<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.970> first<00:03:06.180> thing

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
work with our cheese so the first thing

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.360 
work with our cheese so the first thing
we're<00:03:06.540> going<00:03:06.660> to<00:03:06.750> do<00:03:07.280> is<00:03:09.170> mold<00:03:10.170> some<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.190> this

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
we're going to do is mold some of this

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.910 
we're going to do is mold some of this
cheese<00:03:11.840> here's<00:03:12.840> another<00:03:13.110> one<00:03:13.380> that<00:03:13.410> I<00:03:13.590> made

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
cheese here's another one that I made

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.340 
cheese here's another one that I made
earlier<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:14.730> could<00:03:14.910> actually<00:03:15.120> just<00:03:15.390> take

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
earlier you could actually just take

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.170 
earlier you could actually just take
this<00:03:16.560> out<00:03:16.830> turn<00:03:17.250> this<00:03:17.459> over<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:17.940> we'd<00:03:18.030> have<00:03:18.150> a

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
this out turn this over and we'd have a

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.170 
this out turn this over and we'd have a
nice<00:03:18.480> molded<00:03:19.260> look<00:03:19.770> to<00:03:20.010> it<00:03:20.160> but<00:03:20.730> instead<00:03:21.030> of

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
nice molded look to it but instead of

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.960 
nice molded look to it but instead of
doing<00:03:21.450> that<00:03:21.480> what<00:03:22.440> we're<00:03:22.590> going<00:03:22.740> to<00:03:22.830> do<00:03:23.010> is

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
take some of this cheese about half of

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.080 
take some of this cheese about half of
it<00:03:27.680> put<00:03:28.680> it<00:03:28.709> in<00:03:28.890> a<00:03:28.980> bowl<00:03:29.250> you<00:03:29.990> see<00:03:30.990> how<00:03:31.170> nice<00:03:31.500> and

going to do several things so you get it

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.290 
going to do several things so you get it
right<00:03:38.790> out<00:03:38.940> of<00:03:38.970> that<00:03:39.470> cheesecloth<00:03:40.910> this<00:03:41.910> part

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
right out of that cheesecloth this part

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.710 
right out of that cheesecloth this part
gets<00:03:42.510> to<00:03:42.660> be<00:03:42.780> a<00:03:42.810> little<00:03:43.050> messy<00:03:43.290> but<00:03:44.720> there

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
gets to be a little messy but there

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.040 
gets to be a little messy but there
there's<00:03:46.380> our<00:03:46.709> cheese
