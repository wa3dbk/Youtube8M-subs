00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
EQ settings on here well first of all

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.040 
EQ settings on here well first of all
I'm<00:00:50.370> going<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.520> turn<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.790> gain<00:00:51.570> up<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.840> little

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
I'm going to turn the gain up a little

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.180 
I'm going to turn the gain up a little
bit<00:00:52.200> we'll<00:00:52.350> see<00:00:52.470> how<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.740> sounds

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
bit we'll see how that sounds

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.840 
bit we'll see how that sounds
turn<00:00:53.850> down<00:00:54.030> some<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.330> the<00:00:54.450> highs<00:00:55.760> turn<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
turn down some of the highs turn the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.980 
turn down some of the highs turn the
highs<00:00:56.970> back<00:00:57.210> up<00:00:57.450> because<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.690> actually<00:00:57.840> like

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:57.990 
highs back up because I actually like

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:05.360 
highs back up because I actually like
those<00:00:58.380> better

I say what I'm doing there is actually
bringing<00:01:16.610> out<00:01:16.729> somewhat<00:01:17.060> lower<00:01:17.240> meds<00:01:17.509> for

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
bringing out somewhat lower meds for

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.640 
bringing out somewhat lower meds for
them<00:01:18.380> using<00:01:19.040> the<00:01:19.280> mid<00:01:19.549> cut<00:01:20.200> and<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:21.409> mid

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
them using the mid cut and the mid

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:47.640

00:01:47.650 --> 00:02:02.840 

maybe<00:01:48.640> some<00:01:49.170> lows<00:01:50.170> will<00:01:50.410> add<00:01:50.470> to<00:01:50.650> that

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
all right let's go to the next setting

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.400 
all right let's go to the next setting
and<00:02:06.189> that<00:02:06.280> is<00:02:06.490> for<00:02:06.939> the<00:02:07.299> MT<00:02:07.719> to<00:02:07.929> meddle<00:02:08.229> zone

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
and that is for the MT to meddle zone

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.699 
and that is for the MT to meddle zone
from<00:02:08.619> boss<00:02:09.509> remove<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.629> gain<00:02:10.869> back<00:02:11.140> down<00:02:11.440> move

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
from boss remove the gain back down move

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.240 
from boss remove the gain back down move
our<00:02:11.860> mids<00:02:12.099> back<00:02:12.370> town<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:13.000> move<00:02:13.959> our<00:02:14.170> low<00:02:14.410> back

so yeah it's a classic metal zone tone
we'll<00:02:55.069> turn<00:02:55.220> up<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.519> game<00:02:55.700> a<00:02:55.730> bit<00:02:56.060> we'll<00:02:56.629> scoop

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
we'll turn up the game a bit we'll scoop

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.780 
we'll turn up the game a bit we'll scoop
out<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.290> mids<00:02:57.500> to<00:02:57.650> get<00:02:57.769> a<00:02:57.799> classic<00:02:58.220> metal<00:02:58.370> sort

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
out the mids to get a classic metal sort

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:13.640 
out the mids to get a classic metal sort
of<00:02:58.849> rhythm<00:02:59.180> tone<00:02:59.360> school<00:02:59.720> outs<00:02:59.900> environments

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.410 

basically<00:03:14.650> over-the-top<00:03:15.250> metal<00:03:15.610> from<00:03:16.180> the

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
basically over-the-top metal from the

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.250 
basically over-the-top metal from the
metal<00:03:16.660> zone<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:18.250> next<00:03:18.819> up<00:03:19.060> we<00:03:19.599> got<00:03:19.629> digitech

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
metal zone and next up we got digitech

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.820 
metal zone and next up we got digitech
metal<00:03:20.620> master<00:03:21.690> I'm<00:03:22.690> not<00:03:23.110> familiar<00:03:23.319> with<00:03:23.620> this

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
metal master I'm not familiar with this

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.670 
metal master I'm not familiar with this
pedal<00:03:24.160> so<00:03:24.370> we'll<00:03:25.330> see<00:03:25.510> how<00:03:25.599> it<00:03:25.720> sounds<00:03:28.680> this

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
pedal so we'll see how it sounds this

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.619 
pedal so we'll see how it sounds this
has<00:03:29.860> a<00:03:29.890> lot<00:03:30.160> of<00:03:30.400> upper<00:03:30.879> mids<00:03:31.150> so<00:03:31.390> what<00:03:31.540> I'm

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:31.629 
has a lot of upper mids so what I'm

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:32.880 
has a lot of upper mids so what I'm
going<00:03:31.750> to<00:03:31.780> do<00:03:31.989> is<00:03:32.200> I'm<00:03:32.319> going<00:03:32.349> to<00:03:32.500> raise<00:03:32.680> our

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
going to do is I'm going to raise our

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.750 
going to do is I'm going to raise our
mid<00:03:33.099> frequency<00:03:33.730> and<00:03:34.860> actually<00:03:35.860> lower<00:03:36.160> them

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
mid frequency and actually lower them

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:44.599 
mid frequency and actually lower them
it's<00:03:36.940> a<00:03:37.030> bit

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:53.369 

add<00:03:45.609> some<00:03:45.909> lows<00:03:51.480> so<00:03:52.480> it's<00:03:52.599> kind<00:03:52.750> of<00:03:52.780> a<00:03:52.870> nasally

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
add some lows so it's kind of a nasally

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.500 
add some lows so it's kind of a nasally
sound<00:03:53.909> see<00:03:54.909> what<00:03:55.030> we<00:03:55.090> can<00:03:55.209> do<00:03:55.299> with<00:03:55.420> these

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
sound see what we can do with these

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:04.010 
sound see what we can do with these
myths

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:14.470

Hey
ah<00:04:16.060> not<00:04:17.049> really<00:04:17.079> suited<00:04:17.650> for<00:04:17.799> rhythm<00:04:17.980> but

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
ah not really suited for rhythm but

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.660 
ah not really suited for rhythm but
seems<00:04:18.549> to<00:04:18.639> work<00:04:18.850> well<00:04:19.060> for<00:04:19.590> soloing<00:04:20.590> has<00:04:21.340> a<00:04:21.370> lot

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:21.670 
seems to work well for soloing has a lot

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.090 
seems to work well for soloing has a lot
of<00:04:21.760> sustain<00:04:22.200> alright<00:04:23.200> let's<00:04:23.680> try<00:04:23.830> the<00:04:23.920> last

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
of sustain alright let's try the last

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.790 
of sustain alright let's try the last
one<00:04:24.340> and<00:04:24.850> this<00:04:24.940> is<00:04:25.090> the<00:04:25.180> big<00:04:25.360> muff<00:04:25.650> chords<00:04:26.650> -

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
one and this is the big muff chords -

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:43.529 
one and this is the big muff chords -
classic

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:45.810 

trying<00:04:43.900> to<00:04:43.990> get<00:04:44.110> some<00:04:44.289> of<00:04:44.380> that<00:04:44.430> sustain<00:04:45.430> that

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
trying to get some of that sustain that

00:04:45.820 --> 00:05:08.159 
trying to get some of that sustain that
the<00:04:45.940> big<00:04:46.120> muff<00:04:46.300> is<00:04:46.479> known<00:04:46.660> for

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.029 

so<00:05:09.009> that's<00:05:09.159> sort<00:05:09.400> of<00:05:09.520> a<00:05:09.610> fuzz<00:05:09.849> tone<00:05:10.319> so<00:05:11.319> we

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 
so that's sort of a fuzz tone so we

the df7 distortion factory seems to be a
lot<00:05:16.210> of<00:05:16.300> different<00:05:16.599> options<00:05:16.930> a<00:05:16.990> lot<00:05:17.050> of

know may not give you exactly the tone
that<00:05:21.789> you'd<00:05:21.909> get<00:05:22.150> from<00:05:22.689> some<00:05:23.050> of<00:05:23.139> the<00:05:23.229> real
