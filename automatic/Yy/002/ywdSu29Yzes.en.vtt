00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.759

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.740

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.599
 actors and dancers wanted but 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.680
 here is the kids club of my ship 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:21.509
 loud and now i want to give them the 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.279
 introduce the head of this kids club 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.320
 that christian tiedemann christin was 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.640

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.590
 children and youth workers in the 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.149
 future on the my ship faster 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.040
 should be able to work in a casting 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:33.750
 we have a great overall impression of 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.520
 get this people and that is 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:45.600
 much more meaningful than one 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:46.620
 Application interview a casting from that 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.720
 have to make the participants 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.790
 the contents are that on the one hand the 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.980
 Participants must present and to 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.040
 others work in groups 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.040
 have to 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.270
 so I just sat down here 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.010
 the first film was group's task 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.410
 to develop a game for the children 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.360
 and the topic is called naturvÃ¶lker marion 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.950
 you are the mayas what do you have 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.690
 we have developed a game 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.820
 this is called mature indiaca 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.130
 The content of the game is the Spaniard 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.260
 fight against the aborigines and with 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.210
 this met in the rechargeable batteries in mature 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.900
 must be achieved and who mature more 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.900
 who wins 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.890
 all four teams have succeeded her 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.840
 Developed players and now decide 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.070
 the children whether the game is fun or 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.860
 not that easy with the 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:52.960
 thumb is fun goes this way or thumb 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.790
 down but ultimately love christine 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.170
 does not decide even if Spielmann 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.420
 not fun it can still be great 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.100
 Become a coworker or yes absolutely so 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.780
 the games definitely do not decide 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.730
 Here we see again what 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.170
 the caretakers worked out above 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.460
 but in the end of course that counts 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.450
 Overall impression and the overall impression 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.850
 At the moment, people are able to work in a team 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:21.370
 You can flexible with the ship 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:23.170
 can live conditions to such job at 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.640
 board with you in teens club for example 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.680
 Compare it to a job on land 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.600
 completely different is not 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.040
 completely different it is comparable 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.690
 but still we have our programs 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.370
 the first time the supervisors learn 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.020
 we have to try it already 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.310
 children long term to deal with the 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.910
 means it has to be structured 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.910
 be program 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.000
 how does the game get on here? 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.380
 That's what the kiddies did 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.890
 Game has been pretty good so far 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.150
 I say 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.640
 before that, the boys were a bit 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.170
 bored of the story but the 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.459
 pyramid was there again as it still 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.630
 let's get the boys out of it 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.070
 also historically cool 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:06.630
 We now ask even the kiddies to 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:06.630
 In 2004 it was a good eight thumbs down 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.870
 Now it's in the individual talks with 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.150
 Every single thing happens exactly there 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.070
 We'll talk one more time 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.230
 times topics we noticed here 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.540
 it's the applicants again 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.760
 Criticism I would say 80 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.980
 percent of the people today are the 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.650
 really have a lot of quality though 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.600
 40 percent I would say are ship 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.180
 suitable and counts at the end of the day 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.110
 more is really suitable 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.970
 Thank Christina a great thing 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.930

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.400
