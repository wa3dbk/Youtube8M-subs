recently I was out traveling and I

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.430 
recently I was out traveling and I
needed<00:00:02.399> to<00:00:02.610> get<00:00:02.820> into<00:00:03.210> Seoul<00:00:03.570> for<00:00:03.929> a<00:00:03.990> special

bus and I saw something amazing I saw
what<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.519> believe<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.630> ultimate<00:00:12.870> bus<00:00:13.740> stop

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160

what I believe is the ultimate bus stop
sign<00:00:14.549> in<00:00:15.240> Korea<00:00:15.809> at<00:00:16.250> first<00:00:17.250> glance<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:17.970> was

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
sign in Korea at first glance it was

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.380 
sign in Korea at first glance it was
just<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.779> normal<00:00:19.350> bus<00:00:19.859> stop<00:00:20.100> sign<00:00:20.369> but<00:00:20.760> upon

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
just a normal bus stop sign but upon

your next destination the other thing
that<00:01:19.110> was<00:01:19.350> really<00:01:19.920> cool<00:01:20.250> about<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.939> despite

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
that was really cool about this despite

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.600 
that was really cool about this despite
was<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.689> lower<00:01:21.930> right-hand<00:01:22.380> corner<00:01:22.799> it

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
was in the lower right-hand corner it

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.030 
was in the lower right-hand corner it
was<00:01:23.790> traffic<00:01:24.540> information<00:01:24.920> giving<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
was traffic information giving the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.710 
was traffic information giving the
travel<00:01:26.490> time<00:01:26.640> from<00:01:26.700> your<00:01:27.210> current<00:01:27.540> location

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
travel time from your current location

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.630 
travel time from your current location
to<00:01:28.590> three<00:01:29.189> different<00:01:29.970> areas<00:01:30.780> close<00:01:31.409> by<00:01:31.770> it

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
to three different areas close by it

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.749 
to three different areas close by it
really<00:01:32.939> helps<00:01:33.270> one<00:01:33.450> determine<00:01:33.990> not

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
really helps one determine not

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.520 
really helps one determine not
necessarily<00:01:35.759> late<00:01:35.970> if<00:01:36.210> you're<00:01:36.659> driving<00:01:37.049> there

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
necessarily late if you're driving there

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.580 
necessarily late if you're driving there
but<00:01:38.220> how<00:01:38.790> long<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.240> bus<00:01:39.479> may<00:01:39.750> take<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.229> get<00:01:40.530> to

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
but how long the bus may take to get to

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.210 
but how long the bus may take to get to
that<00:01:40.979> other<00:01:41.220> destination<00:01:42.000> based<00:01:42.689> on<00:01:42.899> current

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
that other destination based on current

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.960 
that other destination based on current
travel<00:01:44.220> conditions<00:01:44.930> that<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.290> really<00:01:46.770> cool

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
travel conditions that is really cool

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.690 
travel conditions that is really cool
but<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.119> thing<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.450> really<00:01:48.829> really<00:01:49.829> blew<00:01:50.490> me

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
but the thing that really really blew me

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.520 
but the thing that really really blew me
away<00:01:51.259> was<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:53.270> subway<00:01:54.270> stop<00:01:54.659> information

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
away was this subway stop information

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.889 
away was this subway stop information
this<00:01:56.040> particular<00:01:56.369> bus<00:01:56.729> stop<00:01:56.939> was<00:01:57.119> just<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.600> few

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
this particular bus stop was just a few

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.310 
this particular bus stop was just a few
hundred<00:01:58.140> meters<00:01:58.649> from<00:01:58.829> young<00:01:59.250> hung<00:01:59.490> young<00:01:59.790> and

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
hundred meters from young hung young and

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.859 
hundred meters from young hung young and
to<00:02:01.320> think<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.979> they<00:02:02.280> would<00:02:02.490> put<00:02:02.939> both<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.689> up

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
to think that they would put both the up

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.180 
to think that they would put both the up
and<00:02:04.140> down<00:02:04.860> word<00:02:05.369> tracks<00:02:05.969> on<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:07.140> bus<00:02:07.860> stop

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
and down word tracks on this bus stop

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.110 
and down word tracks on this bus stop
sign<00:02:08.520> was<00:02:09.360> cool<00:02:09.720> because<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.170> can<00:02:10.200> see<00:02:10.590> here

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
sign was cool because you can see here

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.020 
sign was cool because you can see here
that<00:02:11.599> there<00:02:12.049> are<00:02:12.200> two<00:02:12.730> Subway's<00:02:13.730> trains

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
that there are two Subway's trains

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.080 
that there are two Subway's trains
