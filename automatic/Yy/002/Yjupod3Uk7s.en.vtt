00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.360
 hello friends welcome to my channel 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.950
 gastronomic 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.950
 I am priscilla and today I bring you a 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.900
 recipe super different than something that 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.300
 they have never seen I will teach them to 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.460
 make some breaded avocados but 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.500
 baked then they will not be fried 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.410
 What I love about this recipe is that it is 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.059
 super easy to make super rich the 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.640
 I really think it's a very good option 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.340
 like to carry a football Sunday 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.680
 or to share with your friends or if 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.110
 you have a scene with friends I think it's 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.210
 a very good option as input what 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.060
 what I love is that apart from easy 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.640
 They have a lot of flavor and as they are 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.579
 baked are quite crispy what 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.980
 you need me here are avocados and 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.410
 I have my slices prepared and try 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.210
 to leave them a bit thick because if not 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.369
 they can break you and they are not going to 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.130
 look very good then once 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.110
 you have your slices me here I have my 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.930
 liquid mixture that would be how to use 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.860
 egg when you're breading and it's 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:23.069
 simply sauce tamariz water and mustard 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.610
 organic yellow and here I have flour 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:26.670
 corn 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.080
 organic a little ground flaxseed salt 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.140
 of sea and pepper 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.470
 literal here what I'm going to do is 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.320
 dip my avocado in the mixture of 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.260
 tamariz and then I'll pass it to the 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:45.870
 flour mixture will climb to cover 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.870
 very good our slice of avocado 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.260
 and then we are going to transfer it to 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.510
 tray that I already have ready with a paper 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.060
 of silicon that if you do not have you can use 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:59.180
 the waxed paper and this we're going to 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.180
 bake as you can see these slices 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:06.860
 of avocado and are well covered 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:09.910
 mix and absorb the flour very well with 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.910
 the tamarisk mixture 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.970
 it's like shrimp type 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.570
 breaded but flying tape 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.570
 that 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.050
 Well, I have my slices of 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.420
 avocado ready to bake are 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.920
 let's put in like 20 to 30 minutes 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.130
 until we see that they are well 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.430
 crispy and we're going to bake them at 180 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.430
 degrees 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.970
 well my avocados if they are ready and 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.280
 they were in the oven for 30 to 35 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.069
 minutes until I felt they were fine 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.900
 crunchy smell delicious I think that 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:22.200
 it's for the tammar and that gives them that smell 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.959
 so rich and another thing that I forgot 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:29.180
 tell them at the beginning a thousand apologies is not 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:32.629
 corn flour I think I translated it wrong 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.340
 is with me then really do not create 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:37.219
 which is like cornmeal like the one 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.490
 you use for tortillas are like more than 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:41.730
 nothing 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:44.130
 little pieces of corn so if you have left 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.830
 as well as with a little bit of the rest of the 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:50.060
 corn do not think it's flour is the 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:54.140
 crushed corn and good this 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:57.230
 is very very rich and I'm dying to try them 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.440
 the truth I will accompany you with a 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.810
 marinated salsita that is in one of my 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.520
 previous videos of a pasta but also 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.250
 you can serve it with the cat your date in 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.650
 house that is super rich too and they 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.920
 It gives like a very rich flavor it can 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.870
 Serve with tahini dressing or when 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.269
 with any other sauce that you like 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.650
 but I find that the combination with 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.650
 tomato is great 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.200
 when you touch the avocados you feel that 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:34.020
 they are crispy they feel hard 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.200
 and the aroma is really very very 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.680
 nice 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:42.990
 well then I have here now my 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.990
 avocados ready as you can see 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.750
 they look super rich they 're like that 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.660
 great to share with your 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.780
 family to take them to any 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:58.000
 meeting and with your permission I'm going to 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.000
 try because if I crave a lot 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.120
 Wow 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.900
 it's great 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:14.619
 outside they have a very crispy capita and 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:17.139
 inside they are super soft yet 

00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:20.360
 combined with the tomato sauce 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:23.509
 wow they taste really delicious 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.699
 to these delicious and the truth I think 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:27.800
 that you will like a lot is a 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:30.289
 new way to serve vegetables for 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.110
 share them with your family and if not 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:36.770
 he will find me 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:39.020
 you can use some kind of for example 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.639
 almond flour also like 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.860
 Burn it in almonds I think that 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:45.110
 They would be excellent too and it's more 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.120
 easy to find it or even flour 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.490
 of coconut but I'm not sure so no 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.620
 do not believe me because I have not tried it but 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.900
 I do not doubt that it would be just as good in 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.719
 case you do not find this with milk and 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.330
 I tell them and tell me please what 

00:05:56.719 --> 00:06:02.000
