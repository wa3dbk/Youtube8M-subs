but the skin is fine so the fat goes
through<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.360> process<00:01:21.509> called<00:01:21.900> apoptosis<00:01:22.520> which

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
through a process called apoptosis which

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.210 
through a process called apoptosis which
is<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> way<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.450> cells<00:01:24.720> guy<00:01:25.020> get<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.799> one<00:01:28.220> how

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
is a way the cells guy get this one how

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.609 
is a way the cells guy get this one how
many<00:01:29.280> treatments<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:30.150> treatment<00:01:30.509> -<00:01:30.840> mm-hmm

so where does the fat go the lymphatic

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.580 
so where does the fat go the lymphatic

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
system absorbs the dead fat cells and

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.389 
system absorbs the dead fat cells and
you<00:01:41.040> eliminate<00:01:41.310> them<00:01:41.790> naturally<00:01:42.420> okay<00:01:43.399> it's

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
you eliminate them naturally okay it's

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.609 
you eliminate them naturally okay it's
the<00:01:44.520> same<00:01:44.759> way<00:01:44.939> as<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.180> do<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> back<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.500> you'll

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.720 

this<00:02:40.110> is<00:02:40.260> just<00:02:40.409> a<00:02:40.470> skin<00:02:40.739> protector<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.489> skin

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
this is just a skin protector the skin

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.880 
this is just a skin protector the skin
is<00:02:41.849> protected<00:02:42.000> carefully<00:02:42.810> so<00:02:43.200> only<00:02:43.439> the<00:02:43.680> fat

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
is protected carefully so only the fat

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.270 
is protected carefully so only the fat
cells<00:02:44.189> die<00:02:44.689> so<00:02:45.689> this<00:02:45.870> is<00:02:46.049> just<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.620> liner<00:02:46.860> so

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.460 
cells die so this is just the liner so
it's<00:02:47.459> just<00:02:47.579> kind<00:02:47.849> of<00:02:48.110> it's<00:02:49.110> like<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.260> little
