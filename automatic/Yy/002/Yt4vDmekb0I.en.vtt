00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:23.830 
and dissect a little bit and see where I

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.400 
and dissect a little bit and see where I
can<00:00:24.040> improve<00:00:24.279> that<00:00:24.340> and<00:00:24.760> you<00:00:25.270> know<00:00:25.410> decision

can improve that and you know decision
making<00:00:26.680> was<00:00:26.800> definitely<00:00:27.190> one<00:00:27.340> of<00:00:27.369> those

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
making was definitely one of those

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.960 
making was definitely one of those
things<00:00:27.699> you<00:00:28.449> know<00:00:29.039> improving<00:00:30.039> mechanics<00:00:30.580> and
