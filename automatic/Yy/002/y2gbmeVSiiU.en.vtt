that's<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.359> only<00:02:52.540> place<00:02:52.930> only<00:02:53.319> thing<00:02:53.590> on<00:02:53.709> this

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
that's the only place only thing on this

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.520 
that's the only place only thing on this
whole<00:02:54.010> unit<00:02:54.280> that<00:02:54.370> I<00:02:54.430> would<00:02:54.609> have<00:02:54.730> improved<00:02:55.030> on

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
whole unit that I would have improved on

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.890 
whole unit that I would have improved on
it<00:02:56.530> was<00:02:56.650> up<00:02:56.769> to<00:02:56.859> me<00:02:56.980> able<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.280> design<00:02:57.549> a<00:02:58.329> couple

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
it was up to me able to design a couple

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.940 
it was up to me able to design a couple
holes<00:02:59.079> or<00:02:59.319> slots<00:02:59.620> in<00:03:00.160> these<00:03:00.400> rings<00:03:01.739> maybe<00:03:02.739> in

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
holes or slots in these rings maybe in

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.190 
holes or slots in these rings maybe in
this<00:03:03.160> little<00:03:04.350> plate<00:03:05.519> but<00:03:07.019> basically<00:03:08.019> your

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
this little plate but basically your

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.539 
this little plate but basically your
guts<00:03:08.349> collection<00:03:08.739> comes<00:03:08.920> around<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.310> spindle

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
guts collection comes around the spindle

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.460 
guts collection comes around the spindle
and<00:03:09.819> through<00:03:10.450> these<00:03:10.599> little<00:03:10.840> grooves<00:03:11.109> in<00:03:11.380> the

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
and through these little grooves in the

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.210 
and through these little grooves in the
back<00:03:11.650> and<00:03:12.840> that's<00:03:13.840> okay<00:03:14.079> you<00:03:14.769> don't<00:03:14.859> have<00:03:15.069> all

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
back and that's okay you don't have all

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.490 
back and that's okay you don't have all
that<00:03:15.250> dust<00:03:15.549> flying<00:03:15.880> in<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.180> air<00:03:16.359> but<00:03:17.230> you

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
that dust flying in the air but you

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.259 
that dust flying in the air but you
might<00:03:17.829> have<00:03:18.040> a<00:03:18.069> little<00:03:18.340> bit<00:03:18.430> of<00:03:18.459> cumulating<00:03:19.180> on

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
might have a little bit of cumulating on

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.379 
might have a little bit of cumulating on
the<00:03:19.359> top<00:03:20.489> another<00:03:21.489> nice<00:03:21.730> thing<00:03:21.760> about<00:03:21.970> this

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
the top another nice thing about this

that's very unique the belt is super
unique<00:03:26.799> to<00:03:27.069> these<00:03:27.220> units<00:03:27.579> but<00:03:28.180> another<00:03:28.419> thing

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
unique to these units but another thing

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.089 
unique to these units but another thing
is<00:03:28.690> you<00:03:28.959> have<00:03:29.139> a<00:03:29.169> tilting<00:03:29.590> table<00:03:30.630> so<00:03:31.860> you<00:03:32.860> can

is you have a tilting table so you can

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:35.880 
is you have a tilting table so you can
set<00:03:33.340> yourself<00:03:33.489> you<00:03:34.480> know<00:03:34.569> 45<00:03:35.110> they<00:03:35.319> have<00:03:35.439> these
