 file It is 4 channels, and capsule lock seed 07 is turned 4 times and 2 of them are 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.610
 It was a lock seed of the title 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.940
 Unfortunately, both were normal versions and I did not have led version

 The official name of this rock seed is Otsu rock seed 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:33.290
 It seems to be a Tajadol Combo Otsu Rock Seed is always 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:39.660
 There are pom pos and punks, so it's already the third type and this time it's gold 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:43.110

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.690
 How to open the lock is the usual legend 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:55.839
 And when it opens it becomes clear parts 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:58.479
 Both the upper and lower medals are loaded, and the upper driver is loaded with Takak Jak Condor medals. 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:02.680

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:18.420
 Oh yeah, the clock seed is a bit subtle, so Tajadol is nice 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.420
 In it in conjunction with the Sengoku driver makeover 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.080
