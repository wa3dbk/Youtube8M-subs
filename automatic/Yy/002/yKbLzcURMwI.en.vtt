this is his entertainment for the trip
it's<00:04:58.070> really<00:04:58.310> unfortunate<00:04:58.610> though<00:04:59.000> we<00:04:59.150> can't

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
it's really unfortunate though we can't

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.660 
it's really unfortunate though we can't
take<00:04:59.570> this<00:04:59.780> good-looking<00:05:00.260> boy<00:05:00.950> out<00:05:01.190> there<00:05:01.430> and

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
take this good-looking boy out there and

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.750 
take this good-looking boy out there and
let<00:05:02.120> him<00:05:02.180> explore<00:05:02.600> a<00:05:02.630> little<00:05:02.810> bit<00:05:03.020> more<00:05:03.610> but<00:05:04.610> he

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
let him explore a little bit more but he

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.310 
let him explore a little bit more but he
would<00:05:04.880> be<00:05:04.910> dog<00:05:05.750> food<00:05:06.550> to<00:05:07.550> a<00:05:07.580> bear<00:05:08.110> and<00:05:09.110> if<00:05:09.200> you

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
would be dog food to a bear and if you

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.980 
would be dog food to a bear and if you
guys<00:05:09.470> haven't<00:05:09.830> seen<00:05:10.010> the<00:05:10.480> the<00:05:11.480> other<00:05:11.630> video

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
guys haven't seen the the other video

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.200 
guys haven't seen the the other video
yet<00:05:12.260> I<00:05:12.470> got<00:05:12.650> a<00:05:12.680> really<00:05:13.310> good<00:05:13.610> footage<00:05:13.880> of<00:05:14.150> a

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
yet I got a really good footage of a

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.110 
yet I got a really good footage of a
grizzly<00:05:14.570> bear<00:05:14.600> tearing<00:05:15.140> into<00:05:15.290> a<00:05:15.520> bison<00:05:16.520> corpse

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
grizzly bear tearing into a bison corpse

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.630 
grizzly bear tearing into a bison corpse
and<00:05:17.620> that<00:05:18.620> was<00:05:18.740> some<00:05:18.860> pretty<00:05:18.980> neat<00:05:19.250> footage

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
and that was some pretty neat footage

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.980 
and that was some pretty neat footage
and<00:05:19.820> unfortunately<00:05:20.360> I<00:05:20.390> guess<00:05:20.480> if<00:05:20.660> we<00:05:20.750> spent<00:05:20.960> a

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
and unfortunately I guess if we spent a

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.120 
and unfortunately I guess if we spent a
lot<00:05:21.140> of<00:05:21.170> time<00:05:21.380> out<00:05:21.470> of<00:05:21.560> the<00:05:21.620> truck<00:05:21.860> and<00:05:22.040> on

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
lot of time out of the truck and on

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.240 
lot of time out of the truck and on
hikes<00:05:22.400> and<00:05:22.760> trails<00:05:23.030> and<00:05:23.330> they<00:05:24.260> specifically

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
hikes and trails and they specifically

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.010 
hikes and trails and they specifically
say<00:05:25.580> in<00:05:25.760> the<00:05:25.850> Yellowstone<00:05:26.270> Park<00:05:26.570> that<00:05:26.840> all

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
say in the Yellowstone Park that all

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.900 
say in the Yellowstone Park that all
animals<00:05:27.350> are<00:05:27.680> prohibited<00:05:28.220> on<00:05:28.340> trails<00:05:28.670> they

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
animals are prohibited on trails they

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.280 
animals are prohibited on trails they
have<00:05:29.060> to<00:05:29.210> pretty<00:05:29.360> much<00:05:29.540> stay<00:05:29.810> around<00:05:30.080> the

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
have to pretty much stay around the

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.870 
have to pretty much stay around the
trailer<00:05:30.650> themselves<00:05:31.220> because<00:05:31.550> they<00:05:31.730> are

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
trailer themselves because they are

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.180 
trailer themselves because they are
their<00:05:32.420> prey<00:05:32.690> for<00:05:32.750> the<00:05:32.990> animals<00:05:33.890> that<00:05:33.980> live<00:05:34.160> in

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
their prey for the animals that live in

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.700 
their prey for the animals that live in
the<00:05:34.310> area

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
the area

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.560 
the area
so<00:05:36.710> unfortunately<00:05:37.160> bear<00:05:37.820> is<00:05:37.970> kind<00:05:38.210> of<00:05:38.300> stuck

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
so unfortunately bear is kind of stuck

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.990 
so unfortunately bear is kind of stuck
at<00:05:38.720> the<00:05:38.840> trailer<00:05:39.200> around<00:05:39.950> the<00:05:40.340> trailer<00:05:40.700> we'll
