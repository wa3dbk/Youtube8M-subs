means reloading so it'll tell you when
it's<00:01:53.549> free<00:01:53.700> Lord<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.420> just<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.689> show<00:01:54.840> you

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
it's free Lord in and just to show you

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.990 
it's free Lord in and just to show you
these<00:01:55.049> guns<00:01:55.350> do<00:01:55.590> work<00:01:55.829> this<00:01:56.340> one's<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.700> sniper

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
these guns do work this one's the sniper

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.880 
these guns do work this one's the sniper
so<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.390> zombie<00:01:57.780> there<00:01:57.960> even<00:01:58.710> though<00:01:58.799> it

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
so that zombie there even though it

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.100 
so that zombie there even though it
looks<00:01:59.040> like<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.280> bullets<00:01:59.520> are<00:01:59.640> curving

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
looks like the bullets are curving

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.780 
looks like the bullets are curving
they're<00:02:01.110> not<00:02:01.229> actually<00:02:01.710> curving<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.490> bullets

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
they're not actually curving the bullets

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.940 
they're not actually curving the bullets
are<00:02:02.969> going<00:02:03.329> straight<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:04.110> don't<00:02:04.380> be<00:02:04.469> fooled<00:02:04.680> by

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
are going straight so don't be fooled by

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.740 
are going straight so don't be fooled by
that<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.549> bullets<00:02:05.850> do<00:02:06.000> go<00:02:06.240> straight<00:02:06.600> now

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
that the bullets do go straight now

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.089 
that the bullets do go straight now
let's<00:02:06.930> take<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.200> look<00:02:07.380> at<00:02:07.530> some<00:02:07.710> more<00:02:07.860> guns

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
let's take a look at some more guns

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.640 
let's take a look at some more guns
we've<00:02:08.970> got<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.239> ak-47<00:02:11.780> see<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:13.020> is<00:02:13.290> going

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
we've got the ak-47 see it is going

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.149 
we've got the ak-47 see it is going
straight<00:02:14.090> we've<00:02:15.090> got<00:02:15.239> a<00:02:15.269> Python<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:16.099> don't<00:02:17.099> know

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
straight we've got a Python I don't know

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.259 
straight we've got a Python I don't know
where<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.370> pythons<00:02:17.760> gonna<00:02:17.879> reach<00:02:18.060> this

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
where the pythons gonna reach this

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:18.920 
where the pythons gonna reach this
distance

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
distance

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.539 
distance
yeah<00:02:19.409> the<00:02:19.470> Python<00:02:19.890> will<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.860> we<00:02:23.040> roll<00:02:23.159> bullets

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
yeah the Python will and we roll bullets

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.000 
yeah the Python will and we roll bullets
though<00:02:24.060> we've<00:02:24.299> got<00:02:24.480> flashbangs<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.650> frag

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
though we've got flashbangs and frag

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.330 
though we've got flashbangs and frag
grenades<00:02:26.400> let's<00:02:26.760> talk<00:02:26.909> a<00:02:26.939> frag<00:02:27.239> grenade<00:02:27.510> him

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
grenades let's talk a frag grenade him

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.349 
grenades let's talk a frag grenade him
that's<00:02:29.340> gonna<00:02:29.519> call<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:29.849> and<00:02:30.709> as<00:02:31.709> you<00:02:32.099> can<00:02:32.220> see

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:32.359 
that's gonna call it and as you can see

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:36.679 
that's gonna call it and as you can see
they<00:02:33.359> work<00:02:33.569> perfectly<00:02:34.459> nor<00:02:35.540> mishaps<00:02:36.540> or

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:36.689 
they work perfectly nor mishaps or

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.490 
they work perfectly nor mishaps or
anything<00:02:37.189> we've<00:02:38.189> got<00:02:38.489> to<00:02:38.670> c4<00:02:39.299> and<00:02:39.720> we've<00:02:40.319> got

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
anything we've got to c4 and we've got

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.759 
anything we've got to c4 and we've got
nothing<00:02:40.829> now<00:02:40.980> we've<00:02:41.189> got<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.340> spider<00:02:41.700> over<00:02:41.909> here

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
nothing now we've got a spider over here

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.879 
nothing now we've got a spider over here
bit<00:02:43.769> of<00:02:43.859> c4<00:02:45.079> this<00:02:46.079> one's<00:02:46.290> on<00:02:46.440> very<00:02:46.709> nicely

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889 
bit of c4 this one's on very nicely

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:47.539 
bit of c4 this one's on very nicely
actually

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
actually

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.020 
actually
all<00:02:48.090> right<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.269> see<00:02:48.450> for<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.840> place<00:02:49.079> it<00:02:49.290> down

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
all right you see for you place it down

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.990 
all right you see for you place it down
they<00:02:51.030> in<00:02:51.180> boom<00:02:51.650> so<00:02:52.650> but<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.549> one<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:53.730> like<00:02:53.970> the

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
they in boom so but the one I like the

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.349 
they in boom so but the one I like the
best

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
best

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.720 
best
Oh<00:02:54.450> we'll<00:02:54.900> look<00:02:55.019> at<00:02:55.139> flashbangs<00:02:55.829> first<00:02:56.159> or

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
Oh we'll look at flashbangs first or

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.190 
Oh we'll look at flashbangs first or
flashbang<00:02:57.150> this<00:02:57.299> dung<00:02:57.510> beetles<00:02:57.810> at<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:57.989> same

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
flashbang this dung beetles at the same

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.530 
flashbang this dung beetles at the same
time<00:02:58.500> as<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:59.189> can<00:02:59.340> see<00:02:59.519> flashbangs<00:03:00.209> worked

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
time as you can see flashbangs worked

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.199 
time as you can see flashbangs worked
and<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:00.900> was<00:03:01.079> off<00:03:01.459> after<00:03:02.459> think<00:03:02.819> it's<00:03:02.939> five

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
and it was off after think it's five

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.520 
and it was off after think it's five
seconds<00:03:03.720> let's<00:03:04.049> just<00:03:04.230> find<00:03:04.409> that<00:03:04.560> out<00:03:06.530> it's

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
seconds let's just find that out it's

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.559 
seconds let's just find that out it's
not<00:03:07.650> gonna<00:03:07.799> tell<00:03:08.069> me<00:03:08.220> is<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:08.370> yeah<00:03:09.180> it's<00:03:09.329> five

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
not gonna tell me is it yeah it's five

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.899 
not gonna tell me is it yeah it's five
seconds<00:03:10.139> it'll<00:03:10.319> wear<00:03:10.470> off<00:03:10.639> but<00:03:11.639> the<00:03:11.730> one<00:03:11.879> I

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
seconds it'll wear off but the one I

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:13.970 
seconds it'll wear off but the one I
really<00:03:12.180> do<00:03:12.359> like<00:03:12.569> and<00:03:12.930> you'll<00:03:13.560> understand<00:03:13.950> why

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
really do like and you'll understand why

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.640 
really do like and you'll understand why
in<00:03:14.159> a<00:03:14.280> minute<00:03:14.370> is<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:15.109> airstrike<00:03:16.109> very<00:03:16.409> nicely

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
in a minute is the airstrike very nicely

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.179 
in a minute is the airstrike very nicely
done

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:17.189 
done

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:18.680 
done
as<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:17.489> can<00:03:17.579> see<00:03:17.879> light<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.389> they'll<00:03:18.510> come

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
as you can see light and they'll come

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.960 
as you can see light and they'll come
down<00:03:18.720> with<00:03:19.019> it<00:03:19.139> airstrike<00:03:19.530> starting<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.430> then

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
down with it airstrike starting and then

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.490 
down with it airstrike starting and then
the<00:03:21.180> airstrike<00:03:21.720> will<00:03:21.870> come

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
the airstrike will come

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.220 
the airstrike will come
so<00:03:23.370> this<00:03:24.299> poking<00:03:24.660> is<00:03:24.720> definitely<00:03:25.049> worth

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
so this poking is definitely worth

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.119 
so this poking is definitely worth
having<00:03:25.620> on<00:03:26.489> your<00:03:26.730> server<00:03:27.060> if<00:03:27.329> it's<00:03:27.540> like<00:03:27.750> my

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
having on your server if it's like my

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.970 
having on your server if it's like my
just<00:03:29.129> a<00:03:29.190> faction<00:03:29.639> server<00:03:30.319> boy<00:03:31.349> I've<00:03:31.590> mixed<00:03:31.799> it

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
just a faction server boy I've mixed it

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.640 
just a faction server boy I've mixed it
up<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.190> bit<00:03:32.370> I've<00:03:32.579> added<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:32.879> bit<00:03:33.000> of<00:03:33.590> sort<00:03:34.590> of

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
up a bit I've added a bit of sort of

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.800 
up a bit I've added a bit of sort of
first-person<00:03:34.980> shooter<00:03:35.579> to<00:03:35.760> it<00:03:35.879> and<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.690> best

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
first-person shooter to it and the best

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.420 
first-person shooter to it and the best
bit<00:03:37.019> about<00:03:37.049> what<00:03:37.349> it's<00:03:37.680> not<00:03:37.949> overpowered

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
bit about what it's not overpowered

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.399 
bit about what it's not overpowered
because<00:03:38.549> it's<00:03:38.760> not<00:03:38.940> like<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:40.049> can<00:03:40.199> just<00:03:40.230> go

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
because it's not like you can just go

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:41.899 
because it's not like you can just go
around<00:03:40.859> and<00:03:41.069> start<00:03:41.129> destroying<00:03:41.489> people's

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:41.909 
around and start destroying people's

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:44.059 
around and start destroying people's
worlds<00:03:42.329> for<00:03:42.989> instance<00:03:43.319> I'm<00:03:43.470> actually<00:03:43.650> in<00:03:43.919> the

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
worlds for instance I'm actually in the

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.479 
worlds for instance I'm actually in the
wilderness<00:03:44.250> now<00:03:44.669> I<00:03:44.699> think<00:03:45.470> find<00:03:46.470> out<00:03:46.739> they

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
wilderness now I think find out they

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:48.860 
wilderness now I think find out they
will<00:03:47.579> go<00:03:47.699> within<00:03:47.909> the<00:03:48.120> wilderness<00:03:48.510> will<00:03:48.659> throw

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
will go within the wilderness will throw

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.149 
will go within the wilderness will throw
down<00:03:49.049> an<00:03:49.139> airstrike<00:03:49.530> and<00:03:49.590> it<00:03:49.799> won't<00:03:49.979> actually

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
down an airstrike and it won't actually

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.969 
down an airstrike and it won't actually
destroy<00:03:50.639> the<00:03:50.790> land<00:03:50.940> around<00:03:51.209> it<00:03:51.479> so<00:03:52.139> it's<00:03:52.769> not

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:52.979 
destroy the land around it so it's not

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:56.240 
destroy the land around it so it's not
all<00:03:53.190> the<00:03:53.459> powered<00:03:53.849> but<00:03:54.810> it<00:03:55.260> is<00:03:55.949> like<00:03:56.220> a

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
all the powered but it is like a

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.080 
all the powered but it is like a
one-shot<00:03:56.760> kill

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
one-shot kill

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.479 
one-shot kill
so<00:03:57.659> yeah<00:03:57.900> but<00:03:58.590> as<00:03:58.650> you<00:03:58.709> can<00:03:58.829> see<00:03:59.040> it<00:03:59.340> won't

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
so yeah but as you can see it won't

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:00.890 
so yeah but as you can see it won't
destroy<00:03:59.879> the<00:04:00.000> world<00:04:00.180> I<00:04:00.389> think<00:04:00.690> you<00:04:00.780> can

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
destroy the world I think you can

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.539 
destroy the world I think you can
actually<00:04:01.139> enable<00:04:01.379> it<00:04:01.680> to<00:04:01.859> destroy<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.370> world

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
actually enable it to destroy the world

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.390 
actually enable it to destroy the world
but<00:04:02.940> that<00:04:03.180> causes<00:04:03.629> a<00:04:03.659> lot<00:04:03.840> of<00:04:03.930> lag<00:04:04.400> especially

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
but that causes a lot of lag especially

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.899 
but that causes a lot of lag especially
when<00:04:05.549> you're<00:04:05.669> using<00:04:05.819> like<00:04:06.060> 1015<00:04:06.870> airstrikes

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:07.909 
when you're using like 1015 airstrikes

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:11.750 
when you're using like 1015 airstrikes
them<00:04:08.909> you<00:04:09.150> get<00:04:09.269> booby<00:04:09.720> traps<00:04:10.109> and<00:04:10.590> you<00:04:11.430> can<00:04:11.609> get

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
them you get booby traps and you can get

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.210 
them you get booby traps and you can get
landmines<00:04:12.299> as<00:04:12.510> well<00:04:12.690> so<00:04:13.530> go<00:04:13.859> and<00:04:13.919> check<00:04:13.979> out

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220
