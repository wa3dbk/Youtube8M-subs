00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.459 
actually going to be post commentated
even<00:00:37.270> though<00:00:37.360> it<00:00:37.420> is<00:00:37.510> my<00:00:37.719> contract<00:00:38.140> that<00:00:38.200> video

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:38.469 
even though it is my contract that video

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:40.889 
even though it is my contract that video
mainly<00:00:38.680> because<00:00:38.920> it's<00:00:39.640> not<00:00:39.879> really<00:00:40.390> a<00:00:40.570> mocking

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 
mainly because it's not really a mocking

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.520 
mainly because it's not really a mocking
trackpad<00:00:41.320> video<00:00:41.559> to<00:00:41.739> begin<00:00:42.039> with<00:00:42.840> but<00:00:43.840> you

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
trackpad video to begin with but you

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.779 
trackpad video to begin with but you
know<00:00:44.649> there's<00:00:44.829> nothing<00:00:45.129> that's<00:00:45.280> stopping<00:00:45.550> it

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:45.789 
know there's nothing that's stopping it

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:47.459 
know there's nothing that's stopping it
from<00:00:45.820> becoming<00:00:46.239> a<00:00:46.570> more<00:00:46.719> contract<00:00:47.110> by<00:00:47.199> video

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469 
from becoming a more contract by video

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.049 
from becoming a more contract by video
so<00:00:47.620> I'll<00:00:47.680> guess<00:00:47.890> I'll<00:00:48.010> just<00:00:48.070> call<00:00:48.489> it<00:00:48.640> that

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
so I'll guess I'll just call it that

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:50.790 
so I'll guess I'll just call it that
because<00:00:49.329> yeah<00:00:49.690> that's<00:00:49.930> what<00:00:50.110> my<00:00:50.140> channel<00:00:50.590> news

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
see how um we'll see how that works all

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.900 
see how um we'll see how that works all
the<00:04:11.500> way<00:04:11.620> that's<00:04:11.829> always<00:04:12.280> gonna<00:04:12.400> say<00:04:12.639> which<00:04:12.880> is

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
the way that's always gonna say which is

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.059 
the way that's always gonna say which is
why<00:04:13.180> you<00:04:13.660> know<00:04:13.780> I<00:04:14.049> wasn't<00:04:14.620> gonna<00:04:14.739> make<00:04:14.889> this<00:04:15.010> a

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
why you know I wasn't gonna make this a

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:16.740 
why you know I wasn't gonna make this a
proper<00:04:15.489> ma<00:04:15.609> contract<00:04:16.000> I<00:04:16.060> video<00:04:16.329> but<00:04:16.510> I<00:04:16.570> guess

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750
