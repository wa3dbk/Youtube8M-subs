00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:42.880 
kinds of or face times for instance if I

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:51.870 
kinds of or face times for instance if I
say<00:00:48.450> fits<00:00:49.450> everything<00:00:49.840> that<00:00:50.260> is<00:00:50.440> just<00:00:50.710> in<00:00:50.860> C<00:00:51.100> so

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:51.880 
say fits everything that is just in C so
