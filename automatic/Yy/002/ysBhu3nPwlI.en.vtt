00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.940
 i 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.300
 very good everyone here I bring you this 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.990
 video that comes out from a good one is 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.189
 an improvised video before knowing about 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.650
 all the steps I said earlier 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.750
 in the index, it is a video that comes out 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.420
 root of a question that I liked 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.510
 pretty sorry and it's about the subject of 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.650
 overclock it's worth to give it a 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:49.699
 definition is basically increase 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:51.980
 something I repeat something because of what 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.829
 which is the new gigahertz cpu of the 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.649
 own cpu but it can also be done 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:01.399
 quietly with the gpu but I repeat 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:04.970
 that not all, not all, nor all 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:08.300
 those of the brushes sorry neither 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:12.830
 the gpu therefore this is something like 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:15.050
 as a market is worth and good is more than 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.780
 nothing that's worth I wanted to say that is what 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.970
 is to overclock or increase better 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.159
 said in Spanish because the gigahertz 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.189
 of the cpu 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.140
 not all can repeat now I can you 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:30.560
 say sorry this error comes out 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.590
 lately quite and good memory 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.609
 I've updated the geforce pro but 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.840
 I do not see it, it does not work out, I do not know 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:41.740
 solve this problem forgive me now 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.109
 I am and well simply if you want to see 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.939
 if your cpu may or may not be 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:49.909
 normally the versions this I do 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.920
 with the windows tabulator the versions 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.020
 normally here are the ones that can be 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.670
 leave the link calm do not kill us 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.189
 to see them leave the link in the 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.560
 description are usually the k 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.020
 what can be done overclock 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.179
 and the theme of the government issue I think is 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.879
 very difficult to do it we go that in the 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:09.829
 normal the tlc that are normal and 

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:11.180
 the little things you can see I do not know 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:12.670
 about the series that are usually burned 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.049
 It is not enough and not as described 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.299
 They also do not bring the option 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:20.329
 to do it or that is partly in 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:23.239
 vain the almost that brings the option is much 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:25.160
 easier to do it never and neither 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.569
 you may not believe that you can because I've 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.180
 seen in forums that puts that you can 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.120
 be duplicate the overclock and that would be 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.840
 already brutal it would be more like having 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.329
 an order of 300,000 degrees on your pc that 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.880
 nothing and good that's just something I 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:43.190
 I remind you that at the most I have reached 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.069
 put a five and if I'm not wrong 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.750
 21 percent and it was burning let's 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.700
 that is, you can not reach 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.310
 duplicate not even 50 percent of 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.760
 what are the gigahertz examples 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:59.150
 if it has 39 gigahertz 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.849
 example you can upload it up to 4 voucher 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.459
 but be tired of 44 and something is 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.080
 enforce the cpi therefore it is 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.030
 less time that will last you than the 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.860
 components are also resistant to 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.660
 the heat but there are materials that 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.370
 melt then let's say it at a temperature 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.010
 no and when they reach that temperature 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.769
 because that one melts and obviously that makes 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.440
 that the life of the gpu cpu can also 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:24.140
 It is shorter then be not then the 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.739
 people are not going to do them enough and one 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.930
 the question was if I cpi my good 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.239
 plate are to overclock if it is 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.640
 they are really to overclock but not 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:38.180
 I have no forgiveness, I do not plan to do it 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:41.299
 now but rather when when it happens 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.950
 maybe since a better time already 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.780
 now because there is not very much worth 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.450
 the truth zero see with what I have 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.580
 Well, if I can not show you this is 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.260
 windows 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.430
 and test tube of system properties 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.890
 sorry 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.060
 and well here you can see what what 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.530
 we have good now there is another updated 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.000
 they have to update again the 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.010
 evaluation I do not do but when I 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.620
 I update then I get the same note 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.810
 I do not know what happens to the truth this 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.659
 des original windows as you will all have 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.010
 seen I guess the original CD but I do not know 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:14.780
 why give me this error I guess 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.340
 they will have to authorize something to delete some 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.870
 component that will leave here little new 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.900
 or something similar then good as you see 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.300
 here I have 15 3,570 here it is worth the here 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.430
 is that it can be done or overclock sorry 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.590
 but no no I'm not going to do it for 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.550
 now it's not not unnecessary it's something that 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.070
 it's not worth it 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.039
 for now let's say it so it's for 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:37.849
 finish what is left of pro of the cpu 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:39.919
 for ends already of what is your life not 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:41.770
 obviously a cpu can not last all 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.300
 life today computer science is 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.039
 quite advanced although we are not in 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.169
 the point that we say everything is 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:49.729
 quite futuristic can still be improved 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.569
 much more equipment and only all the 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.849
 the world knows 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:55.349
 but hey it's nothing else this is this is 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:57.749
 just do overclocking and as I have 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:59.759
 said also to me also has the 

00:04:57.749 --> 00:05:01.740
 versions that can be overclocked 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:04.319
 or increase say so in the 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.669
 giants of the CPU and the examples 

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:06.779
 they can also, although not all 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:11.159
 normally those that are 

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:12.869
 like my example gtx 670 or is coming 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:14.909
 made from factory with overclock so 

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:18.419
 you can not increase it so much 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:20.580
 a lot although if they bring quite a 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:23.849
 dissipation if not if I was not wrong the 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.349
 word is so good but I do not know 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:27.270
 you can increase let's say it like that in a 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:28.889
 too high percentage not and with 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.369
 the graphics cards as something happens 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:31.080
 similar 

00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:32.759
 let's say you can not get to 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.729
 increase both the power that already 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:37.699
 has no and well just so what 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.869
 I would say Ameneh also has its 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:42.059
 brushes that can be made overclock 

00:05:39.869 --> 00:05:44.399
 quietly they are usually black 

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:47.309
 edition is worth it is like the version 

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:49.050
 good of the cpu is that there are let's say that 

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:51.179
 it's like the high-end but not you 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:54.240
 you confuse because for example in intel 

00:05:51.179 --> 00:05:56.999
 here we have the categories that there are not and 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.449
 We have a third second 

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:59.449
 I will put 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:01.949
 the links so you can keep an eye 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:04.409
 as it is here we have the third i7 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:06.979
 generation and the i5 example we 're going to 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:06.979
 open both 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:12.380
 let's put here better to make it look 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:14.810
 better and as you can see the i5 also has 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.450
 their versions their versions in this case 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:20.480
 this is mine that is made in 22 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:22.250
 nanometers this is mine in my case 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.020
 It is also ko 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.210
 that is to say that I am telling you that in 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.460
 each category there may be one or two 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.160
 houses normally if it is and five then 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.760
 there will be some 17 because there will usually be 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:36.800
 one or more in this in this generation 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.440
 here not all the cpsc there are of 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.750
 17 nor are the 65 really 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.720
 many more but here I do not know why not 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.760
 we all come out let's say it's for something 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.220
 of distribution or whatever but not 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.410
 all come out and the example in most 

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.730
 there are two or three that can be 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.670
 do overclock quietly but 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:58.970
 I repeat is not is not something to double what 

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:02.090
 who forgave the giants of the cpe or 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:04.540
 which is to say that it increases by 15 a 10 15 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:07.630
 let's say as much 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.280
 20 and I risk telling the truth 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.740
 I risk quite a bit since it's not 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.660
 recommended and it is necessary to dispel the 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:16.240
 heat pretty well and that it be a 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.830
 plate that can also resist then the 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.960
 reed not that you're going to put the team 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:22.600
 but another thing that I wanted to tell you is 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:24.580
 that is not worth it as the 

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.200
 applications if you 'll put the 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.060
 desktop better since the applications 

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:30.100
 itself are made for one or two 

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.270
 nuclei and nowadays the games are not 

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.010
 they ask as much as they carry motors 

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:35.800
 pretty advanced graphics therefore 

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:37.210
 no need to force yes yes with what 

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.650
 has already goes well is to say that this is 

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.930
 like the jaguar you buy for your 

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:43.000
 own equipment is not worth looking 

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:45.310
 another that error does not see the pain shares what 

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.040
 better yes with the medium good you can already 

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:49.870
 throw calmly and perfectly the 

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:52.540
 trick is in knowing how to buy not in 

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:54.880
 buy in good quantity that 's all 

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.590
 kids was just to give a 

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.480
 little information about this already 

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.980
 that seemed like a good question 

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.570
 good you know that you can comment more 

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:04.300
 you can leave your doubts I do not care 

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:06.250
 if you give like dais whatever it is I do not care 

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:08.500
 just comment what you think and 

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:11.289
 leave your opinion I only ask you 

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:13.360
 I do not ask for neither favorites nor 

00:08:11.289 --> 00:08:16.409
 and that gives me the same good not only of 

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.409
 kids until next time
