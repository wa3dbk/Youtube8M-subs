 A smaller bar asked me about it and 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.669
 so let 's play and analyze 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.170
 and 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.920
 everything 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:16.320
 so the first chord we have in C minor 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.890
 yes m but we take it without a nameless 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.710
 fingertips 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:25.280
 since we will need to play a touch 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.280
 then play 4 3 2 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.780

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.110

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.340
 played first and went 2 3 2 1 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.819

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:32.950
 understandable with the first time 2 will play 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.950

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:45.390
 farther again chord b flat but we 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.390
 playing bass strings and third and second 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.190

 and the second and third play together after 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.569
 of this 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:21.049
 remove the little finger he plays a note in 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.049
 the bar 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:32.950
 pull down the finger on the second string and 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.950
 mass plays on. 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.180
 clear after we removed 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:44.289
 little finger 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.289
 play the third string 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:05:00.530

00:04:50.990 --> 00:05:02.710
 two strings 5 ​​4 strings 8 fret again 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.710
 at first 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:11.889
 the choice we have these notes remain with us 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:17.280
 there is 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:17.280
 and chord a a major 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:24.150
 play the sixth 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:24.150
 fourth third 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.360
 first second 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:34.710

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.710
 fourth and sixth 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:58.190
 that's all slow 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:58.190
 part farther there will be a guitar fight 

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:05.310
 see how slowly I play it 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:10.009
 I picked up more like this 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:10.009
 option see maybe you will like it 

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:19.930
 look slowly 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:19.930
 1 2 3 by 3 make the emphasis louder 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:27.099
 i'm down again and up 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.410
 even so probably 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:05.010
 there there there is the fact that it is something that so 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.010
 it turns out 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:22.030
 yes we have chords 

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:25.360
 there are chords for this fight 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:33.070
 Rami burrows in C major and 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:38.050
 B flat then there will be a chord f 

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:38.680
 and gently a and there will be a place in front 

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.220
 pause 

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:46.580
 there will be played exactly 

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:46.580
 Here he is taken from a chord 

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:53.550
 little finger press the first second 

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:56.230
 string and index fourth and third 

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:59.920
 on the second fret 

00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:00.520
 a chord from base note is played from 5 

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.450
 strings and 

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.450
 whether notes 

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:13.060
 This is the code we get here 

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:13.060
 I wish you all the best of success for the time being
