Harden's<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:27.060> think<00:00:27.660> this<00:00:27.900> jumper<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.529> lot

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
Harden's I think this jumper is a lot

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.040 
Harden's I think this jumper is a lot
more<00:00:29.039> fast<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:30.000> lot<00:00:30.240> more<00:00:30.269> smooth<00:00:30.840> and

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
more fast it is a lot more smooth and

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.350 
more fast it is a lot more smooth and
hopefully<00:00:31.769> all<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.369> meaning<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.329> is

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
hopefully all of that meaning that it is

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.389 
hopefully all of that meaning that it is
going<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.780> be<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:33.989> little<00:00:34.590> bit<00:00:34.770> more<00:00:34.980> easy<00:00:35.190> to

the<00:03:33.450> comments<00:03:33.900> below<00:03:34.020> I'm<00:03:34.530> starting<00:03:35.070> to<00:03:35.190> lean

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
the comments below I'm starting to lean

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.210 
the comments below I'm starting to lean
towards<00:03:35.970> naught<00:03:36.480> but<00:03:37.110> I<00:03:37.350> do<00:03:37.410> think<00:03:37.860> if<00:03:38.010> we<00:03:38.190> all

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
towards naught but I do think if we all

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.280 
towards naught but I do think if we all
come<00:03:38.610> together<00:03:38.790> in<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.330> context<00:03:39.840> and<00:03:40.020> below

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
come together in the context and below

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.380 
come together in the context and below
we're<00:03:40.709> going<00:03:40.950> to<00:03:41.070> find<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.489> correct<00:03:41.760> answer

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
we're going to find the correct answer

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.509 
we're going to find the correct answer
but<00:03:42.720> for<00:03:43.019> now<00:03:43.140> we<00:03:43.500> need<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.800> focus<00:03:44.040> on<00:03:44.340> this

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
but for now we need to focus on this

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.550 
but for now we need to focus on this
second<00:03:45.030> half<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.780> course<00:03:46.050> we<00:03:46.350> need<00:03:46.530> to

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
second half and of course we need to

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.130 
second half and of course we need to
focus<00:03:46.830> on<00:03:47.160> trying<00:03:47.489> to<00:03:47.670> stop<00:03:47.910> Stefan<00:03:48.570> curry<00:03:48.810> and

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
focus on trying to stop Stefan curry and

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.710 
focus on trying to stop Stefan curry and
klay<00:03:49.410> Thompson<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:50.370> I'm<00:03:50.730> not<00:03:50.970> sure<00:03:51.180> what<00:03:51.420> mr.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
klay Thompson and I'm not sure what mr.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.870 
klay Thompson and I'm not sure what mr.
marcin<00:03:52.140> Gortat<00:03:52.500> was<00:03:52.739> doing<00:03:53.010> right<00:03:53.220> there<00:03:53.489> but

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
marcin Gortat was doing right there but

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.420 
marcin Gortat was doing right there but
he<00:03:53.970> is<00:03:54.000> lucky<00:03:54.720> that<00:03:54.959> Chucky<00:03:55.500> Payne<00:03:55.709> saved<00:03:56.130> his

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
he is lucky that Chucky Payne saved his

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.100 
he is lucky that Chucky Payne saved his
face<00:03:56.640> on<00:03:56.940> this<00:03:57.090> possession<00:03:57.450> right<00:03:57.840> there

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
face on this possession right there

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.740 
face on this possession right there
because<00:03:58.440> otherwise<00:03:58.800> marcin<00:03:59.760> Gortat<00:04:00.209> you

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
because otherwise marcin Gortat you

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.449 
because otherwise marcin Gortat you
would<00:04:01.019> have<00:04:01.110> ended<00:04:01.380> up<00:04:01.500> on<00:04:01.680> shaqtin<00:04:02.310> a<00:04:02.430> fool

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
would have ended up on shaqtin a fool

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.150 
would have ended up on shaqtin a fool
but<00:04:03.330> as<00:04:03.480> of<00:04:03.660> now<00:04:03.690> we<00:04:04.110> are<00:04:04.320> pretty<00:04:04.590> much<00:04:04.709> in<00:04:04.890> a

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
but as of now we are pretty much in a

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.620 
but as of now we are pretty much in a
close<00:04:05.400> battle<00:04:05.430> with<00:04:06.120> the<00:04:06.269> Golden<00:04:06.600> State

Warriors<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:07.560> I<00:04:07.680> cannot<00:04:08.130> really<00:04:08.340> say<00:04:08.700> that

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
Warriors and I cannot really say that

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.210 
Warriors and I cannot really say that
I'm<00:04:09.300> feeling<00:04:09.720> confident<00:04:10.290> about<00:04:10.380> that's<00:04:10.860> just

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
I'm feeling confident about that's just

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.030 
I'm feeling confident about that's just
quite<00:04:11.519> yet<00:04:11.550> one<00:04:12.480> thing<00:04:12.810> I<00:04:12.989> do<00:04:13.050> feel<00:04:13.410> confident

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
quite yet one thing I do feel confident

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.970 
quite yet one thing I do feel confident
