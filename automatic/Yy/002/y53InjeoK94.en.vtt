okay<00:03:36.280> and<00:03:38.670> here's<00:03:39.670> the<00:03:39.820> SVC<00:03:40.150> code<00:03:41.610> so<00:03:42.610> let's<00:03:42.730> go

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
okay and here's the SVC code so let's go

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.449 
okay and here's the SVC code so let's go
ahead<00:03:42.910> and<00:03:43.000> test<00:03:43.209> that<00:03:43.329> out<00:03:43.980> we<00:03:44.980> go<00:03:45.100> directly

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
ahead and test that out we go directly

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.819 
ahead and test that out we go directly
on<00:03:45.640> the<00:03:45.730> phone<00:03:45.910> to<00:03:46.060> test<00:03:46.299> it<00:03:46.450> out<00:03:46.540> so<00:03:46.989> for<00:03:47.739> this

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
on the phone to test it out so for this

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.340 
on the phone to test it out so for this
handset<00:03:48.489> now<00:03:48.760> these<00:03:48.910> SVC<00:03:49.510> codes<00:03:49.780> are<00:03:50.079> unique

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
handset now these SVC codes are unique

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.140 
handset now these SVC codes are unique
to<00:03:50.530> each<00:03:50.680> handset<00:03:51.310> so<00:03:51.519> you'll<00:03:51.700> have<00:03:51.850> to<00:03:52.000> follow

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
to each handset so you'll have to follow

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.650 
to each handset so you'll have to follow
these<00:03:52.390> directions<00:03:52.540> to<00:03:53.079> get<00:03:53.200> it<00:03:54.510> go<00:03:55.510> ahead<00:03:55.570> and

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
these directions to get it go ahead and

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.259 
these directions to get it go ahead and
dial<00:03:55.900> pound<00:03:56.290> pound<00:03:56.620> so<00:03:57.609> this<00:03:57.730> thing<00:03:57.910> can<00:03:58.030> allow

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
dial pound pound so this thing can allow

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.060 
dial pound pound so this thing can allow
me<00:03:58.450> to<00:03:58.540> do<00:03:58.660> it<00:03:58.810> which<00:03:59.079> is<00:03:59.109> fine<00:03:59.440> let's<00:03:59.680> go<00:03:59.829> back

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
me to do it which is fine let's go back

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.599 
me to do it which is fine let's go back
