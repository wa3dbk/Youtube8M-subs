00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.379
 and 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.130
 very good girls very good guys 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.600
 where is what are you waiting for? 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.730
 you are all very well 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.799
 Today I tell you the news that you have to 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.930
 see with the water with the solar system and 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.880
 with man of tena what they have to do 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.190
 each other these three components when 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.650
 it turns out that they have found water in a 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.070
 dwarf planet of the solar system us 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.260
 what they teach us is natural in 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.390
 biology in these things are that 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.070
 we know when I studied it that 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.800
 there were nine planets in the system 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.920
 solar mercury venus earth and mars and 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:45.109
 Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune and Pluto 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.659
 now they have removed equal fruit 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:51.289
 as we have, we have been the ones 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:52.670
 we have put as planets in the 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.649
 names of these celestial bodies 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.089
 we also have the right to take them off 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.769
 button because they have removed it 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.289
 then now it can be nine planets 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:03.500
 They are eight good, there are many more 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:05.149
 but they have not investigated the 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.670
 investigate have found a planet that 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:09.799
 it's called doing is it's the planet of 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.570
 nothing smaller from the solar system and 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.429
 contains water vapor according to 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.649
 demonstrated a team of researchers 

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:18.610
 thanks to the observations of the probe 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:21.470
 herschel of the European space agency 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.600
 according to michael who pers that is one of the 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.610
 responsible for the research we have 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.310
 found the existence of ice in the 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.039
 surface of ceres that sublimates and that 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.409
 turns into steam according to the article 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.149
 this dwarf planet that has up close 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.149
 about a thousand kilometers of 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:40.610
 diameter and is the largest of all the 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.430
 asteroid belt ejects the 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.620
 space up to six kilos 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.110
 of water per second with an amount 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:52.430
 quite high for many years 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.750
 scientists already suspected that the 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.530
 water could be a component 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.390
 fundamental of this planet but this is 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.030
 the first time it has been observed 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.180
 how are these fundamental molecules for 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.649
 our lives at least escape two 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.230
 from two regions of the celestial body 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.260
 what's up with this good the finding of 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.900
 water on this dwarf planet is very 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.329
 important according to the authors of the 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.030
 research because it reinforces the theory 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:24.489
 that part of the water in the oceans 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.950
 the earth came to our planet to 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:30.640
 asteroid board when the system 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:34.720
 solar was formed about 4,600 million 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.420
 of years its central regions were very 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.159
 hot to be considered water 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.280
 of the inner planets as they are 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:45.730
 mercury venus the earth and mars before 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.670
 to get to the belt for it is believed 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.290
 that the water came to these as a consequence 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.569
 from the bombing of comets and steroids 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.790
 that impacted on the offers on 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.129
 the surfaces of these planets is 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.689
 say that in fact when we talk about the 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.840
 big-bang the formation of the planets 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:03.310
 our planet so you know that the 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.590
 first is that of our planet was 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.139
 everything washes and it did not stop raining 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.889
 meteorites 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:12.490
 because it was in training 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:15.370
 the parantes were very altered etc 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:18.910
 so what they are saying at the moment is 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.040
 something that we also know these results 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.170
 will be very useful for the study 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.870
 of beings that is in the belt 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:29.650
 of asteroids between the orbits of Mars 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.500
 and jupiter by the dawn probe of 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:37.510
 the nasa that will reach you in the year 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:39.310
 2015 is to say that ceres is in 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.440
 middle of the asteroid belt is 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.390
 say as I have mentioned among the 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.310
 orbits of Mars and the orbits of 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.280
 Jupiter but we have mosques 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.230
 relatively so nothing guys I hope 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.570
 that you have been interested in the news 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.520
 I kiss everyone and see you in another video 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.520
 More from this channel until the next
