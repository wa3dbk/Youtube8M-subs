00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.250
 My God help to solve soon the executive and founder of the rap group 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:06.900
 reggae 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.300
 the clown is 74 projects at night 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.889
 I ask you for Brazil. 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.359
 I currently have today the dirty record and angelina land native germany with 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:17.909
 france and the movement 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:19.650
 more harmful 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.349
 the field movement 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.730
 you create a bridge and a two-way street with unemployment 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.019
 in the case of the sector 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.710
 even with the mayor that everyone respects 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.019
 very much this aspect 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.019
 a total of 3 170 thousand inhabitants 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.850
 it can not be seen only 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.380
 how to make it with renner 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.780
 has functions 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.380
 I think the work 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.720
 I hit the door of five jobs 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.950
 in none of them was a real santander bank 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.950
 and then we started a job that last year 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.790
 not that the relationship had sponsored and sponsored the partnership 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.230
 we start early to the bank to spread a social layer 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.589
 the access package 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:05.130
 not that the bank did not want our cash 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:06.490
 it's from the moment 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.160
 What did you want with this dialogue? 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.790
 you start 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:10.940
 sample 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.160
 there may be a common interest 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.939
 You start to change if you start because I am today. 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.480
 which were previously considered insensitive 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.030
 to be seen as 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.450
 target Audience 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.570
 as the participatory public 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.030
 who wins with this is the population 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.630
 we think it's fundamental a knife that passes through the port sÃ£o paulo 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.300
 here are other cultural social organizations and favela people 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.670
 see what is not so difficult to know if your hand 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.500
 this time too 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.790
 there is not much bias once a day 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.359
 We are always responding 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:48.340
 thus 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.400
 so city with attitude so thinking 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.940
 commenting 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.710
 but my biggest dream was the younger drug trafficker they usually 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.499
 there are very important players 

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:10.060
 from today until the 15th of March so here for example until very little 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.109
 long ago it was a place that was just us for the dressing rooms and today it is 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:19.270
 best known for social cultural and artistic actions novelties 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.270
 the lawyer 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:25.380
 - no doubt 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.890
 even weakened
