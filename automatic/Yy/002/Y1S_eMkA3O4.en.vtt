paint<00:01:08.820> right<00:01:09.030> on<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.420> campus<00:01:09.840> now<00:01:10.080> I'm<00:01:10.200> using

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
paint right on the campus now I'm using

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.270 
paint right on the campus now I'm using
some<00:01:10.590> titanium<00:01:11.520> white<00:01:12.950> adding<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.040> lot<00:01:14.189> of

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
some titanium white adding a lot of

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.510 
some titanium white adding a lot of
light<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.790> highlights<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.570> painting<00:01:15.900> and

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
light and highlights to the painting and

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.429 
light and highlights to the painting and
blending<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.670> also<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:19.259> will

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
blending this also so that this will

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.440 
blending this also so that this will
tone<00:01:19.680> down<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:20.280> brightness<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.880> some<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.360> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
tone down the brightness of some of the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.789 
tone down the brightness of some of the
other<00:01:21.570> colors<00:01:21.840> as<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.500> mixes<00:01:22.830> with<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.040> white

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
other colors as it mixes with the white

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.190 
other colors as it mixes with the white
so<00:01:25.799> gradually<00:01:26.430> all<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.000> colors<00:01:27.270> go<00:01:27.900> from

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
so gradually all the colors go from

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.249 
so gradually all the colors go from
intense<00:01:28.759> to<00:01:29.759> paler<00:01:30.119> as<00:01:30.420> they<00:01:30.570> mix<00:01:30.810> with<00:01:31.020> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
intense to paler as they mix with the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.399 
intense to paler as they mix with the
other<00:01:31.290> colors<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.979> mix<00:01:32.159> with<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.490> white<00:01:33.409> so

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
other colors and mix with the white so

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.319 
other colors and mix with the white so
why<00:01:34.530> most<00:01:34.829> intense<00:01:35.250> colors<00:01:35.610> here<00:01:35.850> are<00:01:36.090> going

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
why most intense colors here are going

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.510 
why most intense colors here are going
to<00:01:36.420> be<00:01:36.479> depression<00:01:37.110> blue<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.920> brilliant<00:01:38.310> blue

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520

knife<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.680> then<00:02:02.310> make<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.579> quick<00:02:02.939> clean<00:02:03.270> sweep<00:02:04.140> a

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
knife to then make a quick clean sweep a

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.490 
knife to then make a quick clean sweep a
broad<00:02:04.649> sweep<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.399> color<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.299> you'll<00:02:07.170> see<00:02:07.350> that

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
broad sweep of color and you'll see that

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.839 
broad sweep of color and you'll see that
sometimes<00:02:07.799> as<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:09.060> sweep<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.539> color<00:02:09.720> on<00:02:10.849> able

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
sometimes as I sweep the color on able

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.910 
sometimes as I sweep the color on able
to<00:02:11.970> go<00:02:12.090> on<00:02:12.270> over<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.900> other<00:02:13.050> color

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
to go on over the other color

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.820 
to go on over the other color
then<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.099> will<00:02:14.220> be<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.090> flat<00:02:15.390> color<00:02:15.690> other<00:02:16.470> times

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
then it will be a flat color other times

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.800 
then it will be a flat color other times
its<00:02:17.069> grapes<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.550> little<00:02:17.760> bit<00:02:17.880> away<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.480> what's

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
its grapes a little bit away of what's

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.000 
its grapes a little bit away of what's
behind<00:02:18.989> it<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:20.250> as<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:21.150> use<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.420> palette<00:02:21.900> knife

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
behind it so as you use a palette knife

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.830 
behind it so as you use a palette knife
you<00:02:23.010> get<00:02:23.190> better<00:02:23.459> at<00:02:23.640> figuring<00:02:24.420> out<00:02:24.569> how<00:02:24.810> to

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
you get better at figuring out how to

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.050 
you get better at figuring out how to
handle<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:25.380> so<00:02:26.130> that<00:02:26.280> it's<00:02:26.430> grapes<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.910> when

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
handle that so that it's grapes you when

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.030 
handle that so that it's grapes you when
you<00:02:27.150> want<00:02:27.330> it<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.510> scrape<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.110> applies<00:02:28.800> the

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
you want it to scrape and applies the

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.860 
you want it to scrape and applies the
color<00:02:29.190> on<00:02:29.520> top<00:02:29.790> when<00:02:30.569> you<00:02:30.660> want<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.050> do<00:02:31.170> that

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
color on top when you want it to do that

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.930 
color on top when you want it to do that
each<00:02:33.870> time<00:02:33.930> I<00:02:34.560> change<00:02:34.890> color<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.400> course<00:02:35.670> with

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
each time I change color of course with

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.979 
each time I change color of course with
the<00:02:36.060> palette<00:02:36.390> knife<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:37.310> clean<00:02:38.310> it<00:02:38.340> first<00:02:38.989> now

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
the palette knife I clean it first now

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.280 
the palette knife I clean it first now
I'm<00:02:40.170> putting<00:02:40.410> in<00:02:40.650> white<00:02:42.050> this<00:02:43.050> is<00:02:43.110> the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
I'm putting in white this is the

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.470 
I'm putting in white this is the
titanium<00:02:43.800> white<00:02:44.250> that<00:02:44.489> I'm<00:02:44.580> putting<00:02:44.790> in<00:02:45.030> some

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
titanium white that I'm putting in some

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.370 
titanium white that I'm putting in some
broad<00:02:46.380> strokes<00:02:46.560> which<00:02:47.040> just<00:02:47.370> pop<00:02:47.610> out<00:02:47.850> of<00:02:48.380> the

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
broad strokes which just pop out of the

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.309 
broad strokes which just pop out of the
background<00:02:50.690> so<00:02:51.690> those<00:02:51.870> are<00:02:52.019> strong

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
background so those are strong

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.130 
background so those are strong
highlights<00:02:52.799> in<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.069> painting<00:02:54.110> after<00:02:55.110> I

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
highlights in the painting after I

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.809 
highlights in the painting after I
finish<00:02:55.470> with<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.769> white<00:02:55.950> I'm<00:02:56.250> going<00:02:56.519> to<00:02:56.610> start

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
finish with the white I'm going to start

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.720 
finish with the white I'm going to start
drawing<00:02:56.970> lines<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.720> I'll<00:02:57.780> show<00:02:57.989> you<00:02:58.019> how<00:02:58.730> the

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
drawing lines and I'll show you how the

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.900 
drawing lines and I'll show you how the
what<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:00.540> use<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:01.080> be<00:03:01.200> able<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.549> make<00:03:02.549> a<00:03:02.580> line

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
what I use to be able to make a line

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.280 
what I use to be able to make a line
with<00:03:03.180> acrylic<00:03:03.540> paint<00:03:03.810> on<00:03:03.959> a<00:03:04.049> canvas<00:03:06.230> here<00:03:07.230> I

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
with acrylic paint on a canvas here I

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.170 
with acrylic paint on a canvas here I
open<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.739> tube<00:03:07.920> of<00:03:08.040> paint<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.549> then<00:03:08.819> I<00:03:08.880> take

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
open the tube of paint and then I take

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.150 
open the tube of paint and then I take
that<00:03:09.209> tap<00:03:09.720> that's<00:03:10.019> sitting<00:03:10.380> there<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.799> screw

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
that tap that's sitting there and screw

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.509 
that tap that's sitting there and screw
that<00:03:11.340> on<00:03:11.580> and<00:03:12.440> it<00:03:13.440> has<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.650> hole<00:03:13.980> in<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.280> top

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
that on and it has a hole in the top

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.340 
that on and it has a hole in the top
which<00:03:14.910> will<00:03:14.940> allow<00:03:15.330> me<00:03:15.360> to<00:03:15.540> squeeze<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.140> paint

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
which will allow me to squeeze the paint

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
which will allow me to squeeze the paint
out<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:16.920> apply<00:03:17.670> it<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.000> canvas<00:03:19.100> so<00:03:20.100> here<00:03:20.340> I

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
out and apply it to the canvas so here I

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.650 
out and apply it to the canvas so here I
am<00:03:20.640> squeezing<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.329> paint<00:03:21.570> out<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.980> apply<00:03:23.280> a

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
am squeezing the paint out to apply a

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.430 
am squeezing the paint out to apply a
line<00:03:24.660> to<00:03:25.079> the<00:03:25.170> canvas<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:26.359> with<00:03:27.359> practice<00:03:27.600> you

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
line to the canvas and with practice you

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.440 
line to the canvas and with practice you
figure<00:03:28.739> out<00:03:28.890> how<00:03:29.100> much<00:03:29.730> you<00:03:29.910> have<00:03:29.940> to<00:03:30.090> squeeze

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
figure out how much you have to squeeze

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.360 
figure out how much you have to squeeze
the<00:03:30.690> tube<00:03:30.900> while<00:03:31.350> you're<00:03:31.680> drawing<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.100> lines

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
the tube while you're drawing the lines

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.699 
the tube while you're drawing the lines
so<00:03:33.000> I've<00:03:33.299> been<00:03:33.450> using<00:03:33.690> this<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:33.959> lot<00:03:34.260> for<00:03:34.560> many

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
so I've been using this a lot for many

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.069 
so I've been using this a lot for many
many<00:03:34.920> years<00:03:35.190> so<00:03:35.430> I'm<00:03:35.790> pretty<00:03:36.720> good<00:03:36.930> at

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
many years so I'm pretty good at

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.030 
many years so I'm pretty good at
figuring<00:03:37.680> out<00:03:38.090> how<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.120> do<00:03:39.420> it<00:03:39.570> if<00:03:40.079> you<00:03:40.920> don't

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
figuring out how to do it if you don't

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.490 
figuring out how to do it if you don't
squeeze<00:03:41.370> enough<00:03:41.670> paint<00:03:41.970> then<00:03:42.810> you<00:03:43.290> get<00:03:43.470> a

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
squeeze enough paint then you get a

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.009 
squeeze enough paint then you get a
fractured<00:03:44.010> line<00:03:44.250> if<00:03:45.120> you<00:03:45.299> squeeze<00:03:45.600> too<00:03:45.810> much

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
fractured line if you squeeze too much

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.530 
fractured line if you squeeze too much
you<00:03:46.230> can<00:03:46.380> get<00:03:46.500> a<00:03:46.530> blob<00:03:46.769> of<00:03:46.799> paint<00:03:47.359> but<00:03:48.359> with

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
you can get a blob of paint but with

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.789 
you can get a blob of paint but with
practice<00:03:49.019> it<00:03:49.310> becomes<00:03:50.310> easier<00:03:51.500> so<00:03:52.500> here<00:03:52.709> I'm

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
practice it becomes easier so here I'm

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.280 
practice it becomes easier so here I'm
using<00:03:52.829> the<00:03:53.250> lines<00:03:53.519> to<00:03:54.359> both<00:03:54.540> to<00:03:54.900> outline

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
using the lines to both to outline

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.910 
using the lines to both to outline
shapes<00:03:56.030> to<00:03:57.030> add<00:03:57.420> a<00:03:57.450> little<00:03:57.840> energy<00:03:58.709> and

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
shapes to add a little energy and

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.819 
shapes to add a little energy and
excitement<00:03:59.160> to<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.519> painting<00:03:59.880> and<00:04:00.620> guide<00:04:01.620> the

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
excitement to the painting and guide the

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.840 
excitement to the painting and guide the
eye<00:04:02.359> throughout<00:04:03.359> the<00:04:03.510> composition<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.850> lines

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
eye throughout the composition the lines

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:11.930 
eye throughout the composition the lines
also<00:04:06.209> help<00:04:06.859> give<00:04:07.859> a<00:04:07.890> texture<00:04:08.870> and<00:04:10.760> I'm<00:04:11.760> pretty

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
also help give a texture and I'm pretty
