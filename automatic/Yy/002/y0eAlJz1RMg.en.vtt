format<00:00:44.610> because<00:00:45.649> um<00:00:47.180> texts<00:00:48.180> like<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.750> sectors

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
format because um texts like in sectors

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.850 
format because um texts like in sectors
and<00:00:49.820> wind<00:00:50.820> ups<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.270> whatnot<00:00:51.629> they<00:00:51.899> did<00:00:52.620> get

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
and wind ups and whatnot they did get

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.000 
and wind ups and whatnot they did get
hit<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:54.030> deck<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.449> more<00:00:54.750> problem<00:00:55.739> arming

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
hit so the deck is more problem arming

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.410 
hit so the deck is more problem arming
the<00:00:56.129> card<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.460> more<00:00:56.640> probable<00:00:56.910> mouth<00:00:57.440> because

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
the card is more probable mouth because

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.319 
the card is more probable mouth because
it's<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.510> fat<00:01:00.780> 1,900<00:01:01.559> attack<00:01:01.620> on<00:01:02.070> sir<00:01:02.340> still

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
it's a fat 1,900 attack on sir still

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.350 
it's a fat 1,900 attack on sir still
that<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.260> now<00:01:04.580> doesn't<00:01:05.580> just<00:01:05.670> get<00:01:05.820> popped<00:01:06.119> by

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
that it now doesn't just get popped by

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.990 
that it now doesn't just get popped by
dragonfly<00:01:07.140> like<00:01:07.950> every<00:01:08.460> turn<00:01:08.729> or<00:01:11.000> played

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
dragonfly like every turn or played

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.690

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
because I found that a lot of times I

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.430
