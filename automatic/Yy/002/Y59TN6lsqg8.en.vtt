00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.920
 Y 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.350
 adif a marita of a precious work is 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.870
 a store rather the concept is network 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.010
 of urban barter and each and every one of 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.210
 we always have some 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.800
 people at home that we use it 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.930
 we come here with a series of garments 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.090
 that we do not use we exchange them for a 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.919
 series of points we pay a fee 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.810
 symbolic and with those points that we can 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.060
 to do is look for clothes that we are going to 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.800
 use that interests us and 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.419
 we exchange them for all the clothes that 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.820
 has brought me a total of 100 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.350
 points for these 100 points defined that 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.180
 pay 8 euros for the management theme 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.580
 of the barter of which they would commission 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.380
 Adelita Madrid take a look because 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.420
 from what I see there is a lot of things 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.160
 from baby clothes that as you know 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.320
 children grow very fast and it is absurd 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.240
 be in prison buying clothes 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.620
 constantly with which is great 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.680
 can come here find but by the 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.380
 moment is not the case and look up things 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.370
 decoration associate appointments if we go a 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:03.710
 little that we can find good 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.460
 up sunglasses a lot of things 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.260
 discs 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.409
 and then glancing good 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.280
 this to this side 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:17.079
 we have up to good typical books 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.079
 that is, this is my youth 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.930
 Y 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.800
 I was my mother that yes a recommendation 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.720
 when you get to a site of these the 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.670
 clothing is not ordered by colors or 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.510
 nor placed the apb well and see their 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.920
 clothing campaign because it's absolutely 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.409
 chaotic with which advice number one 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.359
 lots of patience with your shoulders 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.920
 that is, with a very open mind because 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:51.479
 you have to decontextualize a piece of clothing 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.369
 suddenly you see something hanging here that you do not 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.100
 says nothing you have to try to make a 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.539
 exercise of this abstraction because to 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.310
 the best is perfectly like another 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.619
 what you have at home you have to try 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.140
 good to know how to visualize the garments 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.200
 for 20 points but it gives me a dress I think 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.599
 which is a 15 pants and about 5 are 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.830
 the books and the cds being good as 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.930
 I have an amount of 100 points 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.030
 have I see so I can change it 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.440
 yes, yes, I do not spend total points 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.810
 they have given initially I have three months 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.640
 to spend them if they do not expire 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.989
 prints that do not do much 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.239
 come show us the dress is super total 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.680
 or is achieved is that it makes me a lot 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.660
 grace because we see these things in 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.060
 large surfaces and as we see with 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.030
 other eyes not but but not the green that 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.010
 So much is going to take this spring 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.690
 green mint good different ranges of 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.880
 green west more tropical but green 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.150
 is to find a lot for example this 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.280
 yellow that also has its point 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.480
 with his little golden button man you have to 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.980
 keep it in mind 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.510
 you can customize the garments 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.970
 then put another different button such 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.769
 update not that is the idea also of 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.140
 have a little fun and make things a 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.760
 little more originals then this dress 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.049
 Well, it's not bad, look at this 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.569
 dressed is what I'm going to do I'm going 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.819
 to mount a mogambo look a wet look 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.230
 Well, let's say it would be a dress 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.900
 this cut that would be a dress 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.489
 Sahara would lead to the best we are going to 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.980
 by cas get sunbonnet and a 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.390
 raffia shoes or wedge then I do not know 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.930
 if you have seen the movie but this 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.269
 African inspiration in the jungle colors 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.859
 land I think this dress yet 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.060
 they do not ask me 20 points a lot now for 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.060
 something else let's go
