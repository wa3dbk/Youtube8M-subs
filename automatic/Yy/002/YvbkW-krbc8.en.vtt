00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.790 

question<00:00:00.390> I<00:00:00.420> hear<00:00:00.510> from<00:00:00.659> a<00:00:00.780> subscriber<00:00:00.989> was

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
question I hear from a subscriber was

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.860 
question I hear from a subscriber was
what's<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:02.850> difference<00:00:03.179> between<00:00:03.360> a<00:00:03.540> drywall

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
what's the difference between a drywall

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.260 
what's the difference between a drywall
hammer<00:00:04.290> and<00:00:04.529> just<00:00:04.560> a<00:00:04.710> regular<00:00:04.980> hammer<00:00:05.220> and<00:00:05.490> the

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
hammer and just a regular hammer and the

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.470 
hammer and just a regular hammer and the
difference<00:00:06.839> for<00:00:07.440> pounding<00:00:08.189> is<00:00:08.429> this<00:00:08.820> beveled

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
difference for pounding is this beveled

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.900 
difference for pounding is this beveled
head<00:00:09.750> it's<00:00:10.019> why<00:00:10.260> it's<00:00:10.530> beveled<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.130> it<00:00:11.280> has<00:00:11.519> a

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
head it's why it's beveled and it has a

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.140 
head it's why it's beveled and it has a
waffle<00:00:12.660> design<00:00:13.530> on<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.070> head<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:14.370> it<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.549> what

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
waffle design on the head of it and what

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.670 
waffle design on the head of it and what
that<00:00:15.299> does<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.719> when<00:00:15.839> you<00:00:15.960> pound<00:00:16.289> into<00:00:16.560> the

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
that does is when you pound into the

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.890 
that does is when you pound into the
drywall<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.520> does<00:00:17.699> two<00:00:17.910> things<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.869> first

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
drywall it does two things the first

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.230 
drywall it does two things the first
thing<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.439> because<00:00:19.770> this<00:00:19.920> wide<00:00:20.220> soft<00:00:20.670> bevel

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
thing is because this wide soft bevel

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.670 
thing is because this wide soft bevel
it's<00:00:21.359> not<00:00:21.510> going<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.720> tear<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.080> hole<00:00:22.289> in<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.650> a

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
it's not going to tear a hole in it a

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.890 
it's not going to tear a hole in it a
regular<00:00:22.980> hammer<00:00:23.250> it's<00:00:23.850> very<00:00:24.119> easy<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.630> tear<00:00:24.869> a

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
regular hammer it's very easy to tear a

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.109 
regular hammer it's very easy to tear a
hole<00:00:25.140> through<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.500> paper<00:00:25.769> outside<00:00:26.609> coating

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
hole through the paper outside coating

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.599 
hole through the paper outside coating
of<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.480> drywall<00:00:27.750> so<00:00:28.170> it's<00:00:28.949> softer<00:00:29.460> it's

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
of the drywall so it's softer it's

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.030 
of the drywall so it's softer it's
beveled<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:30.689> get<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.869> nice<00:00:31.140> dimple

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
beveled so that you get a nice dimple

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.970 
beveled so that you get a nice dimple
when<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.520> pound<00:00:32.790> in<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.149> nail<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.590> second

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
when you pound in a nail and the second

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.430 
when you pound in a nail and the second
thing<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.340> waffling<00:00:35.910> effect<00:00:36.410> stipple<00:00:37.410> x'

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
thing is this waffling effect stipple x'

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.110 
thing is this waffling effect stipple x'
the<00:00:37.620> paper<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.190> when<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.399> cover<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.969> with

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
the paper so when you cover it with

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.450 
the paper so when you cover it with
drywall<00:00:39.600> compound<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:40.440> really<00:00:40.920> adheres<00:00:41.250> it

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
drywall compound it really adheres it

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.490 
drywall compound it really adheres it
really<00:00:41.700> sticks<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.840> here<00:00:43.140> we're<00:00:43.290> doing<00:00:43.379> a

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
really sticks so here we're doing a

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.250 
really sticks so here we're doing a
little<00:00:43.590> project<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.280> my<00:00:44.430> mom's<00:00:44.870> closet<00:00:45.870> here

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
little project in my mom's closet here

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.709 
little project in my mom's closet here
and<00:00:46.440> there's<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.980> pop<00:00:47.250> here<00:00:47.579> from<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.969> nail<00:00:48.239> and

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
and there's a pop here from a nail and

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.720 
and there's a pop here from a nail and
I'll<00:00:49.050> just<00:00:49.410> pound<00:00:49.980> on<00:00:50.250> this<00:00:50.520> with<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.850> hammer

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
I'll just pound on this with the hammer

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.310 
I'll just pound on this with the hammer
and<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.850> can<00:00:53.969> see<00:00:54.210> how<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.480> sets<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.140> it

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
and you can see how it sets it it

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.590 
and you can see how it sets it it
dimples<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.949> real<00:00:56.129> nice<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.940> really<00:00:57.390> gives

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
dimples it real nice and it really gives

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.229 
dimples it real nice and it really gives
a<00:00:57.719> texture<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.890> drywall<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.609> when<00:00:59.789> we<00:00:59.910> put

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
a texture to the drywall so when we put

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.209 
a texture to the drywall so when we put
it<00:01:00.359> skim<00:01:00.690> coat<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:01.170> Kalpana<00:01:01.770> --this<00:01:02.010> it's

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
it skim coat of Kalpana --this it's

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.979 
it skim coat of Kalpana --this it's
really<00:01:02.399> going<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.550> help<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.820> stick<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.840> other

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
really going to help it stick the other

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.070 
really going to help it stick the other
thing<00:01:04.229> with<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> drywall<00:01:04.830> hammer<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.810> they<00:01:06.810> have

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
thing with a drywall hammer is they have

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.670 
thing with a drywall hammer is they have
a<00:01:07.439> little<00:01:07.920> built<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.640> nail<00:01:09.119> puller<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.810> I

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
a little built in nail puller and I

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.200 
a little built in nail puller and I
think<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.070> old<00:01:11.220> days<00:01:11.490> before<00:01:12.000> they<00:01:12.090> had

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
think in the old days before they had

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.910 
think in the old days before they had
pulling<00:01:12.540> pry<00:01:12.780> bars<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.200> was<00:01:13.290> probably<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.710> good

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
pulling pry bars it was probably a good

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.190 
pulling pry bars it was probably a good
tool<00:01:14.159> but<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.909> probably<00:01:15.150> better<00:01:15.540> off<00:01:15.750> using<00:01:15.990> a

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
tool but you probably better off using a

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.859 
tool but you probably better off using a
pulling<00:01:16.500> pry<00:01:16.740> bar<00:01:17.009> for<00:01:17.310> most<00:01:17.520> nail<00:01:17.970> pulls<00:01:18.270> it's

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
pulling pry bar for most nail pulls it's

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.649 
pulling pry bar for most nail pulls it's
kind<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.229> think<00:01:19.560> thick<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.250> chunky<00:01:20.490> not<00:01:21.240> real

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
kind of think thick and chunky not real

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.830 
kind of think thick and chunky not real
effective<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.380> found<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:23.520> edge<00:01:23.729> this<00:01:24.150> axe<00:01:24.479> edge

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
effective I found the edge this axe edge

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.840 
effective I found the edge this axe edge
a<00:01:25.530> lot<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.890> customers<00:01:26.280> come<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.729> the

a lot of customers come in to the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.520 
a lot of customers come in to the
hardware<00:01:27.150> store<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.420> ask<00:01:27.600> me<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:28.080> know<00:01:28.200> what

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
hardware store and ask me you know what

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.230 
hardware store and ask me you know what
is<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:28.770> used<00:01:29.040> for<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.970> old<00:01:30.090> days

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
is this used for and in the old days

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.630 
is this used for and in the old days
rather<00:01:30.930> than<00:01:31.200> carrying<00:01:31.530> around<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:32.070> box<00:01:32.310> cutter

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
rather than carrying around a box cutter

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.550 
rather than carrying around a box cutter
they<00:01:33.240> actually<00:01:33.600> took<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.020> edge<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.500> and

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
they actually took the edge of this and

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.980 
they actually took the edge of this and
they<00:01:34.860> score<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.490> drywall<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.299> snapped<00:01:36.750> it

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
they score the drywall and snapped it

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.740 
they score the drywall and snapped it
and<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.860> other<00:01:38.040> thing<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.640> little<00:01:39.000> hook<00:01:39.479> in

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
and the other thing this little hook in

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.200 
and the other thing this little hook in
the<00:01:40.110> hammer<00:01:40.409> two<00:01:41.280> guys<00:01:41.460> would<00:01:41.670> get<00:01:41.820> on<00:01:41.939> two

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
the hammer two guys would get on two
