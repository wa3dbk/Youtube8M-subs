worth<00:01:03.480> though<00:01:03.719> pie<00:01:03.899> apps<00:01:04.140> at<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.320> moment<00:01:04.650> but

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
worth though pie apps at the moment but

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.570 
worth though pie apps at the moment but
this<00:01:05.700> does<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.180> job<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.920> if<00:01:07.920> i<00:01:08.100> was<00:01:08.250> looking<00:01:08.549> to

this does the job so if i was looking to

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.929 
this does the job so if i was looking to
use<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:10.500> know<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.680> spar<00:01:11.100> with<00:01:11.490> if<00:01:11.700> I

I'll<00:01:33.310> cancel<00:01:33.610> it<00:01:33.850> because<00:01:33.940> obviously<00:01:34.480> I

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
I'll cancel it because obviously I

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.110 
I'll cancel it because obviously I
couldn't<00:01:34.900> be<00:01:35.260> able<00:01:35.410> to<00:01:35.470> play<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:36.120> song

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
couldn't be able to play the song

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.300 
couldn't be able to play the song
because<00:01:37.570> copyright<00:01:38.500> stuff<00:01:38.830> like<00:01:39.010> that<00:01:39.040> and

because copyright stuff like that and
but<00:01:40.240> it<00:01:40.360> does<00:01:40.570> work<00:01:40.600> and<00:01:40.990> it<00:01:41.050> automatically

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
but it does work and it automatically

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.620 
but it does work and it automatically
plays<00:01:41.950> when<00:01:42.430> it<00:01:42.550> fall<00:01:42.790> into<00:01:42.910> the<00:01:43.090> track<00:01:43.330> so

that's really useful and as I said links
him<00:01:46.780> with<00:01:46.900> GPS<00:01:48.060> applications<00:01:49.060> as<00:01:49.210> well<00:01:49.240> so

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
him with GPS applications as well so

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.190 
him with GPS applications as well so
read<00:01:49.990> back<00:01:50.200> read<00:01:50.470> back<00:01:50.680> to<00:01:50.860> directions<00:01:51.580> and

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
you can use this one to launch

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.100 
you can use this one to launch
applications<00:01:55.030> like<00:01:55.210> you<00:01:55.360> can<00:01:55.600> with<00:01:55.979> um<00:01:58.110> yeah

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110

that for free so um yeah it's quite fast
activating<00:04:29.860> then<00:04:30.040> going<00:04:30.850> down<00:04:30.880> where<00:04:31.270> it's

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
activating then going down where it's

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:32.850 
activating then going down where it's
there's<00:04:31.810> a<00:04:31.870> few<00:04:32.140> that<00:04:32.260> kind<00:04:32.560> of<00:04:32.620> quite

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
there's a few that kind of quite

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.670 
there's a few that kind of quite
sluggish<00:04:33.130> I'd<00:04:33.430> the<00:04:33.700> that<00:04:34.360> flotation<00:04:35.200> tweaking

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
sluggish I'd the that flotation tweaking

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.100 
sluggish I'd the that flotation tweaking
store<00:04:35.950> which<00:04:36.190> did<00:04:37.060> slow<00:04:37.360> down<00:04:37.510> that<00:04:37.690> process<00:04:38.080> a

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
store which did slow down that process a

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.930 
store which did slow down that process a
little<00:04:38.290> bit<00:04:38.440> so<00:04:38.770> I<00:04:38.800> didn't<00:04:39.220> install<00:04:39.580> that<00:04:39.760> and

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
little bit so I didn't install that and

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.900 
little bit so I didn't install that and
I<00:04:40.390> put<00:04:41.050> this<00:04:41.169> in<00:04:41.470> place<00:04:41.860> of<00:04:41.979> that<00:04:42.370> it's<00:04:42.760> going

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
I put this in place of that it's going

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.180 
I put this in place of that it's going
to<00:04:42.970> be<00:04:43.120> a<00:04:43.180> koala<00:04:43.840> faster<00:04:44.350> when<00:04:44.470> activating<00:04:45.040> it

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
to be a koala faster when activating it

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.790 
to be a koala faster when activating it
so<00:04:45.510> yeah<00:04:46.510> it's<00:04:46.660> unabie<00:04:46.990> to<00:04:46.990> repo<00:04:47.530> and<00:04:47.650> it's

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
so yeah it's unabie to repo and it's

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.800 
so yeah it's unabie to repo and it's
free<00:04:48.040> so<00:04:48.340> worth<00:04:49.000> checking<00:04:49.360> out<00:04:49.450> if<00:04:49.510> you're

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
find this one useful it's called grid

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.980 
find this one useful it's called grid
tab<00:04:57.100> and<00:04:57.669> it<00:04:58.090> allows<00:04:58.300> you<00:04:58.450> to<00:04:58.630> have<00:04:58.720> multiple

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
tabs loaded in this format similar to

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.630 
tabs loaded in this format similar to
whites<00:05:02.380> like<00:05:02.650> on<00:05:02.800> the<00:05:02.890> ipad<00:05:03.250> where<00:05:03.430> you<00:05:03.490> can

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
whites like on the ipad where you can

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.980 
whites like on the ipad where you can
scroll<00:05:04.060> through<00:05:05.160> however<00:05:06.160> many<00:05:06.720> pages<00:05:07.720> you've

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
scroll through however many pages you've

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.090 
scroll through however many pages you've
got<00:05:08.169> loaded<00:05:08.380> you<00:05:08.620> can<00:05:08.650> change<00:05:08.979> the

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
got loaded you can change the

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.400 
got loaded you can change the
preferences<00:05:09.370> in<00:05:09.970> settings<00:05:10.900> that<00:05:11.080> come<00:05:11.260> with

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
preferences in settings that come with

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.219 
preferences in settings that come with
us<00:05:11.560> to<00:05:11.590> have<00:05:12.010> to<00:05:12.970> buy<00:05:13.120> two<00:05:13.150> or<00:05:13.419> three<00:05:13.780> by<00:05:13.900> three

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
us to have to buy two or three by three

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:17.460 
us to have to buy two or three by three
i<00:05:14.320> think<00:05:14.530> it<00:05:14.620> is<00:05:15.060> tabs<00:05:16.060> listed<00:05:16.750> and<00:05:16.930> it<00:05:17.289> just

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
i think it is tabs listed and it just

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:18.390 
i think it is tabs listed and it just
makes<00:05:17.560> it<00:05:17.740> easy<00:05:17.860> switching<00:05:18.190> between

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
makes it easy switching between

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.710 
makes it easy switching between
different<00:05:18.940> tabs<00:05:19.150> that<00:05:19.210> you've<00:05:19.360> got<00:05:19.510> loaded

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
different tabs that you've got loaded

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.529 
different tabs that you've got loaded
allows<00:05:20.289> you<00:05:20.440> to<00:05:20.620> see<00:05:20.830> them<00:05:21.070> all<00:05:21.220> and<00:05:21.539> scroll

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
allows you to see them all and scroll

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:24.060 
allows you to see them all and scroll
through<00:05:22.750> different<00:05:23.110> pages<00:05:23.289> with<00:05:23.740> different

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
through different pages with different

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.430 
through different pages with different
tabs<00:05:24.250> on<00:05:24.490> and<00:05:25.210> that's<00:05:25.450> available<00:05:25.900> on<00:05:26.200> the<00:05:26.289> mud

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
tabs on and that's available on the mud

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.400 
tabs on and that's available on the mud
by<00:05:26.620> our<00:05:26.770> repo<00:05:27.160> think<00:05:28.000> it's<00:05:28.150> one<00:05:28.360> dollar<00:05:28.900> fifty

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
by our repo think it's one dollar fifty

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:30.840 
by our repo think it's one dollar fifty
but<00:05:29.560> i'll<00:05:29.740> check<00:05:30.070> and<00:05:30.430> put<00:05:30.520> that<00:05:30.640> in<00:05:30.789> the

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:30.850 
but i'll check and put that in the

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.760 
but i'll check and put that in the
description<00:05:30.940> and<00:05:31.360> in<00:05:31.870> the<00:05:31.990> video<00:05:32.229> as<00:05:32.350> well<00:05:32.380> so

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
description and in the video as well so

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.100 
description and in the video as well so
you<00:05:32.979> know<00:05:33.250> for<00:05:33.460> sure<00:05:33.490> but<00:05:33.820> it<00:05:34.600> makes<00:05:34.840> it<00:05:34.990> much

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
you know for sure but it makes it much

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.140 
you know for sure but it makes it much
easier<00:05:35.169> to<00:05:35.620> use<00:05:35.830> when<00:05:36.430> browsing<00:05:36.640> multiple

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
easier to use when browsing multiple

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.300 
easier to use when browsing multiple
pages<00:05:37.360> and<00:05:38.200> that's<00:05:38.680> pretty<00:05:38.800> much<00:05:38.919> it<00:05:39.039> for<00:05:39.160> this

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
pages and that's pretty much it for this

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.490 
pages and that's pretty much it for this
video<00:05:39.520> if<00:05:40.060> you<00:05:40.180> find<00:05:40.330> it<00:05:40.450> useful<00:05:40.510> just<00:05:41.110> be<00:05:41.350> sure
