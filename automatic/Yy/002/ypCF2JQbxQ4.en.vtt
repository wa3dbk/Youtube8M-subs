different ways to use it the easy and
most<00:00:15.570> simple<00:00:15.900> way<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.080> use<00:00:16.320> it<00:00:16.350> is<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.710> fold<00:00:17.010> it

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
most simple way to use it is to fold it

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.790

through it around the big loop place it
in<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.740> dot<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.420> then<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.570> can<00:00:24.720> adjust<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:25.170> in

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
in the dot and then you can adjust it in

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.470 
in the dot and then you can adjust it in
and<00:00:25.439> out<00:00:25.529> without<00:00:25.769> tying<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.460> when<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.300> boat
