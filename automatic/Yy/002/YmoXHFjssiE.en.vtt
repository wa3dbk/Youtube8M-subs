change from the old library pull you can
see<00:00:12.840> we've<00:00:12.990> got<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.290> optical<00:00:13.710> trackpad

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:14.179 
see we've got the optical trackpad

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.849 
see we've got the optical trackpad
opposed<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.750> old<00:00:15.780> check<00:00:16.230> ball<00:00:16.440> we<00:00:16.619> used<00:00:16.650> to

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
opposed to the old check ball we used to

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.410 
opposed to the old check ball we used to
have<00:00:16.980> this<00:00:17.640> should<00:00:17.850> be<00:00:17.940> more<00:00:18.090> resilient

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
have this should be more resilient

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.910 
have this should be more resilient
actually<00:00:18.869> gives<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.109> much<00:00:19.260> better<00:00:19.470> feel<00:00:19.740> and

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
actually gives a much better feel and

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.859 
actually gives a much better feel and
there's<00:00:20.640> easier<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.090> move<00:00:21.210> around<00:00:21.270> as<00:00:21.660> well

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
there's easier to move around as well

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.420 
there's easier to move around as well
and<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.680> should<00:00:22.830> be<00:00:22.859> more<00:00:23.070> resilient

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
and it should be more resilient

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.130 
and it should be more resilient
