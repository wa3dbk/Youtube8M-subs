down-and-dirty guide to dayz as you can
see<00:00:04.680> here<00:00:04.920> I'm<00:00:05.100> having<00:00:05.339> some<00:00:05.580> FPS<00:00:05.940> issues<00:00:06.150> I'm

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
see here I'm having some FPS issues I'm

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.750 
see here I'm having some FPS issues I'm
getting<00:00:06.899> around<00:00:07.109> 20<00:00:07.470> frames<00:00:07.710> per<00:00:07.830> second<00:00:08.309> I

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
getting around 20 frames per second I

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.580 
getting around 20 frames per second I
had<00:00:09.360> meant<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:09.660> have<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.929> frames<00:00:10.110> per<00:00:10.260> second

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
had meant to have the frames per second

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.990 
had meant to have the frames per second
in<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.740> upper<00:00:10.950> left-hand<00:00:11.190> corner<00:00:11.370> but<00:00:11.880> it

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
in the upper left-hand corner but it

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.330 
in the upper left-hand corner but it
failed<00:00:12.179> on<00:00:12.389> me<00:00:12.540> so<00:00:13.049> anyways<00:00:13.380> let's<00:00:14.219> go<00:00:14.309> ahead

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
failed on me so anyways let's go ahead

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.890 
failed on me so anyways let's go ahead
and<00:00:14.610> correct<00:00:14.759> this<00:00:15.000> let's<00:00:15.480> go<00:00:15.630> into<00:00:15.809> your

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
and correct this let's go into your

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.810 
and correct this let's go into your
video<00:00:16.139> options<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.400> first<00:00:17.609> thing<00:00:17.730> you

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
video options and the first thing you

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.130 
video options and the first thing you
want<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:17.970> make<00:00:18.029> sure<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.510> that<00:00:18.539> your<00:00:18.779> 3d

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
want to make sure is that your 3d

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.650 
want to make sure is that your 3d
resolution<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:19.800> at<00:00:19.949> 100%<00:00:20.460> now<00:00:20.939> having<00:00:21.570> a

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
resolution is at 100% now having a

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.090 
resolution is at 100% now having a
percentage<00:00:22.080> over<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.410> hundred<00:00:22.710> percent<00:00:22.800> will

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
percentage over a hundred percent will

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.859 
percentage over a hundred percent will
be<00:00:23.130> more<00:00:23.430> processor<00:00:23.939> intensive<00:00:24.269> but<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.689> game

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
be more processor intensive but the game

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:25.730 
be more processor intensive but the game
will<00:00:25.080> look<00:00:25.289> better

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
will look better

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.470 
will look better
whereas<00:00:26.220> percentages<00:00:26.730> under<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.180> hundred

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
whereas percentages under a hundred

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.300 
whereas percentages under a hundred
percent<00:00:27.570> will<00:00:28.019> be<00:00:28.140> less<00:00:28.439> processor<00:00:28.980> intensive

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
percent will be less processor intensive

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.910 
percent will be less processor intensive
Bowl<00:00:29.970> will<00:00:30.119> look<00:00:30.269> worse<00:00:30.480> now<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.439> next<00:00:31.740> value

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
Bowl will look worse now the next value

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.709 
Bowl will look worse now the next value
that<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.279> want<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.550> set<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.149> video<00:00:33.480> memory

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
that you want to set is the video memory

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.209 
that you want to set is the video memory
and<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.079> want<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.320> set<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.649> default

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
and you want to set that to default

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.979 
and you want to set that to default
setting<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.210> other<00:00:36.420> options<00:00:36.870> will

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
setting it to the other options will

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.330 
setting it to the other options will
actually<00:00:37.290> limit<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.739> amount<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.100> video

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
actually limit the amount of video

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.069 
actually limit the amount of video
memory<00:00:38.489> that's<00:00:38.820> used<00:00:39.090> whereas<00:00:39.600> default<00:00:39.960> will

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
memory that's used whereas default will

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.709 
memory that's used whereas default will
use<00:00:40.260> whatever<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.710> available<00:00:41.329> now<00:00:42.329> gone<00:00:42.600> ahead

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
use whatever is available now gone ahead

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.690 
use whatever is available now gone ahead
and<00:00:42.870> set<00:00:43.200> my<00:00:43.320> object<00:00:43.770> detail<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.219> normal<00:00:44.550> I

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
and set my object detail to normal I

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.040 
and set my object detail to normal I
don't<00:00:44.910> think<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.180> increases<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.780> frames

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
don't think that increases the frames

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.110 
don't think that increases the frames
per<00:00:46.170> second<00:00:46.500> too<00:00:46.620> much<00:00:46.800> but<00:00:47.489> something<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.910> do

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
per second too much but something you do

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.420 
per second too much but something you do
want<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.329> adjust<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.840> your<00:00:49.079> shadow<00:00:49.350> detail<00:00:49.829> now

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
want to adjust is your shadow detail now

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.619 
want to adjust is your shadow detail now
is<00:00:50.489> just<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.789> show<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.000> what<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.300> does<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.600> can

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
is just to show you what it does you can

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.420 
is just to show you what it does you can
see<00:00:51.780> over<00:00:52.110> here<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.500> leaves<00:00:52.710> are<00:00:53.010> pretty<00:00:53.129> well

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
see over here the leaves are pretty well

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.830 
see over here the leaves are pretty well
detailed<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.059> shadow<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.480> as<00:00:54.629> soon<00:00:54.750> as

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
detailed in the shadow and as soon as

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.360 
detailed in the shadow and as soon as
you<00:00:54.930> go<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.079> normal<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.649> just<00:00:55.800> becomes<00:00:56.039> kind<00:00:56.160> of

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
you go to normal it just becomes kind of

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.459 
you go to normal it just becomes kind of
a<00:00:56.460> big<00:00:56.640> block<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.719> can<00:00:57.899> see<00:00:57.989> around<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.320> edges

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
a big block you can see around the edges

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.260 
a big block you can see around the edges
of<00:00:58.680> my<00:00:58.770> screen<00:00:59.070> here<00:00:59.309> it's<00:00:59.430> very<00:00:59.640> blurry<00:01:00.030> and

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
of my screen here it's very blurry and

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.060 
of my screen here it's very blurry and
that's<00:01:00.570> what<00:01:00.690> post-processing<00:01:01.410> effects<00:01:01.890> does

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
that's what post-processing effects does

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.410 
that's what post-processing effects does
it<00:01:02.219> gives<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.399> kind<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.760> depth<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.149> field

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
it gives you kind of a depth of field

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.750 
it gives you kind of a depth of field
effect<00:01:03.809> now<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.739> super<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.189> processor

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
effect now that is super a processor

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.010 
effect now that is super a processor
intensive<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.390> want<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.630> go<00:01:06.689> ahead<00:01:06.869> and

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
intensive and you want to go ahead and

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.320 
intensive and you want to go ahead and
disable<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:08.700> next<00:01:08.909> thing<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.150> we're

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
disable that the next thing that we're

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.850 
disable that the next thing that we're
gonna<00:01:09.420> change<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.960> anisotropic<00:01:10.229> filtering

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
gonna change is anisotropic filtering

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.160 
gonna change is anisotropic filtering
now<00:01:11.729> some<00:01:12.000> players<00:01:12.240> have<00:01:12.420> noted<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:12.780> that

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
now some players have noted that that

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.600 
now some players have noted that that
doesn't<00:01:13.560> really<00:01:13.740> increase<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.250> frames<00:01:14.460> per

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
doesn't really increase the frames per

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.830 
doesn't really increase the frames per
second<00:01:14.939> too<00:01:15.000> much<00:01:15.210> but<00:01:15.390> anything<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.659> you

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
second too much but anything that you

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.480 
second too much but anything that you
can<00:01:16.020> do<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.320> lower<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.710> processor<00:01:17.130> load<00:01:17.159> is

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
can do to lower the processor load is

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.280 
can do to lower the processor load is
gonna<00:01:17.670> be<00:01:17.759> helpful<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.659> let's<00:01:18.689> go<00:01:18.900> ahead<00:01:18.990> and

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
gonna be helpful so let's go ahead and

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.070 
gonna be helpful so let's go ahead and
adjust<00:01:19.560> anti-aliasing<00:01:20.490> down<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.880> low

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
adjust anti-aliasing down to low

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.420 
adjust anti-aliasing down to low
anti-aliasing<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.259> what<00:01:22.439> gives<00:01:22.650> edges<00:01:23.220> on

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
anti-aliasing is what gives edges on

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.340 
anti-aliasing is what gives edges on
your<00:01:23.460> models<00:01:24.000> on<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.360> buildings<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.990> kind<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.229> a

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
your models on the buildings a kind of a

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.020 
your models on the buildings a kind of a
smoother<00:01:25.830> look<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.700> can<00:01:26.790> be<00:01:26.880> very

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
smoother look and it can be very

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.789 
smoother look and it can be very
processor<00:01:27.630> intensive<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.229> again<00:01:28.439> let's<00:01:28.680> go

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
processor intensive so again let's go

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.499 
processor intensive so again let's go
ahead<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.070> set<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.220> down<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.670> low<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.390> with

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
ahead and set that down to low so with

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.819 
ahead and set that down to low so with
the<00:01:30.630> latest<00:01:30.930> beta<00:01:31.079> there<00:01:31.350> are<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.470> couple<00:01:31.590> new

not gonna care about PPA in fact you

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:51.950 
not gonna care about PPA in fact you
probably<00:01:50.850> shouldn't<00:01:51.180> even<00:01:51.270> have<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.600> on<00:01:51.689> it's

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
probably shouldn't even have it on it's

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.359 
probably shouldn't even have it on it's
just<00:01:52.140> gonna<00:01:52.229> be<00:01:52.380> more<00:01:52.530> processor<00:01:53.040> intensive

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
just gonna be more processor intensive

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.569 
just gonna be more processor intensive
so<00:01:54.030> I'm<00:01:54.090> just<00:01:54.210> gonna<00:01:54.299> keep<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.689> as<00:01:54.840> disabled

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
so I'm just gonna keep that as disabled

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.249 
so I'm just gonna keep that as disabled
so<00:01:56.579> if<00:01:56.729> you'll<00:01:56.850> notice<00:01:57.060> my<00:01:57.509> trees<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.200> my

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
so if you'll notice my trees and my

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.440 
so if you'll notice my trees and my
grass<00:01:58.530> are<00:01:58.740> very<00:01:59.009> lush<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.700> that's<00:02:00.149> what<00:02:00.299> a

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
grass are very lush and that's what a

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.630 
grass are very lush and that's what a
talk<00:02:00.719> does<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.469> loads<00:02:01.770> different<00:02:02.219> textures

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
talk does it loads different textures

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.370 
talk does it loads different textures
and<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.969> loads<00:02:03.149> different<00:02:03.630> objects<00:02:04.049> into<00:02:04.259> the

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
and it loads different objects into the

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.050 
and it loads different objects into the
game<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:05.009> give<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.340> trees<00:02:05.579> in<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.820> grass<00:02:06.030> a

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
game to give the trees in the grass a

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.059 
game to give the trees in the grass a
different<00:02:06.600> kind<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.869> look<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.320> can<00:02:07.829> kind<00:02:08.009> of

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
different kind of look you can kind of

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.410 
different kind of look you can kind of
play<00:02:08.220> with<00:02:08.340> all<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.580> settings<00:02:08.910> yourself<00:02:09.239> to

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
play with all the settings yourself to

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.969 
play with all the settings yourself to
see<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.750> different<00:02:10.080> looks<00:02:10.229> but<00:02:10.590> for<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.830> most

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
see the different looks but for the most

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.440 
see the different looks but for the most
part<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.340> can<00:02:11.370> just<00:02:11.610> disable<00:02:11.849> if<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.239> want<00:02:12.390> to

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
part you can just disable if you want to

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.150 
part you can just disable if you want to
get<00:02:12.569> better<00:02:12.720> frames

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
get better frames

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.090 
get better frames
second<00:02:14.050> so<00:02:15.050> right<00:02:15.200> now<00:02:15.380> I'm<00:02:15.530> recording<00:02:15.980> with

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
second so right now I'm recording with

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.700 
second so right now I'm recording with
fraps<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:16.700> I'm<00:02:16.880> getting<00:02:17.180> around<00:02:17.510> 45<00:02:18.200> to<00:02:18.230> 60

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
fraps and I'm getting around 45 to 60

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.500 
fraps and I'm getting around 45 to 60
frames<00:02:18.950> per<00:02:19.040> second<00:02:19.520> and<00:02:19.640> on<00:02:20.090> places<00:02:20.480> where

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
frames per second and on places where

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.940 
frames per second and on places where
there's<00:02:20.810> lots<00:02:21.020> of<00:02:21.140> objects<00:02:21.530> or<00:02:21.650> lots<00:02:21.860> of

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
there's lots of objects or lots of

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.220 
there's lots of objects or lots of
buildings<00:02:22.310> I'm<00:02:22.610> getting<00:02:23.000> about<00:02:23.090> 28<00:02:23.780> to<00:02:23.960> 30

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
buildings I'm getting about 28 to 30

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.800 
buildings I'm getting about 28 to 30
zooms<00:02:24.890> in<00:02:25.070> here<00:02:25.340> I'm<00:02:25.520> getting<00:02:25.790> about<00:02:25.880> maybe<00:02:26.330> 30

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
zooms in here I'm getting about maybe 30

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:27.880 
zooms in here I'm getting about maybe 30
to<00:02:26.900> 33

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
to 33

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.650 
to 33
so<00:02:28.310> everything's<00:02:28.880> actually<00:02:29.210> looking<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.540> lot

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
so everything's actually looking a lot

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.170 
so everything's actually looking a lot
better<00:02:29.720> I'm<00:02:30.260> not<00:02:30.530> as<00:02:30.710> laggy<00:02:30.980> as<00:02:31.160> before<00:02:31.520> and<00:02:31.760> as

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
better I'm not as laggy as before and as

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.580 
better I'm not as laggy as before and as
soon<00:02:32.360> as<00:02:32.420> it<00:02:32.570> turn<00:02:32.690> off<00:02:32.720> fraps<00:02:33.080> I<00:02:33.260> should<00:02:33.440> get

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
soon as it turn off fraps I should get

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.380 
soon as it turn off fraps I should get
about<00:02:33.740> a<00:02:33.800> 5<00:02:34.130> to<00:02:34.340> 15<00:02:34.670> frames<00:02:34.910> per<00:02:35.060> second

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
about a 5 to 15 frames per second

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.510 
about a 5 to 15 frames per second
increase<00:02:35.720> so<00:02:36.200> thanks<00:02:36.680> for<00:02:36.800> watching<00:02:37.130> and<00:02:37.340> see

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
increase so thanks for watching and see

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.090 
increase so thanks for watching and see
