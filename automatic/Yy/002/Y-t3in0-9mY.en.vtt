00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.530
 after the sedan in the spring it's the turn of the break tired of being 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.420
 marketed it wants to be a reference on the segment of the breaks 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.370
 premium family in terms of interior modularity in terms of 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.789
 loading and in traction capacity 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.039
 the top 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.490
 but as for the sedan the break avant garde and is distinguished by its 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.320
 grille and its more aggressive shield 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.349
 while classics and elegance 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.729
 concert with a more classic troupe with the star overhanging the grid of 

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:33.190
 radiator barely larger than the sedan the new steered displays a 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.460
 floor area greater than the old companion 6 centimeters in length and 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.780
 four in width 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.750
 without asking more than the previous one happily the height remains stable a 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:42.920
 master 46 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.980
 decosse which gives him the size of a audi a4 before 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.400
 the livability of which that of the sedan he gains compared to the real that 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.740
 of older generations mainly elbows wide dare for the 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.580
 a little also on guard at the roof or legs at the back the trunk 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.450
 to collect a minimum of 10 liters and a maximum of 150 liters 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.650
 mainly tailgate window radius - tilted capacity in 5 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.880
 seats the luggage cover reaches 485 liters with anti-puncture kit 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.000
 load up to the pavilion the volume reaches 690 liters always in 5 places 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.700
 and at the maximum bench folded one reaches 1500 liters 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.260
 class c is distinguished by a more present and agile behavior than 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.800
 that of the previous generation 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.650
 while also remaining 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.900
 the comfort of suspension of the assembly in all the districts excellent even 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.150
 if the cash movements remain too large the lack of lateral support of the 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.230
 Series seats do not arrange things 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.330
 how last we could not produce enough blood these crimes 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.920
 we took the opportunity to try this basic diesel engine with 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.910
 the loan 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.350
 the 4 cylinders 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.159
 2 to win compared to the old generation eleven percent power 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.010
 and 12% in mixed consumption 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.160
 without being really under-powered 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.120
 the truth that this force requires him to remake his delay taken on the 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.380
 fifth and sixth report and his passable accelerations 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.660
 let the drivers get nervous about their fate 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.390
 for 2000 euros more the break his 220 these countries which is much more 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.490
 vigorous with its 410 metric tons that tired of sensitivity 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.490
 we are there wiser choice 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:16.829
 when we go to the big worries chapter 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:20.089
 the new class c break does not seem too badly placed among the 

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:23.150
 premium builders especially as his benefits we really want 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.139
 seduced the price differential compared to the sedan was reduced to 1450 euros 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:30.599
 against 1800 for the previous generation the rates are so 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:31.400
 reasonable 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.469
 but always higher than at the general manufacturers 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:37.469
 caradisiac liked both sides 

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:40.359
 caradisiac did not deserve 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:42.490
 lack of resources more sensitivity 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.840
 and the rates always found
