00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 beauty guys in this video I'm going today 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.970
 give some tips for you how 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.890
 control the autofocus of your 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.160
 dslr camera so let's go and show it to 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.160
 you 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.279
 So where are you talking about the points? 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.590
 auto focus and the ways of a focus 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.750
 most used in beauty dslr cameras 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.359
 then each camera has an amount of 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.210
 point auto focus line and t2 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.870
 line t4 skin the whole line stole from da 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.930
 canon 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.600
 are nine points of focus at nikon d3100 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.360
 are 11 points of auto focus in Canon 7d 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.890
 19 points of self-focus are humiliated 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.870
 nikon of 7,100 are 51 points is the focus 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.449
 so the more points the focus is 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.160
 easy for you to focus more on these nine 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.260
 points is the focus I have on my 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.360
 enough position also then you have 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.870
 option to select only one 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.879
 as all focus points of a 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.519
 Sometimes it's depending on your camera. 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.530
 you can select the group of 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.970
 auto focus when you select all the 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.400
 points is another focus on your camera that 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.479
 happens it becomes automatic then your 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.729
 camera will decide where to focus then 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.100
 often it focuses in the wrong place 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.350
 she always searches in her image where she has 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.200
 more contrast and you already select 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.780
 just one point a group forum you 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.909
 can focus more accurately on your 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.090
 Such beauty object so you have to 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.680
 learning how to use the points to focus is 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.659
 you manually change 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.340
 You have a center and in the field you have to 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.250
 up and down so always when 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.840
 you focus on an object is you change your 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.479
 point of focus to the furthest point 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.030
 next and if the object tj for you does not 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.560
 have to focus and recompose 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.119
 so if you are using a 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.140
 Aperture too large one 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.040
 1.4.2 and you select 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.780
 center 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.090
 there you will focus on your object that is 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.090
 in the corner it's here only that many photographers 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.840
 stage it focuses on one person's eye 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.840
 day like this 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.840
 then reassembles right to picture just 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.330
 framed in the person in the corner 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.220
 even using the rules of the third then 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.629
 when you recompose if you had 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.290
 using a very large aperture that I 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.599
 I spoke 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.950
 it may be that the person gets out of focus 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.849
 let's see that you little in the eye of 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.470
 person is there in opening 1.410 focused 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.569
 in the person's eye with the point of focus 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.910
 the person 's cancer center when 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.190
 You make up, you 're altering the plan. 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.750
 then it may be that the eye of the 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.489
 person gets out of focus the ear stays in 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.150
 focus then you have to be careful with 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.340
 that 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.140
 if you are using it is open more 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.540
 closed right 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.849
 You will have no problem ta most 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.290
 of photographers do this but it's good you 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.930
 learn to use the auto focus points 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.780
 It's up to you to select a focus point. 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.280
 closest to your object 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.150
 you can move the camera just a little bit 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.160
 to focus is and recover but moving well 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.780
 little the camera like this will not have danger 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.430
 of your object is out of shape 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.370
 or if you do not know how to change the 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.959
 its focus point so I made a video 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.140
 to not like me when and how 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.519
 to use only this r I live there as you are 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.930
 change the auto focus points and I will 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.760
 let him in the description of the video you 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.989
 They can watch later, too. 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.930
 when you are using the 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.280
 auto focus you select everyone is so 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.500
 many people think that it focuses on a 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.190
 Bring it on, too. 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.900
 so it will not focus even if you 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.489
 see there you see problem makes it 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.889
 selected a left tip slightly in the 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:33.650
 right the focal plane will be the same're 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:35.329
 focus on an object on the same line of 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.430
 object that will be back-focused 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:40.130
 will stand out forward will stand out 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.810
 focus also then you're ok 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.609
 selected all the focus points and will 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.040
 select both front and back 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:47.750
 now talking about the auto focus modes is 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.230
 then talk about the main ones that are the 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.880
 single shot or coutinho noted collection 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.739
 is so dependent on the camera that you 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.419
 have it it will be called different but 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:00.099
 the function will be the same 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:03.440
 so the single servant is when you 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:05.209
 select it you press the 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.970
 I shoot until half happens it goes 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.910
 focus your object is on and will hang 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.190
 so if the object moves, you are already 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.799
 out of focus you take your hand off the button 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:19.159
 and focus again then the 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:21.829
 is only for objects that are 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:22.350
 still you're also would have stopped 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.870
 your 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:28.860
 have already shot very little talk 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:31.200
 and the continuous I serve collection is for 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.270
 objects that are in motion are then 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.280
 it never hangs you will speed up the 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.960
 press the shutter button halfway 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.220
 it will put the objects only if the 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.470
 object to move 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.510
 it will focus to denote without you have to 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.600
 pushing a finger on the button will always have 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:48.630
 focusing then is this continuous mode 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.640
 you use to do sport is to 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.970
 objects that are moving child 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.010
 running a dog car 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.110
 if you're going to make that effect pane 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.660
 It's also that you have to follow in your 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.460
 object happened to photograph it will be 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.720
 always focusing will never stop 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.840
 beauty 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.810
 so for this you use continuous 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.660
 when you are in the single mode is the 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.040
 his focus hangs and he gives that bug 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.100
 is enabled for your camera then 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.980
 You know you focused if you're 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.900
 using continuous he does not like he does not he 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.400
 does not lock focus and also does not say 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.260
 bittar then you will see the little light 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.880
 red rising through the fire is 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.070
 focus point 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.770
 it will light but it will not give the pipita 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.770
 so there are people who sometimes change without 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.360
 want in the camera that way and the camera 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.860
 for then referee the person gets through 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.650
 not knowing what to do then that's it 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.270
 when it beeps latch 15 has right and 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.520
 When you have on the continent you are always 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.170
 focusing is in the match and focus on object 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.790
 moving 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:50.280
 he will continue to focus and then 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:53.760
 also has a focus is that is what 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:57.420
 almost no one uses it then this is the spotlight 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:01.680
 the camera decides whether it will 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:03.630
 focus is not on then can it be that she brings 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.090
 it may be that it continues to focus then 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:09.120
 she is in a year between 1 5 and 1 continue 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.440
 but I honestly can not get you to use 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.510
 Or so I hope you enjoyed it. 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.150
 I hope it helped too if you 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.560
