00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.580 

in<00:00:17.789> my<00:00:18.029> opinion<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.630> hardest<00:00:19.050> game<00:00:19.230> bird<00:00:19.470> to

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
in my opinion the hardest game bird to

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.040 
in my opinion the hardest game bird to
shoot<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.070> high<00:00:20.220> pheasant<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.880> I'm<00:00:21.810> now

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
shoot is the high pheasant and I'm now

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.050 
shoot is the high pheasant and I'm now
going<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.350> demonstrate<00:00:22.500> here<00:00:23.130> two<00:00:23.430> torches

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
going to demonstrate here two torches

going to demonstrate here two torches
the<00:00:24.210> whole<00:00:24.420> high<00:00:24.630> felt<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.310> the<00:00:26.310> new<00:00:26.609> whole<00:00:26.970> -

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
the whole high felt and the new whole -

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.929 
the whole high felt and the new whole -
extreme<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.380> show<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.580> difference

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
extreme and show you the difference

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.170 
extreme and show you the difference
between<00:00:30.199> how<00:00:31.199> good<00:00:31.500> they<00:00:31.890> perform<00:00:32.340> at<00:00:32.850> long

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
between how good they perform at long

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.970 
between how good they perform at long
distances<00:00:33.750> we're<00:00:34.350> now<00:00:34.469> talking<00:00:34.530> about

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
distances we're now talking about

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.389 
distances we're now talking about
pheasants<00:00:35.640> which<00:00:35.790> are<00:00:35.940> beyond<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:37.170> 3540<00:00:38.160> yard

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
pheasants which are beyond the 3540 yard

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.639 
pheasants which are beyond the 3540 yard
mark<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:39.030> where<00:00:39.210> we<00:00:39.300> really<00:00:39.780> require<00:00:39.989> a

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
mark so where we really require a

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.819 
mark so where we really require a
cartridge<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.579> help<00:00:41.790> us<00:00:42.320> we're<00:00:43.320> moving<00:00:43.680> on

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
cartridge to help us we're moving on

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.279 
cartridge to help us we're moving on
from<00:00:44.070> we<00:00:44.430> can<00:00:44.670> shoot<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.149> high<00:00:45.809> fessin

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
from we can shoot the high fessin

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.590 
from we can shoot the high fessin
through<00:00:46.559> an<00:00:46.680> side-by-side<00:00:47.579> we're<00:00:48.300> now<00:00:48.420> moving

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
through an side-by-side we're now moving

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.209 
through an side-by-side we're now moving
on<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.899> an<00:00:49.050> over-and-under<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.770> we<00:00:49.860> can<00:00:50.010> show

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
on to an over-and-under so we can show

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.130 
on to an over-and-under so we can show
you<00:00:50.250> what<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.730> looks<00:00:50.969> like<00:00:51.180> with<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.570> with<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
you what it looks like with the with the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.220 
you what it looks like with the with the
high<00:00:52.260> end<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.309> -<00:00:53.489> extreme<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.930> without

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
high end and the - extreme and without

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.470 
high end and the - extreme and without
doubt<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.100> high<00:00:56.250> pheasant<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.969> hardest

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
doubt the high pheasant is the hardest

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:06.320 
doubt the high pheasant is the hardest
game<00:00:57.690> bird<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.440> shoot<00:01:04.250> with<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.430> -<00:01:05.850> what<00:01:06.210> we're

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
game bird to shoot with the - what we're

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.270 
game bird to shoot with the - what we're
going<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.479> do<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.840> we're<00:01:06.990> going<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.280> produce

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
going to do is we're going to produce

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.640 
going to do is we're going to produce
two<00:01:08.790> things<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.360> think<00:01:09.540> about<00:01:09.810> not<00:01:10.290> only<00:01:10.350> the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
two things to think about not only the

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.880 
two things to think about not only the
connection<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.490> bird<00:01:11.670> but<00:01:12.659> also<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.680> the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
connection to the bird but also that the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.920 
connection to the bird but also that the
window<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.549> connection<00:01:15.210> as<00:01:15.330> well<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:15.780> we're

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
window of connection as well so we're

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.060 
window of connection as well so we're
going<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.080> have<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.320> two<00:01:16.530> things<00:01:16.770> together

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
going to have the two things together

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.120 
going to have the two things together
both<00:01:17.549> help<00:01:17.850> each<00:01:18.030> other<00:01:18.590> following<00:01:19.590> on<00:01:19.920> from

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
both help each other following on from

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.800 
both help each other following on from
when<00:01:20.310> you're<00:01:20.430> shooting<00:01:20.640> grouse<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.540> then

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
when you're shooting grouse and then

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.600 
when you're shooting grouse and then
you're<00:01:21.960> shooting<00:01:22.200> parches<00:01:22.710> with<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:22.979> hyphens

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
you're shooting parches with the hyphens

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.700 
you're shooting parches with the hyphens
because<00:01:23.880> they're<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.180> far<00:01:24.390> away<00:01:24.509> we<00:01:25.439> need<00:01:25.590> to

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
because they're so far away we need to

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.109 
because they're so far away we need to
make<00:01:25.890> sure<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.250> not<00:01:26.400> only<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.729> pickup<00:01:27.090> point

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
make sure that not only the pickup point

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.359 
make sure that not only the pickup point
is<00:01:27.450> important<00:01:27.930> but<00:01:28.320> also<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.590> connection<00:01:29.250> to

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
is important but also the connection to

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.429 
is important but also the connection to
the<00:01:29.460> bird<00:01:29.640> okay<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.869> I'm<00:01:30.960> going<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.170> show<00:01:31.409> you

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
the bird okay so I'm going to show you

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.539 
the bird okay so I'm going to show you
where<00:01:31.740> we're<00:01:31.860> going<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.040> get<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.310> connection

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
where we're going to get the connection

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.069 
where we're going to get the connection
of<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.909> bird<00:01:33.229> so<00:01:35.150> with<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.390> with<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.869> pickup

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
of the bird so with the with the pickup

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.260 
of the bird so with the with the pickup
point<00:01:37.259> it's<00:01:37.680> very<00:01:37.829> important<00:01:38.250> again<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:39.000> top

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
point it's very important again the top

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.880 
point it's very important again the top
of<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.509> tower<00:01:39.780> if<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.110> tower<00:01:40.350> wasn't<00:01:40.680> there

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
of the tower if the tower wasn't there

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.370 
of the tower if the tower wasn't there
and<00:01:41.100> this<00:01:41.189> was<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> big<00:01:41.610> drive<00:01:41.970> you'd<00:01:42.780> see<00:01:43.110> that

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
and this was a big drive you'd see that

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.670 
and this was a big drive you'd see that
you'd<00:01:43.700> give<00:01:44.700> yourself<00:01:44.820> an<00:01:45.210> imaginary<00:01:45.810> Tower

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
you'd give yourself an imaginary Tower

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.069 
you'd give yourself an imaginary Tower
there<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.280> pick<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.640> bird<00:01:47.820> up<00:01:48.090> from<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.659> so

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
there to pick the bird up from and so

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.630 
there to pick the bird up from and so
your<00:01:49.229> pickup<00:01:49.590> point<00:01:49.860> will<00:01:50.009> be<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.250> central

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
your pickup point will be the central

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.310 
your pickup point will be the central
point<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.000> tower<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.630> then<00:01:52.200> the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
point of the tower and then the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.810 
point of the tower and then the
connection<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.009> bird<00:01:53.189> because<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.610> birds

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
connection to the bird because the birds

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.399 
connection to the bird because the birds
a<00:01:53.939> long<00:01:54.090> way<00:01:54.270> away<00:01:54.329> I've<00:01:54.720> got<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.930> try<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.259> get

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
a long way away I've got to try and get

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.469 
a long way away I've got to try and get
my<00:01:55.560> muzzle<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:56.159> connect<00:01:56.520> as<00:01:56.700> tight<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
my muzzle to connect as tight to the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.920 
my muzzle to connect as tight to the
bird<00:01:57.689> as<00:01:57.930> possible<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:59.219> if<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.329> see<00:02:00.570> what<00:02:00.810> this

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
bird as possible so if you see what this

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.209 
bird as possible so if you see what this
is<00:02:01.110> like<00:02:01.290> with<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.560> bird<00:02:01.740> if<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:01.950> just<00:02:02.070> have<00:02:02.189> a

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
is like with the bird if I just have a

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.300 
is like with the bird if I just have a
look<00:02:02.369> at<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.490> straight<00:02:02.790> bird<00:02:03.030> well<00:02:04.130> there<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.250> is

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
look at a straight bird well there it is
