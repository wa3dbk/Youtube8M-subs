00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
Michaels and I cut it out and so this is

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:00.179 
Michaels and I cut it out and so this is
how<00:01:53.369> that's<00:01:53.880> looking<00:01:54.240> once<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.470> painted

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:03.929 

so<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:02.229> that's<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.859> opposite<00:02:03.399> side<00:02:03.609> which<00:02:03.819> I

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
so and that's the opposite side which I

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.059 
so and that's the opposite side which I
haven't<00:02:04.299> painted<00:02:04.539> yet<00:02:05.020> but<00:02:05.649> it'll<00:02:05.920> look<00:02:06.009> just

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
haven't painted yet but it'll look just

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:08.999 
haven't painted yet but it'll look just
like<00:02:06.460> this<00:02:06.729> size<00:02:07.030> this<00:02:08.019> side<00:02:08.289> when<00:02:08.649> I'm<00:02:08.799> done

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
like this size this side when I'm done

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.449 
like this size this side when I'm done
okay<00:02:10.470> but<00:02:11.470> either<00:02:11.590> way<00:02:11.830> I<00:02:11.860> just<00:02:11.980> wanted<00:02:12.340> to

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
okay but either way I just wanted to

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.140

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
I took a plate and I traced the plate

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.289 
I took a plate and I traced the plate
and<00:02:19.780> that<00:02:20.709> gave<00:02:20.950> me<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.370> size<00:02:22.000> of<00:02:24.299> styrofoam

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299

the styrofoam and I dug it into the
plate

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
plate

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.250

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
well the styrofoam that was traced like

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.160
