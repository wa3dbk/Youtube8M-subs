show you how you can have a running cap

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.169 
show you how you can have a running cap
and<00:00:05.420> headset<00:00:06.420> in<00:00:06.600> one<00:00:07.370> and<00:00:08.370> not<00:00:08.670> just<00:00:09.000> a

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
and headset in one and not just a

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.780 
and headset in one and not just a
headset<00:00:09.599> but<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.440> bone<00:00:10.830> conduction<00:00:11.040> headset

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
headset but a bone conduction headset

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.539 
headset but a bone conduction headset
that<00:00:12.030> means<00:00:12.660> that<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.740> sound<00:00:13.980> is<00:00:14.070> transferred

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
that means that the sound is transferred

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.080 
that means that the sound is transferred
through<00:00:14.580> vibration<00:00:15.590> by<00:00:16.590> these<00:00:16.770> little

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
through vibration by these little

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.210 
through vibration by these little
transducers<00:00:18.090> here<00:00:18.359> they<00:00:18.990> touch<00:00:19.260> your<00:00:19.500> head<00:00:19.680> so

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
transducers here they touch your head so

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.670 
transducers here they touch your head so
you<00:00:20.699> can<00:00:20.939> hear<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.779> sound<00:00:22.020> without<00:00:22.320> having

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
you can hear the sound without having

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.609 
you can hear the sound without having
anything<00:00:23.160> in<00:00:23.400> or<00:00:23.820> on<00:00:24.000> your<00:00:24.269> ears<00:00:24.510> this<00:00:25.380> means

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
anything in or on your ears this means

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:26.630 
anything in or on your ears this means
that<00:00:25.710> when<00:00:25.859> you're<00:00:25.980> running<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.460> can

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
that when you're running you can

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.570 
that when you're running you can
actually<00:00:26.820> pay<00:00:27.119> attention<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.720> traffic<00:00:27.960> and

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
actually pay attention to traffic and

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.540 
actually pay attention to traffic and
still<00:00:29.580> stay<00:00:30.240> connected<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.779> your<00:00:30.929> phone<00:00:31.550> so
