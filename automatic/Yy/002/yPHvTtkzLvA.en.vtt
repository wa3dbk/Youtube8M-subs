00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.880
 As a kid I was a big fan of 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.460
 play all pokémon 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.540
 the first game I owned was the 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.000
 red edition 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.000
 I played it again several times 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.590
 to complete a pokédex 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.490
 my sister was in possession of the blue 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.130
 edition 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.689
 this allowed us the unattainable 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.980
 pokémon between the different 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.600
 exchange versions 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.910
 we all wanted the 151 million 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.890
 We looked for it everywhere to make 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.690
 like the truck of msn or the 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.239
 blocked grass outside of allah 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.530
 bastian we could not find anything on 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.600
 and unfortunately were unsuccessful 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.730
 on a dark summer night I did 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.879
 me on the way to the hotel of prisma 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.730
 city when I inquired about the building 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.399
 I discovered something unusual that 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.890
 My interest woke it was a 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.190
 computer as I am the hidden 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.080
 If I had approached something I would have something 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.210
 strange i would have a weird one 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:12.190
 hein from my gameboy speakers 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:14.409
 there it was but the letters were 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.710
 twisted and I had no idea what 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.740
 that meant it was staring at me 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.240
 and his eyes moved 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.850
 comparable to the old red edition 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.580
 from pokémon, the spreads were none 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.440
 animation 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.450
 I was starting to get scared so I lost myself 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.520
 decided to escape from the hotel 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.520
 but my character could not 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.429
 I tried again on the pc 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.880
 to access and a text box appeared 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:44.470
 I will chase you for your spirit 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.390
 catch and I for eternity 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.649
 cross 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.049
 I quickly tried the gameboy 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.360
 but it works 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.340
 just not even after removal 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.229
 the batteries became my gameboy 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.610
 which continues to be powered 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.950
 actually already was possible 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.299
 all that was left was the gameboy 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.899
 to throw on the side 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:07.090
 I shivered again, I heard in one 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.149
 high tone the cry of your own it was 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.560
 much louder than that of a gameboy 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.810
 slowly I moved in the direction 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.040
 of the device while a shiver me 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.200
 ran back down it was out of me 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.609
 urgently needed to talk to someone 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.620
 I told the event of my 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:24.670
 sister 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.709
 of course she does not believe me and 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.239
 started laughing 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.640
 i have my gameboy in a drawer 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.710
 laid and never swore to me again 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.720
 playing Pokémon 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:38.170
 Later in the night I tried to 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.380
 I could not sleep in vain 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.790
 afraid to fight against in my head 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.460
 after a while I made it 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.920
 fall asleep and dreamed me me 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.630
 will hunt through my house 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.140
 I ran there fell several times on the 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.320
 ground 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.880
 it felt like my legs were 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.240
 to lose vitality 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.980
 It was right behind me but 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.600
 I did not dare to go back 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.490
 watch 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.430
 bathed in sweat, I woke up 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:09.460
 it was just a dream everything will be fine 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.220
 I thought I would have that again 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.590
 yell from me my gameboy lay next to me 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.380
 me on my desk with one 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:22.980
 twisted and withered news raid a 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:27.960
 text field appeared I chose similar 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.960
 made straub to be exploited
