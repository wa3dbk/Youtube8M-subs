 Forster «We connected the thermal bath to the iPhone 4 here 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.419
 Officers are also one with all the other percent at SuS if you're ready 

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:09.179
 is 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.570
 and that's what he has to measure fever and how everything you do 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.789
 Objects here 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:16.789
 on the table and the fan mile hottest 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:19.859
 a freshly brewed stands 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.279
 Lesson Temperatures Going Up You Should Enter At Midnight 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.050
 desperate parents 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.210
 «To measure Malte Kotzur again 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.960
 At first it was licking 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.030
 First was the Magic Mouse 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.960
 the clubs where that means percent 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.320
 this was done by no artisans and the temperature 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.870
 the before down then it looks the same 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.180
 consider one percent 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.720
 Then it went on with one 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.910
 and 4 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.200
 under a surface temperature you will of 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.520
 11 degrees 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.470
 actually 4000 books completely on 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.650
 set four degrees but spared stay out now 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:04.479
 percent 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.460
 That's because the temperature is rising 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.720
 a little bit 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.720
 so now but no I was very curious and was 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.910
 could be 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.190
 that the temperature is no longer supported 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.430
 that has a very simple reason for me 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.600
 to the club song of 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.760
 a towering 1 percent of course I'm ahead 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.910
 until the complaints 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.470
 Percent Kendall to the load 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.240
 the camera accompanies itself numbers so organizer I have just 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.290
 Installed 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.720
 Let's see if we are like this 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.100
 Mas mode 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.100
 because on Monday booked to make music 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.170
 Words how to climb a beautiful distance of five centimeters 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.899
 Once around should go to the temple 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.899
 Meg Whitman's opponents very well for compact 3 2 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.360
 Umicore is spontaneous 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.800
 demonstrate 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.870
 the surcharge on the topic 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.870
 up to the temple and go as expected 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.790
 entertainment 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.019
 7 30 degrees 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:10.689
 Goosen temperature 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:14.419
 and I let my parents check me so there is no topic 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:19.060
 Of course you have only 2 times 1 002 deviations where I say of course 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:20.699
 can um 

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:22.949
 which has reached it 

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:26.059
 but five-figure amount for children maybe 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:29.070
 Percent, we are only 3 4 seconds 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.379
 also human without touch 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.999
 November on the table 

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:35.559
 around 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:38.719
 I did not want to ask anyone who of you alright 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:42.779
 Star box is formal 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.269
 he now receives the data 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.879
 Euro also succeeded here, however, too high I now fallen for a long time 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:55.689
 Vote goes 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:58.910
 because percent 70 degrees the electoral commission too much 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.279
 that's exactly what they measured in the range of 35 to 43 degrees or so 

00:03:04.279 --> 00:03:08.029
 All in all, it's going to be history is not history 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:11.599
 unfortunately they are looking for 80 euros 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:12.739
 but 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.019
 No, the year over in the Dock Connector is supposed to be connected 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.019
 keep a few Yesil still
