00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.670
 so has the bank of anthony warendorf 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.870
 now my first report with 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.030
 his video that he simply much 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.130
 easier than it is to the movie already for 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:17.160
 today's nice diesel and it is 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.810
 a class e 220 cdi is quite good 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.130
 performance moves well by unfortunately knows 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.630
 that was not completely tested that was 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.490
 vehicle fresh from the factory is that is 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.670
 three days old meanwhile has twelve 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.920
 Kilometers picked up the vehicle is 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.199
 even stronger now you have to say that 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.680
 I'm 20 years old so you can see without 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.110
 will you get but sensible cars 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.420
 and I have to say that she does that 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.350
 true class driver is a very good one 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.520
 car here already sedlak a xenon 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.930
 headlight that means he has me like that 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.450
 the extravagant outfit how to 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:53.149
 actually wishes but you can see 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.149
 the usual led lights are there 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.579
 we'll just go in and 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.579
 look what to find 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.430
 but you can see it coming in immediately 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.050
 very well built interieur knows that 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.200
 one but flat mercedes the 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.220
 wooden strips electric windows 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.770
 if you just go into the cockpit 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.390
 looks very well processed is often with 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.820
 known for the e-class relationship 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.080
 known for mercedes the good thing about it 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.770
 has neither seats with fabric cover 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.360
 just a lot in between 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.070
 Beinfreiheit I am two meters tall 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.479
 sometimes sit at the back but 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.500
 still still legroom one 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.759
 may see this behind here 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:33.250
 maybe I could have a boy 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:34.330
 lady sit so that everything fits there 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.080
 actually a nice gimmicks 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:41.830
 such as the electrically high 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.090
 Car boot is handy one is 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.050
 can drive down in porn too 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.229
 because you're just too lazy to 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:51.100
 get out without end place in there always 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:53.050
 Of course nobody admits of mercedes 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.530
 sentence 3 and is convinced that one in the 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.220
 Of course, she also straightens tires 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.220
 to do nicely 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.009
 the whole of course goes from the 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.490
 Connection is clear we sit down 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.490
 just come in 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:25.049
 so it can just look at the 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:26.609
 kilometer 7 still 33,8 I have 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.340
 now run them on when the second 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:32.939
 no bad thing say what 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.409
 so simons 46 or total below loud 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:36.329
 Handbook if you have the 1500 kilometers 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.769
 retract what I did 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.959
 Of course you can in the weather 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.159
 out nicely much snow now and then 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.379
 times that works well 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.849
 good because only pure ice is here 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.200
 no permanent crazy one 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.720
 bit accelerate the heck breaks 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.379
 that makes it all right 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.269
 a lot of fun 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:54.329
 you know the usual park detector 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:58.230
 certainly also a rearview mirror there 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:59.000
 Rear so multifunction steering wheel is yes 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.010
 already understood 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.319
 unfortunately no fog lights that is 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.790
 a bit disappointing but you can 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.540
 for example, from both sides 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.010
 and complete 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.150
 just like over there would you 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.549
 I noticed that if I did 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.989
 now the middle console movies 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.540
 missing what must be famous is the 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:21.680
 rocker who is now now 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:27.889
 here is also known by mercedes 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.889
 is not really a bad invention 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.079
 is not that right for me 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.699
 because he does not deserve me most of the time 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.019
 my arm here on the switch knob 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:38.959
 lie and then switch yourself 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.819
 you can open that up with this one 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:46.919
 he sown here somewhere they were there 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:49.979
 the paddles it is actually 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:52.019
 relatively fun you have to say only 

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:54.030
 I really miss something 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.280
 hang up you have a lot of freedom 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.010
 as you can see here, of course , many 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.049
 storage options of course with usb 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.230
 and aux connection of course bluetooth 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.000
 telephony 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.560
 and contacts import and you have 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.840
 not seen and would play that 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.629
 radio the music from the phone and a 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.730
 possible knickknack take 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:16.459
 so to speak, here in the 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:20.239
 e-class to survive climatronic is 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.460
 clear big radios also clear nice 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.780
 big navi what i noticed is that 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.100
 there is always new class but that 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.780
 after that does not get bigger when you do that 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.800
 yes comparable to audi, for example 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.139
 the screen is simply one again 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.919
 larger pieces 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.729
 I find that a bit sad that 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.910
 Maybe you could do a bit more 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:37.720
 expand 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:40.520
 otherwise the usual finesse 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.039
 light a mirror and so on and so on 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.350
 but before mirrors dimmable mirror 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.360
 he has not also pretty bad ok 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.340
 have to say the car starts at about 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.389
 40,000 euros in basic equipment then 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.520
 is the special equipment there 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.840
 then you end up with something to follow 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.389
 Price so you have a good view 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.889
 Everything is wonderful in the back 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.320
 maybe a reversing camera that 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.060
 would be something fine electric 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.770
 Unfortunately, I do not have seat adjustment 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.750
 only for the backrest up and down 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.220
 but both are sitting 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.080
 Seat adjustment must be manual 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.330
 actuate 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:16.010
 but otherwise he has everything 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:17.750
 I kind of need the beautiful one that way 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:21.010
 Of course, many assistants only have esp 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:23.690
 and content is angeles's assistant 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:26.090
 just not as much in there as assistant 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.430
 for example, the distance or knife 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:31.669
 or the curvaceous light there is still 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:34.510
 but not otherwise it is actually one 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:37.370
 you have to say very nice car 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:40.880
 and I hope you have the little one 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:42.700
 leadership failed here consumption 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:47.120
 I could actually talk again 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:48.740
 he's actually unexpectedly good 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.190
 Tank is now over three quarters 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.050
 full 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.050
 I still have 695 km / h 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:01.190
 and at the booth was a consumption of 20 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.729
 liter so the eco indicator would have eco eco 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.759
 mode 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:06.740
 sometimes that means he's switching 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:09.280
 it turns off when you at the traffic light that is 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.280
 start stop automatic 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.639
 it shows you if you like more 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:14.900
 accelerates if he even fords me 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:18.919
 or more choice if now stop that 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.389
 steady driving is the usual off 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:22.940
 instead of every day when you start that 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:24.110
 car longer stand starts the new time 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.520
 the current consumption of me 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.900
 last quarter of an hour away eleven songs 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.090
 is clear that's why I have to first 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.760
 settle down so that is now since 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.510
 reset since 20 hours since then i 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.810
 have the car 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:38.090
 that is 600 46 kilometer ago 88 liter 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.460
 that's not for a 220 he does not 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.190
 bad constantly and without kicking 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:46.610
 So it's actually fine 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:48.229
 fun is also a great car too 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.180
 for everyday use is a bit 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:51.490
 big that must be said 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.509
 get used to by the example 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.259
 mcdonald's mcd is missing then 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:56.630
 a bit tight 

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:58.849
 but you can get used to everything 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.710
 and then it should not really 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:24.830
 be a problem 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:25.940
 say something and a very nice overall 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.720
 car i will definitely be back 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.659
 would offer 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.590
 I like to try out new cars and 

00:07:29.659 --> 00:07:32.419
 by that I of course the chef 

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.530
 no formal piece to a simple 

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:36.169
 get hold such 

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:38.000
 yes as I said I have the leadership here 

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:39.020
 Liked and loved here 

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.250
 an impression of the new e class 

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.860
 just get the fresh out of the 

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:44.659
 backhaus is yes ask suggestions there 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.430
 it certainly is mine 

00:07:44.659 --> 00:07:47.240
 first guide of my camera car here 

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.620
 I just have that 

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.780
 I just talked into the eye 

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:52.250
 Certainly something has always fallen 

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:56.000
 do not complain so that's not me yes 

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:57.650
 also new but I think so bad 

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.650
 it had not been that way now 

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:03.949
 then beautiful holidays will look 

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:04.699
 Happy Holidays and do not rent too much anymore 

00:08:03.949 --> 00:08:05.690
 Money in the wallet 

00:08:04.699 --> 00:08:07.550
 that needs the over christmas and 

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.669
 New Year's Eve I wish you hear up 

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.669
 then
