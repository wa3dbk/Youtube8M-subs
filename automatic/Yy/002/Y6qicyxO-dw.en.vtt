00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.920 
very quick now I'll show you what the
keyboard<00:02:32.630> looks<00:02:32.840> like<00:02:34.540> so<00:02:35.540> that's<00:02:35.660> the

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
keyboard looks like so that's the

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.760 
keyboard looks like so that's the
standard<00:02:36.170> keyboard<00:02:37.130> a<00:02:38.530> little<00:02:39.530> bit<00:02:39.620> of<00:02:39.710> a

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
standard keyboard a little bit of a

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.490 
standard keyboard a little bit of a
different<00:02:40.220> keyboard<00:02:41.180> than<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.510> storms

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
different keyboard than the storms

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.920 
different keyboard than the storms
I<00:02:42.730> found<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.820> storm<00:02:44.090> keyboard<00:02:44.510> a<00:02:44.570> little<00:02:44.810> bit

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
I found the storm keyboard a little bit

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.080 
I found the storm keyboard a little bit
difficult<00:02:45.170> to<00:02:45.500> use<00:02:45.620> on<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.250> touchscreen<00:02:46.820> it

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
difficult to use on the touchscreen it

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.520 
difficult to use on the touchscreen it
was<00:02:47.300> sort<00:02:47.570> of<00:02:47.630> a<00:02:47.690> different<00:02:48.020> look<00:02:48.260> on<00:02:48.380> the

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
was sort of a different look on the

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.330 
was sort of a different look on the
keyboard<00:02:48.950> I'll<00:02:49.820> switch<00:02:50.030> it<00:02:50.060> this<00:02:50.390> way<00:02:50.570> as<00:02:50.750> well

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
keyboard I'll switch it this way as well

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.720 
keyboard I'll switch it this way as well
nice<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:52.610> easy<00:02:52.760> there<00:02:54.250> very<00:02:55.250> very<00:02:55.340> nice

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
nice and easy there very very nice

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.270 
nice and easy there very very nice
keyboard<00:02:56.030> so<00:02:56.540> definitely<00:02:57.530> a<00:02:57.620> lot<00:02:57.830> easier<00:02:58.130> to

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
keyboard so definitely a lot easier to

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.950 
keyboard so definitely a lot easier to
type<00:02:58.460> on<00:02:58.640> this<00:02:58.790> keyboard<00:02:58.850> than<00:02:59.390> it<00:02:59.480> was<00:02:59.690> on<00:02:59.720> the

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
type on this keyboard than it was on the

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.550 
type on this keyboard than it was on the
previous<00:03:00.460> touchscreen<00:03:01.460> devices<00:03:01.960> even<00:03:02.960> at<00:03:03.230> the

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
previous touchscreen devices even at the

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.750 
previous touchscreen devices even at the
torch<00:03:05.080> 9898<00:03:06.080> 10<00:03:06.440> I<00:03:06.710> found<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.370> keyboard<00:03:07.700> on

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
torch 9898 10 I found the keyboard on

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.040 
torch 9898 10 I found the keyboard on
this<00:03:07.910> much<00:03:08.180> better<00:03:08.390> than<00:03:08.570> that<00:03:08.720> one

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
this much better than that one

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.830 
this much better than that one
so<00:03:10.040> there<00:03:10.910> you<00:03:10.970> have<00:03:11.000> it<00:03:11.150> not<00:03:11.540> going<00:03:11.630> to<00:03:11.720> go

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
so there you have it not going to go

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.040 
so there you have it not going to go
into<00:03:12.080> too<00:03:12.410> much<00:03:12.440> detail<00:03:13.430> on<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.180> actual<00:03:14.480> phone

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
into too much detail on the actual phone

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.660 
into too much detail on the actual phone
itself<00:03:15.530> just<00:03:15.890> gonna<00:03:16.040> give<00:03:16.280> you<00:03:16.370> a<00:03:16.430> quick

itself just gonna give you a quick

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.090
