00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:09.820 
faction we're actually the best on here
I<00:06:07.430> mean<00:06:07.789> there's<00:06:07.909> a<00:06:08.000> 13-person<00:06:08.719> faction<00:06:09.229> but

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
I mean there's a 13-person faction but

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.300 
I mean there's a 13-person faction but
they<00:06:10.129> aren't<00:06:10.310> any<00:06:10.550> good<00:06:10.849> or<00:06:11.060> anything<00:06:12.159> we<00:06:13.159> are

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.310 
they aren't any good or anything we are

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.480 
they aren't any good or anything we are
the<00:06:13.520> best<00:06:13.699> faction<00:06:14.060> on<00:06:14.180> here<00:06:14.389> because<00:06:14.750> we<00:06:15.020> have

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
the best faction on here because we have

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.159 
the best faction on here because we have
like<00:06:16.490> three<00:06:17.029> donators<00:06:17.779> when<00:06:17.960> we<00:06:18.020> have<00:06:18.139> a

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:18.169 
like three donators when we have a

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:19.930 
like three donators when we have a
modern<00:06:18.650> or<00:06:18.770> faction<00:06:19.159> everything<00:06:19.520> so<00:06:19.819> it's

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
modern or faction everything so it's
