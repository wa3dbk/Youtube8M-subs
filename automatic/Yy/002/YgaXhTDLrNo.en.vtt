00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
selling is now gone so what I can do is

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.869 
selling is now gone so what I can do is
repeat<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.069> glitch<00:03:04.220> that<00:03:04.340> I<00:03:04.430> showed<00:03:04.640> you<00:03:04.760> in

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
repeat the glitch that I showed you in

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.490 
repeat the glitch that I showed you in
my<00:03:04.909> previous<00:03:05.000> video<00:03:05.629> which<00:03:05.840> is<00:03:05.989> selling<00:03:06.349> that

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
my previous video which is selling that

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.770 
my previous video which is selling that
motorcycle<00:03:07.220> it<00:03:07.340> was<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.760> pegasi<00:03:08.030> bottie<00:03:08.420> and

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
motorcycle it was the pegasi bottie and

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.020 
motorcycle it was the pegasi bottie and
basically<00:03:09.739> I<00:03:09.859> sold<00:03:10.310> it<00:03:10.430> for<00:03:10.459> fifty<00:03:10.879> nine

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
basically I sold it for fifty nine

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.899 
basically I sold it for fifty nine
thousand<00:03:11.540> dollars<00:03:11.840> at<00:03:12.409> maximum<00:03:13.129> but<00:03:13.400> this

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:13.909 
thousand dollars at maximum but this

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:15.670 
thousand dollars at maximum but this
actually<00:03:14.299> allows<00:03:14.390> you<00:03:14.659> to<00:03:14.750> bypass<00:03:14.930> that<00:03:15.230> and

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
actually allows you to bypass that and
