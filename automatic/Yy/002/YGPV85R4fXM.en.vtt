that's<00:01:19.700> what<00:01:19.880> greatest<00:01:20.750> thing<00:01:20.869> I've<00:01:21.050> noticed

about<00:01:22.009> my<00:01:22.310> main<00:01:22.549> teacher<00:01:22.790> challenger<00:01:23.479> was<00:01:23.870> the

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
about my main teacher challenger was the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.690 
about my main teacher challenger was the
fact<00:01:24.200> that<00:01:24.260> you<00:01:24.350> will<00:01:24.560> attack<00:01:24.860> him<00:01:25.040> and<00:01:25.610> it

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
fact that you will attack him and it

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.039 
fact that you will attack him and it
would<00:01:25.820> be<00:01:25.940> like<00:01:26.120> you<00:01:26.299> had<00:01:26.479> to<00:01:26.570> hold<00:01:26.720> your<00:01:26.930> own

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
would be like you had to hold your own

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:28.570 
would be like you had to hold your own
balance<00:01:27.440> all<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:27.680> time<00:01:27.860> because<00:01:28.130> it<00:01:28.220> was<00:01:28.340> like

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
balance all the time because it was like

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.609 
balance all the time because it was like
attacking<00:01:29.030> a<00:01:29.390> bag<00:01:30.200> of<00:01:30.409> air<00:01:31.600> hit<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:32.750> wall<00:01:32.990> with

don't<00:02:26.180> worry<00:02:26.480> about<00:02:26.660> that<00:02:27.050> because<00:02:27.200> you<00:02:27.440> get<00:02:27.590> a

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
don't worry about that because you get a

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.199 
don't worry about that because you get a

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
complex and you won't learn anything

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.380 
complex and you won't learn anything
because<00:02:29.450> we're<00:02:29.870> always<00:02:30.019> thinking<00:02:30.500> too<00:02:31.040> much

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
because we're always thinking too much

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
to learn so you would have to slack off

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.069
