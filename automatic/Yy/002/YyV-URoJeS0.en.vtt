 the amounts if it is for a single juice 

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:34.570
 so let's use a slice of 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.570
 melon and we will start it in small squares 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:41.829

 always a glass with water remember that 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.000
 We always go to the glass with water 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.040

 our collagen the melon has a great 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.560
 amount of vitamin e this what does 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.690
 is to protect our cells fight 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.510
 the free radicals that are the ones 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.970
 oxidize the cells and therefore the 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.700
 early aging these fruits 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.010
