00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.180
 in this review we show the assembly order 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.410
 you electric bike yourself 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:13.259
 the bike comes here like that 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:17.369
 carton box its size meter forty 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.439
 70 centimeters weight about fifty 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.230
 sixty kilos it should 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.930
 consider when you come to take 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.500
 the box is not in every car she can 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.750
 fit after removing from the box 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.329
 we see the bike coming to the floor 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.270
 disassembled his shot 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.840
 front wheel front basket steering wheel and 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.780
 headlight and fender front 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.590
 to build a bike you'll need 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.219
 Phillips head screwdriver and set 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.379
 keys 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.379
 the first step is to set the steering wheel 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:01:06.180
 set the role and fix it 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:08.150
 key 12 further we connect 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.500
 battery 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.409
 this will give us the opportunity to check 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.680
 performance of the entire system and 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:20.270
 correct connection 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:26.689
 our connectors drop it here 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:29.390
 a little push the battery is installed 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:32.549
 after installing the battery 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.040
 install the instrument panel and the front 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.229
 headlight with dashboard you will not have 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.070
 issues here are a six-pin connector 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:48.990
 chick just connect it like this 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:52.619
 way when installing lights need 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.960
 connect 4 pin connector here them 2 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.149
 but in principle even if you mix it up 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.149
 nothing terrible will happen 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:21.680
 check the correctness of the connection with us 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:25.970
 working display work turns 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:29.290
 works for whom the signal and when you click on 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.430
 the gas knob starts moving 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.440
 electric motor means everything 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.000
 connections are made correctly and can 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.000
 collect a pair of teplofon 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.760
 headlight fairing connect here 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.890
 such fate screw checks they go to 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.330
 complete 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:52.489
 special places are established 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:58.340
 we pull them up hard not to 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:03:00.470
 need not to crack plastic after 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.050
 of how the fairing he assembled 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:07.959
 fixed with two screws at the back and 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.959
 ahead to the steering column itself 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.180
 again, too, do not delay too much 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.130
 hard so that there is no crack 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.989
 plastics 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.290
 Here you can collect the steering column 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:27.730
 move on to the next step 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:33.920
 collect the front wheel unscrew 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:37.660
 remove all the jokes and insert the mechanism 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.660
 brake drum itself 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:46.420
 so that's the way we collect everything in 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.420
 reverse order 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.290
 set the front wheel in the front 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.760
 plug just like any ordinary 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:04.930
 cycling pay attention to 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.050
 this one here is a fixer and 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:13.730
 delaying 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:17.230
 on both sides of the nut the next step 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.230
 set the front fender 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.260
 cart is set using such 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:41.410
 brackets just bottom hold her 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:45.870
 tighten with the same screw 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:49.320
 do and on the other hand top basket 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:54.570
 fixed by patch planochka and 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.570
 tightened with two two screws 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:07.580
 go to the trunk assembly 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:10.520
 we install seats and plastic 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:15.810
 decorative covers 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:20.250
 sides for fixing use and such 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:28.349
 screws you can use a screwdriver i 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:30.360
 I use just a screwdriver next stage 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:43.849
 we tighten the screws 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:46.849
 which fasten the seat fasten 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:46.849
 pedal 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.900
 it should be remembered that the pedals are divided by 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:56.569
 right left and left pedal 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.569
 twists counterclockwise and 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:02.789
 so our electric bike is collected for it 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.430
 assembly took us half an hour of normal 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:06.810
 screwdriver and several keys 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.900
 do not forget to use 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:12.080
 charge the battery completely and 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.080
 pump up wheels
