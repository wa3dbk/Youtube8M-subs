we went to see yes and believe we found
these<00:00:11.639> kinds<00:00:11.969> of<00:00:12.059> cs<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:12.630> they<00:00:13.080> had<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.259> product

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
these kinds of cs and they had a product

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.460 
these kinds of cs and they had a product
that<00:00:13.860> just<00:00:14.309> amazed<00:00:15.000> us<00:00:15.360> now<00:00:15.960> we've<00:00:16.139> seen<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.410> lot

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
that just amazed us now we've seen a lot

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.279 
that just amazed us now we've seen a lot
of<00:00:16.740> conductive<00:00:17.400> chargers<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:17.990> charge<00:00:18.990> you

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
of conductive chargers that charge you

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.840 
of conductive chargers that charge you
know<00:00:19.380> basically<00:00:19.590> you've<00:00:19.949> set<00:00:20.160> them<00:00:20.310> on<00:00:20.550> a

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
know basically you've set them on a

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.050 
know basically you've set them on a
device<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.800> charges<00:00:23.039> your<00:00:23.250> units<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.000> of

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
device and it charges your units and of

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.880 
device and it charges your units and of
course<00:00:24.300> using<00:00:25.080> there's<00:00:25.230> some<00:00:25.380> sort<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.680> thing

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
course using there's some sort of thing

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.769 
course using there's some sort of thing
inside<00:00:26.340> your<00:00:26.580> unit<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.060> makes<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:27.660> it

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
inside your unit that makes it so it

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.290 
inside your unit that makes it so it
works<00:00:28.160> this<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.340> really<00:00:29.490> cool<00:00:29.640> because<00:00:30.000> it

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
works this is really cool because it

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.900 
works this is really cool because it
used<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.660> magnetic<00:00:31.320> connection<00:00:31.859> as<00:00:32.189> opposed

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
used the magnetic connection as opposed

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.090 
used the magnetic connection as opposed
to<00:00:33.030> other<00:00:33.180> things<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.540> we've<00:00:33.719> seen<00:00:34.100> and

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
to other things that we've seen and

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.620 
to other things that we've seen and
we've<00:00:35.340> seen<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.610> dura<00:00:35.790> cells<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.270> do<00:00:36.420> have<00:00:36.600> a

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
we've seen the dura cells that do have a

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.500 
we've seen the dura cells that do have a
magnetic<00:00:37.110> built<00:00:37.530> into<00:00:37.890> their<00:00:38.329> systems<00:00:39.329> with

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
magnetic built into their systems with

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.750 
magnetic built into their systems with
chargers<00:00:40.020> but<00:00:40.590> this<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.100> really<00:00:41.250> cool<00:00:41.550> we're

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
chargers but this is really cool we're

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.520 
chargers but this is really cool we're
just<00:00:42.000> have<00:00:42.149> like<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.390> magnetic<00:00:42.899> connection<00:00:43.170> on

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
just have like a magnetic connection on

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.319 
just have like a magnetic connection on
the<00:00:43.620> bottom<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.070> plug<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:44.730> away<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.210> go

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
the bottom you plug it in away you go

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.930 
the bottom you plug it in away you go
now<00:00:46.079> I've<00:00:46.200> been<00:00:46.350> loving<00:00:46.620> these<00:00:46.920> sort<00:00:47.910> of

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
now I've been loving these sort of

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.940 
now I've been loving these sort of
connectors<00:00:48.420> where<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:48.930> can<00:00:49.140> charge<00:00:49.829> your

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
connectors where you can charge your

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.889 
connectors where you can charge your
devices<00:00:50.370> without<00:00:50.670> having<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.180> plug<00:00:51.420> them<00:00:51.690> in

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
devices without having to plug them in

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.350 
devices without having to plug them in
when<00:00:52.800> you're<00:00:52.949> trying<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.699> charge<00:00:54.000> your<00:00:54.149> phone

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
these folks we found like I said at CES

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.980 
these folks we found like I said at CES
called<00:01:11.150> magnetron<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.600> we're<00:01:12.720> very

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
called magnetron and we're very

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.990 
called magnetron and we're very
impressed<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.680> see<00:01:13.890> kind<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.220> here<00:01:14.520> how

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
impressed you can see kind of here how

impressed you can see kind of here how
it<00:01:15.090> works<00:01:15.270> it's<00:01:15.509> got<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> magnetic<00:01:16.110> connection

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
it works it's got a magnetic connection

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.160 
it works it's got a magnetic connection
that<00:01:16.860> attaches<00:01:17.549> itself<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.150> base<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.750> in

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
that attaches itself to the base of in

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.660 
that attaches itself to the base of in
this<00:01:19.259> case<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.710> samsung<00:01:20.159> galaxy<00:01:20.720> s4<00:01:21.720> case<00:01:21.990> and

this case the samsung galaxy s4 case and

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.850 
this case the samsung galaxy s4 case and
basically<00:01:23.750> helps<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.869> magnetically<00:01:25.500> charged

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
basically helps you magnetically charged

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.679 
basically helps you magnetically charged
it<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.430> course<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.759> also<00:01:26.970> has<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.570> looks

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
it and of course it also has it looks

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.319 
it and of course it also has it looks
like<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.049> screen<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.340> can<00:01:29.579> use<00:01:29.790> which

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
like the screen that you can use which

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.260 
like the screen that you can use which
once<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.079> cover<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.619> s4<00:01:32.400> gives<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.150> kind

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
once you cover the s4 gives you a kind

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.819 
once you cover the s4 gives you a kind
of<00:01:33.390> your<00:01:33.540> basic<00:01:33.930> data<00:01:34.140> where<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.439> can<00:01:34.650> see

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
of your basic data where you can see

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.999 
of your basic data where you can see
calls<00:01:35.100> but<00:01:35.490> your<00:01:35.880> screen<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.299> turned<00:01:36.450> off<00:01:37.009> so

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
calls but your screen is turned off so

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.890 
calls but your screen is turned off so
basically<00:01:38.490> never<00:01:38.790> fumble<00:01:39.240> around<00:01:39.299> trying<00:01:39.869> to

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
basically never fumble around trying to

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.390 
basically never fumble around trying to
