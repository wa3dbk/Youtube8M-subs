00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
learned of Honda's new x11

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.070 
learned of Honda's new x11
it's<00:00:32.590> a<00:00:32.739> naked<00:00:32.950> retro<00:00:33.760> style<00:00:34.120> bike<00:00:34.360> based

it's a naked retro style bike based

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.320 
it's a naked retro style bike based
around<00:00:35.500> the<00:00:35.740> super<00:00:36.100> Blackbird<00:00:36.580> but<00:00:37.210> it's

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:37.330 
around the super Blackbird but it's

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.600 
around the super Blackbird but it's
capable<00:00:37.540> of<00:00:37.810> over<00:00:38.200> two<00:00:38.410> and<00:00:38.530> a<00:00:38.560> half<00:00:38.770> times<00:00:39.190> the

capable of over two and a half times the
national<00:00:40.210> speed<00:00:40.480> limits<00:00:41.520> can<00:00:42.520> you<00:00:42.670> believe<00:00:43.000> it

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
national speed limits can you believe it

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.630 
national speed limits can you believe it
a<00:00:43.390> retro<00:00:44.080> style<00:00:44.110> machine<00:00:44.860> that's<00:00:45.100> been<00:00:45.280> built

a retro style machine that's been built
to<00:00:46.000> look<00:00:46.150> mean<00:00:46.390> and<00:00:46.570> aggressive<00:00:46.930> leaving<00:00:47.860> all

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
to look mean and aggressive leaving all

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.890 
to look mean and aggressive leaving all
but<00:00:48.340> the<00:00:48.490> very<00:00:48.670> best<00:00:48.760> of<00:00:49.180> the<00:00:49.300> sports<00:00:49.570> class

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
but the very best of the sports class

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.020 
but the very best of the sports class
lagging<00:00:50.590> way<00:00:50.920> behind<00:00:50.950> in<00:00:51.579> terms<00:00:51.820> of

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
lagging way behind in terms of

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.130 
lagging way behind in terms of
performance<00:00:52.570> it's<00:00:53.320> quite<00:00:53.710> amazing<00:00:55.140> but

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
performance it's quite amazing but

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.350 
performance it's quite amazing but
perhaps<00:00:56.530> not<00:00:56.770> quite<00:00:57.370> so<00:00:57.489> amazing<00:00:58.120> when<00:00:58.239> you

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
perhaps not quite so amazing when you

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.360 
perhaps not quite so amazing when you
realize<00:00:58.720> that<00:00:58.750> it<00:00:59.020> really<00:00:59.410> is<00:00:59.649> a<00:00:59.860> black<00:01:00.160> bird

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370

underneath well I say underneath there's
not<00:01:02.560> actually<00:01:02.980> anything<00:01:03.310> to<00:01:03.550> be<00:01:03.670> underneath

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
not actually anything to be underneath

not actually anything to be underneath
no<00:01:04.239> fur<00:01:04.479> and<00:01:04.659> a<00:01:04.720> completely<00:01:05.170> naked<00:01:05.590> bike<00:01:05.800> as

no fur and a completely naked bike as
you<00:01:06.130> can<00:01:06.280> see<00:01:06.460> but<00:01:06.940> that<00:01:07.120> is<00:01:07.360> a<00:01:07.510> black<00:01:07.780> bird

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
you can see but that is a black bird

it's got different fuel injection
settings<00:01:20.590> different<00:01:21.010> timing<00:01:21.610> what<00:01:22.090> they've

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
settings different timing what they've

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.120 
settings different timing what they've
done<00:01:22.450> is<00:01:22.690> taken<00:01:22.720> the<00:01:23.229> very<00:01:23.470> edge<00:01:23.710> of<00:01:23.920> the

more mid-range more usable power means
you<00:01:29.380> don't<00:01:29.530> have<00:01:29.650> to<00:01:29.770> be<00:01:29.890> flicking<00:01:30.280> up<00:01:30.369> and

you'd<00:03:42.310> have<00:03:42.340> thought<00:03:42.550> they'd<00:03:42.760> have<00:03:42.820> got<00:03:43.000> it

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
you'd have thought they'd have got it

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
anything I don't even think they

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.490 
anything I don't even think they
wouldn't<00:03:58.570> even<00:03:58.630> get<00:03:58.810> a<00:03:58.870> pair<00:03:59.080> of<00:03:59.110> waterproof

to carry anything on one of these I'm

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.240 
to carry anything on one of these I'm
not<00:04:03.730> so<00:04:03.910> sure<00:04:04.350> but<00:04:05.350> let's<00:04:05.560> stop<00:04:05.800> the<00:04:05.920> moaning

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.800 
not so sure but let's stop the moaning
let's<00:04:06.430> think<00:04:06.610> positive<00:04:07.150> and<00:04:07.240> something<00:04:07.450> I<00:04:07.630> do

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
let's think positive and something I do

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.780 
let's think positive and something I do
like<00:04:08.050> is<00:04:08.290> this<00:04:08.500> very<00:04:09.130> trendy<00:04:09.550> little

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
clocks look at them dead smart only I

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.600

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
fuel gauge that would have been better

fuel gauge that would have been better
we<00:04:21.130> haven't<00:04:21.340> got<00:04:21.459> a<00:04:21.489> clock<00:04:21.990> telling<00:04:22.990> the<00:04:23.080> time

we haven't got a clock telling the time

we haven't got a clock telling the time
clock<00:04:23.500> that<00:04:23.650> is<00:04:23.830> that<00:04:24.340> would<00:04:24.460> have<00:04:24.580> been

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
clock that is that would have been

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.940 
clock that is that would have been
useful<00:04:24.880> as<00:04:25.150> well<00:04:25.300> but<00:04:25.960> I<00:04:26.020> can't<00:04:26.680> help<00:04:26.830> thinking

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
useful as well but I can't help thinking

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.740 
useful as well but I can't help thinking
when<00:04:27.370> I<00:04:27.400> look<00:04:27.610> at<00:04:27.729> this<00:04:27.880> of<00:04:28.150> a<00:04:28.300> malaguti

or<00:04:29.559> something<00:04:29.830> like<00:04:29.979> that<00:04:30.159> it<00:04:30.309> looks<00:04:30.519> just

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
or something like that it looks just

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.279 
or something like that it looks just
like<00:04:30.939> one<00:04:31.149> of<00:04:31.239> the<00:04:31.300> consoles<00:04:31.719> that<00:04:31.839> you<00:04:31.929> see<00:04:32.110> on

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
like one of the consoles that you see on

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:33.869 
like one of the consoles that you see on
the<00:04:32.679> front<00:04:32.769> of<00:04:32.919> these<00:04:33.069> trendy<00:04:33.489> modern

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:35.649 
scooters and I'm not sure that it's

00:04:35.649 --> 00:04:37.739 
scooters and I'm not sure that it's
strictly<00:04:36.219> in<00:04:36.399> keeping<00:04:36.789> with<00:04:36.819> the<00:04:37.029> retro<00:04:37.449> theme

strictly in keeping with the retro theme

where we'd be more used to seeing the

where we'd be more used to seeing the

Sun of chrome backed instruments that

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.719 
Sun of chrome backed instruments that
type<00:04:41.289> of<00:04:41.319> thing<00:04:41.589> but<00:04:41.619> it's<00:04:42.399> certainly<00:04:42.669> very

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
type of thing but it's certainly very

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.309 
type of thing but it's certainly very
different<00:04:42.939> very<00:04:43.419> distinctive<00:04:43.959> but<00:04:44.439> he<00:04:44.499> smarts

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:46.319 
different very distinctive but he smarts

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:49.409 
different very distinctive but he smarts
it<00:04:47.319> also<00:04:47.769> does<00:04:48.189> a<00:04:48.399> reasonable<00:04:49.029> job<00:04:49.059> of

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
it also does a reasonable job of

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.179 
it also does a reasonable job of
deflecting<00:04:49.989> some<00:04:50.289> of<00:04:50.379> the<00:04:50.499> wind<00:04:50.679> blast<00:04:50.919> away

00:04:51.179 --> 00:04:51.189 
deflecting some of the wind blast away

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:54.059 
deflecting some of the wind blast away
from<00:04:51.580> your<00:04:51.729> chest<00:04:52.059> it's<00:04:52.809> not<00:04:53.110> super<00:04:53.589> efficient

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:54.069 
from your chest it's not super efficient

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:56.459 
from your chest it's not super efficient
but<00:04:54.249> it<00:04:54.459> does<00:04:54.759> work<00:04:54.999> and<00:04:55.330> that's<00:04:55.839> important
