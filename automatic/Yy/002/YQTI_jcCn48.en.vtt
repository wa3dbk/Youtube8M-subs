at that you can draw a few cards just

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.240 
at that you can draw a few cards just
this<00:01:46.049> effect<00:01:46.350> can<00:01:46.380> only<00:01:46.530> be<00:01:46.649> used<00:01:46.799> once<00:01:46.950> per

this effect can only be used once per

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.090 
this effect can only be used once per
turn<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:49.079> can't<00:01:49.259> abuse<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:49.950> just

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
turn so you can't abuse this and just

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.359 
turn so you can't abuse this and just
draw<00:01:50.369> popped<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.270> cards<00:01:52.640> which<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.880> fair

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
draw popped on the cards which is fair

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.240 
draw popped on the cards which is fair
also<00:01:56.369> this<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:57.500> activation<00:01:58.500> effects<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.189> you

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
also this is a activation effects so you

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.740 
also this is a activation effects so you
can't<00:01:59.520> do<00:01:59.850> this<00:01:59.969> during<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.360> battle<00:02:00.509> phase

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
can't do this during a battle phase

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.980
