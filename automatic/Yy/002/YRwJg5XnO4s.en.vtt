00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:09.000
 if I have 12 years better to fish from the screen 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.000
 the follow was recorded on the huan 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:18.820
 good game good game good game 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:23.500
 this is not what they need this gift is not that 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:27.160
 what they want many tried to create 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.880
 good game but in fact it 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.880
 is impossible 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.059
 these people do not have the skills necessary 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.059
 for a normal game 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:49.370
 few things like brain reflexes 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.440
 elementary logical decisions you even 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.220
 could enter a paid subscription and swim 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.890
 along with sour in cyprus 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.920
 but our tsa is schoolchildren with 50 rubles in 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.920
 pocket 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.800
 do you think that a good game to do 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.270
 I just need nothing normal 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.009
 programmers to invest in the game enough 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.009
 money and most importantly soul 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:31.299
 you still on and draw i thought 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.659
 people don't need a good game 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.530
 well-developed gameplay 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.130
 they need new ones 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.909
 mb and gold shells for silver and 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.140
 comic holiday modes 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.689
 need to satisfy their animal 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:54.799
 needs for aggression and give them 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:02:00.170
 unlucky game boy you give them that and 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:03.009
 they will follow you and this is what we 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.009
 going to do 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:33.099
 power changes all the call of wargaming 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.099
 advanced development
