performance<00:02:23.909> advantage<00:02:24.020> we<00:02:25.020> see<00:02:25.200> that<00:02:25.350> in

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
performance advantage we see that in

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.949 
performance advantage we see that in
terms<00:02:25.740> of<00:02:25.980> weight<00:02:26.340> heat

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959

the<00:02:28.200> classic<00:02:28.560> things<00:02:28.770> you<00:02:28.920> get<00:02:29.040> with<00:02:29.160> calipers

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
the classic things you get with calipers

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.940 
the classic things you get with calipers
like<00:02:29.760> pad<00:02:30.030> drag<00:02:30.780> for<00:02:31.110> example<00:02:31.620> which<00:02:31.739> means

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
like pad drag for example which means

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.339 
like pad drag for example which means
that<00:02:32.160> when<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.700> calipers<00:02:33.060> aren't<00:02:33.360> on<00:02:33.540> how

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
that when the calipers aren't on how

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.170 
that when the calipers aren't on how
much<00:02:34.560> does<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:35.010> pad<00:02:35.310> drag<00:02:35.580> against<00:02:35.849> the<00:02:35.970> disc

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
much does the pad drag against the disc

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.820 
much does the pad drag against the disc
and<00:02:36.720> we're<00:02:36.900> looking<00:02:37.140> in<00:02:37.230> Formula<00:02:37.560> one<00:02:37.680> for

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
and we're looking in Formula one for

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.940 
and we're looking in Formula one for
fractions<00:02:38.520> of<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:39.410> percentage<00:02:40.410> difference<00:02:40.830> in

One<00:04:15.150> but<00:04:15.930> we<00:04:16.109> believe<00:04:16.410> in<00:04:16.530> Akebono

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
One but we believe in Akebono

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.789 
One but we believe in Akebono
we<00:04:17.549> have<00:04:17.669> a<00:04:17.700> great<00:04:17.970> caliper<00:04:18.450> three<00:04:19.410> words<00:04:19.650> to

we have a great caliper three words to
describe<00:04:19.829> Akebono<00:04:20.519> for<00:04:20.850> me<00:04:20.970> would<00:04:21.329> be

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.850 

one<00:04:42.360> of<00:04:42.480> the<00:04:42.540> biggest<00:04:42.750> challenges<00:04:43.260> for<00:04:43.530> GT

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
one of the biggest challenges for GT

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.100 
one of the biggest challenges for GT
racing<00:04:44.160> is<00:04:44.520> you're<00:04:44.730> moving<00:04:44.940> from<00:04:45.330> carbon<00:04:45.870> to

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
racing is you're moving from carbon to

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.860 
racing is you're moving from carbon to
iron<00:04:46.410> brakes<00:04:46.680> then<00:04:47.580> 30%<00:04:48.090> larger<00:04:48.450> in<00:04:48.690> diameter

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
iron brakes then 30% larger in diameter

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.710 
iron brakes then 30% larger in diameter
so<00:04:49.770> they're<00:04:49.980> much<00:04:50.460> heavier<00:04:50.880> it's<00:04:51.390> quite<00:04:51.690> a

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
so they're much heavier it's quite a

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.330 
so they're much heavier it's quite a

the last five years on Formula one and I

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.390 
the last five years on Formula one and I

wanted to transfer all of that learning

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.300 
wanted to transfer all of that learning
over<00:05:08.760> into<00:05:09.150> the<00:05:09.240> GT<00:05:09.540> program<00:05:10.160> the<00:05:11.160> main

over into the GT program the main

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.190 
over into the GT program the main
difference<00:05:11.700> was<00:05:11.790> in<00:05:11.940> a<00:05:12.060> GT<00:05:12.630> and<00:05:12.810> for<00:05:12.990> Milan

calipers fundamentally science the brake

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.010 
calipers fundamentally science the brake
discs<00:05:16.470> are<00:05:16.620> some<00:05:16.830> 30%<00:05:17.250> larger<00:05:18.060> so<00:05:18.570> the<00:05:18.690> caliper

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
discs are some 30% larger so the caliper

to<00:05:31.890> that<00:05:32.040> Kapono<00:05:32.400> the<00:05:33.030> first<00:05:33.300> thing<00:05:33.450> we<00:05:33.540> did

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
to that Kapono the first thing we did

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.570 
to that Kapono the first thing we did
was<00:05:33.750> to<00:05:33.900> develop<00:05:34.140> a<00:05:34.350> brake<00:05:34.560> model<00:05:34.950> so<00:05:35.340> we<00:05:35.460> could

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
was to develop a brake model so we could

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.300 
was to develop a brake model so we could
size<00:05:35.850> all<00:05:36.090> the<00:05:36.180> various<00:05:36.480> components<00:05:37.310> calipers

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
of continuing our brake relationship

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.020 
of continuing our brake relationship
with<00:05:42.960> Akebono<00:05:43.320> into<00:05:43.710> the<00:05:43.800> GT<00:05:44.160> program<00:05:44.430> is

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
with Akebono into the GT program is

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.280 
with Akebono into the GT program is
because<00:05:45.360> we<00:05:45.480> understand<00:05:45.930> each<00:05:46.020> other<00:05:46.200> very

and<00:05:48.930> we<00:05:49.080> knew<00:05:49.320> we<00:05:49.620> would<00:05:49.740> get<00:05:49.860> the<00:05:50.010> product

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
and we knew we would get the product

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.120 
and we knew we would get the product
that<00:05:51.330> would<00:05:51.450> make<00:05:51.660> the<00:05:51.780> car<00:05:51.990> quick<00:05:52.260> on<00:05:52.500> time

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
that would make the car quick on time

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.640
