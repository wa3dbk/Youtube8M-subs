00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello and welcome to do it 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.930
 yourself inspiration and a new one 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.570
 challenge video this week 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.980
 accessories and I chose this one 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.320
 bangles decided 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.400
 These are very simple metal bangles 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.680
 her in large packs quite bmw 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.720
 you do not get it completely everywhere 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.019
 Simple metal tires and I go 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.970
 so a little spiced up with stickern 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.920
 that is this year that you too 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.410
 make use of classic or to 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.239
 embroider and that's a very simple one 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.739
 Method I have two here each 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.180
 connected that went well with several 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.760
 bangles then you can get out of this 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.250
 make thin tires thicker and like that 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.570
 works now I show the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.890
 Both are the same way 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.140
 I like to work closely here 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.020
 pushed together and here I am like this 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.699
 fanned 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.190
 and yes here are three colors used here 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.350
 one and disgusting start me now 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.910
 show you this variant and 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.589
 Meanwhile, I'll show you as well 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.810
 how the other one works I suppose 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.520
 two golden ones I have silver golden ones 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.520
 and this big gold 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.150
 I think 15 pieces cost three euros 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.010
 So really super cheap the camera 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.810
 but I will wear them 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:25.080
 Now go 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:27.880
 I'll put it down for this 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.830
 I liked to have that wrapped and wrapped 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.180
 this is simply clamped in front here 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:36.970
 a great way of teheran 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.070
 works great so I start with 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:44.710
 the two parallel with it in both 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:48.690
 poor countries and go from left here 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.690
 below under the right one 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.080
 from then come back from above and go 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:02.400
 below the other 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:03.840
 from right to left the end I leave 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.490
 I'll keep it open here 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.530
 a bit firm and stabilized 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:14.610
 myself and then I go again 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:17.690
 under the right he again over it and 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.690
 under the left more 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.210
 you see it all goes away like that 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.210
 together 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:34.750
 again under the right closer 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:37.180
 over it and under the left now 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.950
 already recognize the pattern now if 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.599
 the whole thing is fanned out, it looks 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.640
 Sun and closely pushed together 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.110
 I get all this effect 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.190
 Do a few more passes now 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.400
 show you again 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.190
 I go over here then under the 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.720
 right closer and again over the 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.720
 right over it under the life here 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.230
 live a bit I loved one like that 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.190
 I have a few passes here now 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.060
 The whole thing looks like I said 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.629
 Lease sliding gets this is 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.629
 effect 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:27.250
 and widely spread out it looks like 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:30.250
 I 'm doing this pass here now 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.760
 here and then show you the same as you 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.290
 the whole concludes I'm here so'n 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.200
 section now about two 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.770
 worked centimeters 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.270
 The whole thing looks like this now 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:46.900
 really pushed together like 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.370
 It's exactly this effect and me 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.230
 The whole thing could go on here now 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.210
 open up and could have more here 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.460
 to make of this little packet 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.890
 and if I make these packages 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:00.100
 I cut the conclusion as follows i cut 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.650
 the thread here and go with one 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:06.340
 needle and thread through here once 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.810
 this package by which one moves 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.770
 so a bit and then here 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:14.980
 really club sting here once 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:17.410
 completely under it go the thread 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.310
 perform again with forward and 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.310
 make knots here 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.680
 So I link the two ends then 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.030
 together 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.379
 I will not show you that in this case 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.500
 how I make the knot so a whole 

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:34.719
 just tie a knot and in that 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.879
 In this case, I 'm doing this motive 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:38.370
 I do it all differently and show that 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:40.900
 me now 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.020
 i have the end here and i am fan 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:47.139
 all this a little bit on the 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.120
 whole uniformly distributed over the ring 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.099
 you see it all now 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.379
 relatively little effort in contrast to 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:55.319
 this is the threefold expense 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:58.060
 or depending on how many color elements 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:59.889
 you can contribute more and more 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.280
 the whole course, even more 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.280
 do 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:09.330
 I distribute this whole evenly 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.650
 and now here comes that is the 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.880
 Startbahn that comes from the left 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.530
 this one comes from the right and the 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.590
 meet up here on because I do 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:29.870
 equal 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.870
 for this the first band cuts off too 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.260
 and just make a knot about it 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.430
 simple simple double knot on it 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.430
 do 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.600
 and all right now 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.860
 I take a little bit of seal 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.950
 Seconds glue this is not necessarily 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:09.920
 you may also need others to glue this 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.620
 I just let the money go 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.610
 then it will be on no account again 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.080
 You can do it all at first 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.760
 shove a bit back and forth as you do 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.430
 lust has always been sweeter 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.900
 I think I find myself playing points 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:25.940
 you have a bit fun in hand 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:27.590
 And that's just the bracelet as I said 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.330
 in the two variants and if you 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.930
 I definitely like that 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.330
 thumb down 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.560
 I'm always looking forward to that 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.030
 and then let's see what we will do next 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.390
 week for a challenge topic 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.710
 and I quickly get rid of the tapes 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:41.650
 so now we draw one again 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.880
 term for next week 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:49.670
 I would like to return all the notes 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:52.100
 bit through and key chain ok 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:53.960
 Article games of possible help endangers 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.420
 you can do everything possible to the 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.670
 key dranhÃ¤ngen not to the whole 

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.170
 different methods yes beautiful things 

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.970
 I 'm looking forward to your will 

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.470
 So then see the next week what 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.840
 we key to the topic 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:07.130
 and yes, if you like it until then 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.080
 but shadow have us in the channel over 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.550
 Let us maybe a miracle or 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.710
 look at twitter in my topic 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.270
 facebook over with us 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.770
 if you still feel like it and still good ones 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.610
 Themes she just writes us in 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.170
 the comments 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.850
 then we just throw them in the 

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.710
 glass in and maybe that will be the topic 

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:24.820
 then next week already pulled and yes 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.820
 Until next time
