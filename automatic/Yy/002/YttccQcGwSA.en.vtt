00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.969

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:17.469
 give a group in lam and stay on top 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.540
 to create a game worth and once you're 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:21.880
 on top of creating that triangle's departure 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.310
 and you give the square to join the leader of 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.750

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.280
