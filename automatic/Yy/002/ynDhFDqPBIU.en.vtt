00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.899

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.060
 i 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.040

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.350
 teach how to perform these simple and 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.510
 originals the truth that the 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.820
 we're going to do in two minutes and the 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.080
 result is great let's see the 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.080
 materials that we need 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.619
 The first thing we need is going to 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.260
 be some hooks for earrings too 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.840
 we will need the terminals 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.450
 pieces of chains of this type or 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.460
 chain of balls and we will help each other 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.320
 cutting pliers and pliers of 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.720
 Flat tip 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.519
 let's see how to make them I 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.559
 first thing I've done has been to cut a 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:53.530
 piece of chain as far as I 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.690
 interesting and after that same life I have 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:00.390
 continued cutting chain bits 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.390
 until in total 9 pieces 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.190
 and now what I'm going to do is put them 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.190
 in the terminal 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.130
 For this I put all the same aritos and 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.759
 now he placed the terminal helped me from the 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.950
 pliers nylon inks to close it 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.710
 I tighten well terminal for the chain it 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.110
 is well placed and we could already 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.380
 leave like this but what I do is cut 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.439
 in ladder the chain so to win 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.329
 shaped earrings peak not me 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.329
 it seems that they are more funny 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.560
 and we would have them ready, see what 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.180
 beautiful and originals simply we 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.950
 it remains to place the hook 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.250
 for that what we are going to do is open 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.539
 hook the earring and put it through the 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.539
 ring that has the terminal 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.750
 and now if the mini finished does not 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.849
 say that not so simple 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.190
 we can also do in a great 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.290
 variety of colors so this has been 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.300
