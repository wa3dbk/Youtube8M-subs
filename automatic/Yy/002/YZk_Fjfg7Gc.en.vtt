 I promise to offer you a video 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.940

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.740
 stubs no my friend will fail 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.929
 you write like ants to constantly hang out and 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.820
 you are carrying the audience now do not need 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:24.090
 please, please, okay, okay 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.539
 go and go but I'll be there 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:31.500
 thank you friends and bye this dunce 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:39.270
 I have not heard anything but listen to 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:43.070
 more about the stubs learned so friends 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:49.110
 my about stub many masters 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:50.460
 faced with the concept of how to hide 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.410
 her fasteners 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.120
 supply elements for example you hand over 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.219
 work your next kitchen cooper 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.230
 kitchen table 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.840
 computer doesn't matter you have fasteners 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.780
 which must be hidden to 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.970
 he is visually not a portal appearance what 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.229
 there are options you can close secure u 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.060
 I do not close the fasteners 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.820
 caps 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.330
 consider the two most common 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.960
 types of plugs is a plastic plug I 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.970
 today without an operator so sorry 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:30.119
 nobody to bring and remove this 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.939
 she has a plastic cap 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.060
 several minus take minus it costs 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.900
 money i will need to buy this once 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.350
 secondly it has a certain thickness and 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.420
 will be at installation after installation 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.000
 stand out for the plane of your details 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.930
 This, too, not good but very its 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.440
 hillocks stands out and spoils 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.530
 no and the main minus you never 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.570
 pick and match the color of your material 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.190
 very difficult almost impossible 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.860
 material colors 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.860
 laminator colors exist there more 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:09.600
 a hundred let's stubs yourself distributed 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:13.750
 10 little man never gets 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:17.380
 This time the second strange type of this so 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:21.209
 called self adhesive plugs in 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:27.250
 In this case, I have this option 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:29.800
 some kind of nut nut some kind of mesh they 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.020
 We could honors basis they too have 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.180
 minus and not worth the money they need to buy 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:38.200
 it is to dismiss small amounts but not 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:41.800
 less have to do it and you 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.620
 never get a booze here 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.560
 the color of your laminate 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.530
 another minus is a very weak glue 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.660
 layer which after a small 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.549
 the amount of time there are several 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.620
 months they will literally answer you if 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.080
 you glue them very badly glued and 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.200
 display and fastener which 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.019
 as a rule of steel and for metals and their 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.370
 alloys 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.269
 if you especially wipe something 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.670
 wet cloth 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:12.950
 Well, it's naturally not very fast 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:16.550
 shine what i suggest and how i do 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:20.750
 and what if to us when you buy 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.790
 let's say well what kind of buy 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.760
 choose a day melamine crown 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:29.440
 and what if we are not doing well if 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:33.280
 you need to do the download yourself 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.569
 how is it done there is such a tool 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.250
 sold in in many building 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:42.890
 stores hand tools shop 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:46.480
 are called a set die cut set 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.040
 you will cut out that if to represent such. 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.160
 massive metal power with 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:56.200
 plastic insert and set got up 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:59.170
 different diameters of what we do 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.360
 one of a hundred 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:05.590
 we put on the body 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.590
 take melamine his company 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.390
 hammer 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.540
 killing 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:28.130
 get out and get we get 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.530
 cap of the same color as ours 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.630
 Fomina 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:38.900
 agree this is a class 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:45.790
 me here in my opinion is it here some 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:45.790
 us yes we glue the stub 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:56.650
 You could eat here and so it is now, and 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:59.800
 I cry but will simply put next to a 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.169
 here is our own passive agree she 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.999
 more 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:06.969
 more suited to this color or even with 

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:09.400
 does not merge and is almost invisible on 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:13.240
 actually tell from my experience if you 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.729
 okay you take ldsp and edge and maybe 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.219
 be perfect at all but I take some 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:22.330
 stub you will see if you look at it 

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:25.449
 to focus state two feet and if you 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.249
 will look at your furniture is admissible 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:27.819
 holy distance this is not at all 

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:31.990
 you see 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:33.159
 what are the advantages here on the edge at all 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.680
 another adhesive layer 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:37.270
 it is more durable and it will hold on 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.080
 you on the workpiece is much more serious 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.139
 much stronger 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.949
 glue can either melt the iron 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:46.469
 adhesive layer is you know yes either way 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:50.379
 I usually do there I 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:52.810
 the heat gun heated the heat gun 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:55.779
 pressed flew practically at it 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:06:00.250
 very cool and plus is still very big 

00:05:55.779 --> 00:06:02.439
 plus what a large number of diameters 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:05.229
 that is, you will pick up the field fixture 

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:06.310
 let's say you need to close my hat 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:09.699
 from a small screw 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:11.729
 please one diameter up to the same 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:11.729
 with 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:18.009
 let's say eur1 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:20.740
 please here eurowin under small 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:26.409
 center please under any screed we 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:31.930
 you can always pick this much this 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:32.770
 way both more rational and more 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.780
 cool 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:38.139
 and actually when you start doing 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:40.690
 you this thing is very tighten and you will 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:43.090
 I use this method all the time 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.970
 I myself have anyone this work let's say what 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:48.909
 then i fill i allocate myself in the area there 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:50.949
 10 15 minutes click to stub they 

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:55.780
 lie please and then come 

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:59.169
 stuck it all very easy and convenient for me 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:03.300
 I wanted you to like this video
