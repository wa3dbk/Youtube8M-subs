something<00:00:13.049> which<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.469> very<00:00:13.799> small<00:00:14.099> for

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
something which is very small for

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.200 
something which is very small for
putting<00:00:15.690> few<00:00:16.109> Guppies<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.880> I'm<00:00:17.880> not<00:00:18.060> sure

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
putting few Guppies and I'm not sure

putting few Guppies and I'm not sure
what<00:00:18.390> plant<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.779> going<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.050> grow<00:00:19.250> and<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.850> make

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
what plant is going to grow and I make

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.920 
what plant is going to grow and I make
this<00:00:21.210> set<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:22.250> suddenly<00:00:23.250> I'm<00:00:23.430> testing<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.600> and

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
this set and suddenly I'm testing it and

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.419 
this set and suddenly I'm testing it and
tried<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.880> fine-tune<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.140> siphon<00:00:28.140> I'm<00:00:29.130> using

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
tried to fine-tune the siphon I'm using

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.430 
tried to fine-tune the siphon I'm using
a<00:00:29.609> very<00:00:29.939> small<00:00:30.060> siphon<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:32.090> as<00:00:33.260> from<00:00:34.260> my

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
a very small siphon and as from my

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.440 
a very small siphon and as from my
experience<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.399> smaller<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.940> siphoned<00:00:36.420> the

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
experience the smaller the siphoned the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.040 
experience the smaller the siphoned the
more<00:00:36.690> difficult<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.350> make<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:38.120> since<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.480> set

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
more difficult to make it since this set

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.459 
more difficult to make it since this set
is<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.680> very<00:00:42.110> small<00:00:43.110> unit<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:45.390> siphon<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.960> use<00:00:46.200> is

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
is a very small unit the siphon I use is

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.529 
is a very small unit the siphon I use is
20<00:00:47.430> millimeter<00:00:48.170> stamp<00:00:49.170> I'm<00:00:49.410> cycling<00:00:50.750> with

straining Bell of 15 millimeter and is
it<00:01:02.190> had<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.489> be<00:01:02.609> small<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.359> accommodate<00:01:03.449> in<00:01:03.989> to

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
it had to be small to accommodate in to

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.990 
it had to be small to accommodate in to
that<00:01:04.880> cookie<00:01:05.880> jar<00:01:06.170> so<00:01:07.170> what<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.409> use<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.340> two

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
that cookie jar so what I use is two

cookie jar one on top of the other the
top<00:01:12.600> cookie<00:01:12.960> jar<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.520> cut<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.909> make<00:01:15.270> Arobin

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
top cookie jar I cut it to make Arobin

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.740

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
and the bottom four fish tank Kristen

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.280 
and the bottom four fish tank Kristen
will<00:01:18.930> have<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.350> drill<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.189> accessible<00:01:21.020> at<00:01:22.020> least

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
will have a drill to accessible at least

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.219 
will have a drill to accessible at least
I<00:01:22.409> can<00:01:22.590> put<00:01:22.799> Guppies<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.430> I'm<00:01:24.390> going<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.630> use<00:01:24.869> a

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
I can put Guppies and I'm going to use a

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.749 
I can put Guppies and I'm going to use a
different<00:01:25.740> pump<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.970> this<00:01:27.150> video<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.900> palm<00:01:28.170> is

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
different pump in this video the palm is

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.370 
different pump in this video the palm is
larger<00:01:29.759> than<00:01:29.939> required<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:31.110> it's<00:01:31.259> quite

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
larger than required so it's quite

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.700 
larger than required so it's quite
difficult<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:32.009> control<00:01:32.460> water<00:01:33.270> flow<00:01:33.540> into<00:01:34.350> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
difficult to control water flow into the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.310 
difficult to control water flow into the
crappie<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:36.140> I'm<00:01:37.140> just<00:01:37.799> running<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.430> and

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
crappie and I'm just running it and

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.100 
crappie and I'm just running it and
trying<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.470> get<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.400> size<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.939> work

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
trying to get the size of the work

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.069 
trying to get the size of the work
properly<00:01:43.220> Tomatina<00:01:44.220> was<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.790> fiddle<00:01:45.750> around

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
properly Tomatina was to fiddle around

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.660 
properly Tomatina was to fiddle around
and<00:01:46.560> get<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.549> running<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.540> eddy<00:01:48.689> stage

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
and get it running to the eddy stage

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.240 
and get it running to the eddy stage
various<00:01:50.990> outlets<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.759> various<00:01:53.759> siphon

various outlets and various siphon

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.899 
various outlets and various siphon
adapters<00:01:56.420> used<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.810> get<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.920> water<00:01:59.130> flow<00:01:59.490> or
