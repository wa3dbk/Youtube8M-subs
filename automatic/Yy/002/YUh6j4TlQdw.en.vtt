the things that I've seen so far and uh
I'm<00:00:16.529> gonna<00:00:16.680> get<00:00:16.800> started<00:00:17.070> with<00:00:17.190> dynamic<00:00:17.850> maps

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
I'm gonna get started with dynamic maps

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.370 
I'm gonna get started with dynamic maps
I<00:00:19.730> absolutely<00:00:20.730> love<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.210> fact<00:00:21.390> that<00:00:21.570> in<00:00:21.900> siege

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
I absolutely love the fact that in siege

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.220 
I absolutely love the fact that in siege
of<00:00:22.560> Shanghai<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.820> building<00:00:24.600> collapsed<00:00:24.750> and

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
of Shanghai the building collapsed and

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.500 
of Shanghai the building collapsed and
that<00:00:25.830> was<00:00:26.010> awesome<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.460> completely<00:00:27.119> altered

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
that was awesome it completely altered

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.500 
that was awesome it completely altered
the<00:00:27.630> map<00:00:28.400> there<00:00:29.400> was<00:00:29.519> dust<00:00:29.820> particles<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
the map there was dust particles in the

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.840 
the map there was dust particles in the
air<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:31.439> was<00:00:31.619> like<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.800> Jai<00:00:32.040> just<00:00:32.340> cloud<00:00:32.579> all

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
air it was like a Jai just cloud all

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.959 
air it was like a Jai just cloud all
throughout<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.300> city<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:34.370> the<00:00:35.370> area<00:00:35.670> where

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
throughout the city and the area where

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.139 
throughout the city and the area where
the<00:00:36.540> flag<00:00:36.809> was<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.410> now<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.920> giant<00:00:38.579> like<00:00:38.879> you

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
the flag was is now in a giant like you

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.750 
the flag was is now in a giant like you
know<00:00:39.239> ground<00:00:39.840> zero<00:00:40.230> point<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.520> feel<00:00:41.730> like

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
know ground zero point and I feel like

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.360 
know ground zero point and I feel like
that's<00:00:41.879> pretty<00:00:42.300> awesome<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:43.350> like<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.100> but<00:00:44.340> I

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
that's pretty awesome I like that but I

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.130 
that's pretty awesome I like that but I
hope<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.879> every<00:00:45.210> map<00:00:45.390> has<00:00:45.780> something

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
hope that every map has something

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.310 
hope that every map has something
different<00:00:46.760> say<00:00:47.760> something<00:00:48.149> like<00:00:48.390> there

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
different say something like there

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.799 
different say something like there
happens<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.010> be<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.219> map<00:00:50.460> with<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.700> giant<00:00:50.969> dam<00:00:51.420> and

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
happens to be a map with a giant dam and

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.110 
happens to be a map with a giant dam and
make<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.649> blow<00:00:52.980> up<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.160> dam<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.670> whole<00:00:53.850> map

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
make you blow up the dam the whole map

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.060 
make you blow up the dam the whole map
gets<00:00:54.480> flooded<00:00:54.809> from<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.199> water<00:00:55.469> or<00:00:55.770> part<00:00:56.010> of

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
gets flooded from that water or part of

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.069 
gets flooded from that water or part of
the<00:00:56.129> mountain<00:00:56.370> off<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.550> whole<00:00:56.699> map<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.210> the

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
the mountain off the whole map and the

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.200 
the mountain off the whole map and the
whole<00:00:58.230> part<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.530> mouth<00:00:58.680> can't<00:00:59.010> be

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
whole part of the mouth can't be

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.910 
whole part of the mouth can't be
occupied<00:01:00.210> or<00:01:00.780> some<00:01:01.020> parts<00:01:01.320> can't<00:01:01.559> be<00:01:01.649> occupied

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
occupied or some parts can't be occupied

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.170 
occupied or some parts can't be occupied
I<00:01:02.100> feel<00:01:02.309> like<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.579> would<00:01:02.699> be<00:01:02.760> pretty<00:01:03.059> cool

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
I feel like that would be pretty cool

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.630 
I feel like that would be pretty cool
what<00:01:03.510> amount<00:01:03.809> stuff<00:01:04.739> like<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.100> feel<00:01:05.460> like

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
what amount stuff like that I feel like

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.850 
what amount stuff like that I feel like
the<00:01:06.150> dynamics<00:01:06.720> map<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.140> hope<00:01:07.290> it's<00:01:07.439> not<00:01:07.560> all<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
the dynamics map I hope it's not all the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.300 
the dynamics map I hope it's not all the
same<00:01:08.570> one<00:01:09.570> thing<00:01:09.810> another<00:01:10.290> thing<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
same one thing another thing is that the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.200 
same one thing another thing is that the
multiple<00:01:12.500> sites<00:01:13.500> as<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.580> can<00:01:14.610> have<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.880> red

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
multiple sites as in you can have a red

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.960 
multiple sites as in you can have a red
dot<00:01:15.390> sight<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.049> then<00:01:16.560> also<00:01:16.710> have<00:01:16.950> an<00:01:17.040> acog<00:01:17.400> um

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
dot sight and then also have an acog um

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.600 
dot sight and then also have an acog um
I'm<00:01:18.840> not<00:01:19.740> really<00:01:19.799> sure<00:01:20.040> how<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.310> feel<00:01:20.549> about

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
I'm not really sure how I feel about

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.749 
I'm not really sure how I feel about
that<00:01:20.909> one<00:01:21.060> um<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.229> like<00:01:22.740> having<00:01:23.009> my<00:01:23.100> red<00:01:23.280> dot<00:01:23.490> in

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
that one um I like having my red dot in

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.670 
that one um I like having my red dot in
Cobra<00:01:24.090> sites<00:01:24.360> those<00:01:24.659> are<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.869> two<00:01:25.200> main<00:01:25.500> ones

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
Cobra sites those are the two main ones

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.590 
Cobra sites those are the two main ones
that<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:25.920> use<00:01:26.100> sometimes<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.670> use<00:01:26.700> infrared<00:01:27.119> on

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
that I use sometimes I use infrared on

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.380 
that I use sometimes I use infrared on
small<00:01:27.930> maps<00:01:28.170> but<00:01:28.470> not<00:01:28.680> very<00:01:28.829> often<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.729> I

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
small maps but not very often and I

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.539 
small maps but not very often and I
don't<00:01:30.930> really<00:01:31.049> know<00:01:31.229> if<00:01:31.259> it's<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:32.100> ability<00:01:32.369> is

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
don't really know if it's the ability is

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.950 
don't really know if it's the ability is
going<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.729> be<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.820> disadvantage<00:01:33.090> because<00:01:33.659> you

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
going to be a disadvantage because you

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.569 
going to be a disadvantage because you
can<00:01:34.079> have<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> red<00:01:34.470> dot<00:01:34.619> sight<00:01:34.890> for<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> close

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
can have a red dot sight for a close

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.230 
can have a red dot sight for a close
range<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.119> then<00:01:36.180> all<00:01:36.509> this<00:01:36.659> i<00:01:36.780> have<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:38.240> hybrid

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
range and then all this i have a hybrid

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.830 
range and then all this i have a hybrid
optic<00:01:40.140> site<00:01:40.470> for<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.520> know<00:01:41.640> medium<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.630> longer

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
optic site for you know medium to longer

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.990 
optic site for you know medium to longer
range<00:01:43.229> on<00:01:43.649> certain<00:01:44.340> maps<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.729> just<00:01:44.909> feel

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
range on certain maps and I just feel

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.460 
range on certain maps and I just feel
like<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.180> gives<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.390> disadvantage<00:01:45.960> if<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.290> want

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
like it gives a disadvantage if you want

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.569 
like it gives a disadvantage if you want
to<00:01:46.530> use<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.649> long-range<00:01:47.070> site<00:01:47.340> using<00:01:47.549> a

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
to use a long-range site using a

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.730 
to use a long-range site using a
long-range<00:01:47.880> side<00:01:48.180> not<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.479> if<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.470> want<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.649> use

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
long-range side not a if you want to use

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.080 
long-range side not a if you want to use
this<00:01:49.829> short<00:01:50.130> range<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.520> just<00:01:50.700> short<00:01:50.820> range

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
this short range you just short range

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.030 
this short range you just short range
not<00:01:51.360> coaching<00:01:51.869> at<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.020> same<00:01:52.200> time<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.470> don't<00:01:52.710> I

not coaching at the same time I don't I

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.469 
not coaching at the same time I don't I

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.999 
mean I'm going to I'm gonna like using
that<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.869> mean<00:01:55.020> it's<00:01:55.200> gonna<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:55.649> gonna<00:01:55.770> help

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
that I mean it's gonna it's gonna help

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.429 
that I mean it's gonna it's gonna help
me<00:01:56.159> out<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.280> lot<00:01:56.490> but<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.240> feel<00:01:57.540> like<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.899> takes<00:01:58.290> a

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
me out a lot but I feel like it takes a

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.050 
me out a lot but I feel like it takes a
little<00:01:58.590> bit<00:01:58.740> away<00:01:58.860> from<00:01:58.979> skill-wise<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.759> the

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
little bit away from skill-wise in the

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.469 
little bit away from skill-wise in the
game<00:02:01.340> another<00:02:02.340> thing<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.729> water<00:02:02.969> vehicles

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
game another thing is to water vehicles

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.700 
game another thing is to water vehicles
I<00:02:04.170> like<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.159> boat's<00:02:05.369> bow<00:02:06.240> were<00:02:06.710> more

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
I like that the boat's bow were more

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.529 
I like that the boat's bow were more
heavily<00:02:08.129> armed<00:02:08.580> they<00:02:08.789> have<00:02:08.940> more<00:02:09.119> weapons

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
heavily armed they have more weapons

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.869 
heavily armed they have more weapons
they<00:02:09.959> didn't<00:02:10.200> look<00:02:10.349> like<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.860> little<00:02:11.009> like<00:02:11.340> they

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
they didn't look like a little like they

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.980 
they didn't look like a little like they
are<00:02:12.030> HIV<00:02:12.660> boat

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
are HIV boat

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.660 
are HIV boat
they<00:02:13.110> were<00:02:13.170> kind<00:02:13.410> of<00:02:13.620> pointless<00:02:14.160> in<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.520> game

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
they were kind of pointless in the game

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.800 
they were kind of pointless in the game
you<00:02:14.850> couldn't<00:02:15.090> really<00:02:15.210> do<00:02:15.360> much<00:02:15.390> with<00:02:15.750> them

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
you couldn't really do much with them

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.230 
you couldn't really do much with them
they<00:02:16.290> were<00:02:16.350> easy<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.710> destroy<00:02:17.010> they<00:02:17.910> take<00:02:18.120> like

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
they were easy to destroy they take like

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.410 
they were easy to destroy they take like
30<00:02:18.360> percent<00:02:18.690> damage<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.290> they're<00:02:20.420> they're

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
30 percent damage and they're they're

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.180 
30 percent damage and they're they're
disabled<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.230> can't<00:02:22.470> really<00:02:22.710> move<00:02:22.860> anywhere

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
disabled you can't really move anywhere

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.310 
disabled you can't really move anywhere
and<00:02:23.520> then<00:02:24.420> on<00:02:24.510> top<00:02:24.660> of<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:25.080> couldn't

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
and then on top of that you couldn't

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.930 
and then on top of that you couldn't
even<00:02:25.380> pack<00:02:25.650> up<00:02:25.860> really<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.370> was<00:02:26.520> like<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:26.910> were

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
even pack up really it was like you were

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.370 
even pack up really it was like you were
going<00:02:27.270> wind<00:02:27.480> away<00:02:27.660> unless<00:02:27.960> you<00:02:28.170> could<00:02:28.260> turn

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
going wind away unless you could turn

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.220 
going wind away unless you could turn
around<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.800> 360<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.550> were<00:02:29.790> not<00:02:30.060> going<00:02:30.600> the

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
around a 360 you were not going the

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.820 
around a 360 you were not going the
other<00:02:31.260> way<00:02:31.520> so<00:02:32.520> I'm<00:02:33.000> glad<00:02:33.210> to<00:02:33.390> see<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.870> boats

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
other way so I'm glad to see the boats

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.830 
other way so I'm glad to see the boats
in<00:02:35.040> this<00:02:35.160> game<00:02:35.370> in<00:02:35.640> battlefield<00:02:36.090> 4<00:02:36.150> are<00:02:36.660> gonna

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
in this game in battlefield 4 are gonna

in this game in battlefield 4 are gonna
be<00:02:36.960> pretty<00:02:37.080> heavily<00:02:37.320> armored<00:02:37.800> they're<00:02:38.070> gonna

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
be pretty heavily armored they're gonna

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.420 
be pretty heavily armored they're gonna
have<00:02:38.400> better<00:02:38.970> guns<00:02:39.360> yeah<00:02:39.810> that's<00:02:40.080> good<00:02:40.230> about

have better guns yeah that's good about

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.340 
have better guns yeah that's good about
and<00:02:41.430> also<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.940> jet<00:02:42.180> skis<00:02:42.450> that's<00:02:42.990> that's

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
and also the jet skis that's that's

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.250 
and also the jet skis that's that's
pretty<00:02:43.530> cool<00:02:43.680> they<00:02:44.340> had<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.730> UH<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:45.660> ATVs<00:02:46.230> and

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
pretty cool they had the UH the ATVs and

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.380 
pretty cool they had the UH the ATVs and
the<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:47.010> bikes<00:02:47.250> in<00:02:47.490> battlefield<00:02:47.880> 3<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.240> could

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
the the bikes in battlefield 3 you could

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.210 
the the bikes in battlefield 3 you could
get<00:02:48.510> across<00:02:48.750> land<00:02:49.170> maps<00:02:49.440> pretty<00:02:49.770> quickly<00:02:49.980> but

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
get across land maps pretty quickly but

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.040 
get across land maps pretty quickly but
you're<00:02:50.370> pretty<00:02:50.520> vulnerable<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.240> it<00:02:51.840> looks

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
you're pretty vulnerable and it looks

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.800 
you're pretty vulnerable and it looks
like<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:53.070> way<00:02:53.220> that<00:02:53.460> the<00:02:53.760> jet<00:02:54.330> skis<00:02:54.570> are<00:02:54.690> going

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
like the way that the jet skis are going

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.540 
like the way that the jet skis are going
to<00:02:54.870> be<00:02:54.960> at<00:02:55.350> least<00:02:55.500> it's<00:02:55.950> gonna<00:02:56.130> be<00:02:56.310> something

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
to be at least it's gonna be something

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.910 
to be at least it's gonna be something
that<00:02:56.940> it's<00:02:57.750> going<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:57.990> be<00:02:58.050> vulnerable<00:02:58.290> but<00:02:58.650> you

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
that it's going to be vulnerable but you

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.410 
that it's going to be vulnerable but you
can<00:02:59.070> still<00:02:59.220> get<00:02:59.580> across<00:02:59.850> the<00:03:00.060> map<00:03:00.210> in<00:03:00.390> the

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
can still get across the map in the

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.010 
can still get across the map in the
water<00:03:00.690> pretty<00:03:01.020> quickly<00:03:01.880> swimming<00:03:02.880> that<00:03:03.810> is

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
water pretty quickly swimming that is

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.350 
water pretty quickly swimming that is
awesome<00:03:04.200> I'm<00:03:04.650> glad<00:03:05.250> they<00:03:05.490> put<00:03:05.880> something<00:03:06.180> in

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
awesome I'm glad they put something in

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.900 
awesome I'm glad they put something in
like<00:03:06.660> swimming<00:03:07.020> go<00:03:07.110> underwater<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.860> I'm<00:03:08.460> sure

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
like swimming go underwater and I'm sure

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.700 
like swimming go underwater and I'm sure
that<00:03:09.300> your<00:03:09.630> you<00:03:09.990> can<00:03:10.170> get<00:03:10.290> somewhat

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
that your you can get somewhat

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.410 
that your you can get somewhat
suppressed<00:03:11.190> with<00:03:11.340> bullets<00:03:11.670> going<00:03:11.820> by<00:03:12.030> and<00:03:12.270> the

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
suppressed with bullets going by and the

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.090 
suppressed with bullets going by and the
food's<00:03:12.690> I'm<00:03:12.960> sure<00:03:13.200> gonna<00:03:13.530> take<00:03:13.740> less<00:03:14.070> damage

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
food's I'm sure gonna take less damage

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.670 
food's I'm sure gonna take less damage
when<00:03:14.640> you<00:03:14.730> get<00:03:14.910> hit<00:03:15.090> but<00:03:15.870> i'm<00:03:16.020> wondering<00:03:16.200> if

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
when you get hit but i'm wondering if

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.620 
when you get hit but i'm wondering if
you<00:03:16.860> get<00:03:17.100> hit<00:03:17.370> by<00:03:17.520> a<00:03:17.550> bullet<00:03:17.790> if<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.210> have<00:03:18.360> less

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
you get hit by a bullet if you have less

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.090 
you get hit by a bullet if you have less
air<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.200> you<00:03:19.290> have<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.560> come<00:03:19.710> up<00:03:19.860> for<00:03:19.890> air

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
air and you have to come up for air

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.190 
air and you have to come up for air
faster<00:03:20.940> than<00:03:21.390> you<00:03:21.510> would<00:03:21.690> if<00:03:21.810> you<00:03:21.840> were<00:03:22.020> just

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
faster than you would if you were just

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.990 
faster than you would if you were just
swimming<00:03:22.260> without<00:03:22.560> getting<00:03:22.980> shot<00:03:23.010> at<00:03:23.340> it

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
swimming without getting shot at it

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
swimming without getting shot at it
would<00:03:24.120> be<00:03:24.240> kind<00:03:24.390> of<00:03:24.450> cool<00:03:24.510> thing<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:24.840> add

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
would be kind of cool thing to add

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.240 
would be kind of cool thing to add
because<00:03:25.260> you<00:03:25.530> could<00:03:25.650> just<00:03:25.740> be<00:03:25.890> shooting<00:03:26.160> at

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
because you could just be shooting at

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.740 
because you could just be shooting at
someone<00:03:26.430> they<00:03:26.550> keep<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:26.850> on<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:26.970> water<00:03:27.240> verb

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
someone they keep you on the water verb

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.170 
someone they keep you on the water verb
I<00:03:28.050> don't<00:03:28.320> know<00:03:28.410> 10<00:03:28.710> or<00:03:28.740> 15<00:03:29.100> seconds<00:03:29.490> but<00:03:30.090> if

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
I don't know 10 or 15 seconds but if

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.520 
I don't know 10 or 15 seconds but if
you're<00:03:30.270> shooting<00:03:30.420> at<00:03:30.690> them<00:03:30.900> they<00:03:31.230> wait<00:03:31.380> only

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
you're shooting at them they wait only

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.950 
you're shooting at them they wait only
be<00:03:31.680> able<00:03:31.830> to<00:03:31.890> go<00:03:31.980> forever<00:03:32.250> like<00:03:32.580> 55<00:03:33.570> seconds

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
be able to go forever like 55 seconds

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.530 
be able to go forever like 55 seconds
left<00:03:34.140> I<00:03:34.290> think<00:03:34.740> that<00:03:34.830> would<00:03:34.920> be<00:03:35.010> kind<00:03:35.220> of<00:03:35.250> cool

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
left I think that would be kind of cool

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.790 
left I think that would be kind of cool
shooting<00:03:36.540> from<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.780> water<00:03:36.960> that's<00:03:37.410> cool

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
shooting from the water that's cool

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.560 
shooting from the water that's cool
because<00:03:38.790> I<00:03:38.940> know<00:03:39.000> sometimes<00:03:39.330> you

because I know sometimes you

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.390 
because I know sometimes you
accidentally<00:03:40.200> get<00:03:40.410> stuck<00:03:40.800> in<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:40.950> water<00:03:41.190> if

something and throw I do like the fact
you<00:04:05.820> you<00:04:06.150> seem<00:04:06.360> to<00:04:06.390> be<00:04:06.540> able<00:04:06.600> to<00:04:06.750> throw<00:04:06.960> it

thought it was just like a bug and
that'll<00:04:14.490> go<00:04:14.610> for<00:04:14.850> but<00:04:15.120> it<00:04:15.209> seems<00:04:15.450> if<00:04:15.660> that's

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
that'll go for but it seems if that's

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.870 
that'll go for but it seems if that's
gonna<00:04:16.109> be<00:04:16.230> in<00:04:16.650> battlefield<00:04:17.220> 4<00:04:17.250> when<00:04:17.760> the
