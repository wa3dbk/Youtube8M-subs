00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.500
 in exchange for oil 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.750
 at the time of changing the oil we must 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.370
 verify that the engine is not hot 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.710
 we loosen the drain screw 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.080
 using the number 16 cup to the 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.369
 right side we remove the seal of the 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.300
 oil talking about it and we wait for it 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.300
 Remove all the oil 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.519
 the sieve we blow it with air 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.660
 compressed to remove impurities from 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.400
 oil 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.050
 Modern oils are responsible for 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.670
 clean avoid accumulation of 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.500
 particles that generate the engine mud 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.140
 and keeps them suspended in the oil 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.000
 that's why it gets dark so in 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.620
 No time affects the performance of 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.690
 lubricated while at the same time 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.190
 protects the metal parts after 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.019
 to have removed all of the oil we put 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.400
 We place the screw of the 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.110
 draw and we push to the side 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.120
 let's take care of the adjustment of the 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.309
 drain screw because we can 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.050
 damage the thread do not squeeze it with much 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.080
 force we remove the cap from the tank 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.300
 of oil we introduce a clean funnel 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.610
 we deposit the double advance 20 oil 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.040
 250 it is advisable to throw the same 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.380
 oil 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.450
 if when starting the motorcycle or when we have 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.280
 travel several meters and we see that from 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.290
 the muffler is coming out colored smoke 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.960
 white or gray is because it is burning 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.690
 oil and it is recommended that the 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.790
 take the mechanic if you're doing a 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.560
 good black color is because you are 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.600
 passing a lot of gasoline to the mix 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.880
 You need to take your motorcycle to a workshop 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.440
 to clean it, synchronize and 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.479
 correct the flows of the mixture of 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.550
 motorbike carburetor in the logo of the 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.550
 visual we see some lines superior and 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.770
 lower is the oil level the minimum 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.250
 and the maximum is very bad to be above 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.890
 of the maximum or below the minimum what 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.800
 more advisable is to be a little 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.930
 below the maximum if it is above 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.060
 maximum we would injure retainers bouncing 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.220
 oil through the vents and even it 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.220
 would reheat and burn the oil 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.630
 it is important to look at every 15 or 20 days 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:06.870
 oil level keep in mind to change 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.910
 the ip every 1,500 or 2,000 km 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.890
 whenever we change the oil we should 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.300
 to see that the amount that comes out is very 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.700
 similar to the amount we have 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.980
 entered earlier because otherwise 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.330
 we have to go to the technician so 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.520
 make an evaluation about the engine 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.250
 because it can be the cylinder that is 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.840
 scratched the valves among others something that 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.000
 let's finish changing the oil is 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.220
 recommended warm up the engine because if 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.710
 the engine is cold and undergoes work 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.990
 as soon as it is turned on it is damaged 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.550
 since their fluids and metals must 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.100
 acquires a standard temperature for 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.560
 work as it should the used oil 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.030
 it must be properly recycled what can you 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.770
 take to a workshop with a point of 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.270
 collection this is one of the 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.930
 main pollutants in the environment 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.930
 ambient
