this glitch by using my brain and

this glitch by using my brain and
realizing<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.130> app<00:00:29.340> does<00:00:29.609> not<00:00:29.670> need

realizing that this app does not need

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.450 
realizing that this app does not need

right<00:01:49.350> back<00:01:49.409> into<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.920> it'll<00:01:50.399> automatically

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
right back into it it'll automatically

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.630 
right back into it it'll automatically
load<00:01:51.240> buff<00:01:51.630> what<00:01:52.020> you've<00:01:52.170> done<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.130> did<00:01:53.490> I

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
load buff what you've done and I did I

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.010 
load buff what you've done and I did I
think<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.909> only<00:01:54.000> did<00:01:54.149> like<00:01:54.180> two<00:01:54.450> minutes<00:01:54.600> there

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
think I only did like two minutes there

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.950 
think I only did like two minutes there
so<00:01:55.829> my<00:01:56.340> kitchen<00:01:56.790> didn't<00:01:57.240> do<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.570> think<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.899> do

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
so my kitchen didn't do so I think I do

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.020 
so my kitchen didn't do so I think I do
a<00:01:58.049> little<00:01:58.290> bit<00:01:58.439> more<00:01:58.560> here<00:01:58.820> I'm<00:01:59.820> using

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
a little bit more here I'm using

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.510 
a little bit more here I'm using
reflector<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.290> trial<00:02:01.590> beta<00:02:01.920> thing<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.340> was

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
reflector to the trial beta thing I was

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.100 
reflector to the trial beta thing I was
could<00:02:02.939> not<00:02:03.119> figure<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.540> out<00:02:03.689> but<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:03.930> turned

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
could not figure it out but it turned

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.160 
could not figure it out but it turned
out<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.229> needed<00:02:04.469> faster<00:02:04.829> Wi-Fi<00:02:05.960> so<00:02:06.960> it's<00:02:07.079> gonna

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
out I needed faster Wi-Fi so it's gonna

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.110 
out I needed faster Wi-Fi so it's gonna
be<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.290> little<00:02:07.380> bit<00:02:07.530> glitchy<00:02:07.710> but

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.120 
be a little bit glitchy but

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.030 
be a little bit glitchy but
it's<00:02:11.120> kind<00:02:11.270> of<00:02:11.300> covering<00:02:11.690> exactly<00:02:12.200> over<00:02:12.530> where

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
it's kind of covering exactly over where

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.940 
it's kind of covering exactly over where
it<00:02:13.130> says<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.490> times<00:02:13.960> so<00:02:14.960> bear<00:02:15.170> with<00:02:15.200> it<00:02:15.560> but<00:02:15.830> as

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
it says the times so bear with it but as

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.470 
it says the times so bear with it but as
you<00:02:16.190> get<00:02:16.460> the<00:02:16.610> concept<00:02:16.940> it's<00:02:17.150> really<00:02:17.300> simple

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
you get the concept it's really simple

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.270 
you get the concept it's really simple
to<00:02:17.630> do<00:02:17.780> now<00:02:18.140> there<00:02:18.320> are<00:02:18.440> some<00:02:18.650> negatives<00:02:19.040> with

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
to do now there are some negatives with

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.940 
to do now there are some negatives with
this<00:02:19.540> let's<00:02:20.540> say<00:02:20.720> you<00:02:20.780> it's<00:02:21.320> one<00:02:21.470> o'clock<00:02:21.650> and

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
this let's say you it's one o'clock and

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.850 
this let's say you it's one o'clock and
you<00:02:22.130> fast<00:02:22.700> forward<00:02:22.970> your<00:02:23.150> time<00:02:23.270> until<00:02:23.510> 2:00

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
you fast forward your time until 2:00

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.140 
you fast forward your time until 2:00
you<00:02:24.860> have<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.070> be<00:02:25.160> careful<00:02:25.580> because<00:02:25.880> now

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
you have to be careful because now

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.630 
you have to be careful because now
you've<00:02:26.330> wasted<00:02:26.570> that<00:02:27.500> whole<00:02:27.770> hour<00:02:28.010> that<00:02:28.520> you

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
you've wasted that whole hour that you

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.750 
you've wasted that whole hour that you
could<00:02:28.850> be<00:02:28.970> getting<00:02:29.090> supplies<00:02:30.020> and<00:02:30.760> sending

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
could be getting supplies and sending

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.180 
could be getting supplies and sending
out<00:02:31.910> scavengers<00:02:32.570> in<00:02:32.600> one<00:02:32.870> line<00:02:33.050> and<00:02:33.710> also

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
out scavengers in one line and also

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.090 
out scavengers in one line and also
let's<00:02:34.880> say<00:02:35.030> you<00:02:35.120> send<00:02:35.330> it<00:02:35.450> out<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.990> two<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.560> you

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
let's say you send it out to two and you

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.620 
let's say you send it out to two and you
want<00:02:37.310> your<00:02:37.370> phone<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:37.640> be<00:02:37.880> back<00:02:38.060> on<00:02:38.240> normal

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
want your phone to be back on normal

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.070 
want your phone to be back on normal
time

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
time

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.850 
time
if<00:02:39.140> you<00:02:40.070> click<00:02:40.940> set<00:02:41.450> automatic<00:02:41.990> now<00:02:42.590> it'll<00:02:42.800> go

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
if you click set automatic now it'll go

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.030 
if you click set automatic now it'll go
back<00:02:43.280> in<00:02:43.490> time<00:02:43.730> it'll<00:02:44.210> honestly<00:02:44.900> not<00:02:45.680> go<00:02:45.860> back

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
back in time it'll honestly not go back

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.810 
back in time it'll honestly not go back
to<00:02:46.310> one<00:02:46.460> o'clock

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
to one o'clock

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.140 
to one o'clock
it'll<00:02:47.150> go<00:02:47.300> back<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:47.840> negative<00:02:48.650> one<00:02:48.800> and<00:02:49.150> now

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
it'll go back to negative one and now

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.540 
it'll go back to negative one and now
you've<00:02:50.390> just<00:02:50.420> wasted

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
you've just wasted

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.450 
you've just wasted
it'll<00:02:52.550> add<00:02:52.670> time<00:02:53.060> on<00:02:53.330> to<00:02:53.510> your<00:02:53.630> rooms<00:02:53.840> so<00:02:54.710> let's

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
it'll add time on to your rooms so let's

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.860 
it'll add time on to your rooms so let's
say<00:02:55.520> you<00:02:55.610> have<00:02:55.730> five<00:02:55.970> minutes<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:56.660> then<00:02:56.840> you

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
say you have five minutes and then you

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.840 
say you have five minutes and then you
go<00:02:57.050> back<00:02:57.200> from<00:02:57.440> two<00:02:57.650> to<00:02:57.770> one<00:02:57.800> then<00:02:58.550> you<00:02:58.610> have<00:02:58.760> an

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
go back from two to one then you have an

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.820 
go back from two to one then you have an
hour<00:02:59.030> and<00:02:59.240> five<00:02:59.450> minutes<00:02:59.510> to<00:03:00.230> wait<00:03:00.530> for<00:03:00.710> these

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
hour and five minutes to wait for these

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.500 
hour and five minutes to wait for these
rings<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.100> catch<00:03:01.310> up<00:03:01.520> so<00:03:02.060> do<00:03:02.240> it<00:03:02.390> in

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
rings to catch up so do it in

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.650 
rings to catch up so do it in
progression<00:03:03.050> I<00:03:03.290> haven't<00:03:04.010> found<00:03:04.190> a<00:03:04.280> way<00:03:04.430> to

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
progression I haven't found a way to

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.630 
progression I haven't found a way to
reset<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.780> clock<00:03:05.930> so<00:03:06.320> that<00:03:06.350> it's<00:03:06.650> it<00:03:07.010> stays<00:03:07.430> to

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
reset the clock so that it's it stays to

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.750 
reset the clock so that it's it stays to
the<00:03:07.730> time<00:03:07.940> when<00:03:08.540> you<00:03:08.690> go<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:09.760> set

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
the time when you go to set

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.880 
the time when you go to set
automatically<00:03:11.210> on<00:03:11.420> your<00:03:11.570> phone<00:03:11.870> but<00:03:12.680> what<00:03:12.860> I

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
automatically on your phone but what I

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.730 
automatically on your phone but what I
have<00:03:13.160> found<00:03:13.400> out<00:03:13.610> is<00:03:14.180> if<00:03:14.420> you<00:03:14.600> do<00:03:14.840> say<00:03:15.290> set

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
have found out is if you do say set

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.400 
have found out is if you do say set
automatically<00:03:16.459> and<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:17.780> phone<00:03:17.959> is<00:03:18.170> let's<00:03:18.320> say

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
automatically and the phone is let's say

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.620 
automatically and the phone is let's say
five<00:03:18.680> minutes<00:03:18.980> in<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.400> future<00:03:19.580> you<00:03:20.209> can<00:03:20.390> wait

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
five minutes in the future you can wait

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.210 
five minutes in the future you can wait
five<00:03:20.959> minutes<00:03:21.110> and<00:03:21.440> it'll<00:03:21.590> catch<00:03:21.860> up<00:03:21.890> by

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
five minutes and it'll catch up by

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.720 
five minutes and it'll catch up by
itself

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
itself

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.580 
itself
it<00:03:23.090> won't<00:03:23.390> actually<00:03:23.510> go<00:03:23.900> back<00:03:24.110> in<00:03:24.260> time<00:03:24.410> and

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
it won't actually go back in time and

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.860 
it won't actually go back in time and
stay<00:03:24.890> back<00:03:25.250> in<00:03:25.430> time<00:03:25.580> for<00:03:25.760> five<00:03:25.970> minutes<00:03:26.300> so

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
stay back in time for five minutes so

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.240 
stay back in time for five minutes so
that's<00:03:27.050> probably<00:03:27.260> going<00:03:27.560> to<00:03:27.620> be<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:27.830> best<00:03:28.010> way

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
that's probably going to be the best way

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.780 
that's probably going to be the best way
to<00:03:28.280> do<00:03:28.520> it<00:03:28.750> so<00:03:29.750> I<00:03:30.260> talked<00:03:31.250> about<00:03:31.280> this<00:03:31.550> later<00:03:31.730> in

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
to do it so I talked about this later in

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.270

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.570 
freezes right here because I'm lost in
that<00:03:35.630> connection<00:03:36.400> okay

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
happens when I switch it from future

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:53.030 
happens when I switch it from future
time<00:03:42.440> and<00:03:42.800> back<00:03:43.610> to<00:03:44.320> set<00:03:45.320> automatic<00:03:45.890> time<00:03:46.190> zone

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.370 

okay<00:03:54.040> so<00:03:54.100> just<00:03:54.490> switched<00:03:54.700> it<00:03:54.850> over<00:03:54.970> to<00:03:55.380> auto

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
okay so just switched it over to auto

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.100 
okay so just switched it over to auto
timezone<00:03:57.100> and<00:03:57.430> now<00:03:57.640> it<00:03:58.180> says<00:03:58.480> okay<00:03:58.810> now<00:03:58.840> I'm

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
timezone and now it says okay now I'm

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.590 
timezone and now it says okay now I'm
going<00:03:59.290> back<00:03:59.319> in<00:03:59.650> time<00:03:59.830> a<00:04:00.250> couple<00:04:00.700> hours<00:04:01.030> the

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
going back in time a couple hours the

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.300 
going back in time a couple hours the
game<00:04:01.780> is<00:04:01.990> running<00:04:02.110> on<00:04:02.410> that<00:04:02.560> clock<00:04:02.890> so

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
game is running on that clock so

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.210 
game is running on that clock so
consistently<00:04:04.030> that<00:04:04.780> it's<00:04:05.650> really<00:04:05.950> hard<00:04:06.130> to

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
consistently that it's really hard to

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.580 
consistently that it's really hard to
see<00:04:06.400> but<00:04:06.580> it'll<00:04:06.790> say<00:04:06.940> two<00:04:07.000> hours<00:04:07.500> something<00:04:08.500> or

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
see but it'll say two hours something or

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.150 
see but it'll say two hours something or
other<00:04:08.680> and<00:04:10.170> you<00:04:11.170> guys<00:04:11.380> got<00:04:11.590> to<00:04:11.650> be<00:04:11.709> careful<00:04:12.010> the

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
other and you guys got to be careful the

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.800 
other and you guys got to be careful the
only<00:04:12.489> way<00:04:12.640> I've<00:04:12.760> been<00:04:12.790> able<00:04:12.970> to<00:04:13.150> bypass<00:04:13.330> this

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
only way I've been able to bypass this

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.560 
only way I've been able to bypass this
is<00:04:14.020> to<00:04:14.260> go<00:04:14.350> into<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:15.190> future<00:04:15.340> and<00:04:15.550> then<00:04:15.940> set

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
is to go into the future and then set

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.479 
is to go into the future and then set
the<00:04:16.660> timezone<00:04:17.049> as<00:04:17.260> I<00:04:17.680> say<00:04:17.859> you<00:04:17.919> do<00:04:18.100> it<00:04:18.220> for<00:04:18.430> an

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
the timezone as I say you do it for an

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:25.650 
the timezone as I say you do it for an
hour<00:04:18.639> okay<00:04:21.180> you<00:04:22.980> you<00:04:23.980> run<00:04:24.160> the<00:04:24.310> game<00:04:24.460> into<00:04:25.390> its

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
hour okay you you run the game into its

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.650 
hour okay you you run the game into its
one<00:04:25.810> o'clock<00:04:25.990> you<00:04:26.230> run<00:04:26.410> it<00:04:26.530> till<00:04:26.650> 2:00<00:04:26.890> okay<00:04:27.660> so

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
one o'clock you run it till 2:00 okay so

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.630 
one o'clock you run it till 2:00 okay so
you're<00:04:28.870> an<00:04:29.020> hour<00:04:29.260> in<00:04:29.530> advance<00:04:30.250> if<00:04:30.580> you<00:04:32.400> set<00:04:33.400> the

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
you're an hour in advance if you set the

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.840 
you're an hour in advance if you set the
time<00:04:33.880> to<00:04:34.090> go<00:04:34.210> back<00:04:34.450> to<00:04:34.690> the<00:04:34.810> auto<00:04:34.990> time<00:04:35.350> zone

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
time to go back to the auto time zone

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.870 
time to go back to the auto time zone
then<00:04:36.850> it'll<00:04:37.680> hold<00:04:38.680> off<00:04:38.980> at<00:04:39.220> 2:00<00:04:39.370> o'clock<00:04:39.400> it

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
then it'll hold off at 2:00 o'clock it

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.390 
then it'll hold off at 2:00 o'clock it
won't<00:04:40.120> keep<00:04:40.360> counting<00:04:40.900> so<00:04:41.530> if<00:04:41.800> you<00:04:41.979> go<00:04:42.190> from

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
won't keep counting so if you go from

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.880 
won't keep counting so if you go from
one<00:04:42.760> in<00:04:43.060> real<00:04:43.450> life<00:04:43.660> in<00:04:43.810> real<00:04:43.840> time<00:04:44.229> back<00:04:44.560> up<00:04:44.770> to

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
one in real life in real time back up to

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.820 
one in real life in real time back up to
two<00:04:45.100> now<00:04:45.610> you've<00:04:45.760> caught<00:04:46.000> yourself<00:04:46.330> back<00:04:46.600> up

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
two now you've caught yourself back up

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.590 
two now you've caught yourself back up
so<00:04:47.830> this<00:04:48.220> is<00:04:48.370> a<00:04:48.400> way<00:04:48.580> to<00:04:48.639> do<00:04:48.940> it<00:04:49.060> maybe<00:04:49.300> for

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
so this is a way to do it maybe for

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.210 
so this is a way to do it maybe for
sleep<00:04:49.840> think<00:04:50.260> about<00:04:50.470> it<00:04:50.560> for<00:04:50.680> sleep<00:04:50.889> though

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
sleep think about it for sleep though

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.070 
sleep think about it for sleep though
eight<00:04:51.490> hours<00:04:51.850> in<00:04:52.000> the<00:04:52.060> future<00:04:52.419> or<00:04:52.630> however

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
eight hours in the future or however

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.560 
eight hours in the future or however
long<00:04:53.260> you're<00:04:53.560> going<00:04:53.650> to<00:04:53.740> sleep<00:04:53.979> then<00:04:54.760> set<00:04:55.479> your

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
long you're going to sleep then set your

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.860 
long you're going to sleep then set your
time<00:04:55.750> to<00:04:55.930> automatic<00:04:56.410> time<00:04:56.620> zone<00:04:56.850> now<00:04:57.850> when<00:04:58.720> you

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
time to automatic time zone now when you

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.800 
time to automatic time zone now when you
wake<00:04:59.290> up<00:04:59.530> it<00:04:59.800> should<00:05:00.100> be<00:05:00.600> neck<00:05:01.600> and<00:05:01.630> neck

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
wake up it should be neck and neck

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.080 
wake up it should be neck and neck
really<00:05:02.320> closely<00:05:03.310> to<00:05:03.520> what<00:05:03.669> your<00:05:03.790> automatic

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
really closely to what your automatic

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.200 
really closely to what your automatic
time<00:05:04.450> zone<00:05:04.479> is<00:05:04.870> so<00:05:05.380> you<00:05:05.440> can<00:05:05.680> be<00:05:06.010> an<00:05:06.370> extra

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
time zone is so you can be an extra

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.060 
time zone is so you can be an extra
eight<00:05:07.419> hours<00:05:07.810> and<00:05:07.960> the<00:05:08.020> day<00:05:08.169> or<00:05:08.350> technically

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
eight hours and the day or technically

there's<00:05:18.070> no<00:05:18.250> way<00:05:18.400> they<00:05:18.520> can<00:05:18.580> really<00:05:18.789> patch

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
there's no way they can really patch

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.820 
there's no way they can really patch
this<00:05:19.270> glitch<00:05:19.539> because<00:05:19.900> that's<00:05:20.350> just<00:05:20.530> the<00:05:20.680> way

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
this glitch because that's just the way

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.279 
this glitch because that's just the way
the<00:05:21.100> game<00:05:21.130> runs<00:05:21.700> and<00:05:22.090> unless<00:05:22.720> they<00:05:23.020> start

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
the game runs and unless they start

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.950 
the game runs and unless they start
