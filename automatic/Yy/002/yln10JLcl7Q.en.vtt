00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:11.249
 Hello to all known screen 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:14.429
 detail of the inhabitants of the tank is often very 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:16.460
 car owners are afraid of what they see in 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.210
 expansion tank 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:26.249
 foam and now we look at why this 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.949
 foam forms a small overview 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:30.829
 coolant 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:37.260
 this is antifreeze concentrated 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:40.410
 yellow german phosphorus is lukoil i 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.500
 for some reason it has become a rarity in our city rarely 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:48.750
 you will see the sale is well known 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:54.690
 Felix regulars of our stores antifreeze 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:01:00.540
 Gostovsky also centek is included in our 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:05.420
 the market here is novelty antifreeze films and 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:13.500
 Gray is a very beautiful product like not 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:14.490
 here are 7 famous dj antifreeze so here 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.760
 for production 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.340
 any coolant will antifreeze 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.440
 be it antifreeze applies the greatest 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.640
 additive package 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.990
 this additive is somehow an additive package it 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.729
 hiding the manufacturer completely then 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.590
 have their low act leaves indicated 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.560
 approximate amount of additives these 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:39.420
 names you we define those too 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:42.810
 additives that we know by noticed 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.130
 what happens is a different color cooling 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:52.520
 fluid and blue-green red happens 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:55.670
 yellow green happens here too 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.250
 so this is one of the first additives 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.979
 to determine which digit is worth you 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:06.229
 2 additives are very important 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:07.189
 valid additive to not to 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.069
 rhodium metal 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:14.690
 this is copper for example a cooling radiator 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:17.900
 it is heating + cast iron blocks and 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.940
 aluminum and each manufacturer 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:25.329
 engines let's say everyone needs 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:29.030
 please therefore the amount of additives in 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:31.459
 antifreeze and antifreeze is very large for 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.890
 identified to be two important additives 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.170
 it is a color additive that determines 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.019
 color and ati are valid and most important 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:43.120
 additive is anti foam additive here 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:46.670
 it is she who shows in the barrel what 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.130
 the presence of foam that this additive ceases 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.090
 work as you know what we have for 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.760
 for the cooling system to work 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.910
 here's the famous water pump detail so 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.900
 here it is fiber it can not foam 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.480
 pump it bills only liquid 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.920
 there are very different compositions for poor 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.989
 fiber adoption pumps 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.019
 that is, they are prophetic in cars 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.700
 practically not used 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:19.639
 here it is an additive there is an anti foam here 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:21.650
 she is very few lives why not enough 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:23.329
 because the engine is constantly either 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:28.720
 cold or hot spikes 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:31.160
 temperatures so every manufacturer 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.130
 car in technical cod writes 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:38.389
 that here after 50,000 kilometer for example 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.489
 or visiting 2-3 years putting off liquid 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:44.870
 need to change because it is sharp 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:46.190
 changes its properties the worst here 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:51.470
 I thought answered our question why 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:54.349
 foam appears in these barrels now 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.180
 let's see clearly how antipin works 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:04:04.359
 here look 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:09.469
 shake well, for example, these foam appeared 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:11.359
 can not quite see but it can be seen 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:16.070
 there is less foam in the cooling 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:19.699
 fluids the better product here is highgear 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:24.370
 seemingly good product but also on 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:24.370
 Kremlin there are so many he can see 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:39.500
 foam have it bad for cooling 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:41.539
 inexpensive liquid that was almost no waiting 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.150
 that is, the anti foam additive works 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:47.900
 good in Russia practically not 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:52.070
 produced additives for cooling 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:55.520
 liquids are mostly foreign 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.430
 representatives are represented in the market well 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.669
 Well, I think I answered your question. 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:04.510
 Why does foam appear in barrels 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.510
 all until we meet again
