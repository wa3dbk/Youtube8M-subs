00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 all right 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.420
 yes 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.840
 do not 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.310
 two 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.200
 that is 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.240
 yes 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.049
 if it calmed down a boy 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.690
 disconsolate while his older brother 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.320
 was preparing for the battle 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.050
 why are you crying son are you both 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.080
 from a family 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.520
 and a family is a fact that can never be 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.210
 break the war 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:48.020
 neither the fights nor the force 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.479
 and most importantly you are brothers 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.720
 brothers will be brothers despite 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:56.320
 time the discussions and even the 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.320
 distance 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.610
 it is not by chance that he will perform his 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:06.570
 training in this cell 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.910
 the legend says that a long time ago 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.569
 some evil military leaders will govern 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.170
 this land 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.270
 and that's it 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.180
 the jump is a movement without work 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:23.200
 but jumping further requires a 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.200
 extra effort 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.680
 you can get higher by far without 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.170
 again in the air 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.920
 the coins allow you to buy many 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.349
 interesting things but first of all 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:51.359
 you must complete first function and then 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.359
 Play again your mind 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.480
 this is not like new york ago 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:06.220
 I found your temple in years 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.780
 exploring that same jungle 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.270
 in the young man and some cameras 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.770
 with what a group that has got 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.770
 great mystic powers 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.570
 Care for the environment and how you learn 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.730
 to approach the projections of a 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.520
 surface to grab and climb 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.340
 or hide 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.770
 sometimes the best thing you can do to 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.480
 launch from one salient to another 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.360
 move towards the other outgoing 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.590
 making a jump at the same time and 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.590
 grabbing you to him 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.510
 yes 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:50.200
 you must find the time 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:52.680
 leave the sacred chamber and recover the 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.680
 medallion 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.959
 I'm going to have to upload more if I want 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:07.260
 find the temple sit between two 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:10.050
 completed walls jump on a wall and 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.640
 jump again towards the 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:17.670
 repeating this action over and over again 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.670
 you will arrive at the top without needing anything else 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.550
 ah 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:39.580
 when you jump against a wall you can 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:41.949
 run up to get height 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.270
 extra and propelled away from is for 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:45.270
 reach new ways 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:51.720
 now do not use your movements of 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.720
 combat better control 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.440
 calculate your attacks well to keep 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.240
 your enemy in the concertina with more 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.560
 time to concentrate on others 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.600
 possible crimes 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.940
 while you're in the air makes a 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.870
 paula movement and the ground beneath your 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.870
 feet will shatter 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.800
 i 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.800
 and now 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.600
 the cunning does not always find 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.780
 they had descended to rise from one side 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.780
 to another 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.500
 Y 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.300
 i 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.260
 ah 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.710
 all right 

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:19.080
 as is 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:22.580
 and there it is 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:24.780
 go splinter I was not kidding so amazing 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.669
 splinter taught us every time 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.979
 we defeated one of the bad ones recharges 

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:30.870
 our inner strength 

00:07:28.979 --> 00:07:33.020
 we can use that power with an effect 

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:33.020
 devastating 

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:37.610
 and it will consume everything 

00:07:46.449 --> 00:07:52.710
 is the bomb go I do not think I'll go back to 

00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:52.710
 see something so beautiful
