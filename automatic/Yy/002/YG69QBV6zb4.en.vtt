00:00:04.499 --> 00:00:04.509 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:08.640 

okay<00:00:05.470> I<00:00:05.649> shot<00:00:06.069> up<00:00:06.189> for<00:00:06.339> teens<00:00:06.929> this<00:00:07.929> actually

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:08.650 
okay I shot up for teens this actually

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.580 
okay I shot up for teens this actually
would<00:00:09.070> have<00:00:09.129> booked<00:00:09.400> on<00:00:09.580> so<00:00:10.000> I<00:00:10.510> have<00:00:11.170> a<00:00:11.200> lot<00:00:11.469> to

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:11.590 
would have booked on so I have a lot to

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.279 
would have booked on so I have a lot to
say<00:00:11.769> about<00:00:11.799> this<00:00:12.190> I<00:00:12.400> think<00:00:13.209> that<00:00:13.330> you<00:00:13.809> know<00:00:13.959> as

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:14.289 
say about this I think that you know as

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:18.900 
say about this I think that you know as
far<00:00:14.770> as<00:00:14.980> when<00:00:15.369> a<00:00:15.549> girl<00:00:16.769> begins<00:00:17.769> to<00:00:18.220> menstruate

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910

far as when a girl begins to menstruate
for<00:00:19.300> example<00:00:19.720> I<00:00:19.900> think<00:00:20.140> that's<00:00:20.289> kind<00:00:20.500> of<00:00:20.560> the

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.680 
for example I think that's kind of the

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.170 
for example I think that's kind of the
rite<00:00:20.830> of<00:00:20.950> passage<00:00:21.100> is<00:00:21.490> when<00:00:21.670> you<00:00:21.789> should<00:00:21.850> allow

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
homework the teachers not going to

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:54.719 
homework the teachers not going to
believe<00:00:53.559> them<00:00:53.769> so<00:00:53.949> you<00:00:54.010> kind<00:00:54.249> of<00:00:54.309> got<00:00:54.429> to<00:00:54.549> teach

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:54.729 
believe them so you kind of got to teach

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:57.299 
believe them so you kind of got to teach
them<00:00:54.969> where<00:00:55.749> it's<00:00:56.019> appropriate<00:00:56.139> and<00:00:56.679> you<00:00:57.190> know

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
them where it's appropriate and you know

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.869 
them where it's appropriate and you know
what<00:00:57.579> to<00:00:57.760> wear<00:00:57.999> and<00:00:58.269> win<00:00:58.539> so<00:00:59.079> I<00:00:59.350> think<00:01:00.010> that<00:01:00.429> for

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
what to wear and win so I think that for

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.059 
what to wear and win so I think that for
a<00:01:00.940> daily<00:01:01.510> every<00:01:01.780> day<00:01:02.139> you<00:01:02.499> want<00:01:02.679> to<00:01:02.739> keep<00:01:02.920> them

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:03.069 
a daily every day you want to keep them

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:07.140 
a daily every day you want to keep them
with<00:01:03.249> neutral<00:01:04.180> colors<00:01:05.430> again<00:01:06.430> think<00:01:06.940> along

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
with neutral colors again think along

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.510 
with neutral colors again think along
your<00:01:07.360> earth<00:01:07.659> tones<00:01:08.080> and<00:01:08.680> you<00:01:09.100> know<00:01:09.220> maybe

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
your earth tones and you know maybe

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.700 
your earth tones and you know maybe
golds<00:01:10.210> as<00:01:10.390> opposed<00:01:10.900> to<00:01:11.140> she<00:01:11.290> wants<00:01:11.530> to<00:01:11.620> wear

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
golds as opposed to she wants to wear

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.190 
golds as opposed to she wants to wear
bright<00:01:11.860> yellow<00:01:12.310> if<00:01:13.000> you<00:01:13.540> can<00:01:13.720> bring<00:01:13.990> her<00:01:14.110> into

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
bright yellow if you can bring her into

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.970 
bright yellow if you can bring her into
a<00:01:14.320> cop<00:01:14.620> or<00:01:14.860> as<00:01:14.950> opposed<00:01:15.280> to<00:01:15.460> a<00:01:15.520> strong<00:01:15.820> black<00:01:16.150> or

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:16.980 
a cop or as opposed to a strong black or

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.260 
a cop or as opposed to a strong black or
you<00:01:17.980> know<00:01:18.070> lavenders<00:01:18.790> look<00:01:19.030> really

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
you know lavenders look really

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.330 
you know lavenders look really
beautifully<00:01:19.630> if<00:01:19.990> you<00:01:20.650> can<00:01:20.860> get<00:01:21.070> something

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
beautifully if you can get something

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.640 
beautifully if you can get something
that<00:01:21.610> blends<00:01:22.120> out<00:01:22.390> to<00:01:22.750> be<00:01:22.870> more<00:01:23.080> of<00:01:23.140> a<00:01:23.290> wash

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
that blends out to be more of a wash

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.880 
that blends out to be more of a wash
than<00:01:24.460> an<00:01:24.760> absolute<00:01:25.450> you<00:01:25.810> know<00:01:25.930> strong<00:01:26.470> pigment

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
than an absolute you know strong pigment

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.340 
than an absolute you know strong pigment
it's<00:01:27.430> a<00:01:27.940> great<00:01:28.270> way<00:01:28.510> to<00:01:28.570> make<00:01:28.900> that<00:01:29.050> transition

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
it's a great way to make that transition

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.790 
it's a great way to make that transition
and<00:01:29.980> I<00:01:30.430> think<00:01:31.360> that<00:01:31.540> with<00:01:31.720> teens<00:01:32.080> it's<00:01:32.500> it's

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
and I think that with teens it's it's

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.780 
and I think that with teens it's it's
really<00:01:33.070> important<00:01:33.700> to<00:01:34.890> not<00:01:35.890> tell<00:01:36.550> them<00:01:36.640> that

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
really important to not tell them that

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:37.860 
really important to not tell them that
they<00:01:36.880> shouldn't<00:01:37.120> or<00:01:37.300> make<00:01:37.450> it<00:01:37.570> because<00:01:37.780> you

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870 
they shouldn't or make it because you

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.000 
they shouldn't or make it because you
know<00:01:38.020> at<00:01:38.170> school<00:01:38.350> they're<00:01:38.740> going<00:01:38.860> to<00:01:38.920> be

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
know at school they're going to be

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.590 
know at school they're going to be
borrowing<00:01:39.490> you<00:01:39.850> know<00:01:39.970> make<00:01:40.210> it<00:01:40.330> from<00:01:40.480> their

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
borrowing you know make it from their

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.990 
borrowing you know make it from their
girls<00:01:40.870> and<00:01:41.110> putting<00:01:41.350> it<00:01:41.440> on<00:01:41.560> and<00:01:41.830> that's<00:01:42.430> again

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
girls and putting it on and that's again

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.780 
girls and putting it on and that's again
you<00:01:43.360> know<00:01:43.510> for<00:01:43.990> hygiene<00:01:44.440> it's<00:01:44.740> not<00:01:44.950> really<00:01:45.460> a

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
you know for hygiene it's not really a

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.210 
you know for hygiene it's not really a
good<00:01:46.210> idea<00:01:46.270> because<00:01:46.840> it<00:01:47.290> conjunctivitis<00:01:47.890> is

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
good idea because it conjunctivitis is

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.730 
good idea because it conjunctivitis is
extremely<00:01:48.730> contagious<00:01:49.030> so<00:01:49.510> we<00:01:50.200> want<00:01:50.409> to<00:01:50.440> avoid
