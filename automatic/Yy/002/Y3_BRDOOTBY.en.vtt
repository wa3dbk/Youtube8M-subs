00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.800
&gt;&gt; Space flight results in many negative health
effects, and causes may include microgravity,

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.949
radiation, or isolation and stress. And at
the Johnson Space Center, we have laboratories

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.730
dedicated to investigating each of these phenomenon.
I work in the immunology laboratory, which

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.750
studies the human immune system and how it
may change during space flight. The immune

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.970
system is a variety of different cell types
throughout the body. They fight infection

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.320
and are also important for maintaining proper
physiology. The immune system can be negatively

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.489
affected by many of the factors associated
with flight. Microgravity itself may directly

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.059
inhabit immune cell function. Stress has a
profound effect on the immune system which

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.469
is why we're more susceptible to illness when
we're stressed out, and proper nutrition is

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.089
important for maintaining a healthy immune
system. We're very interested in how the immune

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.979
system changes during space flight, and determining
if it increases crew health risks during exploration

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.470
class missions. NASA's just completed a successful
immune study onboard ISS, which collected

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.500
blood and saliva samples from astronauts,
and returned them to the ground for terrestrial

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.700
analysis. The results indicate that in astronauts
there are interesting alterations in the immune

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.299
system that persist for the duration of an
ISS mission. This includes diminished capacity

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.020
of these cells to respond, interruptions,
and sleep cycles, increases in stress hormone

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.340
levels, and all of this results in the persistent
reactivation of viruses. So this is not widespread

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.030
illness among the crew, but interesting research
findings that raise our concern for these

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.860
deep space exploration class missions. For
the future, we're designing the next generation

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.200
of immune studies, which will complete the
characterization of the immune system during

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.719
space flight, and allow us to proceed to the
evaluation of counter measures, if they're

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:55.439
necessary. Counter measures may include nutritional
supplementation, or pharmacological intervention,

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.219
or even things like radiation shielding, or
exercise will have benefits on the immune

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:04.369
system. Studies of how space flight affects
the immune system may provide benefits to

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.950
earth-based medicine. This includes information
on how stress causes immune system changes

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.310
in healthy adults, changes
that may precede disease.
