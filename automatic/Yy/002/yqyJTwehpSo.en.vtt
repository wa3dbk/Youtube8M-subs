also this weird rate Raven move that
it's<00:01:51.020> kind<00:01:51.170> of<00:01:51.229> weak<00:01:51.409> I<00:01:51.560> don't<00:01:51.679> know<00:01:51.740> why

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
it's kind of weak I don't know why

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:53.230 
it's kind of weak I don't know why
anyone<00:01:52.039> leveled<00:01:52.340> up<00:01:52.399> and<00:01:52.609> has<00:01:52.729> a<00:01:52.759> cool<00:01:53.060> down

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
anyone leveled up and has a cool down

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.840 
anyone leveled up and has a cool down
which<00:01:53.539> is<00:01:53.570> weird<00:01:54.109> I<00:01:54.289> and<00:01:55.249> II<00:01:55.399> probably<00:01:55.579> need<00:01:55.789> to

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
really figured out that workers are a

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.550 
really figured out that workers are a
little<00:05:02.070> bit<00:05:02.250> underpowered<00:05:03.120> and<00:05:03.600> they<00:05:04.380> need<00:05:04.530> to

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
little bit underpowered and they need to

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.200 
little bit underpowered and they need to
be<00:05:04.680> buffed<00:05:05.010> up<00:05:05.190> a<00:05:05.340> little<00:05:05.550> bit<00:05:05.670> i<00:05:05.700> think<00:05:06.030> they

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
be buffed up a little bit i think they

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.470 
be buffed up a little bit i think they
should<00:05:06.450> put<00:05:07.200> rush<00:05:07.650> as<00:05:07.980> a<00:05:08.370> third<00:05:08.700> job<00:05:08.970> skill<00:05:09.360> if

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
should put rush as a third job skill if

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.270 
should put rush as a third job skill if
they<00:05:09.600> put<00:05:09.780> russia's<00:05:10.290> third<00:05:10.590> job<00:05:10.860> skill<00:05:11.100> i

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
they put russia's third job skill i

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.120 
they put russia's third job skill i

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
think they'd actually stand up stand a

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.010 
think they'd actually stand up stand a
chance<00:05:14.160> and<00:05:14.760> there<00:05:15.120> or<00:05:15.300> maybe<00:05:15.420> even<00:05:15.540> i<00:05:15.930> don't

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
chance and there or maybe even i don't

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.990 
chance and there or maybe even i don't
want<00:05:16.260> to<00:05:16.320> say<00:05:16.440> second<00:05:16.890> because<00:05:17.010> this<00:05:17.160> if<00:05:17.790> they

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
want to say second because this if they

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.160 
want to say second because this if they

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 
a lot but i think if the elite if they

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.120 
a lot but i think if the elite if they
keep<00:05:24.630> you<00:05:24.750> the<00:05:24.810> same<00:05:25.020> put<00:05:25.290> their<00:05:25.620> job<00:05:25.890> it'd<00:05:26.010> be

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
keep you the same put their job it'd be

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.060 
keep you the same put their job it'd be
pretty<00:05:26.280> sick<00:05:26.640> just<00:05:27.630> cuz<00:05:27.780> did<00:05:28.290> they<00:05:28.590> have<00:05:28.740> such

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
pretty sick just cuz did they have such

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.580

a<00:05:29.100> freaking<00:05:29.610> terrible<00:05:30.180> time<00:05:30.420> training<00:05:30.810> like

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
a freaking terrible time training like

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.060 
a freaking terrible time training like
trading<00:05:32.280> a<00:05:32.490> word<00:05:32.700> from<00:05:32.910> level<00:05:33.500> 100<00:05:34.500> to<00:05:34.620> 120

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
trading a word from level 100 to 120

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.460 
trading a word from level 100 to 120
he's<00:05:35.190> just<00:05:35.340> so<00:05:35.910> freaking<00:05:36.510> mind<00:05:37.020> numbingly

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
he's just so freaking mind numbingly

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.220

boring it's terrible it's just terrible
so<00:05:40.830> I<00:05:40.860> think<00:05:41.130> if<00:05:41.340> they<00:05:41.430> put<00:05:41.640> a<00:05:41.790> rush<00:05:42.330> as<00:05:42.600> an<00:05:42.750> a

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
so I think if they put a rush as an a

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.590 
so I think if they put a rush as an a
third<00:05:43.650> job<00:05:43.860> skill<00:05:44.130> I<00:05:44.220> think<00:05:44.400> could<00:05:44.520> it<00:05:45.210> help<00:05:45.420> it
