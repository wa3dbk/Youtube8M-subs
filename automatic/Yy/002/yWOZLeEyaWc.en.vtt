00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
natural calfskin leather and the quality

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.480 
natural calfskin leather and the quality
of<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.080> leather<00:02:19.260> actually<00:02:19.560> feels<00:02:20.190> pretty

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
of the leather actually feels pretty

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.490 
of the leather actually feels pretty
good<00:02:20.730> it's<00:02:21.510> definitely<00:02:21.870> on<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.170> thicker<00:02:22.380> side

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
good it's definitely on the thicker side

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.860 
good it's definitely on the thicker side
and<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.040> feels<00:02:23.310> very<00:02:23.460> very<00:02:23.910> solid<00:02:24.240> and<00:02:24.510> rugged

and it feels very very solid and rugged

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.840 
and it feels very very solid and rugged
I'm<00:02:25.110> sure<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.530> will<00:02:25.680> soften<00:02:25.950> up<00:02:26.280> after<00:02:26.670> some

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
I'm sure it will soften up after some

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:27.620 
I'm sure it will soften up after some
break-in<00:02:27.210> time

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
break-in time

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.660 
break-in time
but<00:02:27.900> in<00:02:28.020> terms<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.320> overall<00:02:28.410> quality<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.340> seems

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
but in terms of overall quality it seems

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.460 
but in terms of overall quality it seems
to<00:02:29.820> be<00:02:29.910> a<00:02:29.940> pretty<00:02:30.240> nice<00:02:30.420> leather<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:31.020> you<00:02:31.320> get

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
to be a pretty nice leather and you get

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.410 
to be a pretty nice leather and you get
a<00:02:31.500> lot<00:02:31.710> of<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.130> entire<00:02:32.250> mid<00:02:32.790> foot<00:02:33.030> on<00:02:33.240> both

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
a lot of it the entire mid foot on both

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.970 
a lot of it the entire mid foot on both
the<00:02:33.570> inside<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:33.960> outside<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.590> boot<00:02:34.770> are

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
the inside and outside of the boot are

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.580 
the inside and outside of the boot are
made<00:02:35.550> 100%<00:02:35.760> from<00:02:36.420> leather<00:02:36.630> whereas<00:02:37.410> the

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
made 100% from leather whereas the

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.680 
made 100% from leather whereas the
tongue<00:02:37.800> is<00:02:38.040> made<00:02:38.370> from<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.910> padded<00:02:39.450> mesh

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
tongue is made from a padded mesh

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.750 
tongue is made from a padded mesh
material<00:02:39.900> so<00:02:40.860> again<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.220> quality<00:02:41.370> leather

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
material so again the quality leather

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.550 
material so again the quality leather
seems<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.150> be<00:02:42.270> okay<00:02:42.570> definitely<00:02:43.080> a<00:02:43.350> very

seems to be okay definitely a very
interesting<00:02:44.100> stitching<00:02:44.880> pattern<00:02:45.060> on<00:02:45.450> the

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
interesting stitching pattern on the

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.570 
interesting stitching pattern on the
leather<00:02:45.900> upper<00:02:46.140> itself<00:02:46.680> so<00:02:47.160> I'm<00:02:47.340> kind<00:02:47.520> of

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
leather upper itself so I'm kind of

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.250 
leather upper itself so I'm kind of
curious<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:48.000> see<00:02:48.090> how<00:02:48.360> these<00:02:48.570> are<00:02:48.780> actually

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
curious to see how these are actually

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.050 
curious to see how these are actually
going<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.500> perform<00:02:49.860> you<00:02:50.310> have<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.490> nice<00:02:50.670> extra

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
going to perform you have a nice extra

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.760 
going to perform you have a nice extra
strip<00:02:51.390> of<00:02:51.540> leather<00:02:51.690> wrapping<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.380> toe<00:02:52.560> and

strip of leather wrapping the toe and
forefoot<00:02:53.160> area<00:02:53.240> again<00:02:54.240> to<00:02:54.420> enhance<00:02:54.570> the

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
forefoot area again to enhance the

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.660 
forefoot area again to enhance the
overall<00:02:55.050> durability<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:56.220> you're<00:02:56.340> even<00:02:56.550> going

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
overall durability and you're even going

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.280 
overall durability and you're even going
to<00:02:56.730> find<00:02:56.910> some<00:02:57.120> nylon<00:02:57.510> stitching<00:02:57.960> here<00:02:58.080> right

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
to find some nylon stitching here right

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.930 
to find some nylon stitching here right
at<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.500> front<00:02:58.770> so<00:02:59.160> as<00:02:59.250> far<00:02:59.400> as<00:02:59.460> quality<00:02:59.700> goes

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
at the front so as far as quality goes

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.660 
at the front so as far as quality goes

how they feel on feet now as far as the

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230 
on feet so you can get a better idea as

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.930 
on feet so you can get a better idea as
to<00:05:23.260> how<00:05:23.560> these<00:05:23.740> shoes<00:05:24.010> fit<00:05:24.310> and<00:05:24.490> what<00:05:24.760> the

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
to how these shoes fit and what the

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.540 
to how these shoes fit and what the
sizing<00:05:25.420> is<00:05:25.540> like<00:05:25.750> all<00:05:26.650> right<00:05:26.920> here's<00:05:27.280> a<00:05:27.340> look

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
sizing is like all right here's a look

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.300 
sizing is like all right here's a look
at<00:05:27.760> the<00:05:28.030> wave<00:05:28.240> classic<00:05:28.930> twos<00:05:29.170> on<00:05:29.560> feet<00:05:29.950> and

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
at the wave classic twos on feet and

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.800 
at the wave classic twos on feet and
they<00:05:30.430> actually<00:05:30.820> feel<00:05:31.000> pretty<00:05:31.330> good<00:05:31.540> from

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
they actually feel pretty good from

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:32.880 
they actually feel pretty good from
right<00:05:31.990> out<00:05:32.200> of<00:05:32.230> the<00:05:32.410> box

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:32.890 
right out of the box

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.190 
right out of the box
obviously<00:05:33.550> the<00:05:33.700> leather<00:05:33.910> is<00:05:34.180> decently<00:05:34.810> soft

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
obviously the leather is decently soft

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.080 
obviously the leather is decently soft
and<00:05:35.500> it<00:05:35.620> will<00:05:35.800> require<00:05:36.100> some<00:05:36.190> break-in<00:05:36.880> time

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
and it will require some break-in time

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.390 
and it will require some break-in time
to<00:05:37.300> soften<00:05:37.540> up<00:05:37.810> even<00:05:38.140> further<00:05:38.320> but<00:05:39.190> like<00:05:39.310> I

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
to soften up even further but like I

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.620 
to soften up even further but like I
said<00:05:39.460> there's<00:05:39.790> a<00:05:39.850> pretty<00:05:40.090> good<00:05:40.240> level<00:05:40.390> of

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
said there's a pretty good level of

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.230 
said there's a pretty good level of
comfort<00:05:41.050> with<00:05:41.080> this<00:05:41.410> particular<00:05:41.680> shoe<00:05:42.280> um<00:05:42.640> in

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
comfort with this particular shoe um in

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.510 
comfort with this particular shoe um in
terms<00:05:43.270> of<00:05:43.840> the<00:05:44.110> overall<00:05:44.230> width<00:05:44.800> it's<00:05:45.280> much

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
terms of the overall width it's much

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.490 
terms of the overall width it's much
wider<00:05:45.820> than<00:05:46.000> I<00:05:46.210> was<00:05:46.330> honestly<00:05:46.660> expecting<00:05:46.840> as

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
wider than I was honestly expecting as

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.760 
wider than I was honestly expecting as
well<00:05:47.860> so<00:05:48.850> it<00:05:49.330> would<00:05:49.630> be<00:05:49.780> suitable<00:05:50.110> for<00:05:50.260> pretty

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
well so it would be suitable for pretty

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.920 
well so it would be suitable for pretty
much<00:05:50.860> all<00:05:51.220> foot<00:05:51.610> types<00:05:51.850> it's<00:05:52.090> wide<00:05:52.330> through

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
much all foot types it's wide through

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.900 
much all foot types it's wide through
the<00:05:53.050> mid<00:05:53.230> foot<00:05:53.410> four<00:05:54.130> foot<00:05:54.370> and<00:05:54.520> even<00:05:54.700> in<00:05:54.820> the

the mid foot four foot and even in the

the mid foot four foot and even in the
toe<00:05:55.090> box<00:05:55.120> area<00:05:55.680> in<00:05:56.680> terms<00:05:56.890> of<00:05:57.130> sizing<00:05:57.670> I<00:05:57.850> find

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:58.420 
toe box area in terms of sizing I find

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.820 
toe box area in terms of sizing I find
that<00:05:58.570> these<00:05:58.720> definitely<00:05:59.170> do<00:05:59.320> seem<00:05:59.530> to<00:05:59.680> run

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
that these definitely do seem to run

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.280 
that these definitely do seem to run

smaller<00:06:08.320> than<00:06:08.530> I<00:06:08.680> would<00:06:08.740> normally<00:06:08.950> wear<00:06:09.220> and

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:09.640 
smaller than I would normally wear and

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.340 
smaller than I would normally wear and
the<00:06:10.030> fit<00:06:10.210> in<00:06:10.270> the<00:06:10.360> length<00:06:10.540> seems<00:06:10.870> to<00:06:11.020> be<00:06:11.110> pretty

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
the fit in the length seems to be pretty

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:12.840 
the fit in the length seems to be pretty
good<00:06:11.500> from<00:06:11.740> right<00:06:11.860> out<00:06:12.010> of<00:06:12.070> the<00:06:12.130> box<00:06:12.340> which

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.850 
good from right out of the box which

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:14.370 
good from right out of the box which
leads<00:06:13.120> me<00:06:13.240> to<00:06:13.300> believe<00:06:13.390> that<00:06:13.600> after<00:06:14.170> you<00:06:14.230> wear

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380 
leads me to believe that after you wear

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.360 
leads me to believe that after you wear
these<00:06:14.560> a<00:06:14.620> little<00:06:14.740> bit<00:06:14.860> and<00:06:15.100> the<00:06:15.160> leather

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
these a little bit and the leather

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.490 
these a little bit and the leather
starts<00:06:15.640> to<00:06:15.850> stretch<00:06:16.060> they'll<00:06:16.660> feel<00:06:16.990> even

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
starts to stretch they'll feel even

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.230 
starts to stretch they'll feel even
better<00:06:17.710> so<00:06:18.340> that's<00:06:18.460> pretty<00:06:18.670> much<00:06:18.790> it<00:06:18.940> as<00:06:19.060> far

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
better so that's pretty much it as far

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.490 
better so that's pretty much it as far
as<00:06:19.330> the<00:06:19.420> on<00:06:19.570> feet<00:06:19.810> portion<00:06:20.200> of<00:06:20.290> this<00:06:20.350> video
