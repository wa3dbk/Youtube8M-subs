 iphone and try to win the jackpot 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.420
 which rises to I believe a little more than 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.789
 15000 euros but we will talk about 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.739
 mares horses therefore this 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:58.230
 him with a favorite all indicated the 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.600
 number 12 urfer dumouchel pleasant 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.129
 success lately on 2100 meters but 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.170
 she owns outfits logically she 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.330
 will have to repeat exactly this why 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.770
 I put them in front of my prono ce 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.020
 that I like a lot at her place 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.760
 that she is very regular and since her 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.590
 beginnings she was really spared by 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.360
 her entourage she ran that 17 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.530
 racing 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.990
 she just won as you come from 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.460
 say it on 2100 meters being unshod 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.680
 four feet it was the first 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.659
 once she was before she 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.420
 was second on this course so she 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.220
 does very well the 2700 meters has it a 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.229
 again we undo the four 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.180
 feet so I think it's a 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.439
 indicated favorite all indicated with in 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.200
 more michael burning sulky so 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.140
 exactly it's not bad we'll ask him 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.400
 the number 13 urtica line then there we 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.799
 play the card of freshness 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.899
 the entourage is very very confident there 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.430
 so it's almost logical yes it's 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.990
 quite logical even if it's true that it 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.600
 can be a little flat the freshness 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.299
 Well, I think so much because 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.219
 everything lets me think that the entourage has 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.229
 targeted this race she is deferré of 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.329
 four feet for his return entrusted to 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.640
 jean michel bazire for the first time 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.009
 and we can also emphasize that it is a 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.439
 mare who in 32 outings has been 28 times 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.569
 in the money therefore in the herald the 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.220
 web bettors understood that we do not dismiss 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.070
 took a stand 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.050
 the number 10 a daycare mbo she 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.510
 just triumphed on this same course 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.190
 meanwhile a 14.6 she has only repeated 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.690
 finally the arrival of new times here 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.610
 that's what it was really a success 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.090
 extremely pleasant it was the 1st 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.340
 January 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.310
 she really likes this five-step 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.910
 races she had to win three times 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.100
 on this course 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.920
 so go again free of the four 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.340
 feet inevitably we hold it 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.030
 logic 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.190
 the unanimous number 18 colitti then she 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.240
 is looking for his race right now his 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.800
 accessits on accessit 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.570
 now she absolutely needs 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.220
 to have a good back to be brought back 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.170
 and finish is the little risk 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.850
 it's a little bit the little risk it's 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.500
 true but so it's the richest of the 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.840
 lot so she is really fine 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.510
 committed i think with franck ouvrie 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.850
 cunfin de rivers it's going to go by itself 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.740
 she is deferré of the four still one 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.050
 times so there she just finished two 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.310
 second time on this course behind 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.560
 rib union 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.560
 this time his rival is not part of 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.690
 engaged so I keep it in the 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.520
 quinté yes it is sure ok in simple 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.090
 fifth position against the 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.920
 number 9 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.110
 ula bécaud then she she comes from 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.630
 refine its shape by being shod this 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.550
 once barefoot it feels a little racing 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.280
 aimed yes that's his coach was 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.470
 pretty confident visibly he to undo 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.560
 this time she has a lot of means 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.720
 it's really his category and 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.180
 same time last year she had 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.700
 won two races on this course 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.190
 so what proves both his 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.340
 aptitude for this line and its shape 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.320
 seasonal so here I am I think 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.030
 him the abbot co okay we 'll understand 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.540
 it's a 5/5 apparently with 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.340
 insurance 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.739
 today I ask you a little 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.540
 reminder of your selection the es8 then 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.630
 my eight so the 12 had done 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:01.049
 dumouchel the 13 canine urti say it a 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.440
 bad rice the 18 unanime quality the 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.950
 new 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.980
 ula bécaud the 17 one to one in latina 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.200
 pardon the 15 urania jiel and the united united 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.190
 hockey game board 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.980
 we will not change a team that wins 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.200
 we went on a 501 5.5 not know what 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.180
 that he will say reduced field 12 13 10 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.530
 By the way we placed the 9th the 15th on the 16th 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.539
 the 17th on the 18th 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.039
 personally I added las 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.810
 montanas once it did not smile but 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.740
 why not one will not stop on a 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.020
 failure 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.669
 a game that will cost 15 euros otherwise this 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.570
 long time we stopped 15 euros 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.770
 we can play five-year-old have 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.470
 little played at 10% 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.360
 I remind you a little jackpot 15000 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.220
 euros we are at the time of the balances we are 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.200
 do not hesitate to bottom is what we play 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.200
 follows mainly the prognosis of the uci and 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.599
