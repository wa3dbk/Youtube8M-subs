00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.769
 with you sam and give birth to the release of the review 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.769
 commodity markets today we talk about 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.809
 aluminum 's pricing on this topic 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.410
 we deal with john din disputes with 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.880
 raw analyst sure you groups and so 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.590
 according to an international institution 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.170
 aluminum world production 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.750
 this metal grew by 5 6 percent in 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.769
 first quarter of this year 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.050
 mainly led to this demand 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.880
 China's manufacturing sector as 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:41.460
 an increase in supply will affect the market 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:43.140
 aluminum layla rose principle 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.090
 China 's manufacturing sector has become 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.129
 decisive factor in the decline in prices 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.770
 aluminum in the last few months 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.620
 this one has produced a half million tons 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:57.530
 Aluminum is more than the country need for 2015 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.530
 year this factor undermined the aluminum market 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.380
 this metal has fallen since the beginning of this year 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.510
 due to low oil prices now 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.010
 aluminum production is highly expensive 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.080
 compared to other metals mind 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.280
 energy costs what you predict 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.869
 for the near future for this raw material not 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.210
 We think that aluminum prices can 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.680
 grow your current role soon complete 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.619
 recent weakening of american 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.509
 dollar is not at all justified we are still 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.840
 we expect that by the end of this year the dollar 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.700
 will reach parity with the euro but we also 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.049
 We believe that the rally in oil prices and not 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.040
 will affect production costs 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.990
 aluminum 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.259
 so take into account the mentioned 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.540
 factors price of aluminum does not exceed 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.600
 1900 dollars per ton in 2015 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.040
 maybe short term it's 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.460
 happens but the level won't hold on 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.460
 long 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:04.120
 the reason it was attached here 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.240
 will find 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.400
 lasso sly and finally so you can 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.140
 advise aluminum traders if 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.520
 key indicators that can 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.080
 orientate you depends on china 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.030
 increase or lateral price movement 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.830
 will depend only on China 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.840
 specifically why you need to follow 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.310
 Is it an indicator of export volume less 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.530
 from China every month 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.350
 the Shanghai price is also important if 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.710
 will fall below 13 thousand yuan per ton but 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.460
 aluminum prices will be pressured 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.090
 arbitrage export result 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.740
 the important point will increase significantly 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.690
 whether to reduce china even more export 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.730
 aluminum tax if yes all 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:57.700
 aluminum producers in china will come out on 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:59.440
 international market and thank you for that 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.180
 were with us today dear viewers 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.230
