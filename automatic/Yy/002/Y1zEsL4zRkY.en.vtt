00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:19.160
 make your cappuccino ready very tasty 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:27.359
 while experimenting if it will be seen 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:34.440
 I do not know, I will show here it is obtained in layers 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:37.890
 really milk layer then coffee layer 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.340
 on top of the foam if you stupidly pour in 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:45.120
 milk in coffee 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.750
 then you just have coffee too 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.780
 with milk 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:55.829
 and here it turns out that's cappuccino 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:59.969
 be the only negative 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.670
 preparations that the one who likes to drink 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:07.200
 sugar is cappuccino coffee 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.450
 well, you still have to mix it 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.420
 that is, I say I drink coffee without sugar 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.210
 so this is what i'm doing if you drink with 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.520
 are from but if possible 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.130
 then take the milk before it 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.979
 whip put out the right amount 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.049
 sugar and stir after coffee 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.270
 will pour into your milk 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.990
 but in principle the most will be mixed 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.200
 normal normal coffee 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:40.670
 moment means now we need us all 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.670
 we have this business 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:50.060
 then take this masik 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:52.990
 neatly remove it like this 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.990
 just flush with water 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:17.640
 here just wipe with a damp sponge 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:20.819
 or was such a special napkin on but 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:26.959
 the nose is here that the milk is not dry 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:32.280
 need too pro we take a cup 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:34.970
 again turn on the steam mode blinks 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.970
 temperature 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:46.290
 I blinked at that temperature to go 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.140
 formal that is if i turn now 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:54.080
 here this valve will just go for me 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:57.980
 need water what went exactly hot water 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.980
 waiting now from blinking 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.620
 boyfriend then 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.070
 that is, while blinking here will go by 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:10.550
 as soon as she is here from blinking everything 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:14.560
 It will come on all about Siphon Now 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.560
 can safely turn off the coffee machine 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.060
 Now she again straits 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.950
 but 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.420
 everything is on the rules and turned off 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.120
 automatically still such a moment if you 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.640
 forgot to switch the coffee machine off 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.370
 worry somewhere in about 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.240
 an hour she turns off herself she will blow here 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:05:01.880
 these nozzles will turn off 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:07.760
 that 's what else here we are going to 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:10.490
 the water here is the water sensor here is reds in 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:14.090
 principle itself when filled with water he 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.300
 will show here on the screen that water is well as 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:22.330
 would 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:22.330
 that it is full of water here is our container 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:34.620
 here are the code 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:36.930
 rounds he throws I can not to 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.420
 Unfortunately, the camera does not transmit to I can 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:46.320
 what so to say that when we were preparing 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:51.480
 espresso 40 milliliters as it were prepared 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:54.650
 when just a big 120 mug that's one 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:58.110
 which is 40 millimeters it is drier 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:02.460
 cake which from coffee remained he more 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:07.580
 dried here is poured 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:11.340
 water water passes through the filter 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:15.000
 special here but i can say so i 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:19.080
 I pour water into the coffee machine through the filter 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.970
 also britt because read that such u 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.880
 some of us water quality 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.620
 still it will be useful if someone 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:31.710
 as bukovok no filter in principle 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:35.070
 you can use it in principle 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:37.380
 Nothing complicated next video 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:40.370
 I will do water treatment if someone will 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:43.230
 Good luck to everyone 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:48.240
 enjoy and enjoy 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:52.010
 she is worth her money but not worth those 26 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.970
 20 3 8 there are 30,000 of which they break for it 

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:56.970
 huge supermarket 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:59.490
 if there is a desire to really look better 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:01.890
 on the internet and find in the same internet 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:05.190
 store either with shipping or 

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:09.330
 by pickup but for 16 half 17 thousand 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:12.780
 and even the guarantee, too, even growth with there 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:14.970
 box and unfortunately thrown out but everything 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.919
 how would I officially check later 

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:19.950
 number is the official coffee machine 

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:20.640
 officially imported into Russia has 

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:26.100
 growth 

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:27.930
 by the way here on the beetle book well the book 

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.450
 You can clearly put anything into 

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:32.670
 inside but-but-but the box opened at 

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:35.580
 I myself work 

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:37.860
 home appliances know how to in 

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:40.110
 principle close any box there and 

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:43.800
 stick back but i can say that 

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:44.520
 this box did not hide well everything to everyone 

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.180
 until 

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.180
 happily
