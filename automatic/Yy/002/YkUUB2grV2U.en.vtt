The Perfect Hard Boiled Egg

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hi, Welcome again to the flavor of my kitchen 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is a quick recipe to show you 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
how I make the perfect hard boiled egg

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
when the yolk is still all yellow

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and it does not get that grayish 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
or greenish tint.  So in a small sauce pan or pot

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I´m going to put water and turn the stove on high

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and immediately put two eggs

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I will wait till the water boils  and let it boil

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
for 3 minutes,  eggs and all

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Okay so the water

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
has started boiling  now i will let boil 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
for exactly 3 minutes

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Okay  it has been 3 min

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
now im going to cover it and i will 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
turn off the heat and let it rest

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
for 10 uninterrupted minutes

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
do not open 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Okay  it has been

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
10 minutes  of resting

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I´m going to take them out

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and put them in a small plate

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
to cool down

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I will put them in cold water so they cool down faster

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
On top of napkin

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Hit softly against the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
table

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
start making indentations

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
pressing so is  indented

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
all over

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
this way is so much easier to remove the shell

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
After I let the eggs cool down

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and I peel them, now you can see

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
it is a perfect egg

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
it is super smooth

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I can cut it in half 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
you can see the yolk 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
is all yellow

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
there is no greenish 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
or grayish areas

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I can take it out 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
look at this yellow!

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
look at this yellow!

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
This is the color that the egg should be

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
So this is a perfectly hard boiled egg.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I hope this was helpful. You can 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
use this breakfast, as stuffing for the meatballs,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
you can use it many ways, also in salads

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
o just a simply hard boil egg, is delicious

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Bon Appetite
