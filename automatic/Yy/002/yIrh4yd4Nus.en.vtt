00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
it would help with something like this

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.359 
it would help with something like this

that not just that it helps treat
hair-pulling<00:01:41.280> which<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.850> important<00:01:42.390> for<00:01:42.659> the

hair-pulling which is important for the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.330 
hair-pulling which is important for the
people<00:01:42.869> who<00:01:43.020> suffer<00:01:43.470> from<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.770> but<00:01:44.220> it's

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
people who suffer from that but it's

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.700 
people who suffer from that but it's
really<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:44.939> starts<00:01:45.390> looking<00:01:45.689> from<00:01:46.560> a

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
really that it starts looking from a

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.920 
really that it starts looking from a
very<00:01:47.220> controlled<00:01:47.700> way<00:01:47.850> at<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.329> completely

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
very controlled way at a completely

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.130 
very controlled way at a completely
different<00:01:49.560> sort<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.189> chemical<00:01:50.460> target<00:01:51.270> for

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
different sort of chemical target for

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.560 
different sort of chemical target for
compulsive<00:01:52.950> behaviors

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.600 

in<00:01:55.659> the<00:01:56.590> last<00:01:56.770> several<00:01:56.980> years<00:01:57.220> people<00:01:57.490> have

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
in the last several years people have

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.969 
in the last several years people have
realized<00:01:58.060> that<00:01:58.210> maybe<00:01:58.390> glutamate<00:01:59.050> which<00:01:59.380> is<00:01:59.950> a

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
realized that maybe glutamate which is a

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.740 
realized that maybe glutamate which is a
chemical<00:02:00.190> in<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.909> brain<00:02:00.940> that's<00:02:01.300> sort<00:02:01.540> of<00:02:01.570> all

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
chemical in the brain that's sort of all

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.500 
chemical in the brain that's sort of all
about<00:02:01.960> excitation<00:02:02.740> so<00:02:03.220> it<00:02:03.670> gets<00:02:03.850> us<00:02:04.060> revved<00:02:04.330> up

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
about excitation so it gets us revved up

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.940 
about excitation so it gets us revved up
it<00:02:04.720> gets<00:02:04.810> us<00:02:04.990> wanting<00:02:05.229> to<00:02:05.320> do<00:02:05.440> something<00:02:05.680> and

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
it gets us wanting to do something and

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.469 
it gets us wanting to do something and
this<00:02:06.040> is<00:02:06.190> why<00:02:06.340> it's<00:02:06.400> been<00:02:06.670> implicated<00:02:07.360> in

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
this is why it's been implicated in

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.900 
this is why it's been implicated in
addiction<00:02:08.170> so<00:02:08.770> when<00:02:08.920> it's<00:02:09.039> over<00:02:09.340> active<00:02:09.759> we

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
addiction so when it's over active we

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.120 
addiction so when it's over active we
really<00:02:10.240> want<00:02:10.570> to<00:02:10.810> do<00:02:10.959> things<00:02:11.260> and<00:02:11.500> not<00:02:11.740> always

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
really want to do things and not always

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.080 
really want to do things and not always
the<00:02:12.610> healthiest<00:02:13.060> behaviors<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.890> it's<00:02:15.459> this

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
the healthiest behaviors and it's this

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.730 
the healthiest behaviors and it's this
dietary<00:02:16.540> supplement<00:02:17.140> that<00:02:17.170> really<00:02:17.590> reduces

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
dietary supplement that really reduces

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.699 
dietary supplement that really reduces
the<00:02:18.520> drive<00:02:18.850> of<00:02:19.240> that<00:02:19.390> excitation<00:02:19.810> chemical<00:02:20.620> in

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
the drive of that excitation chemical in

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.010 
the drive of that excitation chemical in
the<00:02:20.800> brain<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:21.310> therefore<00:02:22.150> allows<00:02:22.390> people<00:02:22.660> to

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
the brain and therefore allows people to

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.870 
the brain and therefore allows people to
start<00:02:23.470> thinking<00:02:23.500> about<00:02:23.980> their<00:02:24.280> behaviors

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
start thinking about their behaviors

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.000 
start thinking about their behaviors
being<00:02:25.750> able<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:25.959> control<00:02:26.170> it<00:02:26.560> better<00:02:26.709> so

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
being able to control it better so

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.650 
being able to control it better so
people<00:02:27.280> would<00:02:27.400> say<00:02:27.580> you<00:02:27.640> know<00:02:27.820> I<00:02:27.850> kind<00:02:28.600> of

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
people would say you know I kind of

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.449 
people would say you know I kind of
wanted<00:02:29.050> to<00:02:29.140> pull<00:02:29.410> my<00:02:29.650> hair<00:02:29.680> a<00:02:29.890> little<00:02:30.070> bit<00:02:30.160> but

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
wanted to pull my hair a little bit but

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.580 
wanted to pull my hair a little bit but
I<00:02:30.520> was<00:02:30.670> able<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:30.970> say<00:02:31.120> no<00:02:31.150> I'm<00:02:31.480> not<00:02:31.600> going<00:02:31.989> to<00:02:32.200> so

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
I was able to say no I'm not going to so

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.190 
I was able to say no I'm not going to so
they<00:02:32.739> were<00:02:32.800> a<00:02:33.040> they<00:02:33.400> were<00:02:33.520> it<00:02:34.390> was<00:02:34.420> easier<00:02:34.930> for

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
they were a they were it was easier for

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.670 
they were a they were it was easier for
them<00:02:35.350> to<00:02:35.410> put<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.709> brakes<00:02:35.920> on<00:02:36.070> their<00:02:36.250> behavior
