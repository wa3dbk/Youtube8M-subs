00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.259
 Hello everyone, today I am here to propose you 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:27.289
 another snack for children 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:29.509
 I had already proposed flutes in the past and 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.189
 the snacks kinder paradise 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:34.550

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:37.159
 comic the link available here 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.800
 my intention was to offer you the 

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:42.440
 kinder brioss snack so I did 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.260
 a web search to try to 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.750
 find a snack that had gods 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:52.699
 realization times not very long 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:57.170
 and besides a nice look they are 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:01:02.749
 can you find a recipe on the blog 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:05.780
 that now I tell you the chateau de core 

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:09.710
 mondays and that sincerely has me 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:13.030
 inspired a lot and so I decided to 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:16.190
 do that with small variations 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.530
 decreasing the cream of the farce that 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.780
 I think it was too excessive e 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.820
 adding vanillin to give a 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.840
 a little bit more than in rome a christine 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.390
 rendine the final result is that the 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.659
 snacks are very similar to 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.240
 kinder brioss unfortunately, however, like flavor 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.970
 not 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.640
 they don't look like much but I decided to 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.030
 propose the same because they really are 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.970
 good genuine good to offer 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.700
 equally to your children both for 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.880
 snack for breakfast 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.600
 I hope to succeed later 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:58.140
 to find a recipe that is more 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.240
 similar to this type of snack 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.929

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.090

 first I will go to blend the eggs 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:03:01.980
 whole with sugar must become a 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:08.519
 compound beautiful swollen soft and fluffy 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:11.760
 whitish as soon as I get this 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:14.930
 beautiful foamy texture began to 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.930
 insert the ball 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:28.610
 and continues to mount just made 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.920
 the whole is well assembled began to 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:41.060
 insert all the flours with the baking powder 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:45.560
 sifted by making movements 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:50.030
 delicate from bottom to top for not 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:53.120
 dismantle the compound arrived at 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:56.510
 this point or coated sonale paper from 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:03.220
 oven with internal dimensions of 36 per 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:03.220
 30 and I'm going to distribute the mixture 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:16.979
 the mixture will be soft but enough 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:23.910
 I am going to level it well on the 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:26.760
 drip pan from the oven just finished 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.110
 level it I'll go and put it in the oven 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:33.449
 warm at 180 degrees for 20 minutes 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:36.150
 here's how the dough will look 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:39.300
 once cooked, I let it cool 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.699
 I completely went to shoot 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:45.960
 the dough with a tray 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:49.380
 now I'm going to equalize it as much as possible 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:53.150
 now I'm going to decide a half meal 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.150
 helping me with m 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.319
 I split in half because once 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:16.270
 stuffed I will have to overlap it I prepare the 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:19.449
 Filling it going to put that cream in 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.509
 this case is already sweetened with 20 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:29.409
 grams of icing sugar 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:37.659

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:40.090
 I go to mount everything just 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:43.210
 the cream will be whipped, I let it rest 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:47.400
 in the refrigerator once it is very cold 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.400
 I can start stuffing it 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:12.240
 now overlap I make a light one 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:12.240
 pressure and go to remove the excesses 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:21.669
 once removed the excesses I will go to 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:24.360
 cut them to the size of the typical ones 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:24.360
 snacks 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.310

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:35.520
 melted in a thigh saga with a 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:39.439
 spout end and I will go to practice 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.439
 typical kinder brioss strips 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.979
