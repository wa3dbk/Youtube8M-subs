00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
with what we normally want to do is take

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.700 
with what we normally want to do is take
a<00:00:35.850> look<00:00:36.090> at<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.300> IV<00:00:36.600> characteristics<00:00:37.379> to<00:00:37.530> see

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
a look at the IV characteristics to see

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.140 
a look at the IV characteristics to see
where<00:00:37.920> we're<00:00:38.040> going<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.339> get<00:00:38.489> linear

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.150 
where we're going to get linear

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.360 
where we're going to get linear
amplifier<00:00:39.780> performance<00:00:40.409> and<00:00:40.620> that's<00:00:41.159> just<00:00:41.309> a

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
amplifier performance and that's just a

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.549 
amplifier performance and that's just a
simple<00:00:41.699> matter<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.970> taking<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.570> Baisakhi<00:00:43.290> FET

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
simple matter of taking the Baisakhi FET

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.399 
simple matter of taking the Baisakhi FET
out<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.549> triQuint<00:00:45.150> PD<00:00:45.629> design<00:00:45.930> kit<00:00:46.199> and

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:46.409 
out of the triQuint PD design kit and

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:48.500 
out of the triQuint PD design kit and
hooking<00:00:46.799> up<00:00:47.040> an<00:00:47.159> IV<00:00:47.460> curve<00:00:47.699> element<00:00:48.150> here<00:00:48.390> and

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
hooking up an IV curve element here and

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.189 
hooking up an IV curve element here and
then<00:00:49.229> looking<00:00:49.530> at<00:00:49.710> some<00:00:49.920> IV<00:00:50.190> curves<00:00:50.489> so

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
then looking at some IV curves so

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.750 
then looking at some IV curves so
looking<00:00:52.199> at<00:00:52.320> these<00:00:52.530> IV<00:00:52.890> curves<00:00:53.190> we<00:00:53.309> can<00:00:53.339> see

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
looking at these IV curves we can see

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.399 
looking at these IV curves we can see
here<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.150> because<00:00:54.659> this<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.900> an<00:00:55.049> enhancement

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:55.409 
here that because this is an enhancement

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:57.140 
here that because this is an enhancement
mode<00:00:55.650> device<00:00:56.010> we're<00:00:56.489> going<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.670> get<00:00:56.760> turned<00:00:56.970> on

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
mode device we're going to get turned on

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.930 
mode device we're going to get turned on
above<00:00:57.449> zero<00:00:57.780> volts<00:00:58.110> and<00:00:58.290> the<00:00:59.250> nature<00:00:59.580> of<00:00:59.610> this

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
above zero volts and the nature of this

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.789 
above zero volts and the nature of this
device<00:01:00.239> inside<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.900> a<00:01:00.930> gallium<00:01:01.470> arsenide

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:01.799 
device inside of a gallium arsenide

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:05.299 
device inside of a gallium arsenide
process<00:01:02.309> with<00:01:03.119> a<00:01:03.150> metal<00:01:03.930> gate<00:01:04.110> implies<00:01:05.100> that

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
process with a metal gate implies that

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.050 
process with a metal gate implies that
we're<00:01:05.460> really<00:01:05.580> not<00:01:05.700> going<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.880> want<00:01:06.030> to

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
we're really not going to want to

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.690 
we're really not going to want to
operate<00:01:06.360> this<00:01:06.630> much<00:01:07.560> above<00:01:07.830> 0.7<00:01:08.460> volts

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
operate this much above 0.7 volts

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.740 
operate this much above 0.7 volts
because<00:01:08.850> that's<00:01:09.000> where<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.240> gate<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.540> going

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
because that's where the gate is going

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.540 
because that's where the gate is going
to<00:01:09.810> forward<00:01:10.140> bias<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.590> act<00:01:11.100> more<00:01:11.220> like<00:01:11.370> a

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
to forward bias and act more like a

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.730 
to forward bias and act more like a
diode<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.840> we're<00:01:12.990> sort<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.200> constrained

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
diode so we're sort of constrained

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.400 
diode so we're sort of constrained
between<00:01:14.190> the<00:01:14.700> turn-on<00:01:14.940> voltage<00:01:15.480> which<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:16.140> on

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
between the turn-on voltage which is on

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.460 
between the turn-on voltage which is on
the<00:01:16.500> order<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.740> about<00:01:17.420> 0.2<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.540> 0.3<00:01:18.930> volts<00:01:18.960> and

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
the order of about 0.2 to 0.3 volts and

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.280 
the order of about 0.2 to 0.3 volts and
on<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.820> gate<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.270> upper<00:01:21.480> end<00:01:21.630> at<00:01:21.720> 0.7

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.360 
on the gate and the upper end at 0.7
volts<00:01:22.530> but<00:01:22.650> we're<00:01:22.800> also<00:01:22.920> somewhat

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.090 
volts but we're also somewhat
constrained<00:01:23.700> on<00:01:24.060> our<00:01:24.570> VDS<00:01:25.050> our<00:01:25.620> drain<00:01:25.920> voltage

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
constrained on our VDS our drain voltage

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.080 
constrained on our VDS our drain voltage
by<00:01:26.850> where<00:01:27.120> the<00:01:27.270> knee<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.860> any<00:01:29.550> Class<00:01:29.880> A

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
going to want to be in this region here

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.720 
going to want to be in this region here
so<00:01:34.530> just<00:01:34.890> looking<00:01:35.130> at<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.400> IV

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 
so just looking at this IV

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.820 
so just looking at this IV
characteristic<00:01:36.450> we<00:01:36.600> can<00:01:36.840> say<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.560> we<00:01:37.650> should

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
characteristic we can say that we should

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.680 
characteristic we can say that we should
start<00:01:38.130> exploring<00:01:38.520> our<00:01:38.760> circuit<00:01:39.120> let's<00:01:39.300> say<00:01:39.510> at

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
start exploring our circuit let's say at

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.050 
start exploring our circuit let's say at
0.45<00:01:40.440> volts<00:01:40.710> that's<00:01:41.400> going<00:01:41.760> to<00:01:41.820> be<00:01:41.909> about

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
0.45 volts that's going to be about

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.899 
0.45 volts that's going to be about
halfway<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.110> range<00:01:43.409> here<00:01:43.800> and<00:01:43.950> let's<00:01:44.790> say

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
halfway in this range here and let's say

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.910 
halfway in this range here and let's say
we<00:01:45.030> want<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.270> go<00:01:45.930> two<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.230> a<00:01:46.290> half<00:01:46.440> volts<00:01:46.770> on

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
we want to go two and a half volts on

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.000 
we want to go two and a half volts on
the<00:01:46.980> on<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.120> drain<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:49.110> when<00:01:49.229> we<00:01:49.350> do<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.740> I'm

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
the on the drain so when we do that I'm

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.910 
the on the drain so when we do that I'm
going<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.640> set<00:01:50.790> up<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.970> very<00:01:51.150> simple<00:01:51.659> circuit

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
going to set up a very simple circuit

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.190 
going to set up a very simple circuit
start<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.070> begin<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.720> understand<00:01:54.720> this<00:01:54.840> device

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
start to begin to understand this device

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.990 
start to begin to understand this device
in<00:01:55.440> terms<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.100> its<00:01:56.220> gain<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.610> noise<00:01:56.700> figure

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
in terms of its gain and noise figure

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.190 
in terms of its gain and noise figure
and<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.300> trade-offs<00:01:57.690> that<00:01:57.780> we're<00:01:57.930> going<00:01:58.050> to

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
and the trade-offs that we're going to

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.260 
and the trade-offs that we're going to
have<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.440> make<00:01:58.620> and<00:01:58.950> as<00:01:59.550> we<00:01:59.729> mentioned<00:02:00.120> in<00:02:00.210> the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
have to make and as we mentioned in the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.210 
have to make and as we mentioned in the
first<00:02:00.330> video<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:00.990> this<00:02:01.080> installment<00:02:01.560> our<00:02:01.920> our

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
first video in this installment our our

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.030 
first video in this installment our our
methodology<00:02:03.030> here<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.560> very<00:02:04.560> much<00:02:04.710> like<00:02:04.890> an

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
methodology here is very much like an

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.680 
methodology here is very much like an
onion<00:02:05.340> we<00:02:05.460> want<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.700> peel<00:02:05.909> back<00:02:05.940> the<00:02:06.240> layers<00:02:06.450> of

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
onion we want to peel back the layers of

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.690 
onion we want to peel back the layers of
complexity<00:02:07.260> and<00:02:07.530> as<00:02:07.860> we<00:02:08.039> do<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.399> we<00:02:08.459> want<00:02:08.580> to

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
complexity and as we do that we want to

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.889 
complexity and as we do that we want to
gain<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:08.879> deeper<00:02:09.269> and<00:02:09.420> deeper<00:02:09.659> understanding

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
gain a deeper and deeper understanding

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.800 
gain a deeper and deeper understanding
of<00:02:10.379> our<00:02:10.530> design<00:02:10.890> taking<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:12.030> understanding

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
of our design taking that understanding

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.650 
of our design taking that understanding
with<00:02:12.989> us<00:02:13.230> as<00:02:13.409> we<00:02:13.950> go<00:02:14.129> from<00:02:14.430> not<00:02:15.300> knowing<00:02:15.480> a

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
with us as we go from not knowing a

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.510 
with us as we go from not knowing a
whole<00:02:15.870> lot<00:02:16.080> about<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.770> process<00:02:17.280> or<00:02:17.430> our

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
whole lot about the process or our

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.300 
whole lot about the process or our
circuit<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:19.200> getting<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.620> complete<00:02:20.010> sir

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
circuit to getting a complete sir

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.520 
circuit to getting a complete sir
and<00:02:20.610> building<00:02:21.150> up<00:02:21.300> our<00:02:21.450> understanding<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.140> the

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
and building up our understanding of the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.230 
and building up our understanding of the
sensitivities<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.400> interactions<00:02:24.030> and

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
sensitivities and interactions and

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.540 
sensitivities and interactions and
really<00:02:25.020> what's<00:02:25.200> going<00:02:25.350> on<00:02:25.530> inside<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.250> the

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
really what's going on inside and the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.130 
really what's going on inside and the
best<00:02:26.730> place<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:26.940> start<00:02:27.360> is<00:02:27.569> just<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.959> very

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
best place to start is just a very

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.480 
best place to start is just a very
simple<00:02:28.319> circuit<00:02:28.650> like<00:02:28.920> this<00:02:29.130> where<00:02:29.340> we<00:02:29.459> have

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
simple circuit like this where we have

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.000 
simple circuit like this where we have
no<00:02:29.910> reactive<00:02:30.720> elements<00:02:31.140> we<00:02:31.260> have<00:02:31.290> no<00:02:31.650> micro

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
no reactive elements we have no micro

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.710 
no reactive elements we have no micro
strip<00:02:32.250> or<00:02:32.370> RF<00:02:32.670> elements<00:02:33.060> we're<00:02:33.450> really<00:02:33.630> just

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
strip or RF elements we're really just

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.809 
strip or RF elements we're really just
looking<00:02:34.200> at<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.440> device<00:02:34.680> in<00:02:34.980> 50<00:02:35.370> ohms<00:02:35.550> and

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
looking at the device in 50 ohms and

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.090 
looking at the device in 50 ohms and
playing<00:02:36.720> around<00:02:36.810> with<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.080> bio<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:38.010> we

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
playing around with the bio so that we

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.430 
playing around with the bio so that we
can<00:02:38.220> select<00:02:38.819> an<00:02:39.090> appropriate<00:02:39.180> bias<00:02:39.840> condition

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
can select an appropriate bias condition

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.050 
can select an appropriate bias condition
that's<00:02:40.890> going<00:02:41.130> to<00:02:41.220> put<00:02:41.730> us<00:02:41.850> in<00:02:41.970> the

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
that's going to put us in the

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.180 
that's going to put us in the
neighborhood<00:02:42.239> of<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:43.380> performance<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:44.069> we

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
neighborhood of the performance that we

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.440 
neighborhood of the performance that we
want<00:02:44.400> this<00:02:44.670> doesn't<00:02:45.030> mean<00:02:45.150> that<00:02:45.270> we're<00:02:45.420> not

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
want this doesn't mean that we're not

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.120 
want this doesn't mean that we're not
going<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.750> adjust<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.319> bias<00:02:46.530> as<00:02:46.860> we<00:02:47.010> go

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
going to adjust the bias as we go

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.590 
going to adjust the bias as we go
through<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.459> process<00:02:47.640> but<00:02:48.300> we're<00:02:48.390> just<00:02:48.420> going

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
through the process but we're just going

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.270 
through the process but we're just going
to<00:02:48.660> gain<00:02:49.020> an<00:02:49.140> understanding<00:02:49.260> of<00:02:49.830> what<00:02:50.190> would

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
to gain an understanding of what would

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.270 
to gain an understanding of what would
be<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.459> good<00:02:50.730> or<00:02:50.970> reasonable<00:02:51.540> starting<00:02:51.870> place

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
be a good or reasonable starting place

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.710 
be a good or reasonable starting place
so<00:02:53.280> with<00:02:53.489> that<00:02:53.670> let's<00:02:53.940> go<00:02:54.120> ahead<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:54.480> look<00:02:54.600> at

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
so with that let's go ahead and look at

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.440 
so with that let's go ahead and look at
our<00:02:54.840> noise<00:02:55.470> circles<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.160> gain<00:02:56.790> circles<00:02:57.239> here

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
our noise circles and gain circles here

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.870 
our noise circles and gain circles here
and<00:02:58.640> you<00:02:59.640> can<00:02:59.820> see<00:03:00.090> that<00:03:01.640> let<00:03:02.640> me<00:03:02.700> minimize

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
and you can see that let me minimize

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.059 
and you can see that let me minimize
this<00:03:03.239> a<00:03:03.269> little<00:03:03.450> bit<00:03:03.630> so<00:03:03.810> we<00:03:03.900> can<00:03:04.019> really<00:03:04.769> can't

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
this a little bit so we can really can't

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.780 
this a little bit so we can really can't
see<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:06.440> and<00:03:07.440> I've<00:03:07.560> got<00:03:07.590> my<00:03:07.830> noise<00:03:08.160> figure<00:03:08.459> over

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
see it and I've got my noise figure over

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.750 
see it and I've got my noise figure over
here<00:03:09.030> with<00:03:09.900> my<00:03:10.050> minimum<00:03:10.319> noise<00:03:10.500> figure<00:03:10.610> in<00:03:11.610> the

and<00:03:14.670> I've<00:03:15.120> got<00:03:15.300> my<00:03:15.420> gain<00:03:15.630> circles<00:03:16.140> over<00:03:16.500> here

and I've got my gain circles over here

with my maximum gain that I would be

region over here and let's look what

region over here and let's look what
happened<00:03:29.010> as<00:03:29.190> we<00:03:29.640> start<00:03:30.180> tuning<00:03:30.390> over<00:03:30.780> biased

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
happened as we start tuning over biased

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.830 
happened as we start tuning over biased
to<00:03:31.470> select<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.250> bias<00:03:32.880> condition<00:03:33.480> that's<00:03:33.630> going

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
to select a bias condition that's going

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.720 
to select a bias condition that's going
to<00:03:33.930> be<00:03:34.019> appropriate<00:03:34.380> for<00:03:34.829> this<00:03:34.920> so<00:03:35.459> what<00:03:35.610> we're

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
to be appropriate for this so what we're

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.340 
to be appropriate for this so what we're
looking<00:03:35.760> for<00:03:36.060> is<00:03:36.510> a<00:03:36.540> minimum<00:03:37.140> noise<00:03:37.290> figure

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
looking for is a minimum noise figure

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.220 
looking for is a minimum noise figure
and<00:03:37.950> a<00:03:38.610> reasonable<00:03:39.090> amount<00:03:39.239> of<00:03:39.420> gain<00:03:39.660> in<00:03:39.959> terms

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
and a reasonable amount of gain in terms

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.289 
and a reasonable amount of gain in terms
of<00:03:40.350> a<00:03:40.410> single-stage<00:03:40.950> device<00:03:41.310> so<00:03:41.880> let's<00:03:41.910> start

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
of a single-stage device so let's start

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.840 
of a single-stage device so let's start
by<00:03:42.420> adjusting<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:43.079> voltage<00:03:43.440> on<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.640> gate

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
by adjusting the voltage on the the gate

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.330 
by adjusting the voltage on the the gate
here<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.329> as<00:03:46.049> we<00:03:46.290> do<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:46.500> you<00:03:46.920> can<00:03:47.040> see<00:03:47.190> that

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
here and as we do that you can see that

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.400 
here and as we do that you can see that
as<00:03:47.430> I'm<00:03:47.610> raising<00:03:47.880> up<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.180> voltage<00:03:48.690> if<00:03:48.930> you

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
as I'm raising up the voltage if you

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.050 
as I'm raising up the voltage if you
start<00:03:49.650> looking<00:03:49.890> at<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.100> noise<00:03:50.220> figure<00:03:50.700> over

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
start looking at the noise figure over

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.849 
start looking at the noise figure over
here<00:03:51.420> you<00:03:52.410> can<00:03:52.590> see<00:03:52.859> that<00:03:53.459> raising<00:03:54.299> the<00:03:54.859> gate

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
here you can see that raising the gate

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.910 
here you can see that raising the gate
voltage<00:03:56.480> begins<00:03:57.480> to<00:03:57.810> drop<00:03:58.230> down<00:03:58.530> our<00:03:58.739> noise

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
voltage begins to drop down our noise

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.729 
voltage begins to drop down our noise
figure<00:03:59.430> until<00:03:59.730> it<00:04:00.510> starts<00:04:00.780> to<00:04:00.840> go<00:04:00.989> up<00:04:01.109> again<00:04:01.380> it

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
figure until it starts to go up again it

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.890 
figure until it starts to go up again it
looks<00:04:01.980> like<00:04:02.130> we<00:04:02.250> see<00:04:02.519> a<00:04:02.549> minimum<00:04:03.030> right<00:04:03.239> around

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
looks like we see a minimum right around

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.220 
looks like we see a minimum right around
here<00:04:04.410> at<00:04:04.560> about<00:04:05.190> half<00:04:05.549> a<00:04:05.700> volt<00:04:05.910> and<00:04:06.209> on<00:04:07.049> our

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
here at about half a volt and on our

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.099 
here at about half a volt and on our
drain<00:04:07.590> if<00:04:07.890> we<00:04:08.040> stand<00:04:08.310> start<00:04:08.840> varying<00:04:09.840> our

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
drain if we stand start varying our

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.520 
drain if we stand start varying our
drain<00:04:10.620> bias<00:04:10.859> you<00:04:11.850> can<00:04:12.060> see<00:04:12.359> that<00:04:12.870> as<00:04:13.019> we<00:04:13.290> begin

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
drain bias you can see that as we begin

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.340 
drain bias you can see that as we begin
to<00:04:13.920> drop<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.310> drain<00:04:14.760> bias<00:04:15.000> or<00:04:15.720> getting<00:04:16.049> lower

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
to drop the drain bias or getting lower

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.409 
to drop the drain bias or getting lower
and<00:04:16.500> lower<00:04:16.709> noise<00:04:17.459> figure<00:04:17.760> of<00:04:17.970> course<00:04:18.150> we<00:04:18.299> have

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
and lower noise figure of course we have

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.180 
and lower noise figure of course we have
to<00:04:18.510> be<00:04:18.600> careful<00:04:19.019> about<00:04:19.109> this<00:04:19.410> because<00:04:19.620> what

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
to be careful about this because what

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.310 
to be careful about this because what
we're<00:04:20.310> trading<00:04:20.579> off<00:04:20.820> now<00:04:21.030> is<00:04:21.180> a<00:04:21.209> dynamic<00:04:22.049> range

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
we're trading off now is a dynamic range

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.200 
we're trading off now is a dynamic range
we're<00:04:23.100> not<00:04:23.220> gonna<00:04:23.310> be<00:04:23.400> able<00:04:23.490> to<00:04:23.610> swing<00:04:23.880> as<00:04:24.030> much

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
we're not gonna be able to swing as much

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.820 
we're not gonna be able to swing as much
voltage<00:04:24.600> across<00:04:24.840> that<00:04:24.930> device<00:04:25.380> so<00:04:25.530> we<00:04:25.620> need<00:04:25.740> to

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
voltage across that device so we need to

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.339 
voltage across that device so we need to
be<00:04:25.919> careful<00:04:26.100> in<00:04:26.490> terms<00:04:27.060> of<00:04:27.270> that<00:04:27.690> nonlinear

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:28.349 
be careful in terms of that nonlinear

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:30.050 
be careful in terms of that nonlinear
spec<00:04:28.740> with<00:04:28.919> regard<00:04:29.190> to<00:04:29.250> these<00:04:29.370> linear<00:04:29.729> specs

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
spec with regard to these linear specs

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.830 
spec with regard to these linear specs
but<00:04:30.539> you<00:04:30.690> can<00:04:30.810> see<00:04:30.930> that<00:04:31.080> as<00:04:31.169> we<00:04:31.320> drop<00:04:31.560> down<00:04:31.830> our

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
but you can see that as we drop down our

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.970 
but you can see that as we drop down our
drain<00:04:33.990> voltage<00:04:34.169> we're<00:04:34.500> going<00:04:34.740> to<00:04:34.830> get

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
drain voltage we're going to get

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.860 
drain voltage we're going to get
somewhat<00:04:35.730> improved<00:04:36.120> noise<00:04:36.300> figure<00:04:36.600> which

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
somewhat improved noise figure which

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.450 
somewhat improved noise figure which
sort<00:04:37.440> of<00:04:37.530> makes<00:04:37.710> sense<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:38.070> device<00:04:38.280> is

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
sort of makes sense the device is

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.320 
sort of makes sense the device is
operating<00:04:38.910> cooler<00:04:39.870> not<00:04:40.470> as<00:04:40.590> hot<00:04:40.830> and<00:04:41.330> we

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
operating cooler not as hot and we

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.330 
operating cooler not as hot and we
should<00:04:42.540> expect<00:04:42.870> to<00:04:43.110> see<00:04:43.199> the<00:04:43.919> noise<00:04:44.100> figure

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
should expect to see the noise figure

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.460 
should expect to see the noise figure
improve<00:04:44.850> so<00:04:45.419> if<00:04:45.510> we<00:04:45.600> play<00:04:46.020> around<00:04:46.260> a<00:04:46.380> little

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
improve so if we play around a little

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.159 
improve so if we play around a little
bit<00:04:46.710> with<00:04:46.860> this<00:04:47.040> and<00:04:47.639> I<00:04:48.630> think<00:04:48.810> it<00:04:48.900> looks<00:04:49.080> like

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
bit with this and I think it looks like

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:50.810 
bit with this and I think it looks like
we're<00:04:49.410> going<00:04:49.620> to<00:04:49.770> find<00:04:50.460> some<00:04:50.639> good

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
we're going to find some good

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.520 
we're going to find some good
performance<00:04:51.330> right<00:04:51.540> around<00:04:51.690> half<00:04:51.960> a<00:04:52.050> volt<00:04:52.290> so

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
performance right around half a volt so

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.320 
performance right around half a volt so
for<00:04:52.740> a<00:04:52.770> sake<00:04:52.979> of<00:04:53.100> simplicity<00:04:53.280> let's<00:04:53.880> just<00:04:53.940> dial

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
for a sake of simplicity let's just dial

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.180 
for a sake of simplicity let's just dial
it<00:04:54.510> in<00:04:54.630> at<00:04:54.750> half<00:04:54.930> a<00:04:55.050> volt<00:04:55.260> and<00:04:57.860> let's<00:04:58.860> get<00:04:59.160> a

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
it in at half a volt and let's get a

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.629 
it in at half a volt and let's get a
reasonable<00:04:59.790> amount<00:05:00.030> of<00:05:01.160> voltage<00:05:02.160> across<00:05:02.400> that

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
reasonable amount of voltage across that

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.480 
reasonable amount of voltage across that
device<00:05:02.940> let's<00:05:03.210> say<00:05:03.800> two<00:05:04.800> and<00:05:04.949> a<00:05:04.979> half<00:05:05.130> volts

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
device let's say two and a half volts

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.400 
device let's say two and a half volts
and<00:05:08.090> we<00:05:09.090> get<00:05:09.240> about<00:05:09.360> a<00:05:09.479> DB<00:05:09.900> of<00:05:09.930> noise<00:05:10.020> figure

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
and we get about a DB of noise figure

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.280 
and we get about a DB of noise figure
and<00:05:10.680> 15<00:05:11.639> DB<00:05:11.940> of<00:05:11.970> gain<00:05:12.060> which<00:05:12.419> is<00:05:12.450> quite

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
and 15 DB of gain which is quite

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.290 
and 15 DB of gain which is quite
substantial<00:05:13.550> it's<00:05:14.550> a<00:05:14.639> reasonable<00:05:15.120> amount

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
substantial it's a reasonable amount

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.400 
substantial it's a reasonable amount
given<00:05:15.570> our<00:05:16.460> analysis<00:05:17.460> in<00:05:17.669> the<00:05:17.760> previous<00:05:18.410> video

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
between gain and noise figure so this

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:25.520 
between gain and noise figure so this
would<00:05:24.030> be<00:05:24.180> a<00:05:24.210> good<00:05:24.570> starting<00:05:24.960> place<00:05:25.110> for<00:05:25.440> our
