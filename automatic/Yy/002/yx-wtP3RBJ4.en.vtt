00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.250
 fuel delivery pumps are there so probably 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.350
 many different farmers pointed 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.300
 Manufacturer gives one but you have 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.610
 All together they become electric 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.710
 driven 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.050
 they can be installed in the tank or 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.960
 outside so-called inline pumps 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.879
 the fuel lines are somewhere 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.809
 but corrosion 1 are due 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:44.120
 you can find the majority in the tank today 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:46.370
 You have a funding volume between 50 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.350
 and that's 200 liters an hour 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.540
 Of course much more so a motor 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.480
 but it needs to be ensured 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:57.199
 Be that at every point in time 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.140
 operating system enough fuel to 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.400
 available 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.729
 excess fuel will be back in 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.040
 The tank led you to press these 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.080
 bombs are between 3 and 7 bar 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.549
 so not so high and you 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.130
 Be by a pressure regulator 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:19.490
 regulated by direct injection 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.020
 systems we have this power 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.360
 transfer pumps as so-called front 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.280
 Pumps where you can easily 5 bar 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.289
 to achieve pressure before promoting 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.049
 The fuel then becomes one 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.509
 high-pressure pump which built it similar 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.340
 as with the diesel engines common rail 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.070
 three stamp pumps 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.159
 however, the pressure here is 50 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:44.210
 He calls diesel engines up to 120 bar 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.899
 yes at 2,000 more was so already 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.899
 again such a donkey bridge ottomotor 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:53.299
 Direct injection we were 100 bar 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:55.039
 diesel engines common rail 2000 bar the 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.409
 take care of it and it is 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.460
 Helpful when you're in a test 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.460
 is asked 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.280
 be injection valves 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.959
 finally there are so many actors 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.010
 different types probably like 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.550
 there are manufacturers 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.250
 But they all have one thing in common 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.470
 are electrically operated that is they 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.220
 are streamed from the controller if they 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.569
 should open and do not exist if 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.690
 they should close and that happens 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:31.540
 by a shooting error this 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.300
 Injection valves at the indirect 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.720
 Injecting systems will not work 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.720
 so highly stressed pressures between 5 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:44.230
 and 7 bar and the installation location in the suit 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.239
 mean channel near the inlet valves 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:51.370
 that they are not a big burden 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:53.019
 are exposed to injected mass of 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.340
 fuel is dependent on 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.900
 different factors 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.910
 of course from the opening 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.239
 duration but also of the injection quantity 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:05.350
 per unit time of the fuel 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:08.140
 Density and fuel pressure these 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.570
 I only get parameters when I am with 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:15.269
 my sensors corresponding values 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:17.769
 the control unit delivered at the 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.900
 I have direct injection systems 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:23.500
 already a much higher stress 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.709
 the injectors because the bridge of 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.350
 50 to 120 bar are around 10 to 20 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.829
 times higher than the in directly 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:36.130
 Injecting system and installation location 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:38.290
 directly in the cylinder head means one 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.380
 very high thermal load so 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.660
 through cylinder head temperature and for that 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.110
 the valve must be designed and the 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.110
 it is 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:56.100
 the 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:59.430
 image of the fuel jet should be like that 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:02.130
 look that the droplets as possible 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.290
 are fine and optimally with the air 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.570
 can mix 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.100
 why I have a previous one 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.620
 already mentioned 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.780
 if you imagine a big one 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.700
 Ball has a certain surface 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.769
 you can find that in your formula collection 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.590
 if you are interested even formula 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.140
 for that if you imagine that 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.390
 10 cubic centimeters would have this ball as 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.820
 volume then it has an associated 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.520
 surface that you can calculate if 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.210
 this ball in ten single balls 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.310
 divide and also have ten 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.320
 cubic centimeter but the surface of the 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.750
 total surface of the ten individual 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.660
 balls is much larger than this 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.400
 a sphere of equal volume and if 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.890
 100 times that for a thousand times 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.560
 then they will see that through the 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.870
 very fine distribution of the droplets on one 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.260
 immense large surface come and the 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:58.080
 one needs thereby the fuel with the 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.960
 oxygen can react and one 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.380
 as complete as possible combustion 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.200
 can be done 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.810
 That's why we're so fine 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:11.310
 aspire for atomization and for many 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:14.160
 Take action stands for them 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.520
 in the near future a house examination that is 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.590
 yes something everyday in our profession 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.450
 only courage and no fear 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.400
 maybe look again 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.890
 one or the other topic some clips in 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.780
 read this channel again in her 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.100
 maybe ask in your textbook 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.020
 Workshop in your school 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.850
 and then if they are well prepared in the 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.240
 Examination go what is there still 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.240
 go wrong
