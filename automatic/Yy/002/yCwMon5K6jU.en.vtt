00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
the hardest part of the entire learning

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.410 
the hardest part of the entire learning
process<00:00:59.129> for<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.399> trick<00:00:59.609> because<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.180> good

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
process for this trick because a good

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.939 
process for this trick because a good
foot<00:01:00.600> placement<00:01:01.020> leads<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.530> faster

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
foot placement leads to the faster

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.640 
foot placement leads to the faster
rotation<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.609> an<00:01:02.910> increase<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.270> balance<00:01:03.719> when

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
rotation and an increase in balance when

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.840 
rotation and an increase in balance when
I<00:01:04.680> was<00:01:04.830> first<00:01:04.979> learning<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.400> straight<00:01:05.640> I

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
I was first learning the straight I

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.399 
I was first learning the straight I
thought<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.210> myself<00:01:06.330> okay<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.229> like<00:01:07.380> a

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
thought to myself okay this is like a

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.590 
thought to myself okay this is like a
backside<00:01:07.770> Ollie<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.460> I'll<00:01:08.700> place<00:01:09.090> my<00:01:09.119> feet<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
backside Ollie so I'll place my feet the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.510 
backside Ollie so I'll place my feet the
same<00:01:09.810> way<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.260> wasn't<00:01:10.890> sure<00:01:11.010> if<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.220> leading

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
same way I wasn't sure if the leading

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.520 
same way I wasn't sure if the leading
foot<00:01:11.729> was<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> back<00:01:12.299> foot<00:01:12.600> or<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.080> front<00:01:13.290> foot

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
foot was the back foot or the front foot

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.800 
foot was the back foot or the front foot
so<00:01:14.250> here's<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.490> little<00:01:14.729> tip<00:01:14.880> when<00:01:15.360> facing<00:01:15.720> this

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
so here's a little tip when facing this

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.690 
so here's a little tip when facing this
problem<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:16.380> just<00:01:16.530> look<00:01:16.890> at<00:01:17.009> my<00:01:17.100> board<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.520> try

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
problem I just look at my board and try

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.460 
problem I just look at my board and try
to<00:01:17.759> make<00:01:17.939> sense<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.570> know<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.290> if<00:01:19.380> I

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
to make sense of it I know that if I

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.350 
to make sense of it I know that if I
place<00:01:19.680> my<00:01:19.830> front<00:01:20.100> foot<00:01:20.159> off<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.640> side<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.210> will

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
place my front foot off the side it will

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.179 
place my front foot off the side it will
most<00:01:21.540> likely<00:01:21.570> flip<00:01:22.049> but<00:01:22.590> if<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.740> place<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.100> in

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
most likely flip but if I place it in

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.190 
most likely flip but if I place it in
the<00:01:23.250> middle<00:01:23.549> my<00:01:23.909> foot<00:01:24.119> comes<00:01:24.360> off<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.840> was<00:01:25.170> like

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
the middle my foot comes off I was like

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.289 
the middle my foot comes off I was like
fuck<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.860> front<00:01:26.100> foot<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.700> focused<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.180> how

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
fuck you front foot and I focused on how

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.940 
fuck you front foot and I focused on how
to<00:01:27.360> throw<00:01:27.570> my<00:01:27.720> back<00:01:27.900> foot<00:01:28.140> keeping<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.799> mind

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
to throw my back foot keeping in mind

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.440 
to throw my back foot keeping in mind
that<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.159> would<00:01:29.250> use<00:01:29.369> my<00:01:29.400> front<00:01:29.700> foot<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:30.329> help

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
that I would use my front foot to help

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.969 
that I would use my front foot to help
stabilize<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.140> have<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.350> board<00:01:31.560> under<00:01:31.860> my

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
stabilize and have the board under my

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.830 
stabilize and have the board under my
feet<00:01:32.159> at<00:01:32.310> all<00:01:32.400> time<00:01:32.640> during<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.909> rotation<00:01:33.390> at

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
feet at all time during the rotation at

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.450 
feet at all time during the rotation at
that<00:01:34.020> point<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.439> was<00:01:34.650> still<00:01:34.829> unsure<00:01:35.009> where<00:01:35.369> to

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
that point I was still unsure where to

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.950 
that point I was still unsure where to
place<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.820> on<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.000> board<00:01:36.180> but<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.630> thought<00:01:36.840> it

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
place it on the board but I thought it

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.179 
place it on the board but I thought it
would<00:01:37.049> be<00:01:37.140> similar<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.799> backside

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
would be similar to the backside

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.460 
would be similar to the backside
backspin<00:01:38.610> okay<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:39.600> by<00:01:39.840> then<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.020> knew<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.380> my

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
backspin okay so by then I knew that my

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.140 
backspin okay so by then I knew that my
back<00:01:40.650> foot<00:01:40.860> was<00:01:41.040> my<00:01:41.159> leading<00:01:41.369> foot<00:01:41.670> but

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
back foot was my leading foot but

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.240 
back foot was my leading foot but
instead<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.689> had<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.960> do<00:01:43.079> backside<00:01:43.590> 360

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
instead it had to do backside 360

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.469 
instead it had to do backside 360
instead<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.729> backside<00:01:45.090> ollie

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
instead of a backside ollie

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.450 
instead of a backside ollie
in<00:01:45.600> order<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.899> have<00:01:46.020> my<00:01:46.200> board<00:01:46.439> rotate<00:01:46.860> fully<00:01:47.189> I

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
in order to have my board rotate fully I

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.280 
in order to have my board rotate fully I
decided<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.180> have<00:01:48.299> my<00:01:48.420> toes<00:01:48.659> hanging<00:01:48.930> out<00:01:49.140> in

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
decided to have my toes hanging out in

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.600 
decided to have my toes hanging out in
the<00:01:49.350> front<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.710> board<00:01:49.890> in<00:01:50.189> order<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.490> have

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
the front of the board in order to have

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.399 
the front of the board in order to have
enough<00:01:50.790> strength<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.180> throw<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.899> helped

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
enough strength to throw it it helped

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.990 
enough strength to throw it it helped
but<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.740> was<00:01:52.890> still<00:01:53.040> lacking<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.460> lot<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.700> control

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
but I was still lacking a lot of control

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.090 
but I was still lacking a lot of control
I<00:01:54.270> noticed<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.020> if<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.170> had<00:01:55.320> both<00:01:55.530> feet<00:01:55.829> facing

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
I noticed that if I had both feet facing

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.830 
I noticed that if I had both feet facing
in<00:01:56.340> front<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.670> me<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.180> looked<00:01:57.479> at<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.689> nose

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
in front of me and I looked at the nose

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.780 
in front of me and I looked at the nose
of<00:01:57.869> my<00:01:58.020> board<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.890> allowed<00:01:59.189> me<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.430> throw<00:01:59.640> my

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
of my board it allowed me to throw my

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.670 
of my board it allowed me to throw my
shoulders<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.750> board<00:02:00.990> not<00:02:01.140> only<00:02:01.200> popped

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
shoulders and the board not only popped

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.010 
shoulders and the board not only popped
it<00:02:01.950> followed<00:02:02.310> my<00:02:02.460> movement<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.659> now<00:02:03.840> knew

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
it followed my movement so I now knew

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.240 
it followed my movement so I now knew
for<00:02:04.200> sure<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.380> my<00:02:04.590> back<00:02:04.799> foot<00:02:04.979> was<00:02:05.130> my

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
for sure that my back foot was my

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.649 
for sure that my back foot was my
leading<00:02:05.549> foot<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.909> mean<00:02:06.149> look<00:02:06.270> at<00:02:06.329> my<00:02:06.420> front

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
leading foot I mean look at my front

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.059 
leading foot I mean look at my front
foot<00:02:06.719> it's<00:02:07.020> not<00:02:07.170> even<00:02:07.320> on<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.500> board<00:02:07.619> half<00:02:07.890> of

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
foot it's not even on the board half of

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.070 
foot it's not even on the board half of
the<00:02:08.160> time<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:09.360> now<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.569> I've<00:02:09.720> given<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:10.020> a

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
the time so now that I've given you a

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.510 
the time so now that I've given you a
basic<00:02:10.470> idea<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.920> trick<00:02:11.099> you're<00:02:11.250> dealing

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
basic idea of the trick you're dealing

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.430 
basic idea of the trick you're dealing
with<00:02:11.550> it's<00:02:11.970> time<00:02:12.120> for<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.360> guys<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.540> learn<00:02:12.810> it

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
with it's time for you guys to learn it

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.990 
with it's time for you guys to learn it
so<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.620> first<00:02:13.860> step<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.130> recommend<00:02:14.550> is<00:02:14.760> this

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
so the first step I recommend is this

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.530 
so the first step I recommend is this
one<00:02:15.590> as<00:02:16.610> you<00:02:17.610> can<00:02:17.760> see<00:02:17.880> there's<00:02:18.120> no<00:02:18.210> popping

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
one as you can see there's no popping

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.730 
one as you can see there's no popping
involved<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:19.110> doesn't<00:02:19.440> make<00:02:19.530> like<00:02:19.710> a

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
involved that doesn't make like a

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.500 
involved that doesn't make like a
backside<00:02:20.070> 360<00:02:20.610> hell<00:02:20.880> you<00:02:21.030> look<00:02:21.150> like<00:02:21.270> freakin

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
have to be one with the board bro what I

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.190 
have to be one with the board bro what I
mean<00:02:32.790> by<00:02:32.910> that<00:02:33.090> is<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:33.600> want<00:02:33.630> your<00:02:33.900> body<00:02:34.050> to

mean by that is you want your body to

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.990 
mean by that is you want your body to
lead<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.560> board<00:02:34.770> and<00:02:34.980> not<00:02:35.130> vice-versa

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
lead the board and not vice-versa

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.910 
lead the board and not vice-versa
the<00:02:36.510> easiest<00:02:36.870> way<00:02:37.020> to<00:02:37.050> do<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.350> is<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:37.710> look<00:02:37.800> at

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
the easiest way to do that is to look at

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.440 
the easiest way to do that is to look at
the<00:02:38.010> front<00:02:38.190> of<00:02:38.250> your<00:02:38.340> board<00:02:38.550> keep<00:02:39.180> your<00:02:39.300> back

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
the front of your board keep your back

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.670 
the front of your board keep your back
as<00:02:39.480> straight<00:02:39.660> as<00:02:39.930> possible<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.470> have<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.590> better

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
as straight as possible to have a better

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.650
