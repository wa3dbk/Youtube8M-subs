00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.840
 good in general every coffee is a 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:18.220
 different story that goes that has 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:21.039
 history and that there is narrative and that there 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.750
 fantasy and myth and legend in the cafe 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.780
 Hi, I'm Jesus Salazar 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.300
 I am coffee or logo 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.720
 and I will have the pleasure to share five 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.030
 ways to make yourself a coffee tailored 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.730
 you can not generalize or talk about 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.190
 absolute form in coffee there are many 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.220
 ways to prepare coffee many techniques 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.980
 many coffees and each of them should 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.500
 find your particular way of 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.720
 prepare and enjoy ourselves we are going to 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.730
 use the mixture of san pedro 'is a 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.450
 mixture 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:58.660
 five varieties this mixture contains 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.270
 typical arabica coffee and caturra bourbon 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.060
 Garnica the world is not going to talk about 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.030
 a mix 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.430
 I should book an experience 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.440
 sensory complex we are going to prepare it from 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.680
 three different ways we are going to do in 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.600
 first place a Japanese siphon is a 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.440
 very spectacular preparation method 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.860
 where there are two flasks found in the 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.950
 flask or lower we deposit the water in 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.890
 the upper material the coffee powder and 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.320
 let's see how, as a result of this, a 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.170
 lighter that applies heat to the flask or 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.450
 lower will amount the water up 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.119
 completely hydrate the tablet 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.670
 coffee generate a movement a bubbling 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.130
 that incorporates the water with the coffee we 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.040
 we assure ourselves a remover of 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.080
 incorporate all the powder with the liquid 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.200
 so that the infusion is complete and 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.190
 finally due to the vacuum 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.800
 remove the lighter 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.450
 we will see the return of the prepared beverage 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.890
 to the flask or lower 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.050
 up the coffee powder 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.470
 since there is a metal filter 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.450
 Coated that prevent the passage of dust 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.810
 of coffee to the inner flask is a 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.600
 coffee that is the one to be seen and I love 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.730
 also because it generates this sense of 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:21.330
 wait, there is nothing better than desire 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:25.110
 satisfied after a wait 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.670
 let's prepare a pemex is a jar 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.580
 glass very aesthetic very cute 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.250
 we will use a metallic filter of a 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.740
 very fine pore that is called cone first 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.590
 we created a coffee bean tablet in 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.740
 where we will do a pre-infusion for 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.860
 facilitate the dilution of solids by 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.960
 the water hot water not boiling and 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.300
 then we will pour the rest of the water 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.150
 Generous way making circles for 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:55.260
 that everything is incorporated all the water touch 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:58.800
 all coffee this way to triangulate 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:02.910
 conical cumex allows oxygenation 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.740
 which will emphasize certain notes of 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.830
 mainly taste the sweetness and 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.140
 acidity finally an aeropress is a 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.140
 way of making coffee that combines the 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.240
 infusion with manual pressure for 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.540
 extraction of the liquid from the drink and 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:22.260
 prepared we use 10 grams of coffee 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.810
 medium milled let's allow it to 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.150
 a contact for three minutes of 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.060
 Water 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.939
 the pill and this manual pressure forced 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.060
 the passage of more solids than those 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:36.950
 naturally they would go to the rate just for 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.769
 effect of gravity then we have 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.799
 a rate that is the result of a filter 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:45.409
 that is to say a clean rate a rate with 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:48.470
 little body and stands out a lot especially 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:51.099
 the acidity we have a classic mocha 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.709
 very express Italian we call express 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:57.470
 because he intends to prepare in 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:01.790
 very little time very quickly a 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:05.150
 intense drink a body full of flavor 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.340
 intense franc flavors predominates the 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.290
 bitterness fundamentally because the water 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.290
 reaches to boil and is several minutes 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.650
 in contact with coffee powder finely 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.260
 ground and the recommendation is always no 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.989
 let once the mouth is ready 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.729
 stay a long time on fire once 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.240
 that is ready is ready and you have to 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:28.910
 serve that cup the basic principle of 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.340
 Hoya coffee is the direct contact of the 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.729
 coffee with water coffee pot is a 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.849
 coffee 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:37.189
 it takes several minutes to prepare for 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:39.650
 So this intimate coexistence 

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:43.699
 between hot water and dust 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:46.129
 finely ground coffee will inform us 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:47.809
 much more intense flavors are going to 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:50.870
 lose all the flavors and aromas 

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:53.029
 floral herbal frutes of guests 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.490
 of the coffee we are going to go for the aromas 

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:58.249
 more intense flavors is not coincidence 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:02.389
 which is sweet this drink from its 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:04.759
 preparation but only so is it real 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:06.710
 have a cup integrates a cup that 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:09.789
 tells a story and a cup that 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.740
 recognize the work of each of the 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:15.249
 people that were on their own 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.249
 path
