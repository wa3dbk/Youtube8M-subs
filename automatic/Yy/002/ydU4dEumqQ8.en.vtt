00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.810
 Happy new year and here comes 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.139
 even the next farmer he goes 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:12.000
 welcome to the new year 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:15.059
 Today we will try our chat 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.890
 mode off and we will be here 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.060
 maximum late that we could today 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:26.039
 maybe use 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:28.410
 and we start the game that way 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.330
 today we will probably 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.390
 load woodchips because the heating 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:39.270
 is empty and there it comes 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:41.309
 missionary ok, all right 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.829
 well for the volume will be 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.070
 probably worry about this shovel 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.750
 she looks big enough and then 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.390
 we still take two followers 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.210
 and then the volume should be fine 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.739
 it will be enough for us the next few 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:05.460
 weeks of warm bude have it then 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:07.530
 Here we go a little harder 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.310
 gloves team once we need out 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.310
 we do not drive 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:26.270
 with front loader activate well then 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.490
 Let's hang on the new shovel 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.120
 I'm curious if the show big 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:35.570
 The scoop is new and there 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.790
 should probably heaped 17 cubic meters 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.110
 go in 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.930
 let's see if that's not too much 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.090
 promised but already looks 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.160
 it looks like the shovel is at it 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.160
 next door because it would fit in completely 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:56.180
 So shovel and a fork I have too 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:59.290
 already fooled then we hang out 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.290
 our trailer leyen 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:08.050
 okay it looks like our speed is 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.040
 still off 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.810
 I also have to push the buttons through 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.450
 problem if you are not sure anymore 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.860
 which button was but he would have to 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.770
 say five or something I try that 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:23.840
 right now we hang this 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:26.470
 ding times just slow down here 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.470
 to solve 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.300
 print 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.700
 the whole other cable completely 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.400
 Overvalued that we leave now 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.000
 it only costs time unnecessarily is the money 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.660
 and we do not have that 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.660
 So let's go 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.780
 so now you have to try by 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:05.920
 f1 it was not f2 neither on three 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:09.310
 not good 4 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:14.200
 but that is fast here I can 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:22.260
 yes hardly steer who I nozzle in 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:22.260
 step by step and there we would be 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.920
 so now we have to rent our first 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:35.170
 uncover there is such a nice flowing 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:37.110
 over it so our tools lay alike 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.810
 take a look 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.510
 we women then again later 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.140
 clean and then we can 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:50.380
 actually start right now 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:56.530
 with the cover only times the tire away 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:58.330
 and then I have to look at the 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.780
 plane look she actually saw 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.970
 very good, but I think there is still 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.430
 a second below this time to end 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.220
 I have to look like I'm down this 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.240
 I would actually have to get that 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:16.590
 create that should not be a problem 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:26.140
 leaving a thing still gone and then 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:28.670
 started covering mode it believes 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:32.200
 very good here 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.200
 promotion not so bad 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:40.100
 because of that now faster I have too 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.680
 bit of problems with the planner 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:46.450
 horrible and certainly not as good 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.450
 its it's going on there 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.260
 but now it's all in the knot 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:59.330
 Damn that seems real to me 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.550
 you are completely missing this is possible 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.070
 Not 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:06.610
 hackl the last life already gone that 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.470
 This can not be true 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.380
 human children there I have to the whole 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.790
 shit play again here 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:17.110
 I'll do that in the morning I have now 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.110
 really no open search
