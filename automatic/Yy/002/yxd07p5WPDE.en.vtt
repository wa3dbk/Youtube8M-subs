00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
world now if you're in creative like so

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.680 
world now if you're in creative like so
they're<00:01:02.340> not<00:01:02.460> gonna<00:01:02.579> do<00:01:02.760> anything<00:01:03.149> but<00:01:03.539> it's

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
they're not gonna do anything but it's

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.149 
they're not gonna do anything but it's
really<00:01:03.840> cool<00:01:04.110> because<00:01:04.350> if<00:01:04.589> they<00:01:04.739> manage<00:01:05.100> to

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
really cool because if they manage to

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.219 
really cool because if they manage to
die<00:01:05.519> they<00:01:05.820> sometimes<00:01:06.210> have<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.720> chance<00:01:07.049> of

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229

turning<00:01:07.409> into<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.799> potato<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.520> thought<00:01:08.670> that

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
turning into a potato so I thought that

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.160 
turning into a potato so I thought that
was<00:01:08.880> kind<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.090> funny<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.869> little<00:01:10.080> bit

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
was kind of funny and a little bit

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.510 
was kind of funny and a little bit

this<00:01:16.830> video<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.310> if<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.490> wanna<00:01:17.670> want<00:01:18.330> to

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
this video to that if you wanna want to

this video to that if you wanna want to
go<00:01:18.450> see<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.689> but<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.650> kind<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.860> what<00:01:19.979> it

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
go see that but this is kind of what it

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.590 
go see that but this is kind of what it
looks<00:01:20.100> like<00:01:20.400> when<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.700> kill<00:01:20.939> them<00:01:21.030> nothing

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
looks like when you kill them nothing

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.270 
looks like when you kill them nothing
really<00:01:21.750> happens<00:01:22.170> except<00:01:22.530> if<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.770> get<00:01:23.009> that

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
really happens except if you get that

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.460 
really happens except if you get that
low<00:01:23.909> chance<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.570> turning<00:01:24.869> into<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.140> potato

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
low chance of it turning into a potato

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.679 
low chance of it turning into a potato
so<00:01:25.710> there<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.950> go<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.610> drops<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.030> potato<00:01:27.360> and

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
so there you go it drops a potato and

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.450 
so there you go it drops a potato and
kind<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.170> turns<00:01:28.409> into<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.650> potato<00:01:29.009> at<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.310> same

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
kind of turns into a potato at the same

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.490 
kind of turns into a potato at the same

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
go ahead and put down our squid and see

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.080 
go ahead and put down our squid and see
if<00:02:44.620> he'll<00:02:44.769> move<00:02:44.980> for<00:02:45.280> us<00:02:45.340> I'd<00:02:45.549> be<00:02:45.670> helpful<00:02:46.030> if
