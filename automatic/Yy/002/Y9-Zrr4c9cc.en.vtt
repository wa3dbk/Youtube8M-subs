00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.480
 there are good we all follow them 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.070
 we are when they talk about photo 5 and os 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.510
 I bring this video to teach another 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.699
 peyote's location so that after 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.199
 turn into another and animal line and in 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:17.029
 this case is a peyote that is below 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.949
 of the sea is worth it is in the water so 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.960
 So much you are going to become one of the 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:23.509
 aquatic animal models as much as 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.330
 it can be the dolphin a shark a bitch 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:28.220
 and even an orca I already tell you how you see 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.900
 here on the map is the location is this 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.180
 where the pier where the fair is the 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.130
 Ferris wheel is very easy to find and 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.720
 it's right down there on the right 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.640
 adjust in that corner where you have the 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.440
 cross purple is worth right there is where we 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.970
 we have to throw into the water and one thing 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.560
 very important and you have to choose 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.060
 franklin is worth it unless you have 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.280
 trained to another character or anyone 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.100
 of the stars be got to michael 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.390
 or a clover but I tell you what I am 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.220
 is that you go with a fraction because it's the 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.260
 that makes me more aquatic breathing 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.300
 you have that's why I 'm going with this 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.860
 character not for anything else but for the 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.930
 who has more breathing is more enduring 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.340
 under water although it is not very difficult 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.510
 and he's very old or nothing but he's 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.610
 next to the pier but I'm telling you 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.930
 if you find it hard to come with this 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.909
 character or because if you are not going to die 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.330
 drowned and another very important thing not 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.310
 do as I do 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.140
 we run over to the people you give yourself there 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.120
 to fuss brown and cohesive police 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.220
 because if it's not going to be very complicated that 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.660
 find the peyote and go to 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.060
 bother the police and I tell you but 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.860
 it 's very easy, I tell you, you come to 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.390
 that at the end of the pier here with our 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.560
 hell is good here of this then it takes 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.150
 follow on either side 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.830
 we go with franklin in this case what 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.770
 che bring my colleague does not bring with you 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.330
 he does not leave the house and with the good bone 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.920
 as you are going to see here we are going to the 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.810
 part of the left of the wharf is worth 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.250
 here we do not go to the next where 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.260
 is the lamp post was legally cut from 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.970
 the lamp is already talking caixa laixa 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.970
 it is exactly you see here we give ourselves the 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.160
 water we are going to the uai good to see you there 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.280
 just down to the left you have to 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.020
 You have a white thing worth 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.430
 is more to the left you see there to the 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.410
 left just above the screen 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.150
 you have a white point as you see here 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.830
 here is the peyote vale is very easy 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.020
 be enters next to some trunks of 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.420
 some sticks of the dock and nothing and here you 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.640
 you give again as advised in 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.770
 another video do not keep deactivating the 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.959
 self-saved if you want to use it 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.300
 again I tell you that it is one 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.340
 use and good here you see that he eats it 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.360
 franklin again come eat it there with 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.420
 its embers 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.340
 the eyes turn red and I tell you that 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.470
 you can convert both as an Orca 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.360
 in a shark as in a dolphin and in 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.850
 this case we get the perth martÃ­ and the 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.450
 beautiful shark hammer very young 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.220
 very very handsome and very handsome god very 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.450
 Currado already tell you that this occurs to you 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.160
 to the industry in putting in the 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.530
 little things is that I already tell you that gives you 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.900
 a little more game and you can leave it 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.610
 I already tell you that you can even go to the 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.280
 beach said come let's go here to the beach 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.260
 so we found some to one swimming 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.090
 once bathing serious we go there what 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.370
 we can attack as is we give the 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.410
 r2 key and we see that there is a 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.480
 movement is like that and there we have been 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.980
 mosquea and I tell you one thing very 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.739
 important that you are going to see it now 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.560
 end of the good video you will see that 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.660
 do not leave the water you do not go do not go away 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.660
 of the water because if you are not going to see what 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.709
 happens the way let's see if 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.480
 we found someone and I tell you there 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.340
 is the location worth it I repeat it here 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.750
 is right at the location it's worth so 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.140
 it is clear to you more or less fair and 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.150
 stuck to the side of the dock and let me do 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.340
 that we have seen the launch or seek the 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.750
 peyote and ale so nothing let's see if 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.540
 There is someone on the beach and if not already 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.920
 I say there was something there and I'm telling you 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.540
 to see if you can attack there to flirt 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.769
 you can do it there are a lot of things 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.480
 I already tell you that a 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.819
 dolphin in a killer whale 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.409
 we go there to the beach and 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.420
 I quietly change what style 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:39.450
 have look what style shark have their 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.159
 Very handsome design sign looks very handsome 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.440
 it's pretty well designed it 's very well 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:44.909
 done and now it's very easy ya 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.459
 I say I'll go up other locations 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:49.769
 of peyote as it finds and there will be 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.450
 different animals and good what they 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.830
 he said we see here there is nobody 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.390
 we are approaching that is the full and 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.400
 nobody bathing is now cold the 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.560
 people stay tomorrow well do not do 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.750
 I'm not going to teach this so you can see what 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.959
 what happens if you go out of the water that 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.060
 take if you lose the hallucination and already 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.110
 you can not use it and I tell you here see 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.760
 a pull 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.410
 so nothing kids like the video 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.410
 and see you in the next goodbye
