of<00:00:36.059> boat<00:00:36.300> owners<00:00:36.660> will<00:00:36.870> hire<00:00:37.170> diving<00:00:37.860> services

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
of boat owners will hire diving services

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.119

to<00:00:39.450> get<00:00:39.960> into<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.290> water<00:00:40.500> waters<00:00:40.860> pretty<00:00:41.010> cold

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
to get into the water waters pretty cold

here<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.610> Pacific<00:00:42.000> Ocean<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.559> they<00:00:43.559> will

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
here in the Pacific Ocean and they will

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.029 
here in the Pacific Ocean and they will
scrub<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:45.300> bottoms<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:46.020> their<00:00:46.500> boats<00:00:46.770> and

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
scrub the bottoms of their boats and

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.450 
scrub the bottoms of their boats and
that's<00:00:47.250> because<00:00:47.640> they're<00:00:47.879> using<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.600> hard

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
that's because they're using a hard

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.740 
that's because they're using a hard
bottom<00:00:50.460> paint<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:50.940> need<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.329> do<00:00:51.480> that

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
bottom paint and you need to do that

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.500 
bottom paint and you need to do that
talking<00:00:52.649> about<00:00:52.890> what's<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.640> conventional

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
of the hard bottom paints really go back

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.279 
of the hard bottom paints really go back
to<00:00:58.980> World<00:00:59.370> War<00:00:59.579> 2<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.570> 40s<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.109> the

fouling and the binding system to hold
that<00:01:06.479> together<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:07.080> there's<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.770> color

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
that together and there's a color

that together and there's a color
pigment<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.549> there<00:01:08.729> okay<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> binder<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> type

pigment in there okay a binder is a type
of<00:01:10.439> glue<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.250> I've<00:01:11.340> been<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.729> your<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.420> your

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
of glue and I've been in your in your

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.510 
of glue and I've been in your in your
factory<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.290> Union<00:01:13.590> New<00:01:13.710> Jersey<00:01:14.100> I've<00:01:14.189> seen

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
factory in Union New Jersey I've seen

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.390 
factory in Union New Jersey I've seen
you<00:01:14.760> guys<00:01:14.939> make<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.540> bottom<00:01:16.259> paint<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.920> and

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
you guys make the bottom paint and and

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.580 
you guys make the bottom paint and and
conventional<00:01:18.030> bodies<00:01:18.450> have<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.720> lot<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.200> copper

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
conventional bodies have a lot of copper

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.340 
conventional bodies have a lot of copper
in<00:01:20.250> them<00:01:20.460> why<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.270> well<00:01:21.960> because<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
in them why is that well because the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.050 
in them why is that well because the
binding<00:01:22.770> system<00:01:23.130> John<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.520> actually<00:01:23.670> not<00:01:24.000> that

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
binding system John is actually not that

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.330 
binding system John is actually not that
sophisticated<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.530> copper<00:01:25.860> gets<00:01:26.070> bound

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
sophisticated so the copper gets bound

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.219 
sophisticated so the copper gets bound
within<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.420> that's<00:01:27.780> actually<00:01:28.049> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
within that and that's actually the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.800 
within that and that's actually the
reason<00:01:28.650> why<00:01:28.799> often<00:01:29.040> times<00:01:29.460> boat<00:01:30.329> owners<00:01:30.630> will

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
reason why often times boat owners will

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.719 
reason why often times boat owners will
have<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:30.960> diver<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.619> scrub<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.280> bottom<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.670> the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
have a diver to scrub the bottom of the

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.100 
have a diver to scrub the bottom of the
boat<00:01:32.880> they<00:01:33.030> want<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.299> get<00:01:33.420> rid<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.810> dead

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
boat they want to get rid of that dead

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.060 
boat they want to get rid of that dead
spent<00:01:34.740> layer<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.310> film<00:01:35.610> so<00:01:35.759> they<00:01:35.880> expose<00:01:36.240> fresh

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
spent layer of film so they expose fresh

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.109 
spent layer of film so they expose fresh
it's<00:01:38.070> not<00:01:38.189> necessarily<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.000> most

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
it's not necessarily the most

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.940 
it's not necessarily the most
sophisticated<00:01:39.450> way<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.020> formulate<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.590> bottom

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
sophisticated way to formulate a bottom

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.889 
sophisticated way to formulate a bottom
paint<00:01:41.130> but<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.579> does<00:01:41.700> prevent<00:01:41.970> fouling<00:01:42.240> okay

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
paint but it does prevent fouling okay

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.039 
paint but it does prevent fouling okay
back<00:01:43.200> in<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.560> 40s<00:01:44.149> kind<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.240> think<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.869> way

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
back in the 40s kind of think of the way

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.810 
back in the 40s kind of think of the way
people<00:01:46.439> were<00:01:46.560> making<00:01:46.740> phone<00:01:47.070> calls<00:01:47.130> back<00:01:47.549> then

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
people were making phone calls back then

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.270 
people were making phone calls back then
versus<00:01:48.780> today<00:01:49.259> we<00:01:49.470> have<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:49.770> cell<00:01:50.040> phone

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
versus today we have this cell phone

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.550 
versus today we have this cell phone
technology<00:01:50.630> okay<00:01:51.659> where<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.229> can<00:01:52.380> take

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
technology okay where you can take

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.280 
technology okay where you can take
pictures<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.670> can<00:01:53.850> have<00:01:54.030> your<00:01:54.240> music<00:01:54.450> and

pictures and you can have your music and

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.889 
pictures and you can have your music and
everything<00:01:55.619> else<00:01:55.860> technology<00:01:56.820> has<00:01:57.030> you're

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
everything else technology has you're

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.539 
everything else technology has you're
still<00:01:58.140> making<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.439> phone<00:01:58.740> call<00:01:59.009> but<00:01:59.189> technology

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
still making a phone call but technology

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.539 
still making a phone call but technology
has<00:01:59.850> really<00:02:00.479> advanced<00:02:01.259> here<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:02.070> same<00:02:02.310> things

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
has really advanced here the same things

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.340 
has really advanced here the same things
happened<00:02:02.969> in<00:02:03.060> bonnet<00:02:03.450> paint<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.780> lot<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:04.079> people

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
happened in bonnet paint a lot of people

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.920 
happened in bonnet paint a lot of people
are<00:02:04.439> real<00:02:04.619> stubborn<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:06.090> it's<00:02:06.630> just

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
are real stubborn and and it's just

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.260 
are real stubborn and and it's just
because<00:02:07.200> they<00:02:07.350> don't<00:02:07.619> know<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.640> advantages

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
because they don't know the advantages

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.080 
because they don't know the advantages
of<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.780> softer<00:02:10.379> of<00:02:10.560> blade<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.220> bottom<00:02:11.670> paints

of the softer of blade of bottom paints

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.670 
of the softer of blade of bottom paints
and<00:02:12.270> I<00:02:12.330> see<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.569> we<00:02:12.690> have<00:02:12.840> some<00:02:13.050> here

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
and I see that we have some here

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.559 
bit ablative bottom hey John are meant
to<00:02:18.480> take<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:19.049> lower<00:02:19.469> amount<00:02:20.099> of<00:02:20.489> copper<00:02:20.909> and<00:02:21.030> put

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
to take a lower amount of copper and put

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.050 
to take a lower amount of copper and put
it<00:02:21.689> in<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:22.159> binding<00:02:23.159> system<00:02:23.549> that<00:02:23.670> holds<00:02:23.819> it

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
it in a binding system that holds it

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.880 
it in a binding system that holds it
together<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.569> washes<00:02:25.079> away<00:02:25.349> as<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.709> boat

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
together and washes away as the boat

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:26.809 
together and washes away as the boat
goes<00:02:26.099> through<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.459> water

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
goes through the water

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.160 
goes through the water
okay<00:02:27.000> well<00:02:27.180> wait<00:02:27.329> a<00:02:27.390> minute<00:02:27.659> if<00:02:27.780> if<00:02:27.930> we're

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
okay well wait a minute if if we're

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.920 
okay well wait a minute if if we're
losing<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:28.650> copper<00:02:29.069> are<00:02:29.250> we<00:02:29.489> losing<00:02:29.930> the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
losing the copper are we losing the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.990 
losing the copper are we losing the
working<00:02:31.409> power<00:02:31.650> actually<00:02:32.489> John<00:02:32.760> you're

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
working power actually John you're

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.420 
working power actually John you're
getting<00:02:33.420> more<00:02:33.750> copper<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.709> surface<00:02:35.159> in<00:02:35.310> an

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
getting more copper to the surface in an

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.280 
getting more copper to the surface in an
effective<00:02:35.939> way<00:02:35.969> because<00:02:36.629> you're<00:02:37.019> washing

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
effective way because you're washing

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.009 
effective way because you're washing
away<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.920> old<00:02:38.129> dead<00:02:38.489> spent<00:02:39.090> paint<00:02:39.420> film<00:02:39.689> so

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
away the old dead spent paint film so

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.020 
away the old dead spent paint film so
even<00:02:40.409> though<00:02:40.530> there's<00:02:40.739> less<00:02:40.980> copper<00:02:41.489> it's

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
even though there's less copper it's

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.479 
even though there's less copper it's
more<00:02:42.510> effective<00:02:42.930> that's<00:02:43.500> correct<00:02:43.769> it's<00:02:44.250> much

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
more effective that's correct it's much

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.339 
more effective that's correct it's much
like<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.700> cold<00:02:45.030> capsule<00:02:45.569> where<00:02:45.959> it<00:02:46.049> releases

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
like a cold capsule where it releases

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.259 
like a cold capsule where it releases
just<00:02:46.799> enough<00:02:47.129> each<00:02:47.400> day<00:02:47.609> to<00:02:47.700> prevent<00:02:48.090> fouling

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
just enough each day to prevent fouling

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.940 
just enough each day to prevent fouling
and<00:02:48.659> that's<00:02:48.900> in<00:02:49.049> the<00:02:49.139> technology<00:02:49.769> of<00:02:49.799> the

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
and that's in the technology of the

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:50.899 
and that's in the technology of the
paint<00:02:50.189> okay

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
paint okay

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.259 
paint okay
now<00:02:51.180> I've<00:02:51.540> heard<00:02:52.049> that<00:02:52.519> the<00:02:53.519> conventional

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
now I've heard that the conventional

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.259 
now I've heard that the conventional
hard<00:02:54.659> bottom<00:02:54.930> paints<00:02:55.530> are<00:02:56.489> faster<00:02:57.090> in<00:02:57.180> the

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
hard bottom paints are faster in the

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.559 
hard bottom paints are faster in the
water<00:02:57.299> they<00:02:58.019> give<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.379> more<00:02:58.680> speed<00:02:59.159> and<00:02:59.569> less

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
water they give you more speed and less

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.780 
water they give you more speed and less
fuel<00:03:00.780> burn<00:03:01.109> is<00:03:01.680> that<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.069> case<00:03:02.189> that's<00:03:02.549> not

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
fuel burn is that the case that's not

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.520 
fuel burn is that the case that's not

true John actually because what happens

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.080 
true John actually because what happens
with<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.769> hard<00:03:04.950> bottom<00:03:05.219> paints<00:03:05.579> they<00:03:05.909> get

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
with the hard bottom paints they get

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.819 
with the hard bottom paints they get
brittle<00:03:06.450> if<00:03:06.599> a<00:03:06.930> boat<00:03:07.079> owner<00:03:07.379> were<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.560> own<00:03:07.799> a

look<00:03:18.090> at<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.239> bottom<00:03:18.389> of<00:03:18.599> a<00:03:18.720> boat<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.019> see

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169 
look at the bottom of a boat and see

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:21.140 
look at the bottom of a boat and see
paint<00:03:19.440> chips<00:03:19.739> that<00:03:20.250> come<00:03:20.459> off<00:03:20.639> at<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:20.849> bottom

of that may just apply more paint over
the<00:03:23.340> reality<00:03:23.849> is<00:03:23.970> John<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.359> bottom<00:03:24.629> is

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
the reality is John the bottom is

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.449 
the reality is John the bottom is
actually<00:03:24.840> getting<00:03:25.199> more<00:03:25.500> rough<00:03:25.739> additionally

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
actually getting more rough additionally

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.399 
actually getting more rough additionally
that<00:03:26.609> hard<00:03:26.940> binding<00:03:27.419> system<00:03:27.780> is<00:03:27.930> still<00:03:28.169> there

that hard binding system is still there

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:30.349 
that hard binding system is still there
but<00:03:28.829> the<00:03:28.889> copper<00:03:29.280> has<00:03:29.459> come<00:03:29.699> out<00:03:29.849> if<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.180> look

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
but the copper has come out if you look

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.149 
but the copper has come out if you look
at<00:03:30.540> that<00:03:30.659> under<00:03:30.810> microscope<00:03:31.379> you'd<00:03:31.590> see<00:03:31.829> Swiss

vessel<00:04:48.280> moving<00:04:48.520> constantly<00:04:48.760> okay<00:04:49.450> so<00:04:49.510> we

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
vessel moving constantly okay so we

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.830 
vessel moving constantly okay so we
don't<00:04:50.110> have<00:04:50.320> to<00:04:50.560> spend<00:04:51.430> money<00:04:51.670> to<00:04:51.820> grind<00:04:52.660> it

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
don't have to spend money to grind it

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.040 
don't have to spend money to grind it
off<00:04:52.990> it<00:04:53.650> wears<00:04:54.070> off<00:04:54.370> correct<00:04:54.970> it<00:04:55.300> is<00:04:55.690> more

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
off it wears off correct it is more

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.720 
off it wears off correct it is more
effective<00:04:56.560> we<00:04:56.740> don't<00:04:56.920> have<00:04:57.070> to<00:04:57.160> spend<00:04:57.400> the<00:04:57.550> big

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
effective we don't have to spend the big

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.600 
effective we don't have to spend the big
money<00:04:57.970> on<00:04:58.060> all<00:04:58.480> the<00:04:58.690> huge<00:04:59.620> amounts<00:04:59.980> of<00:05:00.070> copper

money on all the huge amounts of copper

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.340 
money on all the huge amounts of copper
because<00:05:01.030> it's<00:05:01.360> a<00:05:01.450> more<00:05:01.630> effective<00:05:02.020> way<00:05:02.290> to

because it's a more effective way to

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.610 
because it's a more effective way to

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
deliver copper to the surface okay we're

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.320 
deliver copper to the surface okay we're

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
gonna go faster we're going to spend

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.290 
gonna go faster we're going to spend
less<00:05:07.420> money<00:05:07.570> on<00:05:07.930> fuel<00:05:08.380> and<00:05:08.710> you<00:05:09.700> don't<00:05:09.970> need<00:05:10.180> to
