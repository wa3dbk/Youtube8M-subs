just<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.270> glint<00:02:03.630> from<00:02:03.960> across<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.890> room<00:02:05.040> which

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
just a glint from across the room which

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.040 
just a glint from across the room which
I

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
I

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.920 
I
silly<00:02:06.320> love<00:02:06.530> I<00:02:06.860> staggered<00:02:07.820> some<00:02:08.030> ornaments<00:02:08.510> up

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.700 
silly love I staggered some ornaments up
in<00:02:09.110> there<00:02:09.290> again<00:02:10.300> nothing<00:02:11.300> too<00:02:11.690> garish<00:02:12.140> just

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
in there again nothing too garish just

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.620 
in there again nothing too garish just
kind<00:02:13.400> of<00:02:13.460> blends<00:02:13.730> beautifully<00:02:14.000> with<00:02:14.360> the

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
kind of blends beautifully with the

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.540 
kind of blends beautifully with the
berries<00:02:14.990> I<00:02:15.170> went<00:02:15.380> more<00:02:15.620> with<00:02:15.830> a<00:02:15.860> of<00:02:16.400> a

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
berries I went more with a of a

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.480 
berries I went more with a of a
cranberry<00:02:16.940> look<00:02:17.540> on<00:02:17.810> this<00:02:18.440> chandelier<00:02:18.710> but

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
cranberry look on this chandelier but

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.700 
cranberry look on this chandelier but
when<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:19.730> walk<00:02:20.000> in<00:02:20.240> my<00:02:20.480> front<00:02:20.750> door<00:02:21.020> and<00:02:21.050> pan

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
when you walk in my front door and pan

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.940 
when you walk in my front door and pan
across<00:02:21.830> my<00:02:22.190> foyer<00:02:22.490> you<00:02:23.210> see<00:02:23.480> this<00:02:24.320> chandelier

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
across my foyer you see this chandelier

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.930 
across my foyer you see this chandelier
and<00:02:25.160> so<00:02:25.340> I<00:02:25.370> wanted<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:26.150> I<00:02:27.370> want<00:02:28.370> it<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.730> look

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
and so I wanted it to I want it to look

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.300 
and so I wanted it to I want it to look
nice<00:02:29.750> but<00:02:29.810> without<00:02:30.560> being<00:02:30.830> too<00:02:31.100> too

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
nice but without being too too

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.400 
nice but without being too too
overwhelming<00:02:32.120> so<00:02:32.630> I<00:02:32.660> think<00:02:32.780> it's<00:02:33.020> perfect<00:02:33.380> for

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
overwhelming so I think it's perfect for

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.530 
overwhelming so I think it's perfect for
the<00:02:33.620> kitchen<00:02:34.010> I<00:02:34.160> added<00:02:34.340> some<00:02:34.520> fruits<00:02:35.030> a<00:02:35.270> little

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
the kitchen I added some fruits a little

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.020 
the kitchen I added some fruits a little
bit<00:02:35.660> of<00:02:35.780> gilding<00:02:36.340> some<00:02:37.340> points<00:02:37.670> Etta's

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
bit of gilding some points Etta's

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.180 
bit of gilding some points Etta's
