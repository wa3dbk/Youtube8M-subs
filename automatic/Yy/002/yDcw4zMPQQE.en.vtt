00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.170 
back luckily this map smaller i can get
to<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.709> other<00:03:28.799> side<00:03:28.980> of<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.129> map<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.579> not<00:03:29.940> too

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
to the other side of the map and not too

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.349 
to the other side of the map and not too
much<00:03:30.389> time<00:03:30.690> but<00:03:31.590> other<00:03:31.949> maps<00:03:32.220> it's<00:03:32.669> even<00:03:33.090> more

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
much time but other maps it's even more

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.750 
much time but other maps it's even more
frustrating<00:03:34.019> because<00:03:34.440> it<00:03:34.949> could<00:03:35.430> be<00:03:35.519> a<00:03:35.549> big

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
frustrating because it could be a big

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.800 
frustrating because it could be a big
map<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:36.180> have<00:03:36.299> to<00:03:36.359> run<00:03:36.510> all<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.780> way

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
map and you have to run all the way

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.319 
map and you have to run all the way
across<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.919> entire<00:03:38.519> map<00:03:38.730> could<00:03:38.879> take<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.060> lot

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
across the entire map could take a lot

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:40.819 
across the entire map could take a lot
of<00:03:39.359> time<00:03:39.480> I<00:03:39.629> mean<00:03:39.959> that's<00:03:40.049> a<00:03:40.230> portion<00:03:40.680> of<00:03:40.709> the

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
of time I mean that's a portion of the

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.710 
of time I mean that's a portion of the
game<00:03:41.010> you're<00:03:41.220> gonna<00:03:41.340> you're<00:03:42.150> going<00:03:42.359> to<00:03:42.419> not<00:03:42.569> be

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
game you're gonna you're going to not be

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.770 
game you're gonna you're going to not be

getting any kills now my teammate I

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.710 
getting any kills now my teammate I
popped<00:03:46.319> a<00:03:46.440> couple<00:03:46.590> of<00:03:46.769> these<00:03:46.859> hats<00:03:47.099> already

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
kidding anyway so he's got the Warthog

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.869 
kidding anyway so he's got the Warthog
up<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:04.109> it's<00:04:04.739> just<00:04:04.829> dropping<00:04:05.400> bombs<00:04:05.549> on

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
up and it's just dropping bombs on

up and it's just dropping bombs on
people<00:04:06.379> those<00:04:07.379> are<00:04:07.500> all<00:04:07.590> kills<00:04:07.859> at<00:04:08.040> my<00:04:08.159> dogs<00:04:08.400> or

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:08.699 
people those are all kills at my dogs or

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:12.080 
people those are all kills at my dogs or
swarm<00:04:08.940> could<00:04:09.150> be<00:04:09.269> getting<00:04:09.479> but<00:04:10.819> sucks<00:04:11.819> up<00:04:11.970> the

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
swarm could be getting but sucks up the

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.860 
swarm could be getting but sucks up the
swarm<00:04:12.359> actually<00:04:12.810> has<00:04:12.989> less<00:04:13.530> waves<00:04:13.829> or<00:04:14.099> a

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
swarm actually has less waves or a

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.180 
swarm actually has less waves or a
extended<00:04:15.870> period<00:04:16.199> of<00:04:16.229> time<00:04:16.320> between<00:04:16.560> waves<00:04:16.949> so

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
extended period of time between waves so

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.529 
extended period of time between waves so
I<00:04:17.220> get<00:04:17.459> less<00:04:17.639> kills<00:04:17.909> now<00:04:18.090> what's<00:04:18.299> this<00:04:18.359> one

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
I get less kills now what's this one

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:23.510 
I get less kills now what's this one
that<00:04:18.720> I<00:04:18.750> used<00:04:18.930> to<00:04:19.109> but<00:04:20.000> here<00:04:21.000> we<00:04:21.120> go<00:04:22.219> one<00:04:23.219> half

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
that I used to but here we go one half

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.980 
that I used to but here we go one half
of<00:04:23.669> the<00:04:23.789> game<00:04:24.030> or

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
of the game or

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.189 
of the game or
first<00:04:25.259> side<00:04:25.560> potentially<00:04:26.400> one<00:04:26.550> half<00:04:26.870> 73<00:04:27.870> and

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
first side potentially one half 73 and

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.999 
first side potentially one half 73 and
oh<00:04:28.520> pretty<00:04:29.520> damn<00:04:29.699> good<00:04:30.650> like<00:04:31.650> I<00:04:31.740> said<00:04:31.860> I<00:04:31.949> don't

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 
oh pretty damn good like I said I don't

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.120 
oh pretty damn good like I said I don't
know<00:04:32.160> that's<00:04:32.669> record<00:04:33.030> or<00:04:33.509> whatever<00:04:33.810> but<00:04:34.130> maybe

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
know that's record or whatever but maybe

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.219 
know that's record or whatever but maybe
hopefully<00:04:36.020> so<00:04:37.020> I<00:04:37.530> go<00:04:38.430> for<00:04:38.669> B<00:04:38.880> I<00:04:39.210> don't<00:04:40.080> know<00:04:40.169> if

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
hopefully so I go for B I don't know if

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.240 
hopefully so I go for B I don't know if
you<00:04:40.319> notice<00:04:40.560> that<00:04:40.590> both<00:04:40.949> times<00:04:41.610> or<00:04:42.060> both<00:04:42.240> sides

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
you notice that both times or both sides

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.700 
you notice that both times or both sides
right<00:04:44.250> off<00:04:44.430> spawn<00:04:44.990> that's<00:04:45.990> not<00:04:46.229> normal<00:04:46.680> for

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
right off spawn that's not normal for

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.499 
right off spawn that's not normal for
people<00:04:47.069> that<00:04:47.160> are<00:04:47.250> like<00:04:47.460> trying<00:04:47.729> to<00:04:47.849> not<00:04:48.060> die

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:48.509 
people that are like trying to not die

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:51.640 
people that are like trying to not die
because<00:04:48.990> b<00:04:49.590> is<00:04:49.740> usually<00:04:50.370> the<00:04:50.520> fucking

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
because b is usually the fucking

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.100 
because b is usually the fucking
hellhole<00:04:52.650> of<00:04:53.250> this<00:04:53.759> match<00:04:54.120> it's<00:04:54.630> usually

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
hellhole of this match it's usually

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.670 
hellhole of this match it's usually
crazy<00:04:55.470> but<00:04:56.280> I<00:04:56.520> succeed<00:04:57.060> and<00:04:57.210> capping<00:04:57.690> it<00:04:57.840> and

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
crazy but I succeed and capping it and

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.870 
crazy but I succeed and capping it and
let<00:04:58.979> me<00:04:59.009> talk<00:04:59.190> a<00:04:59.220> little<00:04:59.400> bit<00:04:59.550> about<00:04:59.699> the

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
let me talk a little bit about the

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.700 
let me talk a little bit about the
strategy<00:05:00.360> of<00:05:00.389> trying<00:05:01.080> to<00:05:01.229> get<00:05:01.349> the<00:05:01.440> maximum

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
strategy of trying to get the maximum

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.450 
strategy of trying to get the maximum
kills<00:05:02.069> again<00:05:02.400> like<00:05:02.639> you<00:05:03.419> need<00:05:03.569> to<00:05:04.009> make<00:05:05.009> the

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
kills again like you need to make the

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.159 
kills again like you need to make the
game<00:05:05.669> last<00:05:05.940> as<00:05:06.210> long<00:05:06.240> as<00:05:06.509> it<00:05:06.599> possibly<00:05:06.720> can

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
game last as long as it possibly can

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.439 
game last as long as it possibly can
meaning<00:05:07.620> the<00:05:07.710> 10<00:05:07.919> minutes<00:05:08.310> that<00:05:08.520> is<00:05:08.550> allotted

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
meaning the 10 minutes that is allotted

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.409 
meaning the 10 minutes that is allotted
but<00:05:10.409> the<00:05:10.530> game<00:05:10.680> will<00:05:10.830> also<00:05:11.220> end<00:05:11.460> at<00:05:11.759> 200

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
but the game will also end at 200

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.290 
but the game will also end at 200
whichever<00:05:12.870> team<00:05:12.930> hits<00:05:13.229> 200<00:05:13.680> first<00:05:13.919> so<00:05:14.280> look<00:05:15.210> at

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
whichever team hits 200 first so look at

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.820 
whichever team hits 200 first so look at
how<00:05:15.360> far<00:05:15.539> ahead<00:05:15.840> were<00:05:16.169> over<00:05:16.409> a<00:05:16.440> hundred<00:05:16.470> points

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
how far ahead were over a hundred points

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.439 
how far ahead were over a hundred points
ahead<00:05:17.009> right<00:05:17.310> now<00:05:17.460> so<00:05:17.759> we're<00:05:18.090> gonna<00:05:18.180> hit<00:05:18.330> that

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
ahead right now so we're gonna hit that

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:21.050 
ahead right now so we're gonna hit that
200<00:05:19.080> real<00:05:19.979> quick<00:05:20.250> I<00:05:20.460> didn't<00:05:20.669> really<00:05:20.759> need<00:05:20.940> to

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
200 real quick I didn't really need to

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.210 
200 real quick I didn't really need to
cap<00:05:21.240> that<00:05:21.419> be<00:05:21.599> flag<00:05:21.900> but<00:05:22.710> I'm<00:05:22.800> just<00:05:22.949> playing

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
cap that be flag but I'm just playing

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.330 
cap that be flag but I'm just playing
the<00:05:23.310> typical<00:05:23.849> winning<00:05:24.270> strategy<00:05:24.960> now<00:05:25.680> if<00:05:26.069> I

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
the typical winning strategy now if I

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.390 
the typical winning strategy now if I
would<00:05:26.550> have<00:05:26.639> got<00:05:27.389> on<00:05:27.569> the<00:05:27.750> flag<00:05:27.960> point<00:05:28.259> and<00:05:28.500> try

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
would have got on the flag point and try

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.820 
would have got on the flag point and try
to<00:05:29.460> like<00:05:29.759> boost<00:05:30.150> or<00:05:30.509> exploit<00:05:30.930> the<00:05:31.169> the<00:05:31.560> score

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
to like boost or exploit the the score

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.800 
to like boost or exploit the the score
system<00:05:32.009> in<00:05:32.250> which<00:05:32.370> if<00:05:32.820> I<00:05:33.000> get<00:05:33.210> a<00:05:33.240> kill<00:05:33.570> while

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
system in which if I get a kill while

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.930 
system in which if I get a kill while
standing<00:05:34.229> on<00:05:34.500> the<00:05:34.830> cat<00:05:35.039> while<00:05:35.280> I'm<00:05:35.490> capping

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
standing on the cat while I'm capping

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.850 
standing on the cat while I'm capping
it's<00:05:36.090> an<00:05:36.330> extra<00:05:36.570> 200<00:05:36.690> points<00:05:37.199> then<00:05:37.590> what<00:05:37.740> you

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
it's an extra 200 points then what you

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.499 
it's an extra 200 points then what you
want<00:05:38.130> to<00:05:38.190> do<00:05:38.310> is<00:05:38.430> get<00:05:38.580> off<00:05:38.789> the<00:05:39.030> flag<00:05:39.270> and<00:05:39.449> then

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:39.509 
want to do is get off the flag and then

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:41.360 
want to do is get off the flag and then
get<00:05:39.659> back<00:05:39.690> on<00:05:39.900> and<00:05:40.349> try<00:05:40.530> and<00:05:40.650> do<00:05:40.740> that<00:05:40.770> there's

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
get back on and try and do that there's

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.790 
get back on and try and do that there's
a<00:05:41.460> way<00:05:41.639> that<00:05:41.759> you<00:05:41.820> come<00:05:42.210> milk<00:05:42.590> points<00:05:43.590> but

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
a way that you come milk points but

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.170 
a way that you come milk points but
again<00:05:44.039> you<00:05:44.130> wouldn't<00:05:44.310> want<00:05:44.520> to<00:05:44.580> capture<00:05:44.849> the

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
again you wouldn't want to capture the

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.670 
again you wouldn't want to capture the
point<00:05:45.479> because<00:05:45.900> you're<00:05:46.289> going<00:05:46.409> to<00:05:46.469> shorten

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
point because you're going to shorten

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.680 
point because you're going to shorten
the<00:05:46.919> game<00:05:47.099> you<00:05:47.729> want<00:05:47.909> it<00:05:48.000> to<00:05:48.060> have<00:05:48.210> the<00:05:48.300> maximum

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
the game you want it to have the maximum

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.300 
the game you want it to have the maximum
amount<00:05:48.780> of<00:05:48.960> time<00:05:49.169> I<00:05:49.409> didn't<00:05:49.650> do<00:05:49.740> that<00:05:49.889> there<00:05:50.130> so

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
amount of time I didn't do that there so

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.730 
amount of time I didn't do that there so
I<00:05:50.340> failed<00:05:50.669> to<00:05:50.820> do<00:05:51.000> some<00:05:51.810> of<00:05:51.990> the<00:05:52.139> exploitation

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
I failed to do some of the exploitation

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.920 
I failed to do some of the exploitation
which<00:05:53.250> you<00:05:53.490> go<00:05:53.669> for<00:05:53.909> maximum<00:05:54.330> kills<00:05:54.599> in<00:05:54.810> this

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
which you go for maximum kills in this

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.870 
which you go for maximum kills in this
game<00:05:55.199> instead<00:05:55.560> I<00:05:55.620> just<00:05:55.770> you<00:05:56.159> know<00:05:56.280> go<00:05:56.490> for<00:05:56.699> the

game instead I just you know go for the
when<00:05:57.560> hopefully<00:05:58.560> that's<00:05:58.740> respectable<00:05:59.569> the

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:00.569 
when hopefully that's respectable the

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:02.779 
when hopefully that's respectable the
game<00:06:00.750> is<00:06:00.960> two<00:06:01.199> and<00:06:01.289> a<00:06:01.349> half<00:06:01.440> minutes<00:06:01.680> short<00:06:02.580> of

the full ten minutes it could have been

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.209 
the full ten minutes it could have been
if<00:06:04.229> we<00:06:04.919> had<00:06:05.219> a<00:06:05.250> let<00:06:06.000> the<00:06:06.270> enemy<00:06:06.719> cap<00:06:07.139> and<00:06:08.099> I'm

00:06:08.209 --> 00:06:08.219 
if we had a let the enemy cap and I'm

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:09.950 
if we had a let the enemy cap and I'm
not<00:06:08.370> coordinating<00:06:08.909> though<00:06:09.060> within<00:06:09.419> teammates

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
not coordinating though within teammates

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.320

or<00:06:10.199> more<00:06:10.710> than<00:06:10.860> one<00:06:11.009> teammate<00:06:11.370> so<00:06:11.610> there's<00:06:12.210> so

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
or more than one teammate so there's so

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.850

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 
to cap the points anyways so it's

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:17.659 
to cap the points anyways so it's
actually<00:06:16.500> really<00:06:16.620> difficult<00:06:16.830> and<00:06:17.370> takes
