00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.059
 hello with you evgeny kartashov and 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.579
 Monster photo site recently released new 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.160
 adobe photoshop version 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:22.000
 lightroom is now called adobe 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:25.570
 photoshop lightroom si en n 2015 or 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.240
 adobe photoshop lightroom 6 in what 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.449
 the difference between these two versions by 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:35.170
 functional, they are the same but the fact is 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:39.610
 that lightroom 6 can be bought for 150 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:42.160
 dollars and he but will always be yours if 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.600
 do you use lightroom in the composition 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.379
 clouds creative cloud 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:50.699
 then it will be called lightroom cc 2015 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:53.109
 and you have to pay every month 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:56.079
 some amount for example if you 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:59.109
 use the package for the photographer that is 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.870
 this is photoshop + lightroom you need 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:06.130
 will pay about 10 dollars or 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.320
 for Russia the price is 300 rubles per month if 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.470
 do you use the full package of creative 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.930
 cloud then the cost of one and a half thousand will be 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.340
 regardless of the amount used 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.579
 programs that is you can use 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.579
 all programs that are included in the package or 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:22.659
 for example, some of them 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:26.079
 naturally in the lightroom appeared 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:29.200
 some innovations and in this lesson we 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:32.259
 Let's start to get acquainted with them in this lesson 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:36.159
 we will introduce the editing of masks 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:38.259
 gradients i.e. appeared in the lightroom 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.470
 ability to edit masks which 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.790
 formed as a result of the application 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.909
 gradient filter or radial 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.100
 the gradient in the camera mouth is such an opportunity 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.439
 appeared much earlier than in 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.649
 lightroom and now the developers 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:55.509
 already adjusted to this and lightroom and so 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.360
 we have this photo 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:02.350
 let us have it now fast 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:05.170
 we will process that is for a start I include 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.180
 lens correction profile like this 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.530
 as you can see it removes 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.530
 vignetting around the edges 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:21.440
 Now I turn to the basic tab 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.440
 slightly reducing the overall exposure 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:30.180
 I set the cut-off in colors like this 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.340
 I don't pay much attention to heaven 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.860
 I draw there is no plot important 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.730
 there is no information therefore in general to me 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:42.750
 no matter what happens there 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.790
 highlights removing a little bit of a minus like 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.210
 see we have information in the sky 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:55.860
 fully recovered a little bit 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:57.380
 picking up the shadows setting the cutoff to 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.390
 shadows 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:05.280
 but you can still add a little exposure and 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.660
 add contrast here we have 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.360
 get a photo 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.580
 now you can tweak a little balance 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:18.470
 white 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:23.910
 make it a little warmer like this 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:26.490
 let's see before and after you see 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.620
 the photo has become much better but 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:32.100
 I would like to give more emphasis on 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:36.990
 model simple vignette i do this 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:39.990
 why not be able to because the vignette 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:43.500
 it acts on the whole image here 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.160
 see the blackout comes and on the model in 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.360
 including 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.850
 I don't need to do this 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.950
 dimming everywhere except the model for this 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.870
 I will use 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.270
 radial gradient here it is for that 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.380
 to go to it you need to click here 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:03.050
 this icon 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:06.180
 or shift key combination I choose 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.130
 as you can see the exposure value here at 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.980
 I'm set to -4 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:14.420
 it is necessary for me to be perfect 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:19.519
 clearly saw where the gradient goes 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:23.109
 I stretch like this 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.109
 I turn a little bit 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:34.189
 I shift a little this way as you can see 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:37.319
 here everything is good then do not climb but 

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:39.990
 still part of the impact falls on 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:43.229
 the model we need from this exposure 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.719
 get rid of how pay 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:48.840
 note that right here on the right panel 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:51.930
 Gradient Settings Appeared 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.969
 brush is the brush with which we 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.909
 can erase or add impact 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:05:00.289
 given gradient 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:05:03.330
 I choose to erase 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:09.960
 gradient is exactly what i need to do i 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:12.240
 hold down the alt key and brush over 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.479
 Where do I need to clean 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:19.699
 impact watch impact goes away 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:25.819
 from the face here she doesnâ€™t need me either 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:25.819
 go over the edge erasing down 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:43.460
 choosing here on the arm that's how you see 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.460
 we edited the gradient mask 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.370
 now I select the exposure value 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:56.580
 that is, the value of the blackout that I 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:59.430
 I need to think that this is the value 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.830
 It would be sufficient as possible 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.920
 was add exposure to the sky but i 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:07.500
 I will not do this because the sky 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.930
 here I need light enough for 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:13.350
 ordering a better hairstyle 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:15.600
 models from the background like this 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:22.620
 way let's look now at 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:26.310
 the result we blacked out some rear 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.810
 plan and gave emphasis to the model and so 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.210
 try to use new 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:33.930
 a tool that appeared lightroom 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:36.090
 creative cloud 2015 next lessons we 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:39.300
 continue to get acquainted with the novelties 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:43.430
 lightroom I say goodbye to you 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.430
