the<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:37.070> back<00:02:37.910> part<00:02:38.270> was<00:02:38.480> done<00:02:38.750> just<00:02:39.050> by

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
the the back part was done just by

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.080 
the the back part was done just by
laying<00:02:39.530> it<00:02:39.800> out<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.190> then<00:02:40.340> folding<00:02:40.760> off<00:02:40.910> the

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
edges to kind of get a good smooth

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.440 
edges to kind of get a good smooth
surface<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.520> work<00:02:43.700> with<00:02:43.910> so<00:02:44.209> I'll<00:02:44.270> put<00:02:44.390> that

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
surface to work with so I'll put that

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.690 
surface to work with so I'll put that
over<00:02:44.750> here<00:02:45.110> for<00:02:45.350> just<00:02:45.530> a<00:02:45.650> second<00:02:46.040> I'm<00:02:46.520> going<00:02:46.610> to

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
over here for just a second I'm going to

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.270

start off by just gluing down the part
here<00:02:49.610> for<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:49.970> grass<00:02:50.209> and<00:02:51.250> just<00:02:52.250> try<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.430> use<00:02:52.670> a

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
here for the grass and just try to use a

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
here and then I have the Hat here and

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.390 
here and then I have the Hat here and
the<00:04:03.329> hat<00:04:03.510> does<00:04:03.810> have<00:04:04.140> this<00:04:04.530> quality<00:04:04.890> where

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
the hat does have this quality where

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.819 
the hat does have this quality where
it's<00:04:05.609> a<00:04:05.760> little<00:04:06.500> three-dimensional<00:04:07.500> looking

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
it's a little three-dimensional looking

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.130 
it's a little three-dimensional looking
of<00:04:08.010> course<00:04:08.280> because<00:04:08.609> of<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:09.000> way<00:04:09.690> that<00:04:09.840> one

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
of course because of the way that one

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.710 
of course because of the way that one
part<00:04:10.500> pops<00:04:10.769> up<00:04:10.980> a<00:04:11.069> little<00:04:11.310> bit<00:04:11.459> so<00:04:11.819> you

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
part pops up a little bit so you

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.839 
part pops up a little bit so you
probably<00:04:12.900> want<00:04:13.109> to<00:04:13.140> take<00:04:13.379> this<00:04:13.709> flap<00:04:14.159> and<00:04:14.430> glue

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
probably want to take this flap and glue

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.300 
probably want to take this flap and glue
it<00:04:14.879> down<00:04:15.079> just<00:04:16.079> to<00:04:16.260> keep<00:04:16.410> it<00:04:16.620> out<00:04:16.799> of<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:17.130> way

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
it down just to keep it out of the way

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.159 
it down just to keep it out of the way
and<00:04:18.739> then<00:04:20.000> you<00:04:21.000> can<00:04:21.180> choose<00:04:21.510> you<00:04:21.750> know<00:04:21.900> which

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
and then you can choose you know which

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.460 
and then you can choose you know which
side<00:04:22.410> you<00:04:22.650> prefer<00:04:23.070> to<00:04:23.099> have<00:04:23.870> showing<00:04:24.870> up<00:04:25.080> I

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
side you prefer to have showing up I

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.800 
side you prefer to have showing up I
think<00:04:26.070> actually<00:04:26.280> you<00:04:27.060> know<00:04:27.150> either<00:04:27.300> way<00:04:27.599> it

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
think actually you know either way it

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.719 
think actually you know either way it
really<00:04:28.020> doesn't<00:04:28.410> make<00:04:28.950> that<00:04:29.430> much<00:04:29.490> difference

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
really doesn't make that much difference

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.879 
really doesn't make that much difference
but<00:04:30.450> I<00:04:30.510> do<00:04:30.630> kind<00:04:30.870> of<00:04:30.990> like<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:31.320> front<00:04:31.590> side<00:04:31.860> a

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
but I do kind of like the front side a

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:33.260 
but I do kind of like the front side a
little<00:04:32.190> bit<00:04:32.280> just<00:04:32.490> because<00:04:32.580> of<00:04:32.849> the<00:04:32.880> way<00:04:32.970> the

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
little bit just because of the way the

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.960 
little bit just because of the way the
brim<00:04:34.020> kind<00:04:34.380> of<00:04:34.440> comes<00:04:34.620> in<00:04:34.830> there<00:04:35.039> so<00:04:35.639> I'll<00:04:35.940> use

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
brim kind of comes in there so I'll use

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.870 
brim kind of comes in there so I'll use
that<00:04:36.180> as<00:04:36.870> my<00:04:37.910> front<00:04:40.190> and<00:04:41.190> I'll<00:04:41.310> just<00:04:41.520> get<00:04:41.669> this

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
that as my front and I'll just get this

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:48.910 
that as my front and I'll just get this
hat<00:04:42.180> situated<00:04:42.960> here

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.280 

so<00:04:49.460> that's<00:04:49.670> there<00:04:50.210> with<00:04:50.450> the<00:04:50.540> hat<00:04:50.690> on<00:04:50.750> and<00:04:51.140> then

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
so that's there with the hat on and then

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.600 
so that's there with the hat on and then
I'm<00:04:51.410> just<00:04:51.500> going<00:04:51.650> to<00:04:51.740> go<00:04:51.830> and<00:04:51.920> put<00:04:52.100> the<00:04:52.190> face<00:04:52.400> on

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
I'm just going to go and put the face on

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.090 
I'm just going to go and put the face on
you<00:04:53.180> could<00:04:53.300> of<00:04:53.330> course<00:04:53.450> you<00:04:54.170> know<00:04:54.290> draw<00:04:54.890> these

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
you could of course you know draw these

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.310 
you could of course you know draw these
on<00:04:55.340> if<00:04:55.490> you<00:04:55.580> wanted<00:04:55.880> to<00:04:56.090> I'm<00:04:56.690> just<00:04:56.900> going<00:04:57.080> to<00:04:57.170> do

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
on if you wanted to I'm just going to do

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.320 
on if you wanted to I'm just going to do
this<00:04:57.470> because<00:04:57.710> I<00:04:57.890> think<00:04:58.490> having<00:04:58.790> all<00:04:59.090> of<00:04:59.120> it

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
this because I think having all of it

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.840
