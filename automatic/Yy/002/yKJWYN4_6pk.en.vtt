the<00:00:51.300> game<00:00:51.510> from<00:00:51.750> here<00:00:53.780> in<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:55.379> game<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.829> very

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
the game from here in this game is very

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.910 
the game from here in this game is very
similar<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.670> eliminate<00:00:57.480> except<00:00:58.289> i<00:00:58.469> believe

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
similar to eliminate except i believe

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
change the map right there but i'll just

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.620 
change the map right there but i'll just
go<00:01:45.690> ahead<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.869> do<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:47.090> you<00:01:48.090> can<00:01:48.240> change<00:01:48.420> it

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.090 
go ahead and do it and you can change it
to<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.780> different<00:01:49.200> maps<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.650> want<00:01:49.860> but

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
to the different maps that you want but

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.290 
to the different maps that you want but
you'll<00:01:50.369> leave<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.640> game<00:01:52.820> so<00:01:53.820> i'll<00:01:53.970> just<00:01:54.000> wait

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300

for<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.600> match<00:01:54.900> which<00:01:55.320> shouldn't<00:01:55.710> take<00:01:55.770> that

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
for a match which shouldn't take that

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.590 
for a match which shouldn't take that
long<00:01:56.130> because<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.880> pretty<00:01:57.090> fast<00:01:57.390> game

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
long because this is a pretty fast game

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:12.420 
long because this is a pretty fast game
i'll<00:01:57.750> have<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.990> say

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.459 

okay<00:02:13.150> as<00:02:13.269> you<00:02:13.420> can<00:02:13.450> see<00:02:13.599> i<00:02:13.750> got<00:02:13.989> into<00:02:14.260> another

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:14.469 
okay as you can see i got into another

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:15.929 
okay as you can see i got into another
match<00:02:14.769> because<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.189> loads<00:02:15.400> up<00:02:15.579> the<00:02:15.700> players

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:15.939 
match because it loads up the players

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.929 
match because it loads up the players
halo<00:02:16.599> cell<00:02:16.930> exactly<00:02:17.609> and<00:02:18.609> then<00:02:18.790> I'll<00:02:18.909> show

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:18.939 
halo cell exactly and then I'll show

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:25.950 
halo cell exactly and then I'll show
their<00:02:19.299> ranking<00:02:19.750> on<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:19.989> sidebar<00:02:20.739> right<00:02:20.980> here

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.020 

and<00:02:26.050> then<00:02:26.710> the<00:02:26.800> map<00:02:26.980> hammer<00:02:27.310> is<00:02:27.580> right<00:02:27.820> there

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
and then the map hammer is right there

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.130 
and then the map hammer is right there
so<00:02:28.210> i'll<00:02:28.330> get<00:02:28.420> back<00:02:28.570> to<00:02:28.720> you<00:02:28.780> when<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:28.960> match

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140
