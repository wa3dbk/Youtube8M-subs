00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:17.900
 to the question of how best to paint 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:22.070
 refusal to get good 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:26.150
 look now 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:32.620
 two stripes one strip on pair 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:36.550
 blood stripes across i.e. 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:43.790
 passes loud see on top a 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:48.979
 I'll sew these stripes here 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:50.110
 this slice is the second pair 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:53.330
 stripes 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:57.830
 fit strictly on the road 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:01:01.430
 that is, there will be an edge along the seam 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.820
 so here we will do less 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:11.090
 So 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:14.390
 Well, it will look like a seam 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.390
 this case 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.600
 just wish 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.600
 and let the trash one relatively 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:41.550
 this counter even though 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:41.550
 our business we carry out 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.869
 will evaluate look already in sight that 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.030
 the car gave such a small landing 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:56.229
 you say well, you can pull to unwind 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:00.170
 you're good even here is where I am 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:05.530
 stretched summer has a wavy appearance 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.530
 right i'm now here's just what 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.360
 Details like on my carved out 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.360
 remember how 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:30.090
 look 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.610
 the same these a little bit when planted 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.209
 machine 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:38.340
 you can pull up and deal, and all 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:42.080
 equal to the naked eye it is clear that 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:46.580
 a bit of a machine when planted yes and 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:49.790
 Now I will wake up these two samples and 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.500
 you will see what happens 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:58.890
 let's for the purity of the experiment I will 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:00.830
 console right before our eyes on everyone 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.060
 the rules of science 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.060
 start talking and jan 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.340
 the parties themselves 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.209
 great use 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.349
 and the world is ruined 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.349
 will do 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:00.910
 as far as I don't see the fabric from everything 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:07.310
 still burst at Ulta gives me great 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:12.230
 seam allowance wave 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.569
 what do you do to me there anyway gives on 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.799
 big wave 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:22.040
 and even in the area that I 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:26.710
 Initially, it was still a shock at 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:31.120
 people let alone what's going on 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.120
 then the plot technique 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:39.400
 convey the benefit of the south in the same way 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:42.240
 same I will tell you what I love 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.240
 you immediately 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.450
 put it 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.450
 you 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:25.520
 and look 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:29.159
 not 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:32.159
 how much better did the cops get 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:32.159
 this 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:41.209
 which one 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.830
 which of these stones 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.830
 see this 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.270
 how to get out of Rome but this seam 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:06:01.250
 turned out much smoother 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:02.090
 whatever one may say so brilliant therefore 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.870
 a little bit 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.870
 gives 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.810
 since you're a shevchik exactly 

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:20.059
 here is this man 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:30.240
 you move away 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:38.560
 almost 90 percent of modern 

00:06:34.429 --> 00:06:40.480
 fabrics with local 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.680
 physical swamp threshold because for 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.680
 edge across
