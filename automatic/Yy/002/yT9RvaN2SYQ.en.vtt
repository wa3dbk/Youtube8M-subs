didn't actually acquiring the stick to
it<00:01:35.380> to<00:01:35.680> improve<00:01:35.950> it<00:01:36.070> cuz<00:01:36.220> i<00:01:36.250> know<00:01:36.310> you<00:01:36.430> could<00:01:36.580> do

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
improves it by quite a bit but um once a

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.020 
improves it by quite a bit but um once a
blue<00:01:42.250> binder<00:01:42.460> was<00:01:42.730> across<00:01:43.210> your<00:01:43.510> see<00:01:44.610> what<00:01:45.610> way
