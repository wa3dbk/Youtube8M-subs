like it's kind of like Call of Duty if
you<00:02:09.649> will<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:10.580> know<00:02:10.989> it'll<00:02:11.989> turn<00:02:12.260> red<00:02:12.590> and

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
you will you know it'll turn red and

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.180 
you will you know it'll turn red and
then<00:02:13.310> another<00:02:13.580> interesting<00:02:14.300> thing<00:02:14.330> is<00:02:15.190> you

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
then another interesting thing is you

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.220 
then another interesting thing is you
know<00:02:16.340> when<00:02:16.549> you're<00:02:16.670> going<00:02:16.880> topside<00:02:17.480> topside

like<00:02:18.709> I<00:02:18.739> said<00:02:18.950> it's<00:02:19.100> like<00:02:19.220> post-apocalyptic

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
like I said it's like post-apocalyptic

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.210 
like I said it's like post-apocalyptic

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
so imagine that was going off is hard

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.699 
so imagine that was going off is hard

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
but the thing is though there's no alarm

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.229 
but the thing is though there's no alarm
he<00:02:52.519> just<00:02:52.760> gets<00:02:53.230> really<00:02:54.230> really<00:02:54.980> he<00:02:55.880> just<00:02:56.030> gets

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
he just gets really really he just gets

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.940 
he just gets really really he just gets
really<00:02:56.420> loud<00:02:56.660> and<00:02:56.769> for<00:02:57.769> some<00:02:57.920> reason

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
really loud and for some reason

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.150 
really loud and for some reason
everybody<00:02:58.910> in<00:02:59.239> the<00:02:59.450> whole<00:02:59.690> map<00:03:00.079> is<00:03:00.350> alerted

and<00:03:01.280> that's<00:03:01.940> probably<00:03:02.090> like<00:03:02.359> one<00:03:02.690> of<00:03:02.720> the

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
and that's probably like one of the

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.360 
and that's probably like one of the
times<00:03:03.049> for<00:03:03.260> me<00:03:03.410> because<00:03:03.709> another<00:03:03.980> thing<00:03:04.070> is

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
times for me because another thing is

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.490 
times for me because another thing is
like<00:03:04.720> collision<00:03:05.720> detection<00:03:06.049> like<00:03:06.350> you'll

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
like collision detection like you'll

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.979 
like collision detection like you'll
walk<00:03:06.859> up<00:03:07.070> to<00:03:07.220> something<00:03:07.459> but<00:03:07.549> you<00:03:07.670> actually

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989
