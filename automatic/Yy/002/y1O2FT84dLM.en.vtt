00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.620
 Vallecano ray in mestalla in the 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.400

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.139

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.610
 a triumph that is the third 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.950
 consecutive of the miroslav team 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.020
 djukic that somehow forgets the 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.790
 stumbling at the start of the season 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.980
 the opposite happens to lightning 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:25.640
 vallecano that with this defeat links 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.020
 six stumbles consecutively the 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.860
 meeting was going to be resolved with a 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.380
 solo goal by jonas gonçálves before 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.420
 this opportunity for the che team 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.640
 opportunity of dorón pabón started well 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.370
 Valencia addition to that opportunity 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.980
 peacock in mestalla could see this 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.989
 good offensive action of fede the shot 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.239
 of the Argentine had to divert him to 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.960
 Corner Guardian Vallecano Ray 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.960
 ruben 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.890
 jeremy matthieu's shipment control 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.980
 of jonas and practically the line of 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.530
 golosaul prevented him from dialing the number 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.090
 7 of valencià occupying the position of 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.050
 center forward in the absence by 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.050
 helix postiga injury 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.570
 there comes the jonas auction and how / 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.970
 rubén and saúl prevented the goal from 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.310
 Brazilian player who was the man who 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.440
 laugh that ball was going to sleep Saul 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.210
 I was going to end up recovering Jonas himself 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.340
 that way the action ended 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.430
 in which was going to be the only goal of 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.430
 meeting 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.890
 lamented the error of his paco player 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.960
 jémez the fourth goal of the season for 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.600
 jonas gonçálves the four has 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:41.360
 achieved in the last three days 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.420
 air of the grave error of Saul and that well 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.280
 finish the jonas play with that shot 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.080
 satin that first hit on the pole 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.240
 right of the ray goal and 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.770
 I definitely ended up going inside 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.770
 of the arch of the franjirrojo team 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.860
 in this action 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.680
 he was going to hurt 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.259
 the player of the ray vallecano seba 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.460
 fernandez the piece of paper that was going to have 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.620
 that leave the game rectangle 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.310
 because he was doubled with manna to the topic 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.310
 to the knee 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.950
 I had to make the form change 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.470
 Immediate Paco Jémez enters his place 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.310
 Ray perea the squad that would 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.310
 be very protagonist 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.379
 a ray that was the ruler of the 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.659
 second half and the ball for the team 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:38.620
 of jémez and the opportunities also the 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:42.519
 first clear is of roberto trashorras 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.500
 everything after the fight for that ball of 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.480
 perea 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.150
 nice the hat that makes roberto 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.770
 trashorras that ends shooting center 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.960
 of this Castro head shot from 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.590
 adrián that was lost to the left of 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.599
 the goal 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.930
 defended by diego alves a diego alves 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.519
 that has been dragging physical problems 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.370
 problems in the abductor of his leg 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.010
 right throughout the match 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.420
 and adrián who finished off in that way 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.620
 he came from scoring a goal in the last 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.510
 working day 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.799
 adrián gonzález and more of the vallecano ray 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.460
 It is very clear of perea that does not 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.690
 Finalize 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.690
 in the last shot 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.830
 and he saw along that Castro 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.490
 extraordinary control of perea and the 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.350
 terrible finale of Alberto Perea himself 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.930
 he could mark the second the valence in 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.190
 this quick exit to the against already in the 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.530
 final section of 4 but 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.100
 incomprehensibly social of goal and not 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.100
 hit to finish 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:48.430
 Valencià's fans got very angry 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.430
 with your player for that mistake made 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.160
 the play of all cases should 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.190
 have invalidated the referee outside of 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.190
 game 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.620
 there you see it 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.099
 finally sofiane feghouli got it 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.290
 to finish between sticks at the end 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:11.569
 mestalla triumph of valencia by the 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.569
 minimum palencia to 1 ray vallecano 0
