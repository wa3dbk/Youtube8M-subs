her books Orlando in particular and then

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.389 
her books Orlando in particular and then
we<00:01:20.299> looked<00:01:20.509> at<00:01:20.689> her<00:01:20.840> life<00:01:21.049> and<00:01:21.319> the<00:01:21.829> Bloomsbury

set<00:01:22.729> and<00:01:23.090> so<00:01:23.329> we<00:01:23.899> looked<00:01:24.110> at<00:01:24.259> this<00:01:24.350> historical

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:25.069 
set and so we looked at this historical

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:27.249 
set and so we looked at this historical
sort<00:01:25.459> of<00:01:25.520> blooms<00:01:25.700> with<00:01:25.969> that<00:01:26.119> reference<00:01:26.630> then

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
sort of blooms with that reference then

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.139 
sort of blooms with that reference then
we<00:01:27.380> really<00:01:27.619> wanted<00:01:27.890> to<00:01:27.950> modernize<00:01:28.250> it<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:28.880> we

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
we really wanted to modernize it and we

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:30.880 
we really wanted to modernize it and we
talked<00:01:29.420> a<00:01:29.600> lot<00:01:29.689> about<00:01:29.750> it<00:01:30.200> and<00:01:30.229> then<00:01:30.740> we

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
talked a lot about it and then we

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.469 
talked a lot about it and then we
thought<00:01:31.369> the<00:01:31.520> best<00:01:31.549> solution<00:01:32.179> would<00:01:32.209> be<00:01:32.329> to

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
thought the best solution would be to

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.469 
thought the best solution would be to
almost<00:01:32.780> as<00:01:32.959> if<00:01:33.109> we'd<00:01:33.350> taken<00:01:34.149> elements<00:01:35.149> of<00:01:35.299> that

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
almost as if we'd taken elements of that

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.109 
almost as if we'd taken elements of that
time<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:36.200> put<00:01:36.740> it<00:01:36.829> through<00:01:36.950> a<00:01:37.039> computer<00:01:37.399> so<00:01:37.909> we

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
time and put it through a computer so we

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.830 
time and put it through a computer so we
pixellated<00:01:38.679> and<00:01:39.679> we<00:01:39.970> really<00:01:40.970> made<00:01:41.149> lace<00:01:41.450> very

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
pixellated and we really made lace very

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.469 
pixellated and we really made lace very
geometric<00:01:42.310> has<00:01:43.310> a<00:01:43.340> very<00:01:43.610> sort<00:01:43.849> of<00:01:43.909> controlled

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
geometric has a very sort of controlled

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.479 
geometric has a very sort of controlled
graphic<00:01:45.229> feel<00:01:45.560> to<00:01:45.829> it<00:01:45.860> rather<00:01:46.099> than<00:01:46.250> the

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:46.489 
graphic feel to it rather than the

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:48.550 
graphic feel to it rather than the
feminine<00:01:46.939> feel<00:01:47.149> that<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:47.539> original<00:01:48.079> lage
