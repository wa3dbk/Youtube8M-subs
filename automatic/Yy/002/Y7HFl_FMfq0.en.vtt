00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
those ones were 230 not 250 so they have

of that but the asteroid thing was a

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.679 
of that but the asteroid thing was a
little<00:01:17.549> bit<00:01:17.640> odd<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.820> me<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.119> didn't<00:01:18.330> understand

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
little bit odd to me I didn't understand

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.390 
little bit odd to me I didn't understand
the<00:01:18.869> whole<00:01:18.900> variation<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.740> colors<00:01:20.040> because

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
the whole variation of colors because

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.130 
the whole variation of colors because
that<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.299> print<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.630> me<00:01:21.750> was<00:01:21.930> just<00:01:21.960> like

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
that and the print to me was just like

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.520 
that and the print to me was just like
man<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.710> was<00:01:22.830> okay<00:01:23.930> but<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:24.990> definitely<00:01:25.409> is

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
man it was okay but it definitely is

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.530 
man it was okay but it definitely is
something<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.310> liked<00:01:26.850> with<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.270> soul

having uh you can barely see that but
you<00:02:40.980> get<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.459> idea<00:02:41.489> hopefully<00:02:42.349> and<00:02:43.349> that<00:02:43.409> was

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
you get the idea hopefully and that was

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.500 
you get the idea hopefully and that was
again<00:02:43.739> from<00:02:43.919> the<00:02:44.010> area<00:02:44.219> seventy<00:02:44.489> two<00:02:44.639> pack<00:02:45.329> it

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
again from the area seventy two pack it

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.030 
again from the area seventy two pack it
was<00:02:45.599> like<00:02:45.719> the<00:02:45.840> long-lost<00:02:46.349> pack<00:02:46.709> that<00:02:46.889> came

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
was like the long-lost pack that came

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.979 
was like the long-lost pack that came
out<00:02:47.219> like<00:02:47.310> seven<00:02:48.150> months<00:02:48.269> later<00:02:48.419> made<00:02:48.870> no

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
out like seven months later made no

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.599 
out like seven months later made no
sense<00:02:49.139> at<00:02:49.349> all<00:02:49.409> that's<00:02:49.859> why<00:02:50.010> I<00:02:50.040> ended<00:02:50.519> up

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
sense at all that's why I ended up

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.399 
sense at all that's why I ended up
having<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:51.060> phone<00:02:51.209> posits<00:02:51.569> out<00:02:51.689> here<00:02:51.870> for<00:02:52.349> the

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409 
having the phone posits out here for the

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.939 
having the phone posits out here for the
Galaxy<00:02:52.799> phones<00:02:53.010> because<00:02:53.430> kind<00:02:54.180> of<00:02:54.859> kind<00:02:55.859> of

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:55.949 
Galaxy phones because kind of kind of

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:58.039 
Galaxy phones because kind of kind of
goes<00:02:56.760> together<00:02:57.209> with<00:02:57.480> these<00:02:57.629> a<00:02:57.659> little<00:02:57.900> bit

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
goes together with these a little bit

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.259 
goes together with these a little bit
because<00:02:58.230> these<00:02:59.099> are<00:02:59.159> the<00:02:59.459> Galaxy<00:02:59.819> phones<00:03:00.030> from

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
because these are the Galaxy phones from

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:01.610 
because these are the Galaxy phones from
the<00:03:00.329> year<00:03:00.540> before<00:03:00.569> these<00:03:01.049> are<00:03:01.139> the<00:03:01.230> area<00:03:01.409> semi

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
the year before these are the area semi

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.970 
the year before these are the area semi
twos<00:03:01.859> from<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.549> year<00:03:02.669> after<00:03:02.879> and<00:03:03.739> galaxy<00:03:04.739> and

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
twos from the year after and galaxy and

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.879 
twos from the year after and galaxy and
then<00:03:05.430> asteroid<00:03:06.030> it<00:03:06.389> makes<00:03:06.719> sense<00:03:06.900> right<00:03:07.139> kind

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889 
then asteroid it makes sense right kind

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.039 
then asteroid it makes sense right kind
of<00:03:07.919> cool<00:03:08.209> and<00:03:09.209> obviously<00:03:09.569> these<00:03:09.750> ones<00:03:09.930> are<00:03:09.989> a

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
of cool and obviously these ones are a

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.229 
of cool and obviously these ones are a
little<00:03:10.109> bit<00:03:10.319> small<00:03:10.620> because<00:03:11.159> I<00:03:11.639> got<00:03:12.060> them
