00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello today let's talk 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.690
 dif ex ex a device that we 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.900
 comes from austria 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.450
 so what is it about a species 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.740
 of deflectors actually that has a shape 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.410
 special that allows several things 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.240
 on one hand it will eliminate the what we 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.000
 call the bi my english to practice 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.859
 species of treble bundles that comes 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.769
 directly from the center of your top 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.779
 speakers so we know we know there are 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.669
 already devices that allow 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.380
 block it but there it does not block and 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.260
 once when it happens here except 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.129
 aggressive frequencies are scattered 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.710
 both on the sides and both in 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:48.000
 height so it's very very 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:51.120
 simply in front of the loudspeaker so 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.260
 there we have an amp with a 12 inches 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.870
 to send hop here 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:01.379
 and hop for their place it's really 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.989
 super simple just to center a 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.159
 point of birth well in front of the duo 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.760
 speaker is where we have the best 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.229
 results 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.540
 then there are two models there is this 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.380
 model that is first edition with 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.540
 the red part 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.790
 and then a more transparent model that 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.009
 is called aura that does not have the part 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.009
 red then this red part 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.500
 it only serves that when 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.049
 you come very close to your amp and 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.299
 that you just adjust the sound the sound 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.189
 go up to you budding 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.320
 when I put myself like that in the process of 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.700
 adjust my sound and thanks to the part 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.579
 red who's here I'm going to have 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.619
 exactly the same sound as the one that 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.939
 are going to have people around 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.979
 the antique on the will have on his wishes 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.390
 the transparent version which is less 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.700
 expensive 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.000
 we do not have this part but hey we have 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.729
 on the other hand all the profit 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.009
 of the rest ie this diffusion to 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.540
 both sides at once author 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.840
 which makes that when you're on stage 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.340
 you are completely surrounded with votes 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.700
 are and you do not have any difference 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.369
 living within 3 m 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.040
 three to five meters from all sides of 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.379
 the amp be it front on the sides 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.760
 you have no difference in his this 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:18.250
 which is interesting too is that 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.650
 see your drummer for example if he is 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.209
 arranged in relation to the amp like that 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.519
 there is no need to put the amp 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.019
 behind him for him to hear you he 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.030
 will you hear that way because 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.590
 that part of the sound can be brought back 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.000
 towards him 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:37.660
 so I summarize that first interest that 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.239
 is to avoid aggression throes 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.799
 for the public knew famous syndrome 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.650
 when you're playing and 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.510
 then strangely there is nobody in front 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.310
 from you they are all on the side because 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.739
 that they just take a little 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.420
 too much in the head so that you can 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.319
 forget it 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.530
 the second thing you can 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.510
 forget also it is the the engineer of the 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.709
 its that makes you to drops or all 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.870
 built the other way because 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.640
 thanks to that in fact you're going from the friend 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:09.220
 sound engineers and then and then the 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.709
 third benefit so for you on 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.620
 stage or even at home for that matter 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.650
 that you can move around 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.959
 your amp and have a constant sound 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.750
 so we'll do some sounds 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.870
 with my friend loÃ¯c 1 to show you a 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.920
 little everything that this device the 10 flex 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.920
 can you bring 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:36.430
 so I recorded a very magnifying glass 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:38.319
 very simple on the said aulas and I'm going 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.170
 the momentum and first the week goes 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.150
 keep the microphone right in front of the 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.510
 loudspeaker center so where 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.959
 normally 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.370
 we have the famous bim the famous excess 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.530
 high frequencies I push a little too 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.549
 the treble on the on the amp story 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.870
 we hear them 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.870
 here we go 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.860
 bah 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.450
 Oh 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.139
 Oh 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.550
 years 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:39.110
 so as you can see already the 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.020
 people who are in front of your amp do not 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:45.590
 are not going to take those frequencies very 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.210
 aggressive in the face and on the other hand 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.360
 so what we will see now is 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:53.810
 that the sound that does not go forward 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.260
 and distributed both on the sides and 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.260
 above 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.750
 ah ah 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 and 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.470
 hahaha 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.980
 hahaha 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.020
 ah ah 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.890
 not 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.790
 here you have seen all the 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.220
 benefits of the ex dif then what he 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:18.150
 be aware that it is useful too 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.800
 on stage and at home in 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.030
 studio then in studio there is still 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.310
 many other things we can do 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:26.310
 with the micro positions and that's 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:29.040
 well there we are not equipped so we 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:32.070
 avoid but know that in the studio too 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:34.650
 it's very usable and finally know 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.880
 that these facts in a matter that 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.670
 which is also the portholes 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.710
 plane so it's almost unbreakable 

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:44.790
 the proof we can go there you see I 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:48.180
 I do not clean it I'm downright 

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:50.880
 standing on it and it's not happening that 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.820
 do not break so that's it's more 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.650
 super super solid good must say these 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:58.380
 Austrians and Austrians 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.750
 Germans we know what it is 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.810
 the good cam and on that I greet you 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.810
 well
