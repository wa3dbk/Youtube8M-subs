computers towards these laptop computers
that<00:00:25.090> a<00:00:25.120> little<00:00:25.420> bit<00:00:25.510> bigger<00:00:25.810> a<00:00:26.170> little<00:00:26.380> bit

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
that a little bit bigger a little bit

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.710 
that a little bit bigger a little bit
more<00:00:26.770> packed<00:00:27.100> with<00:00:27.340> power<00:00:27.550> and<00:00:27.820> definitely<00:00:28.600> a

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
more packed with power and definitely a

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.330 
more packed with power and definitely a
little<00:00:29.110> bit<00:00:29.230> heavier<00:00:29.560> this<00:00:29.770> one<00:00:29.949> weighs<00:00:30.100> in<00:00:30.280> at

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
little bit heavier this one weighs in at

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.950 
little bit heavier this one weighs in at
about<00:00:30.490> 10<00:00:30.970> pounds<00:00:31.210> you<00:00:31.510> can<00:00:31.630> tell<00:00:31.780> by<00:00:31.900> the

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
about 10 pounds you can tell by the

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.020 
about 10 pounds you can tell by the
strain<00:00:32.649> in<00:00:32.800> my<00:00:32.890> voice<00:00:33.070> as<00:00:33.309> I<00:00:33.399> pick<00:00:33.579> it<00:00:33.610> up<00:00:33.820> there

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
strain in my voice as I pick it up there

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.880 
strain in my voice as I pick it up there
what<00:00:34.690> you<00:00:34.809> end<00:00:34.930> up<00:00:35.020> getting<00:00:35.260> in<00:00:35.559> one<00:00:35.710> of<00:00:35.739> these

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
what you end up getting in one of these

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.950 
what you end up getting in one of these
larger<00:00:36.429> laptops<00:00:36.940> that<00:00:37.269> have<00:00:37.539> a<00:00:37.569> lot<00:00:37.809> more

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
larger laptops that have a lot more

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.290 
larger laptops that have a lot more
power<00:00:38.230> in<00:00:38.499> them<00:00:38.649> is<00:00:38.800> super<00:00:39.399> fast<00:00:39.609> processor

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
power in them is super fast processor

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.239 
power in them is super fast processor
for<00:00:40.510> so<00:00:40.749> first<00:00:41.019> of<00:00:41.170> all<00:00:41.260> we<00:00:41.469> have<00:00:41.649> the<00:00:41.769> core<00:00:42.069> 2

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:42.249 
for so first of all we have the core 2

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:44.340 
for so first of all we have the core 2
duo<00:00:42.280> processor<00:00:42.579> in<00:00:43.269> here<00:00:43.449> what<00:00:43.839> this<00:00:43.960> means<00:00:44.199> is

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
duo processor in here what this means is

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.649 
duo processor in here what this means is
two<00:00:44.620> separate<00:00:45.129> processors<00:00:45.729> running<00:00:45.940> inside

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:46.659 
two separate processors running inside

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:48.450 
two separate processors running inside
of<00:00:46.839> the<00:00:46.960> laptop<00:00:47.350> that<00:00:47.739> allows<00:00:47.979> you<00:00:48.159> to<00:00:48.219> power

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
of the laptop that allows you to power

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.759 
of the laptop that allows you to power
many<00:00:48.879> applications<00:00:49.659> at<00:00:49.780> the<00:00:49.870> same<00:00:50.079> time<00:00:50.289> takes

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
many applications at the same time takes

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:52.649 
many applications at the same time takes
hyper<00:00:50.979> threading<00:00:51.399> to<00:00:51.489> a<00:00:51.519> whole<00:00:51.699> new<00:00:51.819> level<00:00:51.879> it

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:52.659 
hyper threading to a whole new level it

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:55.709 
hyper threading to a whole new level it
also<00:00:52.839> has<00:00:53.170> up<00:00:53.499> to<00:00:53.559> 4<00:00:54.129> gigabytes<00:00:54.699> of<00:00:54.850> ddr<00:00:55.299> memory

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
also has up to 4 gigabytes of ddr memory

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:58.619 
also has up to 4 gigabytes of ddr memory
so<00:00:55.929> again<00:00:56.229> very<00:00:56.469> high<00:00:57.159> speed<00:00:57.670> unit<00:00:58.149> what<00:00:58.569> are

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
so again very high speed unit what are

00:00:58.629 --> 00:00:59.969 
so again very high speed unit what are
you<00:00:58.690> going<00:00:58.809> to<00:00:58.870> do<00:00:58.960> with<00:00:59.079> all<00:00:59.229> that<00:00:59.260> speed<00:00:59.679> well

00:00:59.969 --> 00:00:59.979 
you going to do with all that speed well

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:01.979 
you going to do with all that speed well
Toshiba's<00:01:00.760> got<00:01:00.879> a<00:01:00.909> few<00:01:01.120> things<00:01:01.359> in<00:01:01.479> mind<00:01:01.539> they

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
Toshiba's got a few things in mind they

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.850 
Toshiba's got a few things in mind they
pet<00:01:02.289> they<00:01:02.469> built<00:01:02.739> in<00:01:02.949> the<00:01:03.190> HD<00:01:03.729> DVD<00:01:04.449> system<00:01:05.379> so

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
pet they built in the HD DVD system so

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.200 
pet they built in the HD DVD system so
this<00:01:06.040> is<00:01:06.190> similar<00:01:06.520> to<00:01:06.670> what<00:01:06.940> we've<00:01:07.060> talked

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
this is similar to what we've talked

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.090 
this is similar to what we've talked
about<00:01:07.299> before<00:01:07.539> with<00:01:07.810> the<00:01:07.899> blu-ray<00:01:08.350> and<00:01:08.560> the<00:01:08.619> HD

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
about before with the blu-ray and the HD

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.670 
about before with the blu-ray and the HD
now<00:01:09.579> you<00:01:09.640> can<00:01:09.850> play<00:01:10.119> really<00:01:10.869> really<00:01:11.020> high-end

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
now you can play really really high-end

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.060 
now you can play really really high-end
movies<00:01:12.159> or<00:01:12.430> low<00:01:12.729> large<00:01:13.090> data<00:01:13.719> files<00:01:14.020> up<00:01:14.560> to<00:01:14.799> 30

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.969 
gigabytes through the HD discs it also
has<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:19.359> Harman<00:01:19.750> Kardon<00:01:19.990> speakers<00:01:20.320> built

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
has the Harman Kardon speakers built

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.319 
has the Harman Kardon speakers built
into<00:01:21.130> it<00:01:21.399> you<00:01:21.490> can<00:01:21.609> see<00:01:21.729> those<00:01:21.909> just<00:01:22.119> on<00:01:22.240> the

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
into it you can see those just on the

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:24.480 
into it you can see those just on the
top<00:01:22.539> here<00:01:22.780> so<00:01:23.170> with<00:01:23.289> the<00:01:23.409> Harman<00:01:23.740> Kardon<00:01:23.950> we
