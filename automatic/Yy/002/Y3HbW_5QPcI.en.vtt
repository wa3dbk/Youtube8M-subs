00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
and Windows 10 technical preview as you

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.660 
and Windows 10 technical preview as you
can<00:00:10.050> see<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.320> differences<00:00:10.769> are<00:00:10.950> absolutely

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
can see the differences are absolutely

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.360 
can see the differences are absolutely
minimal<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.300> they<00:00:12.840> should<00:00:13.170> not<00:00:13.410> be<00:00:13.860> really

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
minimal and they should not be really

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.640 
minimal and they should not be really
taken<00:00:14.880> simply<00:00:15.839> because<00:00:16.139> there<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.470> absolutely

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
taken simply because there is absolutely

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.490 
taken simply because there is absolutely
no<00:00:17.010> difference<00:00:17.160> between<00:00:17.580> them<00:00:18.000> in<00:00:18.930> this<00:00:19.140> video

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500

of FPS numbers benchmarks the only

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.190

difference<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.790> loading<00:01:06.270> times<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:07.080> is

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
difference is loading times that is

difference is loading times that is

no<00:01:15.630> difference<00:01:16.369> so<00:01:17.369> what<00:01:17.610> can<00:01:17.790> we<00:01:17.850> take<00:01:18.119> away

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
no difference so what can we take away

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.480 
no difference so what can we take away
from<00:01:18.420> these<00:01:18.810> results<00:01:19.350> now<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.920> results<00:01:20.369> as

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
from these results now the results as

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.310 
from these results now the results as
you<00:01:20.520> as<00:01:21.150> you're<00:01:21.360> able<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.689> see<00:01:21.960> at<00:01:22.170> the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
you as you're able to see at the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.899 
you as you're able to see at the
beginning<00:01:22.439> we're<00:01:23.159> absolutely<00:01:23.729> identical

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
beginning we're absolutely identical

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.300 
beginning we're absolutely identical
there<00:01:24.810> are<00:01:24.930> no<00:01:25.110> differences<00:01:25.710> between<00:01:25.770> them

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
there are no differences between them

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.550 
there are no differences between them
and<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.759> variation<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.600> something<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.350> you

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
and the variation is something that you

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.950 
and the variation is something that you
should<00:01:28.799> really<00:01:29.100> take<00:01:29.430> with<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.390> pinch<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.750> salt

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
should really take with a pinch of salt

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.830 
should really take with a pinch of salt
simply<00:01:31.710> because<00:01:32.119> the<00:01:33.119> differences<00:01:33.540> are<00:01:33.689> so

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
simply because the differences are so

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.539 
simply because the differences are so
small<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.770> could<00:01:34.890> be<00:01:34.979> anything<00:01:35.310> from

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
small that it could be anything from

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.030 
small that it could be anything from
literally<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.720> chopper<00:01:36.990> blade<00:01:37.290> blowing<00:01:37.770> up<00:01:37.890> in

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
literally a chopper blade blowing up in

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.789 
literally a chopper blade blowing up in
a<00:01:38.100> different<00:01:38.460> way<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:39.049> those<00:01:40.049> differences<00:01:40.439> or

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
a different way so those differences or

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.219 
a different way so those differences or
something<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.000> wouldn't<00:01:42.390> go<00:01:42.540> away<00:01:42.780> saying

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
something that I wouldn't go away saying

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.499 
something that I wouldn't go away saying
Windows<00:01:43.619> 7<00:01:43.979> or<00:01:44.070> Windows<00:01:44.100> 10<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.939> better<00:01:45.180> than

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
Windows 7 or Windows 10 is better than

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.830 
Windows 7 or Windows 10 is better than
the<00:01:45.600> other<00:01:45.780> if<00:01:46.140> there<00:01:46.560> was<00:01:46.680> 5%<00:01:47.159> 10%<00:01:47.840> possibly

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
the other if there was 5% 10% possibly

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.960 
the other if there was 5% 10% possibly
more<00:01:49.110> variants<00:01:49.799> then<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.310> would<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:50.579> said<00:01:50.759> yes

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
more variants then I would have said yes

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.149 
more variants then I would have said yes
you<00:01:51.149> should<00:01:51.329> take<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.630> away<00:01:51.979> I've<00:01:52.979> previously

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
you should take it away I've previously

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.399 
you should take it away I've previously
proved<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.850> Windows<00:01:54.240> 8<00:01:54.450> didn't<00:01:55.170> really

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
proved that Windows 8 didn't really

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.410 
proved that Windows 8 didn't really
bring<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.950> much<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.670> performance<00:01:57.000> boost

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.450 
bring that much of a performance boost
and<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.689> did<00:01:57.840> various<00:01:58.500> benchmarks<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.250> prove

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
and I did various benchmarks to prove

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.389 
and I did various benchmarks to prove
that<00:01:59.869> so<00:02:00.869> what<00:02:01.290> we<00:02:01.320> should<00:02:01.649> we<00:02:01.770> take<00:02:02.009> away<00:02:02.219> from

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
that so what we should we take away from

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.310 
that so what we should we take away from
this<00:02:02.520> video<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.000> these<00:02:03.060> benchmarks<00:02:03.719> well

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
this video and these benchmarks well

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.280 
this video and these benchmarks well
it's<00:02:04.469> quite<00:02:04.649> simple<00:02:05.100> remember<00:02:05.969> Windows<00:02:06.840> 10<00:02:07.079> is

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
it's quite simple remember Windows 10 is

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.619 
it's quite simple remember Windows 10 is
a<00:02:07.350> technical<00:02:08.009> preview<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.670> released

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
a technical preview is released

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.589 
a technical preview is released
literally<00:02:10.259> this<00:02:10.440> week

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
literally this week

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.130 
literally this week
more<00:02:11.930> so<00:02:12.609> the<00:02:13.609> X<00:02:13.879> 12<00:02:14.269> which<00:02:14.540> is<00:02:14.569> the<00:02:14.719> one<00:02:14.989> that's

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
more so the X 12 which is the one that's

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.860 
more so the X 12 which is the one that's
gonna<00:02:15.349> be<00:02:15.560> reboosted<00:02:16.280> up<00:02:16.430> that<00:02:16.609> FPS<00:02:17.090> is<00:02:17.389> not

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
gonna be reboosted up that FPS is not

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.379 
gonna be reboosted up that FPS is not
really<00:02:18.139> implemented<00:02:18.739> either<00:02:19.159> from<00:02:19.819> dice

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:20.389 
really implemented either from dice

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:23.619 
really implemented either from dice
nor<00:02:20.780> from<00:02:21.349> Microsoft<00:02:22.510> themselves

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
nor from Microsoft themselves

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.309 
nor from Microsoft themselves
so<00:02:24.260> DX<00:02:25.069> 12<00:02:25.370> isn't<00:02:25.730> being<00:02:26.079> useful<00:02:27.079> for<00:02:27.290> a

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
so DX 12 isn't being useful for a

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.500 
so DX 12 isn't being useful for a
Eurasian<00:02:27.859> and<00:02:28.189> therefore<00:02:28.819> you<00:02:28.909> can't<00:02:29.150> expect

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
Eurasian and therefore you can't expect

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.349 
Eurasian and therefore you can't expect
better<00:02:29.840> results<00:02:30.469> I<00:02:30.620> just<00:02:31.040> wanted<00:02:31.459> to<00:02:31.609> see<00:02:31.819> just

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:32.359 
better results I just wanted to see just

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:34.270 
better results I just wanted to see just
for<00:02:32.450> myself<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.200> therefore<00:02:33.650> share<00:02:34.069> with<00:02:34.219> the

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
for myself and therefore share with the

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.089 
for myself and therefore share with the
interwebs<00:02:34.730> to<00:02:35.269> see<00:02:35.450> if<00:02:35.659> the<00:02:35.900> if<00:02:36.290> Windows<00:02:36.950> 10

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
interwebs to see if the if Windows 10

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.339 
interwebs to see if the if Windows 10
was<00:02:37.340> getting<00:02:37.639> better<00:02:37.790> results<00:02:37.939> but<00:02:38.540> as<00:02:38.840> I'd

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
was getting better results but as I'd

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.470 
was getting better results but as I'd
probably<00:02:39.650> say<00:02:39.919> as<00:02:40.159> as<00:02:40.459> I'd<00:02:40.669> suspect<00:02:41.180> at<00:02:41.419> the

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
probably say as as I'd suspect at the

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.059 
probably say as as I'd suspect at the
beginning<00:02:41.870> there<00:02:42.409> is<00:02:42.499> actually<00:02:42.859> no

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
beginning there is actually no

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.399 
beginning there is actually no
difference<00:02:43.519> between<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:44.060> two<00:02:44.090> so<00:02:44.870> take<00:02:45.079> it<00:02:45.260> as

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
difference between the two so take it as

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:47.860 
difference between the two so take it as
you<00:02:45.709> will<00:02:45.919> try<00:02:46.639> it<00:02:46.700> yourself<00:02:47.180> you<00:02:47.450> can<00:02:47.480> try<00:02:47.810> the

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
you will try it yourself you can try the

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.689 
you will try it yourself you can try the
exact<00:02:48.230> same<00:02:48.379> benchmark<00:02:48.739> make<00:02:49.159> sure<00:02:49.340> you<00:02:49.519> go

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:49.699 
exact same benchmark make sure you go

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:53.050 
exact same benchmark make sure you go
into<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.439> multiplayer<00:02:51.439> map<00:02:51.680> with<00:02:52.010> 0<00:02:52.430> players<00:02:52.790> in

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
into a multiplayer map with 0 players in

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.229 
into a multiplayer map with 0 players in
there<00:02:53.269> and<00:02:54.549> try<00:02:55.549> it<00:02:55.579> for<00:02:55.730> yourself<00:02:56.090> and

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
there and try it for yourself and

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.349 
there and try it for yourself and
compare<00:02:56.389> if<00:02:57.319> you<00:02:57.650> can<00:02:57.919> like<00:02:58.489> I<00:02:58.669> do<00:02:58.730> on<00:02:59.150> two

00:02:59.349 --> 00:02:59.359 
compare if you can like I do on two

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.869 
compare if you can like I do on two
