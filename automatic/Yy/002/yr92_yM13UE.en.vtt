this is a green gun because this is the
green<00:00:44.910> one<00:00:44.940> sort<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.420> problems<00:00:45.750> got<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.160> film

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
green one sort of problems got that film

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.860 
green one sort of problems got that film
teachers<00:00:47.760> or<00:00:47.879> twisted<00:00:48.239> like<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.420> underwater

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
teachers or twisted like that underwater

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.630 
teachers or twisted like that underwater
and<00:00:49.680> dozen<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.129> light<00:00:50.280> up<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
and dozen the light up on the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.569 
and dozen the light up on the
conversions<00:00:51.120> properly<00:00:51.480> these<00:00:52.170> two<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.440> lot<00:00:52.680> but

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
conversions properly these two a lot but

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.979 
conversions properly these two a lot but
this<00:00:53.670> one<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:53.969> not<00:00:54.210> those<00:00:54.690> some<00:00:55.070> not<00:00:56.070> lining<00:00:56.309> up

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
this one is not those some not lining up

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.180 
this one is not those some not lining up
so<00:00:57.989> yeah<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.410> little<00:00:58.500> resistor<00:00:59.070> there

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
so yeah that little resistor there

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.270 
so yeah that little resistor there
follow<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.609> eight<00:00:59.760> seat<00:01:00.170> but<00:01:01.170> at<00:01:01.320> RC<00:01:02.070> is

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
follow that eight seat but at RC is

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.500 
follow that eight seat but at RC is
actually<00:01:02.760> underneath<00:01:03.059> it

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
actually underneath it

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.530 
actually underneath it
notice<00:01:04.320> it's<00:01:04.500> got<00:01:04.650> bad<00:01:04.949> solder<00:01:05.580> joints<00:01:06.090> let's

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
notice it's got bad solder joints let's

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.690 
notice it's got bad solder joints let's
cook<00:01:06.810> them<00:01:07.110> put<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.470> there<00:01:07.619> no<00:01:07.920> just<00:01:08.430> touch<00:01:08.670> it

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
cook them put in there no just touch it

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.940 
cook them put in there no just touch it
and<00:01:08.939> finger<00:01:09.270> it's<00:01:10.170> nothing<00:01:10.500> virtually

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
and finger it's nothing virtually

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.980 
and finger it's nothing virtually
sitting<00:01:11.280> there<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.330> think<00:01:12.659> that's<00:01:12.840> probably

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
sitting there so I think that's probably

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.350 
sitting there so I think that's probably
a<00:01:13.170> lot<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.439> picture<00:01:13.710> wasn't<00:01:13.890> very<00:01:14.220> good<00:01:14.430> mister

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
a lot of picture wasn't very good mister

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.270 
a lot of picture wasn't very good mister
had<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.509> bad<00:01:15.750> connection

a 33 mile failure but I put a full it's
in<00:02:00.540> my<00:02:00.750> third<00:02:01.079> one<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.560> didn't<00:02:02.130> have<00:02:02.250> any<00:02:02.399> 33<00:02:02.850> so

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
in my third one I didn't have any 33 so

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.480 
in my third one I didn't have any 33 so
I<00:02:03.149> just<00:02:03.299> took<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.450> 47<00:02:04.020> one<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.189> think<00:02:05.399> it

Lillian<00:02:05.729> Meadows<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:05.969> much<00:02:06.680> mr.<00:02:07.680> tall<00:02:07.890> as

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
Lillian Meadows that much mr. tall as

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.839 
Lillian Meadows that much mr. tall as
long<00:02:08.369> as<00:02:08.459> it's<00:02:08.580> within<00:02:08.759> tolerance

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
long as it's within tolerance

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.170 
long as it's within tolerance
here's<00:02:10.719> another<00:02:10.840> contesta<00:02:11.590> which<00:02:11.739> forgot

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
here's another contesta which forgot

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.750 
here's another contesta which forgot
this<00:02:13.180> was<00:02:13.390> mostly<00:02:13.780> just<00:02:14.079> very<00:02:14.920> barely<00:02:15.400> started

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
this was mostly just very barely started

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.369 
this was mostly just very barely started
on<00:02:15.879> which<00:02:16.060> I<00:02:16.150> think<00:02:16.329> at<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.480> father<00:02:16.719> kept<00:02:17.019> anyway

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
on which I think at a father kept anyway

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.559 
on which I think at a father kept anyway
it's<00:02:18.040> worse<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:18.579> the<00:02:18.640> G<00:02:18.819> locks<00:02:19.030> are<00:02:19.209> never<00:02:19.359> in

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
it's worse and the G locks are never in

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.410 
it's worse and the G locks are never in
their<00:02:19.719> TLC<00:02:20.260> there's<00:02:21.099> a<00:02:21.189> 33<00:02:21.640> mark<00:02:21.909> authority

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
their TLC there's a 33 mark authority

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.910 
their TLC there's a 33 mark authority
that<00:02:22.540> you've<00:02:22.689> got<00:02:22.870> which<00:02:23.079> come<00:02:23.349> off<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.709> back

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
that you've got which come off the back

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.259 
that you've got which come off the back
just<00:02:24.189> say<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.400> Hornet<00:02:24.819> nips<00:02:25.060> that<00:02:25.150> are

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
just say the Hornet nips that are

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.449 
just say the Hornet nips that are
connected<00:02:25.659> with<00:02:25.689> the<00:02:25.780> Y's<00:02:25.989> on<00:02:26.260> it<00:02:26.379> the<00:02:27.220> horn

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
connected with the Y's on it the horn

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.059 
connected with the Y's on it the horn
that<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:27.819> where<00:02:27.939> I<00:02:28.030> can<00:02:28.180> test<00:02:28.329> the<00:02:28.540> Kofun<00:02:29.069> now

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
that is where I can test the Kofun now

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.259 
that is where I can test the Kofun now
replacing<00:02:30.700> that<00:02:30.819> with<00:02:31.319> this<00:02:32.319> GU<00:02:32.799> locks<00:02:32.980> on

still attached so there's a very low

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.309 
still attached so there's a very low
quality<00:03:26.590> circuit<00:03:27.340> boards<00:03:27.639> on<00:03:27.729> this<00:03:27.849> TV<00:03:28.319> yeah

quality circuit boards on this TV yeah
I'll<00:03:29.470> stick<00:03:29.620> their<00:03:29.799> capacity<00:03:30.340> in<00:03:30.430> touch<00:03:30.669> of

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
I'll stick their capacity in touch of

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.909 
I'll stick their capacity in touch of
the<00:03:30.879> register<00:03:31.299> see<00:03:32.109> if<00:03:32.199> I<00:03:32.290> got<00:03:32.409> far<00:03:32.470> nothing

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:32.919 
the register see if I got far nothing
