00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.140
 you know the situation finally 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.520
 they have to the opportunity with the 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.000
 they always speak 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.589
 wanted to 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.540
 But they have only little time to 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.250
 disposal and within these few 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.690
 time you just can not do it yourself 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.690
 make clear or 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.310
 they leave a lasting image 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.220
 So missed your chance 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.930
 a solution would be the elevator pitch of the 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.519
 Elevator pitch allows you 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.230
 within a few seconds 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.010
 lasting image rating conversation partner 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.199
 to leave 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.240
 How does that work? I tell them 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.120
 in this video tutorial by edo vision 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.920
 Training of the elevator pitch is one 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.500
 Oral business card could be said 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.760
 The idea is that you husband in 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.469
 the man has been riding for a long time 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.120
 wanted to meet for a long time and finally 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.710
 you can talk to him 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.829
 from the bottom to the top floor 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.260
 So it has only a few seconds or a maximum 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.430
 a minute time around you 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.190
 to present or 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.050
 to present his idea and basis 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.469
 for the elevator pitch that is a 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.410
 model aida stands for action interest 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.199
 desire and that is what so 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.229
 After all, yes, it's good, of course 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.600
 if you have a base pitch in stock 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.270
 So if you are always on a basic picture 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.189
 but they should always be able to access them 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.150
 change again and again after the situation 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.440
 So it's about it 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.720
 maybe you are at a conference 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.400
 and meet an investor then should 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.480
 they talk to them differently than with 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.160
 someone on one 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.890
 meet birthday party and the one 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.300
 potential customer could be so 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.510
 always match the patch on the 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.910
 Situation on the second tip, you take care of 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.070
 I mean a gripping state 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.210
 they ensure attention that they 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.940
 First you notice that you really get it 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.100
 listen and show that they are certain 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.570
 solve problems or we may 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.250
 of course there can be 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.140
 always what they have for it 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.520
 information what do you know but already 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.270
 definitely offer you one 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:55.300
 Add value and third tip be 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.410
 concretely , just use songs and 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.630
 also no complicated formulation 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.440
 but they formulate the sat down 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.090
 speak to 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.119
 use a language of the 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.530
 after the target is matched so 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.140
 For example, do not say us 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.000
 programming in php but we 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.010

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.600
 just to make it a little more appealing 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.070
 make a fourth tip to excite you 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.190
 Remember the company does not 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.570
 only know and to seek knowledge but 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.519
 of course the right people 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.650

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.780
 let her see you too 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.880

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.030
