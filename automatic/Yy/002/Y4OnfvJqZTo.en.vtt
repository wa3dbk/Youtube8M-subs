yeah anyways here's the other side of
that<00:01:50.890> camp<00:01:51.299> ground<00:01:52.299> assessment<00:01:52.840> we<00:01:52.960> were

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
that camp ground assessment we were

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:59.789 
that camp ground assessment we were
looking<00:01:53.320> at<00:01:54.000> area<00:01:55.439> called<00:01:57.149> black<00:01:58.149> oak<00:01:58.799> it's

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
looking at area called black oak it's

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.240 
looking at area called black oak it's
adjacent<00:02:00.250> to<00:02:00.549> and<00:02:00.880> just<00:02:01.060> east<00:02:01.299> of<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.570> lake

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250

the black oak

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.359 
the black oak
I<00:02:03.970> guess<00:02:04.240> camping<00:02:04.630> ground<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:08.190> but<00:02:09.190> I<00:02:09.220> was

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
I guess camping ground and but I was

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.160 
I guess camping ground and but I was
amazed<00:02:09.670> with<00:02:09.819> it<00:02:10.000> was<00:02:10.119> there's<00:02:10.630> an<00:02:10.720> extra<00:02:10.959> arm

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
amazed with it was there's an extra arm

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.220 
amazed with it was there's an extra arm
of<00:02:11.319> the<00:02:11.410> lake<00:02:11.590> that<00:02:11.769> goes<00:02:11.950> around<00:02:12.989> over<00:02:13.989> to<00:02:14.019> the

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
of the lake that goes around over to the

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.699 
of the lake that goes around over to the
side<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:16.569> you'll<00:02:16.810> get<00:02:16.930> a<00:02:16.989> closer<00:02:17.260> picture<00:02:17.500> of

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
side and you'll get a closer picture of

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.470 
side and you'll get a closer picture of
that<00:02:17.860> later<00:02:18.040> but<00:02:19.709> it's<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.890> lake<00:02:21.099> over<00:02:21.480> in

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
that later but it's the lake over in

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.630 
that later but it's the lake over in
that<00:02:22.630> direction<00:02:22.840> that's<00:02:23.380> where<00:02:23.680> we<00:02:23.890> were<00:02:24.069> on

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
that direction that's where we were on

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.050 
that direction that's where we were on
the<00:02:25.120> lake<00:02:25.330> you<00:02:25.950> can<00:02:26.950> see<00:02:27.099> it<00:02:27.250> through<00:02:27.519> the

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
the lake you can see it through the

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.839 
the lake you can see it through the
center<00:02:28.540> of<00:02:28.780> those<00:02:28.959> trees<00:02:29.370> if<00:02:30.370> you<00:02:30.459> look<00:02:30.610> close

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
center of those trees if you look close

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:37.250 
center of those trees if you look close
enough<00:02:34.799> that's<00:02:35.799> all<00:02:36.040> water<00:02:36.250> right<00:02:36.579> there

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.720 
this looks like even nicer place to camp
actually<00:02:49.950> then<00:02:50.950> that<00:02:51.100> place<00:02:51.280> we<00:02:51.430> were<00:02:51.549> walking

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
actually then that place we were walking

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.259 
actually then that place we were walking
it<00:02:52.000> back<00:02:52.380> there<00:02:53.400> it's<00:02:54.400> a<00:02:54.459> nice<00:02:54.609> grassy<00:02:54.880> area

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
down there too I'm gonna walk right over

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.670 
down there too I'm gonna walk right over
to<00:03:02.889> that<00:03:03.010> side<00:03:03.370> and<00:03:04.139> we'll<00:03:05.139> get<00:03:05.290> a<00:03:05.319> closer<00:03:05.560> look

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
to that side and we'll get a closer look

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.770 
to that side and we'll get a closer look
at<00:03:05.889> that<00:03:06.310> arm<00:03:06.459> of<00:03:06.579> the<00:03:06.670> lake<00:03:06.819> there's<00:03:07.540> quite

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
at that arm of the lake there's quite

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.280 
at that arm of the lake there's quite
surprised<00:03:08.290> when<00:03:09.220> I<00:03:09.400> saw<00:03:09.639> this<00:03:10.170> there's<00:03:11.170> an

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
surprised when I saw this there's an

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.500 
surprised when I saw this there's an
extra<00:03:11.590> arm<00:03:11.739> of<00:03:11.889> the<00:03:11.980> lake<00:03:12.100> over<00:03:12.400> here<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:15.510> you

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
extra arm of the lake over here and you

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.090 
extra arm of the lake over here and you
look<00:03:16.660> over<00:03:16.900> there<00:03:17.019> there's<00:03:17.319> even<00:03:17.620> more<00:03:17.859> of<00:03:17.980> the

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
look over there there's even more of the
