00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.620
 Hello 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.160
 friends of the theater and 6 my name is there and that is if the imperial quartet the 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.090
 bill points out as scenery 13 of the tedax so 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.110
 I started 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.949
 at that time ballesteros peralta of the number nine years 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.689
 it's on the courts 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.849
 and preferably of the colors 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.339
 brush to follow sidewalks 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:33.040
 painted will locate 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.040
 5th decorative 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.460
 and will be low or flags panista 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.040
 and in it 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.370
 I started 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.380
 we are going to cut out pieces of 10 centimeters long for the theater is 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.810
 true that I want basic 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.850
 We were going to remember that intimistas be warned 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.190
 you take tricks you want 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.350
 if we cut where it sits and without fearing 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.150
 and so we are going to be many little pieces 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.870
 until joining different 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.940
 this is our effectiveness 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.580
 two types of clients or what is thinner and one that is wider I do not 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.850
 will be that on the court and I'll show you how it's done 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.700
 let's drink 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.420
 challenge will be here let's see introduced 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.560
 inside the brush and let's press hard 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.899
 since you hear com 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.840
 if the science is broken we will pull hard but it is very plural 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.259
 then we're going to need the help that another hand 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.380
 for we can go 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.389
 press harder and we put as unnim 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.410
 both of instruments apt to exhale farc since it is making 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.070
 to the other side 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.310
 because if it's not going to be pretty light berger and so it is in the third act and 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.140
 four years experiences 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.409
 now the second one we are going to take 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:11.439
 the biggest possible that around our city 

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:15.039
 ibarz melet 20 centimeters shock 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:20.109
 and cut larger than 20 centimeters 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.169
 in quarters and short swecomex is not going to see 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:29.729
 we take again now I'm going to put the other side so they see the kind of 

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:30.489
 loyalty 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.559
 they express love 

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:34.959
 and with the help of another way 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.439
 now I'm going to show you how it's done 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.759
 Salamanca is low and if you spend it will be like this 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:46.349
 like skyteam pachón and it goes perfect then you have to leave some tips 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.349
 each end so that we do not go 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:53.359
 after that 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:56.539
 the third with the brush 

00:02:56.539 --> 00:03:00.919
 taking care not to reach the end to not break as we did right now 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:05.079
 later when we have all the bits 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:09.979
 the rise in the ages we take this double-sided appointment 

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:12.239
 we were here 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.359
 what if 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.379
 the idea we paste in this way 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.379
 Tomás Mendez 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.609
 5 we start to throw take off one side 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:30.199
 first is the center 

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:34.059
 because they are the smallest 

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:38.639
 and then we attach the other end of one after another objectives 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:41.319
 box that has layoffs 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.889
 30 50 that there is now a baccalaureate that lowers the age 

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:50.479
 rallies and sticking them one after the other without leaving space 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:51.999
 since it is like this 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:53.999
 now let's pull months 

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:55.699
 on the other hand 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:58.649
 we turn around and we're going to fight him 

00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:01.649
 not much with trinity 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.639
 legislature 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:09.639
 so if we cut 

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:13.959
 and we are giving your support 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.039

 although barack and that was font we cut 

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:08.629

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.080
 we underlined that we brought rehearsals and electoral claims among them 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.270
 Buenos Aires Dec 15 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.710
 not very fair 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.509
 but he has specified 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:57.169
 i verdasco mutating in happiness so you do not see rise

 and let's go developing years ago 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:04.949
 it can be a bit quick 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:06.330
 play at home 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.270
 they return to do accounts 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.430

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:21.830
 celebrate riots to point a friend 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.930

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:29.809
 a flower spin the scissors 

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:35.999
 because this one plays then 

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:38.999
 fifteen days of delinquency leave 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.290
