00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:07.660
 hello everyone today we are going to 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:10.510
 make some peppers or symptoms 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.760
 stuffed in a pan let's put a 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.460
 little oil and we are going to add 2 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.570
 chopped garlic cloves a white onion 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:21.040
 chopped 3 chopped tomatoes and 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:26.560
 about a pound and a half of 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:29.259
 Ground beef seasoned to taste and 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.829
 we are also going to add a spoonful of 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.829
 cumin 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:40.090
 a spoonful of paprika 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.620
 a spoonful of curry and a spoonful 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.460
 of garlic powder 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.860
 this is optional 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.739
 we mix everything very well so that the 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.850
 meat is cooked and incorporated with the 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.850
 other ingredients 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.420
 remember that the power of the flame 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.420
 it has to be half low 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.780
 when about 5 minutes have passed we 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.530
 to add the equivalent of 8 mushrooms 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.830
 little ones 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.030
 we mix again and let the 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.030
 another 5 minutes 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.990
 and then we are going to add three potatoes 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.330
 small this is optional I add them 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.610
 like puree because I like it that way but 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.330
 if you wish, you can cut it in 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.210
 cubes 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.260
 I also added half a cup of pasta 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.900
 tomato 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.300
 we mix the ingredients again and 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.550
 we let it cook about two minutes 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.040
 when we have finished cooking the 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.400
 filling we put out the fire and we leave it 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.400
 rest 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.430
 during this time we are going to deal with 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.680
 chiltoma peppers and what we're going to 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.030
 do is cut the top part that 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.030
 It will serve as a cover 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.619
 We will also remove the veins 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.719
 is that little white you can see we're going 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.700
 to do it with care not to perforate the 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:14.340
 pepper because if not the juice of the 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.340
 meat is going to come out and we do not want that 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.970
 then we are going to remove that part 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.920
 white where the seeds are and 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.730
 we're just going to cut it with the 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.860
 knife 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.489
 we repeat this step with others 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.489
 Peppers 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.760
 when we have finished we are going to 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.450
 place in a tray or tray and 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.980
 we proceed to fill the peppers 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.660
 trying not to fill them completely 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.350
 because we are going to add a bit of 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.350
 chopped basil 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.220
 and about one tablespoon of cheese 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.220
 to gratinate 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.530
 when we have finished filling 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.850
 all the peppers we take to the oven 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.150
 normally I put it the power more 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.610
 low so I leave it between 5 to 10 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.910
 minutes or until the 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.820
 melt cheese 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.310
 and ready so easy and fast is prepared 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.100
 my version of peppers or chiltomas 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.550
 stuffed I hope that this recipe has 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.260
