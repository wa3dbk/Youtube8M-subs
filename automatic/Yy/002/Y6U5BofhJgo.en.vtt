00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:49.260 

wait

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.000 

we're<00:03:50.270> disappointed<00:03:51.050> with<00:03:51.350> the<00:03:51.470> results

credit<00:03:52.670> to<00:03:52.790> see<00:03:52.940> Bonaventure<00:03:53.600> they<00:03:53.750> got<00:03:53.900> the

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
credit to see Bonaventure they got the

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.310 
credit to see Bonaventure they got the
goal<00:03:54.230> to<00:03:54.770> win<00:03:55.550> the<00:03:55.640> game<00:03:55.670> one<00:03:56.060> now<00:03:56.270> I<00:03:56.600> thought

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
goal to win the game one now I thought

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.950 
goal to win the game one now I thought
the<00:03:57.410> first<00:03:57.650> half<00:03:57.920> was<00:03:58.700> probably<00:03:59.390> a<00:03:59.480> little<00:03:59.540> bit

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
the first half was probably a little bit

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.650 
the first half was probably a little bit
better<00:04:00.110> for<00:04:00.440> them<00:04:00.730> in<00:04:01.730> the<00:04:01.910> second<00:04:02.330> half<00:04:02.510> I

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
better for them in the second half I

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.320 
better for them in the second half I
thought<00:04:02.810> it<00:04:02.900> was<00:04:02.990> all<00:04:03.140> of<00:04:03.230> us<00:04:03.880> on<00:04:04.880> a<00:04:05.000> different

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
thought it was all of us on a different

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.460 
thought it was all of us on a different
day<00:04:05.450> we<00:04:05.600> might<00:04:05.750> have<00:04:05.840> been<00:04:05.930> able<00:04:06.020> to<00:04:06.170> put<00:04:06.350> two

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
day we might have been able to put two

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.560 
day we might have been able to put two
or<00:04:06.560> three<00:04:06.740> past<00:04:07.010> him<00:04:07.280> but<00:04:07.880> but<00:04:08.060> ultimately

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
or three past him but but ultimately

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.700 
or three past him but but ultimately
they<00:04:08.840> were<00:04:08.900> able<00:04:09.170> to<00:04:09.610> keep<00:04:10.610> a<00:04:10.730> clean<00:04:10.940> sheet<00:04:10.970> and

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
they were able to keep a clean sheet and

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.590 
they were able to keep a clean sheet and
the<00:04:12.710> shots<00:04:12.890> we<00:04:13.040> ended<00:04:13.250> up<00:04:13.310> with<00:04:13.490> 14<00:04:13.820> 15<00:04:14.420> that
