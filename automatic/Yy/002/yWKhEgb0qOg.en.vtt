to be too close to it and so that was

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:47.779 
to be too close to it and so that was
the<00:01:46.200> only<00:01:46.259> thing<00:01:46.409> they<00:01:46.679> did<00:01:46.859> have<00:01:47.069> ins<00:01:47.249> dog<00:01:47.520> was

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
the only thing they did have ins dog was

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.419 
the only thing they did have ins dog was
robin's<00:01:48.209> egg<00:01:48.389> apparently<00:01:49.139> um<00:01:49.409> they<00:01:50.130> were<00:01:50.159> sold

normally<00:02:56.110> go<00:02:56.560> for<00:02:57.150> but<00:02:58.150> there's<00:02:59.140> a<00:02:59.440> reason<00:02:59.710> for

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
normally go for but there's a reason for

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.660 
normally go for but there's a reason for
this<00:03:00.480> no<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.660> reason<00:03:01.810> I<00:03:02.050> got<00:03:02.230> it<00:03:02.440> it<00:03:03.310> looks

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:11.070 
this no the reason I got it it looks
like<00:03:04.290> so<00:03:05.730> when<00:03:06.730> it's<00:03:06.910> watched<00:03:08.670> it<00:03:09.670> moves<00:03:10.240> like

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
like so when it's watched it moves like

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.160 
like so when it's watched it moves like
that<00:03:11.850> so<00:03:12.850> it's<00:03:13.150> just<00:03:13.360> a<00:03:13.540> really<00:03:13.710> pretty<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:16.180> soft

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
that so it's just a really pretty a soft

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.300 
that so it's just a really pretty a soft
gold<00:03:17.830> color<00:03:18.250> and<00:03:19.440> what<00:03:20.440> I<00:03:20.470> was<00:03:20.650> thinking<00:03:21.160> was
