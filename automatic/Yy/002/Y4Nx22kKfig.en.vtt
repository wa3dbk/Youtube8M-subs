00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
of worried about it like should i do

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.830 
of worried about it like should i do
tutorials<00:04:19.830> because<00:04:20.669> like<00:04:20.910> people<00:04:21.239> would<00:04:21.510> only

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
tutorials because like people would only

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.840 
tutorials because like people would only
watch<00:04:22.230> me<00:04:22.410> to<00:04:22.560> learn<00:04:22.680> things<00:04:23.010> then<00:04:23.220> I<00:04:23.490> don't

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
watch me to learn things then I don't

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.700 
watch me to learn things then I don't
want<00:04:24.090> to<00:04:24.150> be<00:04:24.240> that<00:04:24.270> sort<00:04:24.600> of<00:04:24.630> channel<00:04:25.050> I<00:04:25.230> think

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
want to be that sort of channel I think

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.140 
want to be that sort of channel I think
it's<00:04:25.830> kind<00:04:25.889> of<00:04:26.010> lame<00:04:26.070> to<00:04:26.460> base<00:04:26.639> a<00:04:26.669> channel<00:04:27.090> off

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
it's kind of lame to base a channel off

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.610 
it's kind of lame to base a channel off
the<00:04:27.240> tutorials<00:04:27.720> I<00:04:27.750> mean<00:04:27.870> some<00:04:28.050> people<00:04:28.290> do<00:04:28.440> it

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
the tutorials I mean some people do it

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.320 
the tutorials I mean some people do it
and<00:04:28.650> whatever<00:04:29.070> they<00:04:29.400> can<00:04:29.460> do<00:04:29.669> that<00:04:29.820> but<00:04:30.090> I

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
and whatever they can do that but I

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.719 
and whatever they can do that but I
think<00:04:30.810> like<00:04:31.169> overall<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:32.010> longevity<00:04:32.190> and

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
think like overall the longevity and

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:34.129 
think like overall the longevity and
making<00:04:33.000> a<00:04:33.060> channel<00:04:33.389> grow<00:04:33.600> doing<00:04:33.930> just

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
making a channel grow doing just

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:35.810 
making a channel grow doing just
tutorials<00:04:34.650> is<00:04:34.800> not<00:04:35.040> a<00:04:35.070> good<00:04:35.340> thing<00:04:35.550> and<00:04:35.610> I've

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
tutorials is not a good thing and I've

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.670 
tutorials is not a good thing and I've
had<00:04:36.000> a<00:04:36.030> number<00:04:36.270> of<00:04:36.419> people<00:04:36.570> ask<00:04:36.930> me<00:04:37.110> like<00:04:37.199> Dion

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
had a number of people ask me like Dion
