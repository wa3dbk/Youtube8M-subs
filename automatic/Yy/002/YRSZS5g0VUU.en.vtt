00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:10.349
 we are in a new blog video 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:17.670
 I think it's a good idea it's original 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:21.350
 so with different topics about a 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:26.660
 question of how I started collecting 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.660
 the little mothers that I have in my room 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.430
 with a story 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:01:00.210
 well I remember that one day who are the 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:03.070
 photos and soy plaza trail with a tipa 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.629
 with a tipa alone 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.270
 Y 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.400
 she where she rules a false and a half 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.530
 is about 11 years old 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.570
 and later 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.220
 but I hope to compensate for the 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.150
 films 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:26.680
 well I pay the filtered if I decided 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:28.600
 planet and just when the 360 ​​and well already 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.190
 do not bring the pigs to play the law 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:38.280
 rigid 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:38.280
 and the 2 so some little habits 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.200
 for all 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:02:00.110
 but what are you doing our 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:03.050
 small and I remember that he gave it to me 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.659
 and he was one of the men in the series 3 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.320
 kilos 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.320
 and that's it 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.510
 that they were outside to figure and to 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.930
 next day I remember that I got everything 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:28.590
 pressed in my house with the figurines 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.590
 and in January among others the envelopes and in 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:37.660
 a pendejo a review of the days of the 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.490
 people 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:45.090
 and is that the radio was active 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.090
 starting 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.040
 everything he wanted and 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:11.950
 and we all like it because this 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.110
 yes year 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.840
 It was pure shit but I do not like to sleep 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:20.620
 and that sometimes those senses services 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:24.180
 it has also runaway I remember that we 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.180
 has two subscribers 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:32.020
 and that's how all the good things started on the channel 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.020
 because what the shadow is different 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.460
 I think they should see it 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.800
 but we are for the first time in a 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.270
 small patio of my house here are my 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:48.170
 two little dogs 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:50.510
 soto your new tripp snap come as you 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.300
 condemns me in the shade ends I have 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.530
 many birds were always my life 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.330
 listen to the background of all the 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.910
 birds that do not let you record 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.160
 you have to have another cage 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.710
 and in this part that is like a small 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.510
 cloth here where they fly free there 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.910
 also the one in that fort there right now 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.950
 It has no water but there I had turtles and 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.870
 I also have a turtle and the inside 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.650
 from my house you have to go where the dogs 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.650
 they make their cakes 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.079
 and since everything is coming they fly from 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:26.840

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:30.639

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.670

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.180

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.620

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:58.650

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:24.689
 the wires in the shadows 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:32.580
