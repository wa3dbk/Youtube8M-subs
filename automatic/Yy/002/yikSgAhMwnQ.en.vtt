the freeway in fifth and sixth gear it's
a<00:02:02.480> bit<00:02:02.630> hard<00:02:02.840> to<00:02:02.900> accelerate<00:02:03.440> then<00:02:03.710> and<00:02:04.220> you're

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
a bit hard to accelerate then and you're

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.460 
a bit hard to accelerate then and you're
gonna<00:02:04.970> drop<00:02:05.240> it<00:02:05.390> back<00:02:05.510> to<00:02:05.690> fourth<00:02:05.960> but<00:02:06.260> apart

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
gonna drop it back to fourth but apart

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.190 
gonna drop it back to fourth but apart
from<00:02:06.560> that<00:02:06.790> runs<00:02:07.790> really<00:02:08.330> smoothly<00:02:08.810> and

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
from that runs really smoothly and

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.680 
from that runs really smoothly and
plenty<00:02:09.890> of<00:02:09.920> often<00:02:10.130> get<00:02:10.460> up<00:02:10.550> and<00:02:10.700> go<00:02:10.820> so<00:02:11.090> even

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
plenty of often get up and go so even

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.270 
plenty of often get up and go so even
though<00:02:11.780> I<00:02:11.810> tell<00:02:11.960> you<00:02:12.050> a<00:02:12.110> 1.4<00:02:12.650> engine<00:02:13.070> you

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
though I tell you a 1.4 engine you

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.040 
though I tell you a 1.4 engine you
wouldn't<00:02:13.700> know<00:02:13.880> that<00:02:13.910> it's<00:02:14.330> only<00:02:14.450> a<00:02:14.570> 1.4

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
wouldn't know that it's only a 1.4

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.720 
wouldn't know that it's only a 1.4
engine<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.710> turbo<00:02:16.100> in<00:02:16.250> there<00:02:16.400> gives<00:02:16.610> it

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
engine the turbo in there gives it

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.640 
engine the turbo in there gives it
plenty<00:02:16.970> of<00:02:17.090> plenty<00:02:17.600> of<00:02:17.750> power<00:02:17.990> away<00:02:18.320> from<00:02:18.530> the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
plenty of plenty of power away from the

plenty of plenty of power away from the
lights<00:02:18.830> so<00:02:19.490> very<00:02:19.760> impressed<00:02:20.120> with<00:02:20.300> that

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
push-button start which is which is a

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.220 
push-button start which is which is a
neat<00:02:45.200> little<00:02:45.320> gizmo<00:02:46.270> but<00:02:47.270> it<00:02:47.360> makes<00:02:47.540> hacking

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
neat little gizmo but it makes hacking

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.840 
neat little gizmo but it makes hacking
the<00:02:48.350> car<00:02:48.530> I<00:02:48.560> suppose<00:02:48.980> in<00:02:49.190> a<00:02:49.280> breaking<00:02:49.640> in<00:02:49.760> and

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
the car I suppose in a breaking in and

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.400 
the car I suppose in a breaking in and
hacking<00:02:50.180> it<00:02:50.270> makes<00:02:50.510> it<00:02:50.690> that<00:02:50.870> much<00:02:51.020> harder<00:02:51.080> to

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
hacking it makes it that much harder to

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.020 
hacking it makes it that much harder to
do<00:02:51.620> I<00:02:51.830> don't<00:02:52.400> know<00:02:52.489> it<00:02:52.550> might<00:02:52.670> make<00:02:52.850> it<00:02:52.940> easier

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
do I don't know it might make it easier

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.990 
do I don't know it might make it easier
who<00:02:53.450> knows<00:02:53.739> but<00:02:54.739> it's<00:02:55.160> just<00:02:55.280> a<00:02:55.430> little<00:02:55.550> gizmo

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
who knows but it's just a little gizmo

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.240 
who knows but it's just a little gizmo
or<00:02:56.239> a<00:02:56.270> little<00:02:56.540> gadget<00:02:56.870> and<00:02:57.020> it's<00:02:57.709> well<00:02:57.950> cool

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
or a little gadget and it's well cool

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.250 
or a little gadget and it's well cool
you<00:02:58.489> just<00:02:58.670> put<00:02:58.970> and<00:02:59.330> the<00:02:59.690> nice<00:02:59.870> little<00:03:00.080> thing

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
you just put and the nice little thing

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.170 
you just put and the nice little thing
about<00:03:00.320> the<00:03:00.440> safety<00:03:00.950> feature<00:03:01.160> of<00:03:01.430> it<00:03:01.520> on<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.880> on
