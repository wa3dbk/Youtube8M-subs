cells I've been in the freezer for four

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:18.449 
cells I've been in the freezer for four
years<00:01:15.350> and<00:01:15.880> they<00:01:16.880> sent<00:01:17.179> those<00:01:17.299> embryos<00:01:17.630> out

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:23.109 
years and they sent those embryos out
frozen<00:01:19.459> fedex<00:01:20.090> and<00:01:20.420> when<00:01:21.229> my<00:01:21.740> body<00:01:22.729> had<00:01:23.090> been

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
frozen fedex and when my body had been

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.929 
frozen fedex and when my body had been
prepared<00:01:23.829> those<00:01:24.829> embryos<00:01:25.069> were<00:01:25.429> transferred

about<00:01:31.039> three<00:01:31.369> years<00:01:31.549> ago<00:01:31.689> she's<00:01:32.689> certainly

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:33.109 
about three years ago she's certainly

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:35.589 
about three years ago she's certainly
the<00:01:33.439> joy<00:01:33.649> of<00:01:33.679> our<00:01:34.009> life<00:01:34.279> and<00:01:34.609> one<00:01:35.389> of<00:01:35.509> the

00:01:37.769 --> 00:01:37.779 
things that we've realized is that

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:43.149 
things that we've realized is that
through<00:01:38.779> this<00:01:38.899> process<00:01:39.999> that<00:01:41.979> because<00:01:42.979> she

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
through this process that because she

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.359 
through this process that because she
had<00:01:43.249> been<00:01:43.490> basically<00:01:44.619> held<00:01:45.619> in<00:01:45.799> suspended

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
had been basically held in suspended

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.389 
had been basically held in suspended
animation<00:01:46.490> at<00:01:47.119> two<00:01:47.329> cells<00:01:47.689> in<00:01:48.020> a<00:01:48.139> freezer<00:01:48.439> we

animation at two cells in a freezer we

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.449 
animation at two cells in a freezer we
become<00:01:49.789> acutely<00:01:50.209> aware<00:01:50.450> that<00:01:51.109> you<00:01:52.069> know<00:01:52.189> life

00:01:52.449 --> 00:01:52.459 
become acutely aware that you know life

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:54.030 
become acutely aware that you know life
must<00:01:52.789> begin<00:01:53.240> at<00:01:53.389> conception

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
must begin at conception

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.210 
must begin at conception
if<00:01:54.280> a<00:01:54.460> life<00:01:54.670> could<00:01:55.060> be<00:01:55.240> conceived<00:01:56.080> and<00:01:56.530> held

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
if a life could be conceived and held

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.670 
if a life could be conceived and held
frozen<00:01:57.910> for<00:01:58.180> four<00:01:58.390> years<00:01:58.660> in<00:01:58.960> a<00:01:59.050> freezer<00:01:59.350> and
