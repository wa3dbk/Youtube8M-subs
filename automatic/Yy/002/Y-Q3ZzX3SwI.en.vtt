cars<00:02:39.120> coming<00:02:39.569> I<00:02:40.260> think<00:02:41.129> they<00:02:41.250> need<00:02:41.459> like<00:02:41.640> a

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
cars coming I think they need like a

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.789 
cars coming I think they need like a
crossing<00:02:42.299> or<00:02:42.450> something<00:02:43.049> I<00:02:43.230> don't<00:02:43.319> know<00:02:43.500> it's

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
crossing or something I don't know it's

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.710 
crossing or something I don't know it's
a<00:02:43.980> little<00:02:44.340> dangerous<00:02:44.519> so<00:02:45.030> watch<00:02:45.840> out<00:02:46.940> so<00:02:47.940> again

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
a little dangerous so watch out so again

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.770 
a little dangerous so watch out so again
we<00:02:49.049> came<00:02:49.290> from<00:02:49.410> there<00:02:49.970> we're<00:02:50.970> not<00:02:51.120> very<00:02:51.329> making

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
we came from there we're not very making

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.180 
we came from there we're not very making
much<00:02:51.959> progress<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.560> I'm<00:02:52.680> probably<00:02:52.890> going<00:02:53.099> to

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
much progress and I'm probably going to

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.130 
much progress and I'm probably going to
be<00:02:53.280> end<00:02:53.489> up<00:02:53.610> late<00:02:53.849> for<00:02:53.879> the<00:02:54.150> translation<00:02:54.659> thing

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
be end up late for the translation thing

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.280 
be end up late for the translation thing
so<00:02:55.440> it's<00:02:56.370> okay<00:02:56.640> though<00:02:56.819> so<00:02:57.629> down<00:02:57.870> there<00:02:58.110> is<00:02:58.260> a

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
so it's okay though so down there is a

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.039 
so it's okay though so down there is a
path<00:02:58.560> that's<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:59.220> nice<00:02:59.370> little<00:02:59.579> side<00:03:00.480> path<00:03:00.810> to

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
path that's a nice little side path to

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.660 
path that's a nice little side path to
go<00:03:01.200> there<00:03:01.379> but<00:03:01.560> if<00:03:01.680> it's<00:03:01.859> raining<00:03:02.069> i<00:03:02.340> would<00:03:02.459> not
