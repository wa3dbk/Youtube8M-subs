well<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:03.929> game<00:00:04.110> of<00:00:04.259> tennis<00:00:04.440> itself<00:00:04.950> has

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
well the game of tennis itself has

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.769 
well the game of tennis itself has
changed<00:00:05.190> a<00:00:05.759> lot<00:00:05.910> over<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.270> past<00:00:06.299> 10<00:00:06.750> years

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
changed a lot over the past 10 years

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.870 
changed a lot over the past 10 years
especially<00:00:07.589> with<00:00:07.890> equipment<00:00:08.370> wise<00:00:08.519> from

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
especially with equipment wise from

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.400 
especially with equipment wise from
rackets<00:00:09.630> to<00:00:09.840> strings

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
rackets to strings

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.430 
rackets to strings
grips<00:00:11.219> just<00:00:12.059> about<00:00:12.240> everything<00:00:12.599> so<00:00:13.019> what<00:00:13.290> we

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
grips just about everything so what we

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.810 
grips just about everything so what we
needed<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.710> do<00:00:13.889> was<00:00:14.040> take<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.250> really<00:00:14.610> critical

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
needed to do was take a really critical

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.910 
needed to do was take a really critical
look<00:00:15.179> at<00:00:15.299> our<00:00:15.420> at<00:00:15.660> our<00:00:15.780> own<00:00:15.929> product<00:00:16.410> line<00:00:16.470> and

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
look at our at our own product line and

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.980 
look at our at our own product line and
see<00:00:17.699> what<00:00:17.820> we<00:00:17.940> could<00:00:18.060> do<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.300> redevelop<00:00:18.840> it

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
see what we could do to redevelop it

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.080 
see what we could do to redevelop it
re-engineer<00:00:19.680> it<00:00:19.710> redesign<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.820> better

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
re-engineer it redesign it to better

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.029 
re-engineer it redesign it to better
meet<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.600> needs<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:22.020> today's<00:00:22.080> modern<00:00:22.650> player

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
meet the needs of today's modern player

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.580 
meet the needs of today's modern player
and<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:23.670> we<00:00:24.150> went<00:00:24.300> back<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.750> drawing<00:00:24.990> board

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
and so we went back to the drawing board

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.740 
and so we went back to the drawing board
kicked<00:00:25.890> around<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.220> whole<00:00:26.430> lot<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.760> ideas<00:00:27.210> what

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
kicked around a whole lot of ideas what

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.689 
kicked around a whole lot of ideas what
we<00:00:27.779> came<00:00:28.050> up<00:00:28.199> with<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.980> something<00:00:29.519> that's

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
we came up with is is something that's

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.189 
we came up with is is something that's
definitely<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.210> step<00:00:30.570> on<00:00:30.779> that's<00:00:31.050> going<00:00:31.140> to

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
definitely a step on that's going to

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.049 
definitely a step on that's going to
give<00:00:31.380> players<00:00:31.679> more<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.250> what<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.820> game

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
give players more of what the game

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:40.310 
give players more of what the game
demands<00:00:37.520> the<00:00:38.520> M<00:00:38.640> 3.0<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.510> significantly

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320
