upstairs to the toppers I have to say

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:30.409 
upstairs to the toppers I have to say
initially<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.560> thought<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:29.669> was<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.849> try<00:00:30.149> but<00:00:30.329> a

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
initially I thought it was a try but a

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:37.840 
initially I thought it was a try but a
brilliant<00:00:30.689> take<00:00:31.340> break<00:00:32.340> by<00:00:32.579> Massey<00:00:32.970> tape<00:00:36.829> we

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
brilliant take break by Massey tape we

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.729

try its a try

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.740 
try its a try
and<00:00:41.190> certainly<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.820> crowd<00:00:42.089> feel<00:00:42.420> as<00:00:42.570> though

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
and certainly the crowd feel as though

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.200 
and certainly the crowd feel as though
it<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.260> think<00:00:43.829> perhaps<00:00:44.129> David<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.879> may<00:00:45.150> be

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
it is I think perhaps David you may be

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.890 
it is I think perhaps David you may be
right

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
right

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.630 
right

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
might be getting carried away here but

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.049 
might be getting carried away here but
his<00:00:47.760> left<00:00:48.600> knee<00:00:48.960> there

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
his left knee there

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.350 
his left knee there
go<00:00:51.510> down<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.350> was<00:00:52.469> over<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.039> line<00:00:53.070> but<00:00:53.969> did<00:00:54.210> it

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
go down it was over the line but did it

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.020 
go down it was over the line but did it
touch<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:55.590> should<00:00:55.860> tell<00:00:56.070> us<00:00:58.250> what<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.820> may

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
touch this should tell us what it may

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.389 
touch this should tell us what it may
not<00:01:00.269> tell<00:01:00.540> us<00:01:00.690> it's<00:01:01.110> well<00:01:01.829> listen<00:01:02.160> think<00:01:02.280> this

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
not tell us it's well listen think this

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.820 
not tell us it's well listen think this
could<00:01:02.579> be<00:01:02.610> the<00:01:02.820> telling<00:01:03.120> one<00:01:03.320> watch<00:01:04.320> his<00:01:04.530> left

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
could be the telling one watch his left

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.160 
could be the telling one watch his left
foot<00:01:05.070> there<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:06.360> time<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.780> he<00:01:06.840> puts<00:01:07.050> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
foot there and the time that he puts the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.270 
foot there and the time that he puts the
ball<00:01:07.320> down<00:01:07.380> oh<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.550> think<00:01:09.509> his<00:01:10.409> boot<00:01:10.680> was<00:01:10.890> up<00:01:11.070> and

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
ball down oh I think his boot was up and

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.050 
ball down oh I think his boot was up and
over<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.790> touch<00:01:11.970> line<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.110> case<00:01:14.060> it

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
over the touch line so in that case it

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:27.230 
over the touch line so in that case it
should<00:01:15.360> be<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.540> try<00:01:23.780> I<00:01:25.729> think<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.880> don't<00:01:27.119> think

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
should be a try I think I don't think

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.760 
should be a try I think I don't think
it's<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.539> that<00:01:27.840> picture<00:01:28.080> he<00:01:28.320> needs<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.649> look

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
it's that that picture he needs to look

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.550 
it's that that picture he needs to look
at<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.039> think<00:01:29.070> it's<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.399> end<00:01:29.640> on<00:01:29.850> picture<00:01:30.560> if

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
at I think it's the end on picture if

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.399 
at I think it's the end on picture if
Mark<00:01:31.920> Cueto<00:01:32.130> has<00:01:32.550> scored<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.240> nobody<00:01:34.200> will
