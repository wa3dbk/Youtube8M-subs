00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.820
 other video resources 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.340
 the camera 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.949
 the lot 4 camera application comes from 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.300
 default with a shortcut on the home page 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.590
 however you can also find a 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.109
 application list 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.119
 when you open the camera there will be activated 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.969
 will be ready to take photos 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.110
 I'll explain the interface here a bit 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.940
 on the left end 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.219

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.219
 edit some camera settings and 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.469
 chic and will activate hdr we will explain in 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.910
 short on the right 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.360
 you can switch between the front camera 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.129
 back on the lower left 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.100
 You can go to the gallery to see your 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.930
 photos of eloÃ¡ glued to the bike button on 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.539
 which you can change the type of photo you 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.760
 was to pull the large camera button on the 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.590
 center is for taking pictures while in 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.439
 great hard shape and will start to 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.939
 video recording and boy then it's for 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.240
 the photos will be saved to the 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.549
 sd card connected when flipping the galaxy 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.700
 note 4 to take photo in landscape 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.990
 see the rich also rotational 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.909
 Mexican that you can see for a moment 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.009
 in the center is the autocross 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.799
 whenever you see it and it means 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.460
 the camera is focusing on show now 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.080
 hdr hdr is a technology in the 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.930
 take pictures of places with little 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.850
 1.4 lighting is one of the few devices 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.670
 that can show in real time the 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.040
 hdr effects before you take the photo 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.409
 see that as soon as the asset is from r you 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.420
 can see the floor and the wall that before 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.369
 they were just a dark background beyond 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.579
 brighten the table and shadows 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.890
 caused by objects in configurations 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.560
 you have access to additional functions 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.939
 the flash icon is the flash that at the moment 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.909
 is disabled 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.950
 but when you touch it you can take it to the 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.710
 take a picture the flash will now 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.530
 triggered if you touch again in 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.969
 flash it will take the work of lightning the 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.009
 that means you're in the 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.619
 and will only activate when 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.770
 necessary besides the flash I'm going to leave 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.470
 off timer next to it 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.530
 a timer you can take a while 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.330
 waiting for two five or ten seconds 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.790
 for the picture to be taken after touching the 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.190
 button to use timer 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.380
 time on the screen and a sound when taking 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.710
 the photo to help know with the photo 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.830
 be taken next to the timer with 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.270
 wand icons to effects 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.860
 these effects are interesting 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.660
 use it when choosing one of the 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.060
 various effects you can see the 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.770
 result before taking the photo 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.660
 you can also apply these effects 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.120
 after taking the picture using the 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.610
 photo editing application on the whiteboard 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.560
 however if you wish you can take the photo 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.950
 directly with the effect using this 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.270
 there are several defects and even 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.340
 can download new 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.890
 see that the effects are applied in 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.420
 real time drawing effect cartoon 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.220
 very interesting 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.170
 the last item before entering the 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.980
 settings is the size of the 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.840
 Photograph 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.420
 at the moment we have the camera 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.480
 set at 16 megapixels is the size 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.370
 maximum that 94 can capture the greater 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.360
 the number of megapixels higher quality 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.780
 of the picture 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.730
 but larger file size also 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.190
 You can decrease the size of the photo by 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.990
 save space and take more photos 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.130
 This is a matter of choosing space. 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.410
 available 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.040
 in addition the different proportions for 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.180
 you choose as 16 by 94 for three and 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.160
 one by one 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.630
 try taking a photo in proportions 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.640
 different ways to understand how it 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.280
 it works 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.990
 the right icon is the most options when 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.670
 touch it to access settings 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.950
 the camera 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.380
 I'll explain only a few in this video. 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.390
 you can change the size of the video here 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.720
 and change the storage location and 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.790
 USB card and device know however that 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.459
 continuous photos and the photos are taken 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.470
 When you hold the grin button alone 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.600
 can be saved in the positive due to 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.670
 capture speed as stated in 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.620
 message 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.500
 the video size you can enable 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.300
 recording mode on four bitches 24 and 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.790
 by default in full hd 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.609
 besides these configuration functions you 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.070
 you can activate useful functions by enabling view 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.470
 photos and videos whenever you capture 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.349
 a photo or record a video it will be 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.210
 shown to you shortly after 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:33.210
 so you can analyze the photo and 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.979
 decide whether you need to take other or not 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.050
 last simple function that I will explain 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.159
 the advanced settings is to play 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.250
 to take photos 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:44.189
 the name already reveals that the function does activate 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.569
 there you can touch the area you require and the 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:48.750
 camera will take a photo 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:50.909
 automatically afterwards see that with 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.740
 this function of high touch on the spot 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:54.960
 it was just focusing the camera 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.610
 As I said at the beginning of this video 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.080
 You can tap the link on the tip. 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:05.069
 lower left to see all the 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:06.750
 photos taken in mode you can choose 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:07.740
 one of several camera modes to take 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.409
 Photograph 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.569
 by default night 4 take the photo in mode 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:14.639
 Automatically detect the 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:17.580
 type and adjusts the camera to 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.680
 best photo other currencies including self 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.419
 of the back camera a novelty in the lot 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.490
 4 that lets you take pictures of you 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:25.439
 even easier than before. 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.199
 detect your face and take a photo 

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:30.090
 automatically selective focus and 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:32.340
 allows you to choose the focus point and 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.469
 change after taking the picture and the 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.509
 panorama is a known way to clip the 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:38.699
 People take a photo bomb to give their 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:41.610
 and attach the photos you have taken 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:44.190
 but these are not the only ways and 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.979
 you can download more as you wish 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.440
 I showed the button and took a photo 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:51.560
 simple and quick but touch the 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.330
 camcorder will start recording a video 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.669
 when recording a video you can have 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.740
 recording time information size 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:59.460
 current and size available on the 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.080
 top 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.819
 you can also tap the 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.009
 the camera to take a picture during the 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:07.199
 but remember that this picture is 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:10.199
 in the same resolution as the video 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:11.849
 You can also pause recording and 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:14.099
 continue to save space 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:17.069
 and keep all the videos in the same 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:19.409
 file by tapping the stop recording will 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:21.779
 finalizing the video can be viewed and 

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:23.719
 shared by touching the 

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:26.430
 gallery you can see videos too 

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:28.139
 tap the play icon it asks in 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.360
 which app you want to open 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:32.889
 I will choose the video player the video will be 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.330
 reproduced 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:37.339
 realize that night 4 also succeeds. 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.539
 record and preview the videos with the 

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:40.279
 dr 

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:45.709
 now video can have effects 

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:47.449
 interesting last basic function is 

00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:49.999
 interesting thing you demonstrate is the 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:51.919
 quick shot when taking a photo 

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:54.469
 if you keep the button pressed 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:56.119
 instead of just touching night 4 is taking away 

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:58.309
 up to 30 consecutive shots 

00:06:56.119 --> 00:06:59.869
 but what you should know about this 

00:06:58.309 --> 00:07:01.219
 capture type is that by speed 

00:06:59.869 --> 00:07:02.779
 be very fast 

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:04.550
 the photos will be saved in the internal memory 

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:07.699
 and not on an SD card 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:10.039
 How can you see here in the bay? 

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:11.990
 you can also tap the grid camera on the 

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:14.270
 gallery to go directly to it 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:16.249
 well these are just some functions 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.629
 basic and interesting features of the 

00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:19.939
 garrote 4 

00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:22.279
 It is very simple to use and you 

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:23.869
 simply need to count and capture 

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:25.550
 without having to worry too much about 

00:07:23.869 --> 00:07:26.659
 set it up because she does everything 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.300
 automatically 

00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:30.830
 do not miss our next video can not 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.929
 how to use resources 

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:35.949
