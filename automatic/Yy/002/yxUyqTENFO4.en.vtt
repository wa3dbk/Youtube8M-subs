see<00:01:19.380> here<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.189> PDS<00:01:20.790> defenders<00:01:21.330> will<00:01:21.540> write

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
see here is a PDS defenders will write

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.530 
see here is a PDS defenders will write
out<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.320> line<00:01:22.860> see<00:01:23.759> how<00:01:23.909> causes<00:01:24.390> some

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
out the line see how causes some

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.210 
out the line see how causes some
confusion<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.110> both<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.350> those<00:01:25.560> players<00:01:25.799> open

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
confusion so both of those players open

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.530 
confusion so both of those players open
I<00:01:26.310> mean<00:01:26.460> if<00:01:26.549> they<00:01:26.580> don't<00:01:26.790> have<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.939> safety<00:01:27.210> over

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
I mean if they don't have a safety over

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.969 
I mean if they don't have a safety over
the<00:01:27.659> top<00:01:27.869> here<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.140> definitely<00:01:28.650> want<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.860> hit

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
the top here you definitely want to hit

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.980 
the top here you definitely want to hit
the<00:01:29.070> street<00:01:29.280> for<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.490> touchdown<00:01:29.729> but<00:01:30.150> since<00:01:30.900> the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
the street for a touchdown but since the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.359 
the street for a touchdown but since the
safeties<00:01:31.320> over<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.650> top<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.979> safer<00:01:32.340> option

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
safeties over the top the safer option

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.980 
safeties over the top the safer option
let's<00:01:32.759> go<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.299> corner<00:01:33.570> on<00:01:33.600> here<00:01:33.840> if<00:01:33.900> you

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
let's go to the corner on here if you

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.100 
let's go to the corner on here if you
want<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.259> tag<00:01:34.409> deep<00:01:35.509> also<00:01:36.509> doing<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.810> duck<00:01:36.960> out

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
want to tag deep also doing the duck out

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.260 
want to tag deep also doing the duck out
the<00:01:37.140> back<00:01:37.229> with<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.680> very<00:01:37.890> good<00:01:38.100> read<00:01:38.280> well<00:01:39.000> once

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
the back with a very good read well once

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.550 
the back with a very good read well once
you<00:01:39.360> cut<00:01:39.540> up<00:01:39.720> with<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.930> middle<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.380> see

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
you cut up with the middle you see

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.800 
you cut up with the middle you see
you'll<00:01:40.680> get<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> little<00:01:41.549> separation<00:01:41.909> here<00:01:42.299> but

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
you'll get a little separation here but

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.060 
you'll get a little separation here but
the<00:01:42.899> dragon<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.259> always<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.560> quickest<00:01:43.860> read

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
the dragon is always the quickest read

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.249 
the dragon is always the quickest read
you<00:01:44.880> can<00:01:45.000> use<00:01:45.149> your<00:01:45.270> caches<00:01:45.600> lent<00:01:45.840> out<00:01:45.960> if<00:01:46.140> you

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
you can use your caches lent out if you

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.109 
you can use your caches lent out if you
if<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.649> have<00:01:46.770> put<00:01:46.950> stick<00:01:47.250> work<00:01:47.490> just<00:01:47.970> by

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
if you have put stick work just by

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.090 
if you have put stick work just by

there now on defense you know victims

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.820 
there now on defense you know victims
own<00:01:56.790> coverage<00:01:57.210> anything<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.689> very<00:01:57.900> easy<00:01:58.590> to

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
own coverage anything is very easy to

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.370 
own coverage anything is very easy to
exploit<00:01:59.400> probably<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.450> know<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.350> a

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
exploit probably you know this is a

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.440 
exploit probably you know this is a
great<00:02:01.710> zombie<00:02:01.920> is<00:02:02.490> probably<00:02:02.880> easier<00:02:03.420> to

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
great zombie is probably easier to

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.600 
great zombie is probably easier to
exploit<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.930> man<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.500> here<00:02:04.770> now<00:02:05.220> we<00:02:05.340> just<00:02:05.369> have<00:02:05.490> a
