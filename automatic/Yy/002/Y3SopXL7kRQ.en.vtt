00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.340
 and what would friends be a new map a 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:12.750
 new a new one is a map of what 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:17.460
 would be equipment a team trap 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.920
 or experience for television 0.12 point 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.840
 zero any mobile since it works in 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.140
 any fine unless we have 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.640
 now wave he is the mop stoner and that 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.650
 can do the gas and over the water at 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.309
 less that and that they add more lives to 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.070
 on Tuesday after that the truth is going to 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.420
 keep working and also forgive me 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.030
 wrong at the beginning that you add 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.280
 more more lives there is no problem because 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.989
 you can do something higher 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.910
 then guys I also want to say that 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.270
 I hope you are going to like this video 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.270
 why 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.710
 I thought between the one who does the 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.590
 Longer videos no longer but more 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.840
 edited and those things so that the video 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.780
 be more entertaining and like it more you know 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.340
 very well first that I do not go to 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.620
 appear here will not appear here 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.150
 When the map is serge I will not see if 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.490
 I can make it appear up here for 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.190
 at the moment on the map when you enter 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.840
 the bonus map when it appears and is 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.380
 here because he's going to put it up says 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.720
 here and you are going to enter you are going to enter and you are going to 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.550
 You see this hallway you can enter 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.010
 stronger and power council we can see 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.280
 this the map was made for me and what 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.650
 I've seen what happened to me twitter 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.750
 what happened it seems that a follower of 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.060
 ken gamer channel provider 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.860
 destruction and suture in the description and 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.630
 let's go through the hallway there 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.570
 we have portals to put as they gave 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.549
 see with a big big size yo 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.470
 climb the stairs let's get by 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.350
 here a room where we will have the 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:50.840
 improved enchantment table you can 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:56.850
 see here we're going to have more things and one 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:59.369
 of these with armor and all good 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.560
 here is the trap so here 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.630
 let's have the snot and we will be able to 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.920
 killing them with a single blow does not have to 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.580
 be with a haunted tool neither 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.350
 nothing 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.899
 with your fist you can give it a point and 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.850
 die ok you can see and more time what 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.330
 you let more time be more maps appear 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.670
 and when it also appears more modern you go 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.550
 to have more objects there you can see no 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.470
 xp will leave his experience and already have 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.450
 experience we keep the two objects in 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.160
 the chest here where it is put here is not 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.470
 necessary but good 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.030
 you can, but wherever you want, but I do not 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.769
 and what are we going to do good, I'm going to open 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.360
 here this here a little bit to be able 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.940
 go up here you can teach how 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.330
 the trap works ok let's put it 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:42.660
 this here to not give you live here 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:46.980
 we have a crystal where he brought water 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.569
 where it would take us to the trap ok how 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.810
 the trap works like I said we're going to 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:54.390
 see a second let's go here 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.940
 going down and coming to what 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.130
 it would be around here let's hope that 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.870
 let's say let's kill that skeleton to 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.150
 that does not miss 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:08.099
 I come here and I'm here because I do not 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.099
 I could not do it at the beginning either 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.640
 besides crossing with seal very well we are going to 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.250
 remove that thing from here so it does not 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.200
 problems and very well here we can see 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.390
 what would be how it works we will have 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.320
 a bus pauner of zombie cut or 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.000
 skeleton or robots that is that so 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.000
 I can cross the elevator and I do not know 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.500
 locks like the chandelier Lerman 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.680
 it does not work because you of laporta and 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.790
 they hurt themselves with water I say that 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.850
 it would work more for the skeletons and 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.890
 zombies ok this would work here 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.750
 we would have a 9 x 9 box or 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.020
 proposals for 10 I think it's one for 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.810
 once and 99 where we had here in 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:52.470
 motorcycles and put three to three blocks of 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.720
 water I think if 12 water blocks sees two 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.990
 blocks of water from the 99 valleys 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.210
 where is the 99 here we are going to put water 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.590
 when you put the water the mods go to 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.240
 begin to appear if there is nothing 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.790
 only light will begin to appear 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.220
 the maps and every monster that appears 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.490
 its time to go by this current to 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.550
 put the juices here 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:16.340
 the games are going to go around here 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.989
 was going to form something here in the center and 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.690
 what happens because it is in those two fires 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.850
 for action or if a mouse arrives 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.700
 put there on that side or this side 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.640
 go through the middle and can cross the 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.990
 rope or that when they pass through the door 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.780
 I'm going to do as a skeleton 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.450
 actually as you can see 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.430
 each motorcycle is beat between contributing 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:40.910
 they are doing very well to what 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:43.460
 Was it good here when I got here 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.400
 as they jump they're going to go 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.230
 going up like this by the water elevator of 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.790
 it has its intelligence intelligence 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.100
 artificial so they go love watching for 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.950
 water that goes wrong in climbing height 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.510
 when they go up high you go to 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.919
 see that they are going to move for the voice alone 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.290
 because then that this water onion 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:01.730
 what happens that by the height 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.350
 they also die because it's the same as 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.870
 we have controlled in the year by height 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:09.440
 so what happens here we have had its 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:13.150
 web for we give ourselves a blow and we finish 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.680
 here and what exactly happens we end 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.450
 dying in one fell swoop or the skeleton 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.160
 ends up dying in one fell swoop as 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.960
 you can see premiering collage now that 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.780
 we are seeing everything just from one blow 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.210
 it's that easy to leave everyone with just one 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.810
 with what would be 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:33.900
 a half heart mail that is a blow 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.539
 we already killed him that's the good thing because we 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:39.090
 is going to 6 no tool and that's because 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.410
 sometimes there are traps that do not leave you alone 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.930
 hit and you have to take it with you 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.550
 tool and that does not and that does not waste me and 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.210
 never material but not birds 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.520
 home 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.500
 This is your own fist and you kill it and 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.539
 ready and some guys that creates all the 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.940
 map or that would be all the trap 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:56.759
 wait for everyone is the easiest is a 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.460
 trap easier do not spend almost a lot 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:00.660
 material is the other way around and you are less 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.910
 only thing you have to do is make you 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.220
 by chopping down make your exit from 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.960
 down and ready and guys I hope you 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.360
 liked this video remember that also 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.280
 I'm going to do what this video would be like more 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.080
 irritated and I say that I hope that they 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.669
 like guys the audio forgives and not 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.190
 I can improve the audio of what I wanted 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:20.190
 these sounds that are outside the sound 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:22.050
 of them because right now I do not have 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.699
 a few audio theme with a microphone when 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.319
 I have a hearing aid with a microphone 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:28.610
 get a microphone and could record 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:28.610
 better the audio but for now I can not 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.560
 write comment 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.040
 Doubts 

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:46.720
 and now yes 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.000
 I said it will be for your things 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.270
 and
