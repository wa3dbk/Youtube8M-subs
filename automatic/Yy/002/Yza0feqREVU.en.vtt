 all salute you see the dentist as 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.910
 always with you Lesha united music store 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.770
 and today I will tell you about the microphone 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.770
 blue yeti let's go 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.630
 This video was prepared by 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.520
 united music support 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.080
 here you can find absolutely everything and 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.670
 even more and with the participation 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.619
 muse business information portal 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.110
 the best lessons webinars meeting and much 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.720
 another as always equipment in the best 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.160
 Tradition 2 microphone stand instruction and 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.960
 cable is all you need for 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.760
 full work recall that with 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.290
 the first time you turn on the system automatically 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.910
 determines the device is enough for you 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.160
 insert the cable and after a few seconds 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.720
 everything will be ready for use design 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.760
 This is what blu has always stood out among 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.890
 dominance of nondescript similar products 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.630
 children did not become an exception metallic with 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.490
 matt silver paint on which 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.740
 do not remain prints something like 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.270
 star wars droids stand soft 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.820
 lining that prevents accidental 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.780
 bias and sustainability 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.100
 the design allows you to change the angle 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.800
 tilt thereby giving the opportunity 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.420
 fine tune its position fixation 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.430
 by using fasteners 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.080
 the sides of them need to tighten enough 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.850
 tight as you can see in my case 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.920
 neglected this fact and as a result 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.900
 got peeled paint due to 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.939
 drop the mic and don't repeat my 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.740
 errors on the front of the logo 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:16.540
 chapter companies will find the adjustment 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.950
 headphone volume which will tell 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.020
 a little later and the new button 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.520
 which simply stops 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.690
 record during the test I came in 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.520
 perplexed why the rest 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.200
 manufacturers ignore this moment 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.030
 do you think this function should be 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.190
 implemented everywhere at the bottom of the case 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.870
 various connectors for 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.180
 power connection cable used 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.370
 mini yusb who sits tight in the nest 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.190
 does not falter unlike the standard 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.720
 usb obd ii as a result is much more convenient 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.120
 the possibility of fixing on 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.710
 studio rack and headphone connection 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.200
 which means that there is a function 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.000
 direct monitoring when you can immediately 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.250
 listen to record without delay thing 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.810
 irreplaceable it constantly uses 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.270
 rear gain adjustment is waiting for us 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.810
 incoming signal and my favorite modes 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.090
 records 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.650
 This is the same highlight blu want to draw 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.299
 note that this function does not occur 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.250
 only in top solutions but also in 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.229
 budget which we observed during 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.450
 review snowball as usual microphones 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.459
 one new caps is used these these them 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.710
 immediately three that allows you to use 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.870
 four modes 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.090
 and now in order bidirectional or 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.280
 eight removes sound from the front and rear 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.750
 muffling sounds around is useful when 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.030
 duet recordings or interviews 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.980
 omnidirectional record 360 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.840
 degrees around its axis in mode 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.520
 yeti cardioid is mainly used 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.680
 for vocals as recorded only 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.650
 what is in front of him well and finally 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.080
 the last mode is stereo mode yes yes you are not 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.180
 misheard exactly stereo is now possible 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.920
 create a stereo picture without resorting to 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.020
 double track am and other technicians 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.140
 you will have the left channel and the right channel 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.330
 together in one file for me is the top 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.160
 iceberg coolness yeti while I'm on 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.630
 joy to run in whether to record singing 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:03:17.880
 birds and the noise of foliage I offer you 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:03:19.890
 listen to the vocal test recording if 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.840
 original uncompensated file 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.070
 can be downloaded on our channel itself Cloud 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.570
 son right below the video 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.010
 Speaking of cons, I note that for 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.260
 professional vocal recording 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.300
 tools and would be under red in any 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.160
 case will have to get a good 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.110
 pop filter 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.250
 goes further requires so much 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.230
 extra attention during 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.420
 fixing if you of course 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.769
 here and save your mic 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.049
 presentable as well, finally 3 minus 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.000
 minus all condenser microphones they 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.250
 extremely sensitive to grace about it already 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.110
 mentioned so be careful in 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.180
 write time and don't put your optimus 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.640
 the values of a and c are much more but i 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.959
 I will dwell only on the main ones 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.470
 nice nice design 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.690
 materials used ergonomics straight 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.450
 monitoring without delay adjustment 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.930
 monitoring volume and adjustment 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.000
 gaina 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.250
 and finally the whole modes that 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.680
 turn go to a full-fledged combine 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.129
 absolutely for everything you can do 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:17.100
 record vocals and instruments to write off 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:20.340
 your podcasts interview and finally 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:24.840
 record full stereo and all that 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:26.220
 I will remind for 200 dollars by the way known 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.630
 the team we love to use for 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.979
 their homes microphone will 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.169
