also it could connect to the handset

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.069 
also it could connect to the handset
cord<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.640> telephone<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.360> that's<00:01:30.840> built

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
cord of a telephone and that's built

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.620 
cord of a telephone and that's built
right<00:01:31.229> into<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.670> comes<00:01:32.850> with<00:01:33.000> both<00:01:33.240> a

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
right into this it comes with both a

right into this it comes with both a
size<00:01:34.049> telephone<00:01:34.740> cords<00:01:35.509> these<00:01:36.509> are<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.689> little

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
size telephone cords these are a little

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.149 
size telephone cords these are a little
bit<00:01:36.990> different<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.500> one's<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.799> little<00:01:37.920> bit

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
bit different this one's a little bit

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.249 
bit different this one's a little bit
bigger<00:01:38.369> because<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.210> made<00:01:39.479> for<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.810> wall

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
bigger because that is made for a wall

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.319 
bigger because that is made for a wall
jack<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.700> little<00:01:41.909> bit<00:01:42.030> smaller

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
jack and this is a little bit smaller

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.480 
jack and this is a little bit smaller
that's<00:01:42.689> made<00:01:42.930> for<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.229> telephone<00:01:43.619> handset<00:01:44.220> cord

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
that's made for a telephone handset cord

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.609 
that's made for a telephone handset cord

telephone or if you are a business then
this<00:04:01.060> is<00:04:01.209> how<00:04:01.330> you<00:04:01.390> would<00:04:01.540> connect<00:04:01.840> it<00:04:01.989> using

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 
this is how you would connect it using

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.850 
this is how you would connect it using
handset<00:04:03.330> mode<00:04:04.330> these<00:04:05.170> are<00:04:05.590> a<00:04:05.620> little<00:04:05.709> bit

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
handset mode these are a little bit

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.199 
handset mode these are a little bit
smaller<00:04:06.160> so<00:04:06.250> you<00:04:06.489> would<00:04:06.640> use<00:04:06.670> the<00:04:06.910> smaller

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
smaller so you would use the smaller

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.770 
smaller so you would use the smaller
cord<00:04:07.600> and<00:04:08.470> what<00:04:09.130> you<00:04:09.220> would<00:04:09.340> do<00:04:09.459> is<00:04:09.640> unplug<00:04:10.570> the

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
you would use this line and plug that

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.830 
you would use this line and plug that
back<00:04:18.100> into<00:04:18.489> your<00:04:18.669> phone<00:04:18.880> base<00:04:19.150> where<00:04:19.450> you<00:04:19.570> just

use the handset to speak you would plug

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.040 
use the handset to speak you would plug
that<00:04:24.580> in<00:04:24.760> there<00:04:24.789> so<00:04:25.240> this<00:04:25.450> would<00:04:25.630> sit<00:04:25.840> on<00:04:25.930> your

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
that would be plugged into there and you

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.970
