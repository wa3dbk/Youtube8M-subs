00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.900
 hello my name is pauline cauchefer 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.530
 I'm 15 years old I'm champion of 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.699
 new caledonia in category handi 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.160
 Pauline I know since fall to 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:21.670
 little chemists I discovered the surf 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.900
 thanks to my friends we surfed for the 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.690
 first time together 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.410
 I was little I was 12 years old and that's where 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.410
 where it all started 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.050
 Pauline is a young girl who has 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.300
 started surfing denture on bourail 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.150
 that I had me in activity especially 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.920
 Wednesday that the As it was 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.140
 put in each commune after 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.120
 I was spotted by pat who he created the 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.730
 so it was a little bit more 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.020
 high that the surf club at bourail they 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.960
 were really there all the time for 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.700
 me and really taught me everything and that's 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.620
 thanks to him that I'm here for him 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.360
 did it really follow the initiation phase 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.890
 she is very assiduous she is tenacious 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.260
 who is not afraid to take big 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.460
 waves and she does not let herself in 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.180
 this male environment 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.740
 she is immediately operational on 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.540
 the questions we ask him a vision 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.909
 of the wave that is who is very good 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.680
 Pauline I will meet 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.080
 in the surf group workout with 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.510
 because they have a capacity to 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.520
 understanding of the wave of these young people 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.840
 who may be able to analyze 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.250
 their surfing 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.150
 Finally she is a good girl 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.930
 it's a good waitress I think I 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.930
 can still improve 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.259
 for me surfing is sharing 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:54.470
 friendship 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:57.200
 the meetings the good feelings 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.720
 it's cool what my favorite surface 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.210
 it's carissa moore it's my example 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.679
 I love his way of surfing without 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.570
 that she really has the power of a 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:07.570
 man and this is the best for me 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.010
 before when I saw more often or in 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.019
 almost any tension for the 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.250
 week-end week workouts 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.870
 seems for the moment has not gone to 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.090
 high school she stays more often nicknamed to 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.579
 I had to go to Noumea for my schooling 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.489
 pauline and second in high school blaise 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:27.079
 Paschal in class with non arranged schedules 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.299
 organize hourly tours but 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.019
 which are not very effective regarding 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.700
 surf 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.680
 at first it was a little hard I 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.760
 did not know a lot because he 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.959
 there was no wave 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.640
 during these time slots it may 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.920
 still go swimming at the 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.390
 physical restraint or super g 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.340
 no coach so not really that this 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.519
 be motivated I am paddling and 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.049
 swimming with jeanne and marilou she 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.140
 also in turn with me we know each other 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.850
 since we are very small but we have 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.350
 announced really close with the surf 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.989
 we are in the same class so I am 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.430
 not at all lost this year we can 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.620
 more really done because in noumea 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.350
 it's complicated but the last one 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.850
 was going to surf three times a week 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.320
 had more weekend we do not come back 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:18.430
 all the time to bourail so you're hard to 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:19.570
 progress anyway I'm doing a lot 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.850
 because I love sport 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.590
 stay a little with my family too because 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.960
 that it takes a lot is a superb 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.980
 small sup and funny hours on 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.060
 fishing and a girl when she likes 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.650
 make them jokes 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.960
 she is always keen to laugh is 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.730
 positive and we are really accomplices I 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.409
 love them I love them so much 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.849
 family is everything for me 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:47.330
 my goal for next year that 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.160
 it's getting into the 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.570
 sport studies in Hossegor that would be 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.100
 really the ideal if I want to continue 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.050
 my palmares 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.060
 we would like what she continues 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.310
 to persevere it will really do 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.960
 progress because of express schedules 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.330
 to surf while traveling a lot 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.100
 so that would be really ideal 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.180
 maybe be hard at first but I 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.810
 really think she had called me city 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.920
 is there she is the will I think 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.510
 when we are passionate what we want 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.400
 it is to reach its maximum 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.710
 I just hope I would like 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.540
 that my job is really surfer 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.070
 professional and of course we do everything 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.750
 for who succeeded on will accompany him 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.040
 because it's a dream that vocal 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.040
 she realizes
