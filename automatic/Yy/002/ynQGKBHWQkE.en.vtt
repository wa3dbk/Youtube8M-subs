00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
a Harrier as well and you should never

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.030 
a Harrier as well and you should never
call<00:02:35.209> in<00:02:35.420> a<00:02:35.599> payload<00:02:36.080> when<00:02:36.440> there's<00:02:36.650> a<00:02:36.739> Harrier

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040
