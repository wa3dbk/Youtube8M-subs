from and so i have to turn this
operating<00:00:15.590> system<00:00:15.980> into<00:00:16.190> something<00:00:16.520> that<00:00:16.550> can

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:16.699 
operating system into something that can

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:18.340 
operating system into something that can
actually<00:00:16.940> develop<00:00:17.300> android<00:00:17.750> applications

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
actually develop android applications

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.300 
actually develop android applications
and<00:00:18.529> i'm<00:00:18.590> going<00:00:18.680> to<00:00:18.740> need<00:00:18.859> to<00:00:18.920> install<00:00:19.279> a

couple things in order for it to work
most<00:00:21.650> notably<00:00:21.919> the<00:00:22.369> java<00:00:22.730> development<00:00:23.210> kit

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:23.359 
most notably the java development kit

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:25.089 
most notably the java development kit
we're<00:00:23.929> going<00:00:24.050> to<00:00:24.140> also<00:00:24.230> need<00:00:24.529> to<00:00:24.619> install<00:00:24.890> the

we're going to also need to install the
clips<00:00:25.519> ide<00:00:25.849> which<00:00:26.660> is<00:00:26.839> the<00:00:27.019> preferred<00:00:27.439> ide<00:00:28.099> for

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
clips ide which is the preferred ide for

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.279 
clips ide which is the preferred ide for
setting<00:00:28.970> up<00:00:29.119> android<00:00:29.480> applications<00:00:30.019> and<00:00:30.199> then

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
setting up android applications and then

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:31.989 
setting up android applications and then
the<00:00:30.439> android<00:00:30.769> development<00:00:31.189> kit<00:00:31.310> itself<00:00:31.669> and

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:31.999 
the android development kit itself and

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:33.490 
the android development kit itself and
so<00:00:32.599> we're<00:00:32.720> going<00:00:32.810> to<00:00:32.930> go<00:00:32.989> through<00:00:33.200> the<00:00:33.260> first

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.700 
setting up the java jdk the second video
is<00:00:38.030> going<00:00:38.359> to<00:00:38.420> be<00:00:38.510> on<00:00:38.719> the<00:00:38.840> eclipse<00:00:39.199> and<00:00:39.530> then

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
is going to be on the eclipse and then

itself and so we're going to start from

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:46.119 
itself and so we're going to start from
a<00:00:44.840> basic<00:00:45.199> installation<00:00:45.469> of<00:00:45.800> windows<00:00:46.100> seven

this is a 32 bit operating system that
I've<00:00:48.890> currently<00:00:49.100> got<00:00:49.309> installed<00:00:49.730> and<00:00:50.090> I'm

java<00:01:35.270> if<00:01:35.450> you<00:01:35.540> really<00:01:35.720> want<00:01:35.900> to<00:01:35.990> some<00:01:36.409> of

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
java if you really want to some of

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.140 
java if you really want to some of
people<00:01:36.800> use<00:01:36.950> netbeans<00:01:37.220> and<00:01:37.550> so<00:01:37.670> forth<00:01:38.000> and

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
people use netbeans and so forth and

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.810 
people use netbeans and so forth and
java<00:01:38.720> ee<00:01:38.930> however<00:01:39.440> we<00:01:40.100> want<00:01:40.220> to<00:01:40.340> focus<00:01:40.460> on<00:01:40.670> this

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
java ee however we want to focus on this

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.190 
java ee however we want to focus on this
one<00:01:41.000> just<00:01:41.210> because<00:01:41.420> we're<00:01:41.869> going<00:01:41.960> to<00:01:42.050> be<00:01:42.170> using

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
one just because we're going to be using

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.430 
one just because we're going to be using
eclipse<00:01:43.040> instead<00:01:43.580> as<00:01:43.820> our<00:01:44.360> IDE<00:01:44.660> so<00:01:45.200> let<00:01:45.289> me<00:01:45.350> go

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
eclipse instead as our IDE so let me go

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.290 
eclipse instead as our IDE so let me go
ahead<00:01:45.470> and<00:01:45.590> click<00:01:45.830> on<00:01:45.979> this<00:01:46.220> I'm<00:01:47.060> going<00:01:47.210> to

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
ahead and click on this I'm going to

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.870 
ahead and click on this I'm going to
need<00:01:47.420> to<00:01:47.600> agree<00:01:48.380> to<00:01:48.410> the<00:01:48.729> license<00:01:49.729> agreement

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
need to agree to the license agreement

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.090 
need to agree to the license agreement
here<00:01:50.420> to<00:01:50.660> download<00:01:51.140> and<00:01:51.619> it<00:01:51.710> says<00:01:51.890> right<00:01:51.920> here

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
here to download and it says right here

except<00:01:52.580> license<00:01:53.119> agreement<00:01:53.600> so<00:01:53.750> I'll<00:01:53.810> go

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
except license agreement so I'll go

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:55.570 
except license agreement so I'll go
ahead<00:01:53.930> and<00:01:54.050> click<00:01:54.259> on<00:01:54.440> this<00:01:54.619> one<00:01:54.860> here<00:01:55.100> and

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
then I need to choose the platforms I

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.570 
then I need to choose the platforms I
want<00:01:57.560> to<00:01:57.649> work<00:01:57.770> with<00:01:57.800> and<00:01:58.160> I'm<00:01:58.250> going<00:01:58.399> to<00:01:58.460> work

want to work with and I'm going to work
with<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:58.850> windows<00:01:59.210> x86<00:01:59.869> this<00:02:00.590> is<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:00.890> 32-bit

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
with the windows x86 this is the 32-bit

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.249 
with the windows x86 this is the 32-bit
platform<00:02:02.000> so<00:02:02.600> let<00:02:02.690> me<00:02:02.750> go<00:02:02.869> ahead<00:02:02.899> and<00:02:03.050> use<00:02:03.229> that

platform so let me go ahead and use that
if<00:02:03.560> you<00:02:03.679> are<00:02:03.710> using<00:02:04.009> 64-bit<00:02:04.369> platform<00:02:05.210> then

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
if you are using 64-bit platform then

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.529 
if you are using 64-bit platform then
you<00:02:05.450> want<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.720> x86<00:02:06.340> 64<00:02:07.340> I'm<00:02:08.300> going<00:02:08.420> to<00:02:08.479> go

key<00:05:18.129> combination<00:05:18.789> and<00:05:19.300> i've<00:05:19.599> added<00:05:19.810> that<00:05:20.199> to

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:20.469 
key combination and i've added that to

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:22.200 
key combination and i've added that to
the<00:05:20.500> environment<00:05:21.310> variable<00:05:21.699> for<00:05:21.940> the<00:05:22.000> path

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
the environment variable for the path

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.350 
the environment variable for the path
variable<00:05:22.240> so<00:05:22.719> I'm<00:05:22.810> go<00:05:22.900> ahead<00:05:23.050> and<00:05:23.139> hit<00:05:23.199> OK<00:05:23.500> and

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
variable so I'm go ahead and hit OK and

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.800 
variable so I'm go ahead and hit OK and
we'll<00:05:25.360> hit<00:05:25.479> OK<00:05:25.719> again<00:05:25.870> and<00:05:26.289> ok<00:05:27.250> and<00:05:27.460> close<00:05:28.419> this

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
we'll hit OK again and ok and close this

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.749 
we'll hit OK again and ok and close this
out<00:05:29.020> so<00:05:29.229> this<00:05:29.379> concludes<00:05:29.530> the<00:05:29.919> first<00:05:30.129> video<00:05:30.400> on

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:30.759 
out so this concludes the first video on

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:33.899 
out so this concludes the first video on
setting<00:05:31.389> up<00:05:31.629> the<00:05:31.840> Java<00:05:32.139> development<00:05:32.800> kit<00:05:32.979> for

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:33.909 
setting up the Java development kit for

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:36.629
