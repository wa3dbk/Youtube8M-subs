00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
now that we've done that we can start to

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.560 
now that we've done that we can start to
maintenance<00:00:45.070> on<00:00:45.220> the<00:00:45.310> chain<00:00:45.550> the<00:00:46.150> first<00:00:46.360> thing

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
maintenance on the chain the first thing

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.450 
maintenance on the chain the first thing
we<00:00:46.660> need<00:00:46.810> to<00:00:46.840> do<00:00:47.050> is<00:00:47.290> to<00:00:47.470> check<00:00:47.680> if<00:00:47.920> the<00:00:48.190> chain

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
we need to do is to check if the chain

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.060 
we need to do is to check if the chain
is<00:00:48.670> okay<00:00:49.270> do<00:00:49.870> we<00:00:49.990> need<00:00:50.140> to<00:00:50.260> replace<00:00:50.380> this<00:00:50.830> chain

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
is okay do we need to replace this chain

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.980 
is okay do we need to replace this chain
or<00:00:51.250> can<00:00:51.370> we<00:00:51.460> just<00:00:51.490> do<00:00:51.790> maintenance<00:00:52.060> I'm<00:00:52.720> using

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:52.990 
or can we just do maintenance I'm using

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.960 
or can we just do maintenance I'm using
an<00:00:53.170> easy<00:00:53.380> change<00:00:53.680> checker<00:00:53.980> here<00:00:54.310> put<00:00:54.610> it<00:00:54.730> into

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
an easy change checker here put it into

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.820 
an easy change checker here put it into
a<00:00:55.000> roller<00:00:55.300> and<00:00:55.570> if<00:00:55.720> it<00:00:55.870> sits<00:00:56.080> on<00:00:56.260> a<00:00:56.320> roller<00:00:56.620> like

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:56.830 
a roller and if it sits on a roller like

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.890 
a roller and if it sits on a roller like
so<00:00:57.130> at<00:00:57.280> an<00:00:57.370> angle<00:00:57.760> that<00:00:58.210> means<00:00:58.420> our<00:00:58.570> chain<00:00:58.780> is

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 
so at an angle that means our chain is

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.440 
so at an angle that means our chain is
okay<00:00:59.230> I'm<00:01:00.100> gonna<00:01:00.310> check<00:01:00.610> another<00:01:00.820> spot<00:01:01.210> on<00:01:01.360> the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
okay I'm gonna check another spot on the

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.189 
okay I'm gonna check another spot on the
chain<00:01:01.690> just<00:01:02.260> to<00:01:02.440> make<00:01:02.590> sure<00:01:03.809> same<00:01:04.809> it's

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
chain just to make sure same it's

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.779 
chain just to make sure same it's
sitting<00:01:05.530> on<00:01:05.619> an<00:01:05.770> angle<00:01:06.100> so<00:01:06.189> that<00:01:06.310> means<00:01:06.609> it's

00:01:06.779 --> 00:01:06.789 
sitting on an angle so that means it's

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:07.319 
sitting on an angle so that means it's
okay

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:07.329 
okay

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:09.389 
okay
however<00:01:08.109> I'd<00:01:08.469> like<00:01:08.710> to<00:01:08.829> make<00:01:08.979> a<00:01:09.009> little<00:01:09.189> bit

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:09.399 
however I'd like to make a little bit

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:10.919 
however I'd like to make a little bit
more<00:01:09.549> accurate<00:01:09.969> reading<00:01:10.329> using<00:01:10.509> a<00:01:10.719> digital

00:01:10.919 --> 00:01:10.929 
more accurate reading using a digital

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:14.060 
more accurate reading using a digital
chain<00:01:11.380> checker<00:01:12.299> squeeze<00:01:13.299> the<00:01:13.479> arms<00:01:13.749> together

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
chain checker squeeze the arms together

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.940 
chain checker squeeze the arms together
press<00:01:15.070> zero<00:01:15.460> to<00:01:15.609> calibrate<00:01:16.770> while<00:01:17.770> you're

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
press zero to calibrate while you're

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.529 
press zero to calibrate while you're
still<00:01:18.249> holding<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.729> chain<00:01:18.969> checker<00:01:19.119> together

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:19.539 
still holding the chain checker together

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:22.109 
still holding the chain checker together
you<00:01:20.200> can<00:01:20.350> insert<00:01:20.770> it<00:01:20.950> into<00:01:21.069> the<00:01:21.280> chain<00:01:21.520> like<00:01:21.880> so

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
you can insert it into the chain like so

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.779 
you can insert it into the chain like so
and<00:01:22.329> then<00:01:23.140> carefully<00:01:23.409> let<00:01:23.799> go<00:01:23.979> you<00:01:24.460> can<00:01:24.640> see

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
and then carefully let go you can see

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:26.429 
and then carefully let go you can see
that<00:01:24.969> this<00:01:25.090> chain<00:01:25.299> is<00:01:25.450> way<00:01:25.719> before<00:01:26.109> point

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
that this chain is way before point

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.349 
that this chain is way before point
eights<00:01:26.649> so<00:01:27.009> we<00:01:27.219> can<00:01:27.429> perform<00:01:27.609> maintenance<00:01:27.969> on

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:28.359 
eights so we can perform maintenance on

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:33.709 
eights so we can perform maintenance on
this<00:01:30.840> now<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:31.899> first<00:01:32.200> thing<00:01:32.350> I<00:01:32.469> want<00:01:32.679> to<00:01:32.710> do<00:01:32.859> is
