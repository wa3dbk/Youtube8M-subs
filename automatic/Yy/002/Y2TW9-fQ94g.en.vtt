00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:01.550
 the 4 aspect of those yes while instead 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:06.740

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:27.349
 pokémon which in the thematic deck says spin 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:29.210

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:32.450
 open the fantastic 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:37.669

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:42.770
 leade drina niente a 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:48.160
 the real time war that well designed 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:52.940
 of the terek with the Russian that instead god 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:54.289
 the almiron networks to the deluxe emotion that 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.430
 they can't show you why it comes out 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:06:01.880
 after events its absolute novelty for 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:04.250
 whoever says sorry we must say that 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.050
 obviously an end will strengthen it 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.050
 over when recording when 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.650
