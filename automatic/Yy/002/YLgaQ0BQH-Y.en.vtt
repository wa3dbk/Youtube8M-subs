00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.160
 Hoffnungheim pauses and bank together 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.649
 the entire bundesliga continues to be around 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.960
 live from boris vukcevic after one 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.790
 serious car accident lies the 22 year old 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.040
 still in the artificial koma state 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.150
 is still critical but stable 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.119
 that is a very difficult situation 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.240
 I think the hardest situation is 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.340
 the team ever had no 24 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.050
 hours after the accident occurred his 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.340
 in the Bundesliga against the 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.470
 to augsburg 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.329
 The result became absolute 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.579
 incidentally the game was like one 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.710
 moving memorial event the 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.540
 host wore jersey with the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.579
 number 7 the guests t shirts with 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.230
 recovery wishes the decision 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.969
 to compete at all 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.200
 Hope home his teammates after long 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.809
 Talk to the team 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.640
 psychologist jan meyer 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:55.949
 After weighing up all sorts of things 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.090
 then with the team an attitude 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:03.059
 originated by being in the middle 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.180
 the hope has been placed 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:10.760
 that we play here today 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:15.930
 For Boris play fight for him because 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:19.049
 He and we know that from many things 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.820
 the points of view that know him he does that 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.979
 wanted 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:27.680
 he is a fighter and he will fight 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:32.400
 and we will do the same at noon today 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:35.030
 The team is also important too 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.670
 that we got a feedback 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:42.210
 from his parents who said yes 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.880
 plays for wales fought the entire 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.100
 Football world thinks of Boris Vukcevic and 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.350
 supports in this difficult time too 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.750
 his teammates in Hoffnungheim in the first 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.939
 moment I say I have completely honest 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.130
 also said we have to play this game 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.540
 cancel 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.860
 I think the team was on 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:05.460
 in the beginning, too, but ultimately 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.899
 Team then in the conversation really 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.900
 in detail they have that for and against 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.540
 spoken and I have the 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.780
 decisive points from then also the 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.579
 guys know as boris very good and 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.829
 that's why it was crucial 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:24.069
 Criterion because also agree for the 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:26.209
 guys we play for him 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.220
 Huisheim's trainer Markus Babbel 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.680
 sent the players into a two-day 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.519
 time off the cause of the accident is still 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.290
 unclear 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.090
 but it is investigated whether it is 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.409
 a sugar shock acted boris 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.409
 vukcevic is diabetic
