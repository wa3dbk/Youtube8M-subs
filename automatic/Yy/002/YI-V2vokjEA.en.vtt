talking at them build orders I will not

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.280 
talking at them build orders I will not
be<00:00:11.460> showing<00:00:11.670> you<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.360> perfect<00:00:12.599> build<00:00:12.960> order

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
be showing you the perfect build order

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.020 
be showing you the perfect build order
for<00:00:13.500> this<00:00:13.650> build<00:00:13.950> but<00:00:14.370> it<00:00:14.490> will<00:00:14.639> be<00:00:14.790> showing

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
for this build but it will be showing

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.660 
for this build but it will be showing
you<00:00:15.269> what<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.139> good<00:00:16.529> build<00:00:16.800> order<00:00:17.070> will<00:00:17.220> always

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
you what a good build order will always

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.609 
you what a good build order will always
consist<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.570> what<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.779> bad<00:00:19.080> build<00:00:19.350> order

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
consist of and what a bad build order

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.620 
consist of and what a bad build order
would<00:00:19.740> consist<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.490> build<00:00:21.119> orders<00:00:21.449> will

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
would consist of build orders will

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.740 
would consist of build orders will
constantly<00:00:22.199> change<00:00:22.320> as<00:00:22.890> patches<00:00:23.760> change<00:00:24.090> what

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
constantly change as patches change what

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.750 
constantly change as patches change what
needs<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:25.109> come<00:00:25.140> forth<00:00:25.560> will<00:00:25.800> change<00:00:26.070> but<00:00:26.640> the

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
needs to come forth will change but the

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.730 
needs to come forth will change but the
basic<00:00:26.789> principle<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.930> good<00:00:28.140> build<00:00:28.410> order

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
basic principle of a good build order

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.790 
basic principle of a good build order
should<00:00:29.160> remain<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.910> same<00:00:30.320> now<00:00:31.320> first<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.740> all

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
should remain the same now first of all

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.260 
should remain the same now first of all
to<00:00:32.009> place<00:00:32.219> multiple<00:00:32.640> structures<00:00:32.850> when<00:00:33.180> you

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
to place multiple structures when you

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.229 
to place multiple structures when you
hold<00:00:33.480> shift<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:34.440> queue<00:00:34.829> up<00:00:34.950> like<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.700> now<00:00:36.210> a

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
hold shift you queue up like this now a

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.560 
hold shift you queue up like this now a
good<00:00:36.570> build<00:00:36.870> order<00:00:37.170> will<00:00:37.320> always<00:00:37.649> consist<00:00:38.129> of

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
good build order will always consist of

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.959 
good build order will always consist of
multiple<00:00:39.570> buildings<00:00:40.250> really<00:00:41.250> close<00:00:41.730> together

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
multiple buildings really close together

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.590 
multiple buildings really close together
around<00:00:42.629> really<00:00:43.020> close<00:00:43.320> together<00:00:43.530> like<00:00:43.890> this

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
around really close together like this

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.850 
around really close together like this
reducing<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.719> walk<00:00:45.960> time<00:00:46.320> for<00:00:46.739> your

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
reducing the walk time for your

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.160 
reducing the walk time for your
commander<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:48.149> lower<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.600> walk<00:00:48.809> turn<00:00:49.079> that

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
commander the lower the walk turn that

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.500 
commander the lower the walk turn that
your<00:00:49.320> commander<00:00:49.739> has<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.460> better<00:00:50.789> your

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
your commander has the better your

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.510 
your commander has the better your
commander<00:00:51.840> will<00:00:51.960> be<00:00:52.050> able<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.410> get<00:00:52.559> much<00:00:53.129> more

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
commander will be able to get much more

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.560 
commander will be able to get much more
done<00:00:54.199> in<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.739> quick<00:00:56.039> time<00:00:56.340> instead<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.329> having

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
done in a quick time instead of having

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.869 
done in a quick time instead of having
to<00:00:57.690> walk<00:00:57.989> all<00:00:58.050> over<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.800> place<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.219> really

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
to walk all over the place and really

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.819 
to walk all over the place and really
really<00:01:00.180> mess<00:01:00.359> up<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.170> will<00:01:01.289> build<00:01:01.530> order

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
really mess up so it will build order

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.770 
really mess up so it will build order
will<00:01:01.949> look<00:01:02.100> some<00:01:02.309> like<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.640> face<00:01:02.910> condensed

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
will look some like this face condensed

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.690 
will look some like this face condensed
ready<00:01:03.989> together<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:05.159> can<00:01:05.309> add<00:01:05.460> like

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
ready together and you can add like

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.700 
ready together and you can add like
another<00:01:05.970> team<00:01:06.270> very<00:01:06.689> close<00:01:06.900> boy<00:01:07.170> as<00:01:07.290> well<00:01:07.530> not

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
another team very close boy as well not

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.039 
another team very close boy as well not
a<00:01:07.740> factory<00:01:08.189> there<00:01:08.570> and<00:01:09.570> then<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.780> can<00:01:09.900> see

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
a factory there and then you can see

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.270 
a factory there and then you can see
what<00:01:10.200> commander<00:01:10.530> doesn't<00:01:10.799> have<00:01:10.950> as<00:01:11.100> much

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
what commander doesn't have as much

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.570 
what commander doesn't have as much
walking<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.970> do<00:01:12.119> as<00:01:12.830> what<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:13.860> will<00:01:14.070> now<00:01:14.250> show

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
walking to do as what I will now show

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.810 
walking to do as what I will now show
you<00:01:14.610> as<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.330> body<00:01:15.720> pillow<00:01:16.100> now<00:01:17.100> i'm<00:01:17.310> going<00:01:17.670> to

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
you as a body pillow now i'm going to

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.510 
you as a body pillow now i'm going to
show<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.030> guys<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.689> bad<00:01:19.320> build<00:01:19.650> order<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.130> bad

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
show you guys a bad build order a bad

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.429 
show you guys a bad build order a bad
build<00:01:20.790> order<00:01:21.119> will<00:01:21.270> look<00:01:21.479> something<00:01:22.200> like

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
build order will look something like

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.230 
build order will look something like
this

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.499 

all<00:01:25.810> over<00:01:26.770> the<00:01:26.860> place<00:01:27.100> everything<00:01:28.000> really<00:01:28.210> far

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
all over the place everything really far

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.440 
all over the place everything really far
apart<00:01:28.630> I<00:01:29.350> now<00:01:30.159> look<00:01:30.369> his<00:01:30.729> commander<00:01:31.119> builds

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
apart I now look his commander builds

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.300 
apart I now look his commander builds
that<00:01:31.570> he<00:01:31.689> walks<00:01:31.930> all<00:01:32.170> the<00:01:32.200> way<00:01:32.439> over<00:01:32.890> here<00:01:32.920> then

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
that he walks all the way over here then

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.340 
that he walks all the way over here then
he<00:01:33.430> walks<00:01:33.700> there<00:01:34.000> walking<00:01:34.689> all<00:01:34.899> around<00:01:35.080> the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
he walks there walking all around the

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.090 
he walks there walking all around the
place<00:01:35.500> which<00:01:35.770> does<00:01:36.040> not<00:01:36.220> need<00:01:36.430> to<00:01:36.670> be<00:01:36.700> doing<00:01:37.030> it

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
place which does not need to be doing it

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.219 
place which does not need to be doing it
reduces<00:01:39.509> efficiency<00:01:40.509> early<00:01:40.840> on<00:01:40.960> in<00:01:41.110> the<00:01:41.200> game

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
reduces efficiency early on in the game

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.590 
reduces efficiency early on in the game
so<00:01:41.950> this<00:01:42.100> is<00:01:42.280> a<00:01:42.310> very<00:01:42.580> bad<00:01:42.880> builder<00:01:43.180> you<00:01:43.450> don't

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
so this is a very bad builder you don't

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.730 
so this is a very bad builder you don't
do<00:01:43.810> something<00:01:43.840> like<00:01:44.200> this<00:01:45.210> really<00:01:46.530> these<00:01:47.530> are

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
do something like this really these are

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.039 
do something like this really these are
the<00:01:47.799> basics<00:01:48.220> of<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:48.399> build<00:01:48.610> order<00:01:48.939> as<00:01:49.090> patches

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
the basics of the build order as patches

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:51.570 
the basics of the build order as patches
come<00:01:50.289> and<00:01:50.439> go<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.979> build<00:01:51.189> order<00:01:51.460> will

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
come and go the build order will

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.859 
come and go the build order will
constantly<00:01:51.939> change<00:01:52.090> whether<00:01:52.509> you<00:01:52.659> build

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
constantly change whether you build

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.330 
constantly change whether you build
factory<00:01:53.320> forced<00:01:53.710> our<00:01:53.830> metaphors

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
factory forced our metaphors
