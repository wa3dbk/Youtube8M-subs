00:00:01.725 --> 00:00:03.423
 In stroke 

00:00:03.423 --> 00:00:05.829
 or manifest warning signs of stroke, 

00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:09.630
 such as sudden stiffness on one side of the body, 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.586
 immediate medical attention should be sought, 

00:00:12.586 --> 00:00:16.340
 so that the doctor can diagnose some things. 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.004
 First, did a stroke develop or not? 

00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:23.591
 Second, how bad is the stroke. 

00:00:23.591 --> 00:00:24.509
 Third, 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.806
 what may be the underlying cause of this stroke. 

00:00:27.806 --> 00:00:30.104
 Again, the stroke is an emergency medical case, 

00:00:30.104 --> 00:00:33.579
 so immediate medical attention should be sought. 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:35.804
 How to diagnose a stroke. 

00:00:35.804 --> 00:00:37.941
 In a few steps. 

00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:39.845
 At the first step, the doctor should take it off 

00:00:39.845 --> 00:00:41.910
 detailed medical history. 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.941
 This means that you or your family member, 

00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:48.122
 if you are disoriented or you can not talk, 

00:00:48.122 --> 00:00:49.887
 you or a family member will need 

00:00:49.887 --> 00:00:52.963
 to explain to the doctor what happened to suppose, 

00:00:52.963 --> 00:00:55.366
 that a stroke may have occurred. 

00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.723
 The doctor will then ask 

00:00:57.723 --> 00:00:59.789
 for the symptoms that have occurred. 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.109
 Whether there was a severe headache, 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:05.768
 which may be an indication of a haemorrhagic stroke. 

00:01:05.768 --> 00:01:07.016
 Or if there was 

00:01:07.016 --> 00:01:09.158
 sudden weakness of limbs 

00:01:09.158 --> 00:01:11.062
 or in the facial muscles. 

00:01:11.062 --> 00:01:12.223
 Or if there were any problems 

00:01:12.223 --> 00:01:14.719
 with vision or balance. 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:15.903
 I will ask questions 

00:01:15.903 --> 00:01:18.806
 to check the memory, the speech, 

00:01:18.806 --> 00:01:21.164
 even thinking, 

00:01:21.164 --> 00:01:24.262
 because one or all of them can be affected by a stroke, 

00:01:24.262 --> 00:01:27.501
 depending on which part of the brain has been injured. 

00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:29.625
 In addition to questions about symptoms 

00:01:29.625 --> 00:01:32.621
 will also be given for the presence of risk factors 

00:01:32.621 --> 00:01:34.327
 for stroke development. 

00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:36.243
 They will ask if you have a diagnosis 

00:01:36.243 --> 00:01:37.764
 hypertension. 

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:41.421
 Because we know that chronic high blood pressure, 

00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:44.559
 hypertension, predisposes 

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:48.665
 to a certain type of stroke such as a haemorrhagic stroke. 

00:01:48.665 --> 00:01:49.920
 They will ask you 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.602
 if you have any heart disease, 

00:01:51.602 --> 00:01:55.399
 such as cardiac fibrillation or a previous heart attack, 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.102
 because both are risk factors for stroke. 

00:01:59.102 --> 00:02:02.643
 They will ask you about high cholesterol or whether you smoke, 

00:02:02.643 --> 00:02:05.139
 because both are too big 

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:06.984
 risk factors for stroke. 

00:02:06.984 --> 00:02:09.071
 Remember that the first step 

00:02:09.071 --> 00:02:11.803
 when diagnosing a stroke is to get a very good picture 

00:02:11.803 --> 00:02:13.742
 of what's going on with the patient. 

00:02:13.742 --> 00:02:15.936
 This is done through this medical history, 

00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:18.316
 this interview. 

00:02:18.316 --> 00:02:20.463
 The second step is done by the doctor 

00:02:20.463 --> 00:02:23.203
 complete neurological examination of the patient. 

00:02:23.203 --> 00:02:24.620
 What is this? 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.618
 What does it include? 

00:02:25.618 --> 00:02:28.682
 It's not as scary as it sounds. 

00:02:28.682 --> 00:02:30.900
 This is a physical review of 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.397
 some of the neurological functions. 

00:02:33.397 --> 00:02:36.798
 This is to be observed for signs that there was a stroke. 

00:02:36.798 --> 00:02:40.594
 Motor skills, which are the ability to move, 

00:02:40.594 --> 00:02:43.542
 the perceptions of upper and lower limbs 

00:02:43.542 --> 00:02:46.051
 will be tested in several different ways. 

00:02:46.051 --> 00:02:47.839
 Then it will be checked and 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:49.499
 some of the special perceptions, 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:51.344
 such as hearing and vision. 

00:02:51.344 --> 00:02:53.098
 They'll probably make you fill 

00:02:53.098 --> 00:02:55.082
 also some delicate motor tasks, 

00:02:55.082 --> 00:02:58.020
 like writing a sentence with a pencil. 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.737
 Complete drive test 

00:03:00.737 --> 00:03:03.500
 and the perceptions of the upper and lower limbs. 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.936
 Based on the symptoms, the doctor can often identify 

00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:09.258
 the part of the brain that has been damaged. 

00:03:09.258 --> 00:03:11.616
 For example, you may remember that 

00:03:11.616 --> 00:03:13.356
 symptoms on one side of the body 

00:03:13.356 --> 00:03:16.583
 suggest damage in the opposite hemisphere of the brain. 

00:03:16.583 --> 00:03:20.557
 For example, left-handed problems 

00:03:20.557 --> 00:03:22.714
 may suggest that something is going on 

00:03:22.714 --> 00:03:24.919
 in the right half of the brain. 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:25.986
 Another example, 

00:03:25.986 --> 00:03:28.366
 problems with balance and walking 

00:03:28.366 --> 00:03:30.931
 may suggest malignant brain damage. 

00:03:30.931 --> 00:03:33.287
 Symptoms and place of their manifestation 

00:03:33.287 --> 00:03:35.668
 portray a pretty good picture of what part of the brain 

00:03:35.668 --> 00:03:38.524
 may have been damaged during a stroke. 

00:03:38.524 --> 00:03:41.309
 As part of the review, the doctor will also check 

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:43.342
 pulse and blood pressure. 

00:03:43.342 --> 00:03:44.607
 This is in part to look for 

00:03:44.607 --> 00:03:46.082
 underlying heart disease, 

00:03:46.082 --> 00:03:48.089
 which may have caused stroke. 

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:50.667
 For example, an irregular heartbeat 

00:03:50.667 --> 00:03:53.361
 may be an indication of atrial fibrillation, 

00:03:53.361 --> 00:03:54.649
 which is one of the heart diseases, 

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:56.901
 where the heart does not maintain a normal rhythm, 

00:03:56.901 --> 00:03:59.130
 and this is a huge risk factor for stroke. 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.370
 Apart from pulse and blood pressure, 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.091
 reflexes can be checked, 

00:04:03.091 --> 00:04:05.969
 to see if they were affected by the stroke. 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:08.441
 Depending on what happens with the reflexes, 

00:04:08.441 --> 00:04:11.042
 in particular whether they are more sensitive than usual 

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:14.281
 or even missing, insensitive, 

00:04:14.281 --> 00:04:16.010
 this gives the doctor more information 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.203
 about where a stroke may have developed in the brain. 

00:04:19.203 --> 00:04:21.408
 By collecting all this information 

00:04:21.408 --> 00:04:24.392
 talking to you or a member of your family, 

00:04:24.392 --> 00:04:28.012
 and by conducting this neurological physical examination, 

00:04:28.012 --> 00:04:30.101
 the doctor will get a pretty good idea 

00:04:30.101 --> 00:04:32.923
 about what kind of stroke may have occurred, 

00:04:32.923 --> 00:04:35.233
 where in the brain it may be 

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:37.160
 and how heavy it can be. 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.503
 Other tests will then be made to confirm. 

00:04:41.503 --> 00:04:44.313
 As laboratory tests, such as blood count, 

00:04:44.313 --> 00:04:47.156
 and imaging studies such as brain scan, 

00:04:47.156 --> 00:04:49.838
 will be conducted to evaluate 

00:04:49.838 --> 00:04:52.223
 and diagnosed the possible stroke.
