00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Oh! dear, do not cross it 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 The distance that separates our lips is still 50 cm 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Stop trying to tempt innocence in me, with sweet and obvious words 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 Love, our love, will be perfect 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 Long, adagio, without hurry 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 Slow, slow love, very slow; slow tempo 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Oh! dear, do not cross it

 The distance that separates our lips is still 50 cm 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 Being frank, until I can not feel your heart 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 The distance is 50 cm 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 Love, our love, will be perfect 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.050
 Long, adagio, without hurry 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Slow, slow love, very slow; slow tempo 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.050
 Our love, this love, will be electrifying 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 I love you, honey, I love you 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:53.050
 When my red lower lip touches your upper lip 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 Please do not cross 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 The distance that separates our lips is still 50 cm 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:13.050
 Do not turn me into a common girl with sweet and obvious words 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.050
 Save me for a little later 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 The distance that separates our lips is still 50 cm. 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.050
 Shut up, shut up, honey. Push me darling 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 Please listen to this small request 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Shut up, shut up, honey. Appreciate me honey
