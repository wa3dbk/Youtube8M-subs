00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:07.029
 autoload windows what is it 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.559
 answer this question is not difficult many 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:10.660
 programs run automatically 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.059
 together with the start of the operating system 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.549
 this allows programs either immediately 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.039
 work in the background either at the moment 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.750
 when you run such a program she 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.609
 will open very quickly and you do not need 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.859
 will wait for the program to load everything 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:26.349
 necessary components ie 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.119
 autoload windows is a set of programs 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.400
 and applications that run together 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.110
 with the start of the operating system it seemed 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.300
 autoload would be very convenient 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.050
 invention but in fact here is not 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.390
 everything is so simple 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.650
 firstly because of automatic loading 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.170
 programs together with the start of operating 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.660
 systems significantly increased time 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.220
 computer boot secondly 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.900
 autoload strive to penetrate 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.360
 malware and viruses 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.830
 if with the second point we can help 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.170
 handle antivirus protection 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.150
 then the first item except us nobody 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.760
 can not fix if your computer 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.470
 loaded for a long time then first 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.930
 queue should pay attention to 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.210
 Startup list often on the Internet 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.799
 can be found advice to accelerate 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.390
 computer boot that sounds 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.249
 approximately as follows 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.159
 disable unnecessary programs in 

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:13.990
 autoload this advice is correct here 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.240
 just what programs see fit as 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.159
 what unnecessary this question find 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.399
 a decent answer on the internet is very difficult 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.810
 and there is a reason for the programs 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.549
 huge multitude and here it comes 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.590
 not even the thousands of programs and in 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.539
 millions each user 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.909
 install on your computer only 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.369
 those programs and applications that are needed 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.319
 he therefore a list of programs that 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.240
 installed on every computer he 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:39.399
 different from all other computers 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.679
 it's just impossible to create some kind 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.450
 algorithm which can be cleaned 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:43.929
 autoload operating system 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.909
 windows 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.130
 it is also simply impossible to provide 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.899
 some list of programs that 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.789
 must be present in 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.490
 autoload any computer 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.450
 I will talk about my algorithm for working with 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.060
 autoload 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.219
 and how I define which program 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.799
 leave in autoload and which of it 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:04.270
 exclude access to the list of programs 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.499
 autoload can use 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.590
 system utility 

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:09.789
 it is called by the command m with config though 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.590
 in fact there is a mass 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.990
 specialized programs and the same 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.760
 very sore lenore 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.220
 allows access to programs 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.310
 which are in windows startup 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.010
 so open the autoload for this 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.200
 You can use the window to perform 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.350
 press the windows key combination p and 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.880
 enter the command m with config after 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.120
 click on the ok button 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.190
 a window opens in the startup window 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.010
 go over the list of all 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.780
 programs that are in it 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.820
 We reveal an unknown program in 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.890
 autoruns listed executables 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.920
 program files and accordingly here 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.360
 There may be files that are directly 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.770
 not related to the program ie it 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.730
 may be a file of some component 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.310
 programs 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.500
 but by the location of the file 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.720
 you can guess what program he 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.820
 belongs if find out 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.100
 file ownership failed 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.080
 then enter the name of the executable file in 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.580
 search field of any search engine 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.960
 for example yandex or google 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.700
 after that we will find a huge 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.280
 number of articles to be 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.840
 dedicated to this particular file and such 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.240
 way we can determine 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.710
 the purpose of this file for what it is 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.320
 intended oh what program is he 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.910
 belongs to this procedure we need 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.800
 execute for all files which 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.600
 are in autoload 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.100
 and which are unknown to us that is 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.290
 continue until there is no 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.350
 no known programs and applications 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.360
 Next, we leave in the driver startup 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.950
 devices are usually in their name 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.140
 present manufacturer name 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.050
 therefore, it is easy enough to identify them 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.110
 for example intel or n video also 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.340
 leave the files that belong 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.770
 microsoft the matter is that such files 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.660
 most likely are either drivers 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.610
 devices either are some 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.620
 system services that are needed 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.690
 for the operating system itself 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.290
 or programs that are installed on 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.930
 computer 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.850
 by itself we leave in autoload 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.560
 antivirus and firewall and since these 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.140
 programs must protect 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.240
 computer immediately after turning it on 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.980
 Tom what antivirus program is worth 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.400
 on your computer you can only know 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.530
 you 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.450
 well, as well as about that set to 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.130
 your computer is a separate firewall or 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.750
 No, here I can not give any 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.560
 recommendations as it is so 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.780
 individually 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.760
 that only seeing the computer is possible 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.950
 set the name of these programs 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.050
 well, then everything depends on you after 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.090
 search engine you will 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.850
 have information about each file 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.590
 which is in autoload you 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.840
 will need to decide whether the need 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.520
 you need this program or not 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.370
 it will be useful to you immediately after the start 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.110
 windows or not if assignment 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.930
 some program you do not understand and 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.000
 Internet search didn't help you better 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.380
 this program does not touch although in 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.390
 I am sure that you can be on the Internet 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.730
 find information absolutely for any 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.730
 program and based on that 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.740
 already your choice in general when the appointment 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.290
 programs you understand and you use 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.180
 rarely or occasionally then its worth 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.920
 exclude from autoload 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.530
 also do not forget that in 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.570
 startup may not be themselves 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.240
 programs and their modules which answers 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.370
 for example for updating the program therefore 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.740
 disabling such a module you seem to be 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.810
 than you don't risk and basically you can 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.710
 update programs yourself 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.550
 manually then 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:25.380
 but here there is one nuance regular 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.720
 program update is very important 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.760
 computer protection factor in general, since 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.470
 vulnerabilities in popular programs 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.970
 used by intruders in order 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.890
 to penetrate computers 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.020
 user regular update 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.730
 similar programs allows you to eliminate 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.070
 holes found in the program and 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.110
 respectively patch up the gap in protection 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.480
 your whole computer here 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.340
 responsibility lies with you and yourself 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.030
 you decide you need an update module 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.710
 programs 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.200
 which will be loaded along with 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.210
 start windows or not, but what 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.640
 the computer starts to boot faster you 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:59.160
 find after the first reboot 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.870
 I recommend carefully 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.090
 deal with all the files that 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.460
 are in your windows startup 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.620
 computer do not turn off everything 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.110
 I hope for Russian perhaps in this case 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.730
 you can avoid a lot of problems but 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.890
 most importantly you get an idea 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:16.710
 about those programs that are needed 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:19.140
 your computer for work and it is on 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.150
 really invaluable experience which you 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.650
 will allow to solve problems further 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.840
 slow loading not only your 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.630
 computer but also computer friends and 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.670
 I hope you know your friends 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.180
 helped to figure out autoloading 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.040
 windows 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.600
 if so click on the button 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.310
 like which is under video 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.560
 fit into my channel or my 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:42.630
 the newsletter on the site with you was Andrei 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.630
 dry and up to bond in new videos
