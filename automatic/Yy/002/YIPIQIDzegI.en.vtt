I<00:00:17.830> have<00:00:18.490> two<00:00:18.730> designs<00:00:19.090> for<00:00:19.300> you<00:00:19.390> today<00:00:19.660> one

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
I have two designs for you today one

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.859 
I have two designs for you today one
that<00:00:20.140> is<00:00:20.260> a<00:00:20.289> basic<00:00:20.800> switch<00:00:21.580> that<00:00:22.000> makes<00:00:22.660> the

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
that is a basic switch that makes the

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.930 
that is a basic switch that makes the
weapon<00:00:23.170> drop<00:00:23.470> and<00:00:23.770> the<00:00:24.310> other<00:00:24.460> one<00:00:24.730> would<00:00:24.880> be

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:24.940 
weapon drop and the other one would be

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.480 
weapon drop and the other one would be
having<00:00:25.779> to<00:00:25.990> unlock<00:00:26.260> the<00:00:26.710> switch<00:00:26.980> using

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
having to unlock the switch using

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.580 
having to unlock the switch using
grenades<00:00:27.730> and<00:00:28.180> the<00:00:28.930> grenades<00:00:29.170> will<00:00:29.350> be<00:00:29.470> the

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
grenades and the grenades will be the

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.560 
grenades and the grenades will be the
currency<00:00:30.070> so<00:00:30.580> you<00:00:30.699> can<00:00:30.820> use<00:00:30.939> the<00:00:31.060> grenade<00:00:31.359> to

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
currency so you can use the grenade to

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.350 
currency so you can use the grenade to
make<00:00:32.230> the<00:00:32.439> switch<00:00:32.829> accessible<00:00:33.309> and<00:00:33.760> then<00:00:34.180> you

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
make the switch accessible and then you

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.330 
make the switch accessible and then you
can<00:00:34.540> use<00:00:34.809> it<00:00:34.989> to<00:00:35.200> make<00:00:35.410> the<00:00:35.559> weapon<00:00:35.710> drop<00:00:36.100> and

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
can use it to make the weapon drop and

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.030 
can use it to make the weapon drop and
both<00:00:37.270> of<00:00:37.450> these<00:00:37.570> are<00:00:37.840> very<00:00:38.079> easy<00:00:38.440> to<00:00:38.620> do<00:00:38.800> and

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
both of these are very easy to do and

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.040 
both of these are very easy to do and
won't<00:00:39.340> require<00:00:39.520> too<00:00:40.000> much<00:00:40.210> of<00:00:40.360> your<00:00:40.480> budget<00:00:40.719> so

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
won't require too much of your budget so

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.260 
won't require too much of your budget so
yeah<00:00:41.680> let's<00:00:41.920> get<00:00:42.070> started<00:00:42.130> let's<00:00:44.940> start<00:00:45.940> with

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
yeah let's get started let's start with

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.510 
yeah let's get started let's start with
the<00:00:46.510> basic<00:00:46.989> weapon<00:00:47.290> dispenser<00:00:47.770> this<00:00:48.070> design

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
the basic weapon dispenser this design

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.510 
the basic weapon dispenser this design
that<00:00:49.210> I<00:00:49.360> have<00:00:49.690> is<00:00:49.989> meant<00:00:50.320> to<00:00:50.500> be<00:00:50.649> having<00:00:51.309> the

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
that I have is meant to be having the

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.880 
that I have is meant to be having the
weapon<00:00:51.850> dispenser<00:00:52.390> against<00:00:53.200> the<00:00:53.289> wall<00:00:53.469> or<00:00:53.710> you

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
weapon dispenser against the wall or you

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.709 
weapon dispenser against the wall or you
know<00:00:53.980> part<00:00:54.280> of<00:00:54.370> the<00:00:54.489> wall<00:00:54.670> and<00:00:54.969> now<00:00:55.570> I'm<00:00:55.690> just

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
know part of the wall and now I'm just

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:58.139 
know part of the wall and now I'm just
taking<00:00:56.079> it<00:00:56.320> apart<00:00:56.590> to<00:00:56.770> show<00:00:56.829> you<00:00:57.039> how<00:00:57.850> it<00:00:58.000> works

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
taking it apart to show you how it works

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.650 
taking it apart to show you how it works
really<00:00:59.070> first<00:01:00.070> you<00:01:00.340> will<00:01:00.460> need<00:01:00.610> a<00:01:00.850> fusion<00:01:01.420> coil

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
really first you will need a fusion coil

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.130 
really first you will need a fusion coil
and<00:01:01.930> you'll<00:01:02.920> want<00:01:03.160> to<00:01:03.219> set<00:01:03.640> its<00:01:03.940> scripting<00:01:04.689> to

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
and you'll want to set its scripting to

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.169 
and you'll want to set its scripting to
a<00:01:05.170> certain<00:01:05.920> broadcast<00:01:06.399> channel<00:01:06.759> this<00:01:06.909> will<00:01:07.090> be

00:01:07.169 --> 00:01:07.179 
a certain broadcast channel this will be

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:09.539 
a certain broadcast channel this will be
the<00:01:07.299> same<00:01:07.539> as<00:01:07.779> your<00:01:08.229> broadcast<00:01:09.069> channel<00:01:09.369> for

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
the same as your broadcast channel for

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.269 
the same as your broadcast channel for
your<00:01:09.670> switch<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:11.200> idea<00:01:11.529> is<00:01:11.709> that<00:01:11.889> you<00:01:12.069> will

00:01:12.269 --> 00:01:12.279 
your switch the idea is that you will

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:14.190 
your switch the idea is that you will
trigger<00:01:12.579> the<00:01:12.850> explosion<00:01:13.359> of<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.509> fusion<00:01:13.990> coil

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
trigger the explosion of the fusion coil

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.069 
trigger the explosion of the fusion coil
and<00:01:14.409> make<00:01:14.649> the<00:01:14.950> weapon<00:01:15.369> drop<00:01:15.639> by<00:01:16.299> using<00:01:16.719> the

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:17.079 
and make the weapon drop by using the

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:19.260 
and make the weapon drop by using the
switch<00:01:17.469> toggle<00:01:18.099> that<00:01:18.490> is<00:01:18.670> set<00:01:18.880> to<00:01:18.999> the<00:01:19.090> same

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
switch toggle that is set to the same

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.719 
switch toggle that is set to the same
broadcast<00:01:19.569> channel<00:01:20.139> as<00:01:20.289> for<00:01:21.099> the<00:01:21.189> weapon<00:01:21.490> make

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
broadcast channel as for the weapon make

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.849 
broadcast channel as for the weapon make
sure<00:01:21.939> it's<00:01:22.179> physics<00:01:22.599> is<00:01:22.810> set<00:01:23.079> to<00:01:23.229> normal<00:01:23.469> and

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:23.859 
sure it's physics is set to normal and

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:25.830 
sure it's physics is set to normal and
put<00:01:24.219> it<00:01:24.310> right<00:01:24.549> on<00:01:24.729> top<00:01:24.969> of<00:01:24.999> the<00:01:25.209> fusion<00:01:25.569> coil

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
put it right on top of the fusion coil

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.410 
put it right on top of the fusion coil
make<00:01:26.109> sure<00:01:26.289> it's<00:01:26.789> make<00:01:27.789> sure<00:01:27.880> you<00:01:28.029> lay<00:01:28.179> it<00:01:28.299> on

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
make sure it's make sure you lay it on

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.989 
make sure it's make sure you lay it on

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:45.669 
is a block set in an incline what I am

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:49.109 
is a block set in an incline what I am
using<00:01:45.999> is<00:01:46.329> they<00:01:46.569> use<00:01:47.049> the<00:01:47.229> 5<00:01:47.619> by<00:01:47.799> 1<00:01:48.009> short<00:01:48.279> and<00:01:48.579> I

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
have it set to this a 15 degree incline

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:53.940 
have it set to this a 15 degree incline
over<00:01:52.840> here<00:01:53.020> just<00:01:53.289> so<00:01:53.349> that<00:01:53.380> when<00:01:53.799> the

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
over here just so that when the

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.649 
over here just so that when the
explosions<00:01:54.489> triggered<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.119> weapon<00:01:55.419> easily

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
explosions triggered the weapon easily

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.100 
explosions triggered the weapon easily
falls<00:01:56.289> down<00:01:56.590> and<00:01:56.979> won't<00:01:57.279> get<00:01:57.520> stuck<00:01:57.789> anywhere

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.359 

next<00:02:01.110> thing<00:02:01.229> you'll<00:02:01.409> need<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:02.130> create<00:02:02.340> a

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
next thing you'll need is to create a

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.249 
next thing you'll need is to create a
roof<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:02.969> when<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.570> explosion<00:02:04.140> is

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
roof so that when the explosion is

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.990 
roof so that when the explosion is
triggered<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.649> weapon<00:02:04.890> just<00:02:05.039> won't<00:02:05.280> fly<00:02:05.759> out

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
triggered the weapon just won't fly out

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.389 
triggered the weapon just won't fly out
of<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.270> fly<00:02:06.960> out<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.110> your<00:02:07.259> setup<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:08.099> yeah

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
of the fly out of your setup so yeah

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.729 
of the fly out of your setup so yeah
make<00:02:08.640> sure<00:02:08.759> there's<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.060> roof<00:02:09.269> to<00:02:09.539> seal<00:02:10.530> the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
make sure there's a roof to seal the

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.949 
make sure there's a roof to seal the
weapon<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.400> just<00:02:11.849> pretty<00:02:12.180> much<00:02:12.300> ensure

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
weapon in and just pretty much ensure

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.009 
weapon in and just pretty much ensure
that<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.410> drops<00:02:13.830> into<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.690> little<00:02:15.690> pickup

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
that it drops into the little pickup

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.410 
that it drops into the little pickup
point<00:02:16.290> for<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.560> players<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.180> yeah<00:02:18.180> that's

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
point for the players and yeah that's

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.420 
point for the players and yeah that's
pretty<00:02:18.510> much<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.170> setup<00:02:19.500> for<00:02:19.769> the<00:02:19.950> basic

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
pretty much the setup for the basic

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.040 
pretty much the setup for the basic
weapon<00:02:20.670> dispenser<00:02:21.090> like<00:02:21.360> I<00:02:21.450> said<00:02:21.630> it's<00:02:21.810> really

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
weapon dispenser like I said it's really

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.960 
weapon dispenser like I said it's really
easy<00:02:22.319> and<00:02:22.560> once<00:02:23.250> you're<00:02:23.370> done<00:02:23.489> creating<00:02:23.880> it

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
easy and once you're done creating it

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.520 
easy and once you're done creating it
you<00:02:24.060> can<00:02:24.209> even<00:02:24.390> test<00:02:24.630> it<00:02:24.780> out<00:02:24.870> on<00:02:24.930> forge<00:02:25.290> mode

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
you can even test it out on forge mode

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.350 
you can even test it out on forge mode
itself

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.080 

so<00:02:33.050> now<00:02:33.260> let's<00:02:33.530> dive<00:02:33.770> into<00:02:33.980> my<00:02:34.280> second<00:02:34.790> design

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
so now let's dive into my second design

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.840 
so now let's dive into my second design
this<00:02:35.300> is<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.750> weapon<00:02:36.110> dispenser<00:02:36.620> that<00:02:36.830> has<00:02:37.580> a

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
this is the weapon dispenser that has a

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.700 
this is the weapon dispenser that has a
locked<00:02:38.270> switch<00:02:38.630> so<00:02:38.900> players<00:02:39.140> won't<00:02:39.350> be<00:02:39.470> able

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
locked switch so players won't be able

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.460 
locked switch so players won't be able
to<00:02:39.830> access<00:02:39.980> it<00:02:40.280> until<00:02:40.730> they<00:02:41.120> pay<00:02:41.870> with<00:02:42.170> the

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
to access it until they pay with the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.690 
to access it until they pay with the
grenades<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:43.040> grenades<00:02:43.280> will<00:02:43.460> be<00:02:43.580> the

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
grenades the grenades will be the

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.000 
grenades the grenades will be the
currency<00:02:44.080> let's<00:02:45.080> start<00:02:45.290> off<00:02:45.410> with<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.710> weapon

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
currency let's start off with the weapon

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.800 
currency let's start off with the weapon
and<00:02:46.100> the<00:02:46.220> fusion<00:02:46.430> coil<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:47.150> setup<00:02:47.540> will<00:02:47.690> be

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
and the fusion coil the setup will be

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.460 
and the fusion coil the setup will be
the<00:02:47.930> exact<00:02:48.410> same<00:02:48.830> as<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:50.020> first<00:02:51.020> setup<00:02:51.200> that<00:02:51.410> I

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
the exact same as the first setup that I

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.530 
the exact same as the first setup that I
showed<00:02:51.740> just<00:02:52.070> make<00:02:52.700> sure<00:02:52.970> that<00:02:53.210> the<00:02:53.360> switch

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
showed just make sure that the switch

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.020 
showed just make sure that the switch
toggle<00:02:53.960> console<00:02:54.740> switch<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.790> fusion

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
toggle console switch and the fusion

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.760 
toggle console switch and the fusion
coil<00:02:56.360> are<00:02:56.570> all<00:02:56.720> set<00:02:57.020> to<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:57.260> same<00:02:57.500> broadcast

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
coil are all set to the same broadcast

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.210 
coil are all set to the same broadcast
channel<00:02:58.960> now<00:02:59.960> I'm<00:03:00.170> going<00:03:00.440> to<00:03:00.530> show<00:03:00.740> you<00:03:00.770> how<00:03:01.160> to

channel now I'm going to show you how to
set<00:03:01.760> up<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:02.180> lock<00:03:02.540> system<00:03:03.020> for<00:03:03.770> the<00:03:04.040> I<00:03:04.730> guess

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
set up the lock system for the I guess

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.940 
set up the lock system for the I guess
what<00:03:05.300> prevents<00:03:05.750> you<00:03:05.870> from<00:03:05.900> entering<00:03:06.770> and

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
what prevents you from entering and

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.910 
what prevents you from entering and
using<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:07.760> switch<00:03:08.000> I<00:03:08.240> use<00:03:08.810> dantana<00:03:09.290> smalls<00:03:09.650> as

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
using the switch I use dantana smalls as

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.250 
using the switch I use dantana smalls as
the<00:03:10.220> barrier<00:03:11.000> that<00:03:11.330> will<00:03:11.600> prevent<00:03:12.020> players

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
the barrier that will prevent players

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.199 
the barrier that will prevent players
from<00:03:12.410> using<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.040> switch<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.910> can<00:03:14.000> use

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
from using the switch you can use

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.580 
from using the switch you can use
whichever<00:03:14.450> piece<00:03:14.720> you<00:03:14.900> want<00:03:15.020> I<00:03:15.200> just<00:03:15.410> used

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
whichever piece you want I just used

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.830 
whichever piece you want I just used
antennae<00:03:15.890> smalls<00:03:16.220> for<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.510> sake<00:03:17.660> of<00:03:17.690> the

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
antennae smalls for the sake of the

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.540 
antennae smalls for the sake of the
tutorial<00:03:17.990> and<00:03:18.470> because<00:03:18.740> it<00:03:18.860> fits<00:03:19.070> my<00:03:19.250> setup

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
tutorial and because it fits my setup

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.240 
tutorial and because it fits my setup
better<00:03:19.730> you'll<00:03:20.510> also<00:03:20.660> need<00:03:20.990> some<00:03:21.050> trims<00:03:21.920> and

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
better you'll also need some trims and

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.020 
better you'll also need some trims and
this<00:03:23.030> trigger<00:03:23.600> on<00:03:23.930> destroyed<00:03:24.820> it's<00:03:25.820> the

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
this trigger on destroyed it's the

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.550 
this trigger on destroyed it's the
orange<00:03:26.270> one<00:03:26.480> that<00:03:26.660> you'll<00:03:26.810> find<00:03:27.110> at<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.380> very

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
orange one that you'll find at the very

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.490 
orange one that you'll find at the very
bottom<00:03:27.860> of<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.070> triggers<00:03:28.400> category<00:03:28.910> and

bottom of the triggers category and

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.380 
bottom of the triggers category and
lastly<00:03:30.500> you'll<00:03:30.740> need<00:03:30.830> another<00:03:31.070> incline<00:03:31.850> setup

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
lastly you'll need another incline setup

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.410 
lastly you'll need another incline setup
like<00:03:32.630> this<00:03:33.080> one<00:03:33.520> this<00:03:34.520> is<00:03:34.670> to<00:03:34.970> make<00:03:35.270> the

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
like this one this is to make the

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.150 
like this one this is to make the
grenades<00:03:35.750> bounce<00:03:36.140> into<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:36.650> trigger<00:03:37.040> on

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
grenades bounce into the trigger on

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.949 
grenades bounce into the trigger on
destroyed<00:03:37.700> because<00:03:37.970> it<00:03:38.150> actually<00:03:38.510> needs<00:03:38.690> to

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
destroyed because it actually needs to

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.259 
destroyed because it actually needs to
hit<00:03:39.080> the<00:03:39.110> orange<00:03:39.440> part<00:03:39.920> of<00:03:40.010> it<00:03:40.130> to<00:03:40.700> activate<00:03:41.090> it

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
hit the orange part of it to activate it

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.330 
hit the orange part of it to activate it
as<00:03:41.930> for<00:03:42.260> the<00:03:42.350> labels<00:03:42.709> of<00:03:42.890> the<00:03:42.980> trigger<00:03:43.250> on

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
as for the labels of the trigger on

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.890 
as for the labels of the trigger on
destroyed<00:03:43.850> you'll<00:03:43.970> only<00:03:44.150> need<00:03:44.420> to<00:03:44.660> touch<00:03:44.870> the

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
destroyed you'll only need to touch the

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.110 
destroyed you'll only need to touch the
broadcast<00:03:45.620> channel<00:03:45.980> I<00:03:46.130> have<00:03:46.459> it<00:03:46.610> set<00:03:46.760> to<00:03:46.790> 3

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
broadcast channel I have it set to 3

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.960 
broadcast channel I have it set to 3
because<00:03:47.690> I'm<00:03:47.989> using<00:03:48.350> 1<00:03:48.680> and<00:03:48.860> 2<00:03:49.010> for<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:49.519> other

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
because I'm using 1 and 2 for the other

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.380 
because I'm using 1 and 2 for the other
fusion<00:03:50.660> coils<00:03:51.080> and<00:03:51.320> switches<00:03:52.160> so<00:03:52.790> I'm<00:03:52.910> using<00:03:53.090> 3

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
fusion coils and switches so I'm using 3

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.820 
fusion coils and switches so I'm using 3
here<00:03:53.600> but<00:03:53.780> you<00:03:53.870> can<00:03:53.989> use<00:03:54.140> whichever<00:03:54.440> one<00:03:54.590> you

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830

want<00:03:55.060> next<00:03:56.060> we<00:03:56.330> have<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:56.630> antenna<00:03:56.930> smalls<00:03:57.290> or

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
want next we have the antenna smalls or

want next we have the antenna smalls or
whichever<00:03:57.920> piece<00:03:58.190> you<00:03:58.459> want<00:03:58.580> to<00:03:58.790> de-spawn

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
instructions in the video I'm sure

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.640

you'll<00:05:08.340> be<00:05:08.520> able<00:05:08.610> to<00:05:08.790> follow<00:05:09.000> and<00:05:09.440> yeah<00:05:10.440> just

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
you'll be able to follow and yeah just

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.160 
you'll be able to follow and yeah just
make<00:05:10.800> sure<00:05:10.830> your<00:05:11.640> barriers<00:05:12.210> are<00:05:12.540> there<00:05:12.930> to

make sure your barriers are there to

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.560 
make sure your barriers are there to
properly<00:05:13.530> prevent<00:05:14.010> your<00:05:14.220> player<00:05:14.570> from

to<00:05:18.390> the<00:05:18.630> switch<00:05:18.840> and<00:05:19.160> you'll<00:05:20.160> also<00:05:20.340> have<00:05:20.550> to

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:20.670 
to the switch and you'll also have to

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.400 
to the switch and you'll also have to
make<00:05:20.820> sure<00:05:21.000> that<00:05:21.210> the<00:05:21.360> trigger<00:05:21.660> on<00:05:21.750> destroyed

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
make sure that the trigger on destroyed

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.070 
make sure that the trigger on destroyed
cannot<00:05:23.220> simply<00:05:23.820> be<00:05:23.970> shot<00:05:24.270> at<00:05:24.510> by<00:05:24.540> the<00:05:24.780> players

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
cannot simply be shot at by the players

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.630 
cannot simply be shot at by the players
you'll<00:05:25.350> build<00:05:25.560> like<00:05:25.890> you<00:05:25.980> know<00:05:26.070> it'll<00:05:26.280> have<00:05:26.460> to

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
you'll build like you know it'll have to

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.850 
you'll build like you know it'll have to
use<00:05:26.790> the<00:05:26.940> grenade<00:05:27.270> to<00:05:27.480> be<00:05:27.960> able<00:05:28.230> to<00:05:28.350> trigger<00:05:28.620> it

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
use the grenade to be able to trigger it

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.370
