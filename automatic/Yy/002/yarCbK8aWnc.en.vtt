00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:09.740
 Yes This Well then because because for rice that was a little in fino the first time in a long time 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:15.099
 I would like to see a little driving together today 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.099
 In the second rotation of the flat next Kator 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.820
 after 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:25.590
 Ankoya diet 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:26.840
 It is green-green at 2000 rotations, but at over 3000 songs side 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.930
 8 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.930
 I 'm also set to make each cater glow a little 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:45.550
 It is a feeling that a blue alert sounds at 2000 rotations Shadow 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:48.120
 I 'm a little laydown old 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.120
 I will do 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.220
 Another shining in 2000 rotation 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.329
 Awesome 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:02.350
 I have been set to sound Gingko alarm at 3000 rpm 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.350
 What will happen 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.880
 Hmm 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.970
 Hmm 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.990
 Hmm 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.189
 Hmm 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.350
 Hmm 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.829
 Yup 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.410
 Oh 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.200
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.060
 ban 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.060
 Let 's attention to speed 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.350
 Hmm 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.110
 Strong at 3000 rpm 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.040
 Red 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.040
 It is an alert 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.900
 Green alert at 1000 rpm 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.900
 is not it 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.820
 It was better to stay around 1500 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.220
 Hmm 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.920
 Oh 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.290
 Is not 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:23.780
 It is this alert eh To 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:27.910
 You can adjust a little with this if you press and hold the top 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:31.529
 It's about 500 recommendations and it's a red alert 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:36.449
 I will try to ring 

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:43.199
 If it leaves for 5 seconds by this, setting will be completed 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:48.409
 It is chestnut alert is a green adversaries in this by pressing a little long towards the bottom 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:48.409
 It becomes a form that says can be adjusted in the direction of Izu digit City 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.180
 Around 1500 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:05:00.780
 I 'm not going to be 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.780
 It is a form that a maintenance cater shines 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.680
 Next Bach next 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:18.310
 Minutes from the lett at 2500 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.310
 Soo 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:41.540
 Hmm 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:47.300
 But this will also be another measure of the transmission of rice by it roughly Well any conference this baby 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:52.190
 It'll be I Toka guideline say what I do go hand in clutch 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:54.449
 Aika also use Tteyuu go hand clutch a little since the beginning of the green alert month 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:06:00.559
 I can not see you 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:06:00.559
 It is very cheap It is a lamp of this one scale 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:27.020
 Said once that 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:30.410
 I wonder why 2 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:35.750
 Leave alert 2 red fore 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:43.039
 It is better to set up at the timing of the fall and winter up ahead of the red zone of the press 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:48.310
 Everyone down a little Well-ri rotation you are in you it is a good mouse in the city until there but I'm 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:48.310
 I am asked to see 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:54.750
 This pt sounds you 

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:57.330
 Clearly hear and be greater than the rotational speed 7000 rotation 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:07:02.449
 By I'm 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:02.449
 That it has been originally built in the Impreza over 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:11.090
 The part that informs you of the shoot up timing 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.860
 I can not hear it if I have 5000 rotors 

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.490
 Hmm 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:20.990
 So yes 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:20.990
 I think that it is a great convenience for this by all means 

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.010
 It is good to face 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.319
 I can hear it well 

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:37.720
 Ahha finished but it is I think the story say in Hokkaido 4 Ten' 

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:44.230
 For example yeah 

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:45.240
 It is hugely easy because there isn't so much news, but I think that I want to be rude on this 

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:50.840
 I will 

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:50.840
 Also, I'm thinking about moving images
