00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:09.170
 turn to analyze group b of this 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.500
 world cup that has the champion and the 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:15.350
 runner-up facing is 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.000
 repeat the final of the last cup of the 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.220
 world in the first confrontation of the 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.160
 group stage are the two candidates 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.570
 but eye to gum itself to me without a 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.609
 doubts there is an ugly duckling 'in this group 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.529
 see that it is Australia's selection already 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.660
 everybody puts three points already 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.160
 directly australia but chile is a 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.390
 selection well worked by Jorge 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.460
 sampaoli has a generation 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.530
 extraordinary of players like me 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.329
 it seems he has not had the story of 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.250
 Chilean football is the world champion 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.480
 is the runner-up but it seems to me or with 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.879
 the Chilean team that can give the 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.590
 surprise according to you and where you 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.390
 Play is played in South America. Chile is 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.160
 used to playing there can give you the 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.750
 surprise or get into some problem so much 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.930
 Spain as Holland completely 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.809
 I agree with you and I go by 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.070
 Spain and Chile according 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.489
 Holland 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.470
 I was not playing at all well term 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.870
 leader of the group that clarified classified from 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.360
 directly but also in a group 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.310
 moderately accessible in europe 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.040
 let's see holland is obviously a 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.210
 team of very good players 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.250
 collectively we will see what it is for 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.530
 this world cup knowing even that 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.119
 has two very heavy parties run that 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.770
 he has to play against Spain neither more nor 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.660
 less since input but we're 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.580
 speaking of the same optics let's say of 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.920
 the calendars with respect to what 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.009
 we speak in other segments of the group to 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.950
 is the Chilean team supposedly going 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.780
 to debut against the opponent and more and more 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.300
 simple on paper 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.500
 giving you 3.3 points let's say matches 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.060
 you have to play them would be there 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.710
 Spanish and Dutch points are removed 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.770
 and that can be an advantage for chile 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.840
 Australian is a team as bad as 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.119
 people can think that's a team 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.740
 that has some players with some 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.500
 experience especially in the second 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.780
 division England and can reach 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.509
 represent a match of what in 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.860
 Spain were cheated because 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.280
 everyone here at the table we are talking 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.280
 how good 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.200
 but you have to play the games thousands 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.840
 remember the party that made it italy 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.960
 at a time in a world where 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.000
 it was not a great team but there will be 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.830
 to keep in mind that it will not be 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.320
 easy to none of the three 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.080
 to beat him, let's say the forceful one is going to 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.330
 win surely I think but I do not think 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.310
 that is something with ease and the teams 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.430
 that are in the world cup are 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.590
 involved complicated now arrived 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.490
 that has a good level what happens is 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.890
 that the name is not the one that worries you 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.900
 really in summary then for you 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.880
 classify the two Europeans Spain 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.250
 Holland for me Spain and Chile 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.959
 spanic chile for spain and chile very 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.220
 well happened the group b
