00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.360
 today in sin city 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.340
 we can do a little bit not 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.410
 more not everything show what I can not 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.590
 not but I'll show you anyway 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.970
 a few industries and especially 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:24.090
 all that will be industries 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:26.039
 pollutants to start with here the 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.420
 oil hence the name of the city to prince 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.800
 she said it was to redo a little the 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.610
 case you have the goal is to have good 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.320
 here I have a zone 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.840
 wait I could show you this 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.140
 would be easier drilling so if you 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.600
 show the map here I have a lot of 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.199
 oil so I placed my then 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.579
 you all are pumping so but 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:53.969
 who pumps the petroleum oil that I 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:57.809
 then refine it to make fuel oil 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.820
 and plastic oiled plastic that 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.960
 I sell on the world market means 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.190
 nice people here he's the only one at this 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.830
 metal and ore 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.210
 this is oiled plastic that I sell on 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:12.990
 the world market here i'm exporting this 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.179
 who makes me money skis after for 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.759
 improve things have little here have 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:19.649
 oil seats so there it is 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.380
 new 2 that makes it possible to do more 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.630
 profits and it's good I still have not 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.250
 too much understood the interest of these seats 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.710
 commercial and that's what I did 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.800
 pope but in that one he is soon to 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.229
 for ore grade metal 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.880
 I showed you that's what I had 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.619
 it was a bit of coal here yes here 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:43.649
 so I made a coal mine that 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.569
 I then because I retire there 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.250
 I know more I think the wind all 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:53.039
 just here to three following games I 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.100
 redo I did a foundry I know 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:58.619
 even more yes I did a foundry 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.710
 sorry I made a foundry with the 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.240
 local coal plus raw ore than 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.670
 I buy since I have no sources of 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.229
 minerals I make metal this metal 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.940
 that I am going on to world market 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.500
 but it's a whole thing to do 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.280
 so I showed you sovereign what I 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:24.110
 say that there is coal that I sell that 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:27.530
 I store here here is here I had ore 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.080
 is actually the the metal game the ex door 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.440
 but the young ore matters what 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.210
 do you see it cost me that 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.620
 money to import it only the 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.050
 metal when I'm going to export see the 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.880
 benefit so so on it I'm 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.160
 profitable that's why 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.930
 for the moment I am 320000 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.970
 monthly transactions so we can 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.110
 see plastic coal and so on 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.830
 it's because I bring the ore or 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.050
 there I have a lot of abandoned buildings 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:00.470
 familiar happened 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.000
 their goal scorers 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.830
 that's also the fault when we have 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.170
 spent five years and blows on 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.490
 point that we can not face and 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.170
 we all want to face 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.550
 to the problems well ben here it is on a 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.550
 little more complicated or a little longer 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:19.190
 but in the rest is a non 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.170
 it's good so that's it for 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.110
 the industry here so after that can 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.880
 improve with a commercial port that 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.160
 I have news and because I put 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.740
 then I do not have much interest in 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.610
 the moment but we can do so 1 a 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.630
 commercial port where you can 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.170
 here to a train station 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.490
 merchandise 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.560
 here I have not done well there 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:44.620
 should I turn it's true that I 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.620
 I would not try veers has 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.580
 tourist magar than I have 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.550
 nothing to fuck and that I put rather the 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.600
 freight train station and that 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.190
 once connected blow I could 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.670
 maybe better exported walking saying 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.940
 that's something to dig for 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.740
 me 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.180
 I showed you a little bit ah yes 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.190
 so ok I have the view of the area 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.800
 who bugged it's a shame because I 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.680
 wanted to show you our city that 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.080
 that's what it is here you see me it's 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.049
 the servers there I will not be able 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.620
 to do better I apologize but here we go 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.620
 regarding 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:27.629
 oil and a little bit about 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.240
 is coal metal what but on it

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.210
 another city that is dedicated to mining 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:37.710
 of minerals here thank you for following me 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.979
