00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
flow into the action

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.040 
flow into the action
you<00:00:31.740> put<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> trapping<00:00:32.430> on<00:00:32.520> already<00:00:32.790> onto<00:00:33.239> level

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
you put a trapping on already onto level

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.569 
you put a trapping on already onto level
1<00:00:34.350> due<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:35.840> pressing<00:00:36.840> stepping<00:00:37.559> oh<00:00:37.770> this

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
1 due to the pressing stepping oh this

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.510 
1 due to the pressing stepping oh this
thing<00:00:38.820> would<00:00:39.329> confound<00:00:39.870> them<00:00:40.140> together<00:00:40.520> -

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
thing would confound them together -

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.569 
thing would confound them together -
made<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> moment<00:00:42.360> come<00:00:43.110> by<00:00:43.440> them<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.460> they

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
made a moment come by them in so they

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.190 
made a moment come by them in so they
can<00:00:44.760> make<00:00:44.940> some<00:00:45.090> action<00:00:45.480> twin<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:45.930> they<00:00:46.050> can

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
can make some action twin so they can

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.440 
can make some action twin so they can
see<00:00:46.379> how<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.530> work<00:00:46.800> let<00:00:47.550> me<00:00:47.579> show<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:47.879> here<00:00:48.239> how

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
see how it work let me show you here how

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.020 
see how it work let me show you here how
to<00:00:49.170> do<00:00:49.500> them<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:50.039> they<00:00:50.160> can<00:00:50.309> see<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.610> ideally

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
to do them so they can see the ideally

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.049 
to do them so they can see the ideally
before<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.270> gym<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:52.530> idea<00:00:52.980> remember<00:00:53.670> when<00:00:53.969> they

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
before a gym the idea remember when they

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.110 
before a gym the idea remember when they
do<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.270> punch<00:00:54.480> oh<00:00:54.660> ok<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.340> then<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.699> trap<00:00:56.969> him

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
do the punch oh ok and then you trap him

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.689 
do the punch oh ok and then you trap him
and<00:00:57.300> then<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.750> push<00:00:57.960> them<00:00:58.050> other<00:00:58.199> way<00:00:58.550> this<00:00:59.550> is

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
and then you push them other way this is

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.670 
and then you push them other way this is
the<00:00:59.820> idea<00:01:00.300> when<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.660> come<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.140> make<00:01:01.410> even

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
the idea when you come in to make even

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.670 
the idea when you come in to make even
happen<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.100> reality<00:01:03.019> this<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.170> how<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.379> do

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
happen in reality this is how you do

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.350 
happen in reality this is how you do
them<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.369> problem<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.820> attack<00:01:06.240> me

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
them this is the problem is attack me

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.080 
them this is the problem is attack me
faster<00:01:09.650> you<00:01:10.650> pour<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.189> line<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.909> can

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
faster you pour the in line so you can

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.710 
faster you pour the in line so you can
able<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.689> Newton<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.500> leg<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:14.189> kick<00:01:14.400> later

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
movement and why we could I power up

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.690 
movement and why we could I power up
like<00:03:03.480> you<00:03:03.870> in<00:03:04.020> a<00:03:04.080> house<00:03:04.260> for<00:03:04.500> one<00:03:05.220> more<00:03:05.430> slowly

happening a machine that functional

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.570 
happening a machine that functional
properly<00:03:45.990> there<00:03:46.830> communicate<00:03:47.340> with<00:03:47.460> you

properly so you can able to make this

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.740 
properly so you can able to make this
movement<00:03:49.560> work<00:03:49.940> otherwise<00:03:50.940> it's<00:03:51.540> very

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
movement work otherwise it's very

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.900 
movement work otherwise it's very
difficult<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.650> make<00:03:52.830> your<00:03:52.980> body<00:03:53.160> do<00:03:53.460> thing<00:03:53.730> in

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
a real time when the real time comes so

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.360 
a real time when the real time comes so
many<00:03:57.270> things<00:03:57.450> happen<00:03:57.750> so<00:03:58.470> spend<00:03:59.040> little<00:03:59.220> bit
