00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.460
 Why I have such a place but really 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.640
 But when a baseball club is held, it's a happy birthday special 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.019
 I want to start school 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:25.039
 I'm getting older but I'm not doing anything other than me 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.480
 is not it 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.480
 Nogawa is not now 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.489
 That's why it's the same 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.980
 I remembered 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.980
 I could see that two days 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.590
 None is smoldering 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.120
 Start a classmate 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.850
 Why are you always in my room 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.610
 I'm going back to the room where the three girls are sitting together 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.710
 You are 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.300
 I am sorry 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.540
 Then you can get rid of the shoebox 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.330
 I do not enter at all 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.300
 It will not be necessary 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.640
 Please return soon 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.990
 Seems to indicate it costs money 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.990
 In the first round open battle 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.720
 I got 2 pitchers in Japan 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.630
 It had already changed when we got up in the morning 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.830
 Do exactly 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.640
 Listen to the details 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.760
 I do not understand 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.760
 I don't feel like it's a mischief 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.400
 I am not familiar with the previous week 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.330
 And you have to bother with new features 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.860
 Afghan 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.860
 Please do not with Mr. Murata 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.200
 See you soon 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.050
 Why 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.320
 I have a warm person 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.120
 Do you have something to convey 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.110
 7 losses from meeting 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.090
 It is usable because it is good 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.770
 Please see
