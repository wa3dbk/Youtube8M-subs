00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.689
Herat Province is a predominantly rural area
of western Afghanistan, bordering Iran and

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:24.250
Turkmenistan. In one of the remote, high desert
villages, called Yaka-tut, a platoon of U.S.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.759
and Afghan National Army Soldiers are the
only thing standing between peaceful civilians,

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.360
and the various insurgent forces.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.700
The Platoon’s mission is to bring security
and stability to the region. To do this, the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.960
Platoon employs a sophisticated mix of lethal
and non-lethal activities, which range from

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.829
combat operations to constructing health clinics
and schools.

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.370
Battlefield lessons learned have demonstrated
that language proficiency, and an understanding

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.800
of foreign culture, are vital enablers for
full spectrum operations. As a result, general

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.469
purpose forces are seeing more Squad Designated
Linguists.

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:07.960
(In Dari)

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:16.600
When Army Specialist Kevin Chalkley, a Cavalry
Scout at Ft. Carson, Colorado signed up to

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.920
study Dari, he thought the classes would just
be a fun way to prepare for his deployment

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.730
to Afghanistan. Instead, the Defense Language
Institute Training Detachment, prepared Chalkley

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:32.141
to form an enduring bond between his Platoon,
the local Afghan population and the Afghan

00:01:32.141 --> 00:01:34.310
Army Soldiers living next door.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.440
“The squad designated linguist is an assigned
person, for each section in our platoon, and

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.160
they help bridge the gap – the language
gap – between the Soldiers and the Afghans

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:50.210
we work with. We work with the ANA, ANP and
I help bridge that language gap.”

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.190
Chalkley’s Dari skills proved critical the
day seven Afghan soldiers were severely injured

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.590
when their vehicle struck an Improvised Explosive
Device and there were no contracted translators

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.590
around to help.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.360
“We were able to use our squad designated
linguist to talk with the casualties and find

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.229
out what was wrong so we could treat them.
Having a linguist there allowed our medics

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:16.849
to effectively apply the aid needed and I
can say that it helped save two soldiers lives

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.099
that day.”

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.980
With contracted translators in short supply,
Chalkley’s conversational Dari has enabled

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:31.110
relationships with his Afghan Army brothers,
which he will treasure for the rest of his

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.110
life.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.700
(In Dari)

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.860
The Platoon also feels a strong connection
with their Afghan neighbors, in part because

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.870
of Chalkley’s ability to speak Dari. So
much so, that one of the Platoon’s favorite

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.420
pass-times, is to conduct operations, which
directly benefit the Afghan people with whom

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.950
they live.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.900
Counter insurgency efforts are difficult at
best. However, as Chalkley and his Platoon

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.260
have learned, knowing something of the local
language and culture, goes a long way to making

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.170
things easier.
