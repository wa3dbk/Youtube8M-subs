00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:13.610
 Hello before creating a thumbnail in 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.890
 eastern style 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:24.590
 I suggest you make simple 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:30.539
 exercises we wet a sheet of paper with water 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:35.660
 take in hands all the same great greatness 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:43.879
 brush and light movements lay 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:48.989
 leaf background use translucent 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:52.699
 shades with low paint content 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:57.030
 brush tip and now such 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:01:03.090
 zigzag figurative movements relaxed 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:06.390
 hand control the amount of paint and 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.510
 water on the tip of the brush then you can 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:15.259
 create space in work see 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:18.650
 here appeared the foreground and background and 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:23.060
 here I show how the blunt end of the brush 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:27.780
 you can create various effects 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:30.540
 stretching the still dry paint it 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.869
 coarse bristle brush and 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.259
 and and small punches on paper 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.470
 also create a certain effect which 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.100
 useful to us when creating 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.100
 watercolor miniatures 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:52.280
 this is the use of a small brush 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:58.039
 such a technique is possible to create 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:01.899
 the crowns of the foliage tree and such 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.899
 extra brush movements 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.740
 exercise shook
