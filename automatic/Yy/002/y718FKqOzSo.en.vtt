00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.349
 usual hair I start by separating 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:33.880
 the hair above the forehead that I 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.880
 will use to create mattress 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.629
 the next step is only an option 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.879
 to give volume to fine hair 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.649
 and dishes like mine and so I 'm leaving 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.019
 it's a powder that melted on my 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.059
 roots to give them texture 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.339

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.909
 professional 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.369
 now you have to work the surface 

00:01:50.359 --> 00:02:00.929
 we will gently brush the hair 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:02:01.469
 to harmonize rates see the 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:03.060
 difference 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.700
 it's subtle but still 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.530
 impressive we still have pancakes 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.399
 and the hair in the back and the other 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.399
 side of the head 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.010
 before creating a waterfall on top 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.510
 of the head 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.000
 put the hair you are not going 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.980
 spit in a ponytail then 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.990
 separated three small wicks at the top 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.690
 from the front started as if you were doing 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.210
 an African braid wicked 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.190

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.190
 the left mhd on the middle wick 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.780
 then let go the wick on the right take 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:05.610
 a new wick on the right side is 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:07.320
 spent there in the middle the chain the wick of 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.850
 left 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:16.490
 take a new wick on the left 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:23.210
 went there in the middle and so we let go 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:23.210
 we take in cross 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:56.069
 we let go we cross it 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:57.959
 suites to fix the braid attach 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:19.889
 the last three brown with a small 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:23.070
 elastic and here is your comfortable waterfalls 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.810
 very modern and original at once if 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.440
 you're going to wear it like that with 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.840
 Released hair 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.479
 do not forget to go well with 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.070
 lacquer otherwise we can mess up our 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.580
 hair in a very ponytail 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.889
 chic 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.169
 first you have to gather your hair 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:40.970
 then adjust the branches of the waterfall 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.970
 to give them the desired movements 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:05:00.599
 finally to finish we use a 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.229
 little lock of hair to hide 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:03.229
 elastic 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:07.939
 we fix the tip with a pin 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:13.560
