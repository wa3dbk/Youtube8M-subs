00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
but you'll still need to use two color

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.600 
but you'll still need to use two color
points<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:50.959> apply<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.739> same<00:02:52.069> color<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.519> them

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
maximum full width I will explain why

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.600 
maximum full width I will explain why
did<00:03:05.000> I<00:03:05.120> choose<00:03:05.390> maximum<00:03:06.380> full<00:03:06.590> width<00:03:06.830> in<00:03:07.040> the

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
later part of this video now we have set

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.640 
later part of this video now we have set
properties<00:03:10.700> for<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.060> row<00:03:11.210> I'll<00:03:11.480> add<00:03:11.780> a<00:03:12.080> new

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.400 

let's<00:03:40.800> give<00:03:41.800> it<00:03:42.040> as<00:03:42.250> a<00:03:43.000> heading<00:03:43.510> by<00:03:43.810> adding<00:03:44.110> h1

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
let's give it as a heading by adding h1

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.730 
let's give it as a heading by adding h1
tags

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.070 

and<00:03:48.150> have<00:03:49.150> a
