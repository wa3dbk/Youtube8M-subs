into the RMF abilities because he does

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.090 
into the RMF abilities because he does
have<00:01:41.229> quite<00:01:41.560> a<00:01:41.619> few

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
have quite a few

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.040 
have quite a few
why<00:01:42.520> don't<00:01:42.760> you<00:01:42.850> won't<00:01:43.030> be<00:01:43.240> seeing<00:01:43.479> is<00:01:43.690> flare

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
why don't you won't be seeing is flare

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.500 
why don't you won't be seeing is flare
firework<00:01:44.710> and<00:01:44.979> with<00:01:45.580> the<00:01:45.670> secondary<00:01:46.119> I<00:01:46.210> use

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
firework and with the secondary I use

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.910 
firework and with the secondary I use
it's<00:01:46.690> kind<00:01:46.840> of<00:01:46.900> useless<00:01:47.229> because<00:01:47.530> it<00:01:47.740> makes

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
it's kind of useless because it makes

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.630 
it's kind of useless because it makes
the<00:01:48.070> each<00:01:48.340> flare<00:01:48.900> fly<00:01:49.900> 50%<00:01:50.830> slower<00:01:51.070> with<00:01:51.610> a

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
the each flare fly 50% slower with a

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.250 
the each flare fly 50% slower with a
cost<00:01:51.970> of<00:01:52.210> being<00:01:52.390> able<00:01:52.570> to<00:01:52.690> detonate<00:01:53.050> your

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
cost of being able to detonate your

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.510 
cost of being able to detonate your
flare<00:01:53.590> like<00:01:53.740> a<00:01:53.770> detonator<00:01:54.330> but<00:01:55.330> moving<00:01:56.260> on

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
flare like a detonator but moving on

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.270 
flare like a detonator but moving on
this<00:01:57.520> is<00:01:57.820> that<00:01:58.390> ability<00:01:58.720> is<00:01:59.080> the<00:01:59.590> afterburner

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
this is that ability is the afterburner

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.930 
this is that ability is the afterburner
it<00:02:00.580> allows<00:02:01.210> you<00:02:01.479> to<00:02:01.509> have<00:02:01.899> a<00:02:01.960> jet<00:02:02.500> pack<00:02:02.800> and<00:02:03.130> it

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
it allows you to have a jet pack and it

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.540 
it allows you to have a jet pack and it
consumes<00:02:04.860> flamethrower<00:02:05.860> ammunition<00:02:06.429> it

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
consumes flamethrower ammunition it

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.219 
consumes flamethrower ammunition it
consumes<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:07.030> bit<00:02:07.240> but<00:02:07.660> with<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:07.869> secondary

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
consumes the bit but with the secondary

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.770 
consumes the bit but with the secondary
I<00:02:08.380> have<00:02:08.710> it's<00:02:09.009> very<00:02:09.369> useful<00:02:09.850> that<00:02:10.450> is<00:02:10.630> the

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
I have it's very useful that is the

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.570 
I have it's very useful that is the
burns<00:02:10.990> they<00:02:11.200> present<00:02:11.710> it<00:02:11.830> can<00:02:11.860> only<00:02:12.070> be<00:02:12.250> used

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
burns they present it can only be used

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.670 
burns they present it can only be used

with the back burner take the hundred
ammo<00:02:15.130> to<00:02:15.730> use<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:17.290> that's<00:02:17.620> it<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:18.150> this<00:02:19.150> is<00:02:19.510> the

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
ammo to use it that's it and this is the

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.120 
ammo to use it that's it and this is the
this<00:02:21.610> guy's<00:02:21.880> jutsu<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:23.500> turns<00:02:23.770> you<00:02:23.890> into<00:02:23.920> a

this guy's jutsu it turns you into a

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.870 
this guy's jutsu it turns you into a
barrel<00:02:24.600> it's<00:02:25.600> pretty<00:02:25.960> useless<00:02:26.550> okay

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
barrel it's pretty useless okay

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.850 
barrel it's pretty useless okay
don't<00:02:28.480> use<00:02:28.780> this<00:02:28.960> ability<00:02:29.850> yeah<00:02:30.850> just<00:02:31.210> don't
