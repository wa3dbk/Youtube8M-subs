don't shoot I think it's completely a
legitimate<00:00:36.059> expression<00:00:36.600> if<00:00:36.690> I'll<00:00:36.809> they<00:00:37.320> were

and<00:01:13.979> that's<00:01:14.340> not<00:01:14.460> true<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:15.420> know<00:01:15.540> i<00:01:15.570> mean<00:01:15.840> so

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
and that's not true you know i mean so

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.830 
and that's not true you know i mean so
people<00:01:16.770> can<00:01:17.340> disagree<00:01:17.610> about<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.270> grand<00:01:18.600> jury

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
decided and things may still happen in

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.749 
decided and things may still happen in
Ferguson<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.340> don't<00:01:23.340> think<00:01:23.490> there's<00:01:23.640> any

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
Ferguson so I don't think there's any

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.390 
Ferguson so I don't think there's any
legitimacy<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.689> my<00:01:25.140> one<00:01:25.530> concern<00:01:25.890> and

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
legitimacy to that my one concern and

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.880 
legitimacy to that my one concern and
it's<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.880> small<00:01:27.240> concern<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.380> think

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
it's a small concern is that I think

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.980 
it's a small concern is that I think
sometimes<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.430> need<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:30.090> pick<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.689> choose

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
sometimes you need to pick and choose

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.840 
sometimes you need to pick and choose
the<00:01:31.439> context<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.159> where<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.520> want<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.790> get

the st. Louis Rams play I think it's

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.280 
the st. Louis Rams play I think it's
something<00:02:51.060> that<00:02:51.330> is<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.540> business<00:02:52.020> decision

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
something that is a business decision

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.440 
something that is a business decision
for<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.680> people<00:02:52.950> that<00:02:52.980> who<00:02:53.459> pay<00:02:53.670> them<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.090> if

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
for the people that who pay them and if

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.000 
for the people that who pay them and if
they<00:02:54.480> have<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.780> problem<00:02:54.840> with<00:02:55.320> it<00:02:55.350> that<00:02:55.920> would

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
they have a problem with it that would

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.830 
they have a problem with it that would
be<00:02:56.220> in<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.580> that's<00:02:56.850> very<00:02:57.090> sure<00:02:57.300> I<00:02:57.330> was<00:02:57.600> proud<00:02:57.780> of

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
be in it that's very sure I was proud of

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.240 
be in it that's very sure I was proud of
them<00:02:58.050> for<00:02:58.080> protesting<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:58.890> I<00:02:58.980> thought<00:02:59.160> they

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
them for protesting and I thought they

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.810 
them for protesting and I thought they
make<00:02:59.400> good<00:02:59.550> use<00:02:59.760> of<00:02:59.790> their<00:03:00.239> television<00:03:00.630> time
