00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
I stopped in between the strike of the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.950 
I stopped in between the strike of the
whisk<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.789> you're<00:00:51.030> now<00:00:51.180> seeing<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.629> bottom

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
whisk that you're now seeing the bottom

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.830 
whisk that you're now seeing the bottom
here<00:00:52.309> it's<00:00:53.309> definitely<00:00:53.940> it's<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.300> thick<00:00:54.510> to

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
here it's definitely it's a thick to

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.860 
here it's definitely it's a thick to
listening<00:00:55.289> yep<00:00:55.739> I'm<00:00:56.399> removing<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:57.059> there<00:00:57.510> I

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
listening yep I'm removing it there I

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.650 
listening yep I'm removing it there I
think<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.129> good<00:00:59.340> thinner<00:00:59.550> that<00:01:00.510> way

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
think that this is good thinner that way

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.660 
think that this is good thinner that way
that<00:01:00.899> part<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.500> Yolanda's<00:01:02.010> we<00:01:02.250> call<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
that part of the Yolanda's we call the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.960 
that part of the Yolanda's we call the
sabayon<00:01:03.470> and<00:01:04.470> sometimes<00:01:04.979> we<00:01:05.100> use<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.790> add

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
sabayon and sometimes we use that to add

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.179 
sabayon and sometimes we use that to add
to<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.270> fish<00:01:06.479> sauce<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.049> all<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:07.890> here

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
to a fish sauce and all that so here

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.039 
to a fish sauce and all that so here
should<00:01:08.729> be<00:01:08.850> really<00:01:09.119> kind<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.420> off<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.869> heat

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
should be really kind of off the heat

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.070 
should be really kind of off the heat
and<00:01:10.740> start<00:01:11.010> putting<00:01:11.280> your<00:01:11.610> own<00:01:11.850> butter<00:01:12.570> and

but I think the English muffin is a

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.780 
but I think the English muffin is a
little<00:01:55.350> bit<00:01:55.470> tough<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.860> cut<00:01:56.369> I'd<00:01:56.549> much<00:01:56.759> rather

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
have a nice brioche bread and cut a
