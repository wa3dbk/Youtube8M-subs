when<00:02:23.879> the<00:02:24.030> alarms<00:02:24.420> would<00:02:24.599> go<00:02:24.780> off<00:02:25.340> so<00:02:26.340> let's<00:02:27.060> go

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
when the alarms would go off so let's go

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:34.670 
when the alarms would go off so let's go
ahead<00:02:27.329> and<00:02:31.790> scroll<00:02:32.790> through<00:02:33.209> you<00:02:34.019> can<00:02:34.230> change

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
ahead and scroll through you can change

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.680 
ahead and scroll through you can change
the<00:02:34.920> tune<00:02:35.190> if<00:02:35.459> you<00:02:35.579> want<00:02:37.519> and<00:02:38.519> I<00:02:39.209> don't<00:02:39.390> think<00:02:39.569> I

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
the tune if you want and I don't think I

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:48.619 
the tune if you want and I don't think I
have<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.959> send<00:02:40.230> on<00:02:45.980> so<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.310> is<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:48.030> Samsung

included and you also have a sprint
software<00:03:15.739> store<00:03:16.739> however<00:03:17.700> there's<00:03:18.389> also

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
software store however there's also

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.069 
software store however there's also
marketplace<00:03:20.250> which<00:03:20.669> I<00:03:20.940> think<00:03:21.299> personally<00:03:21.690> is

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
marketplace which I think personally is

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.319 
marketplace which I think personally is
a<00:03:22.109> better<00:03:22.560> shopping<00:03:22.889> experience<00:03:23.730> for<00:03:24.150> your

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
a better shopping experience for your

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.830 
a better shopping experience for your
applications<00:03:26.510> what's<00:03:27.510> also<00:03:27.690> interesting

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
applications what's also interesting

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.339 
applications what's also interesting

instead of the clear memory they put it

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.309 
instead of the clear memory they put it
under<00:03:39.569> the<00:03:39.599> phone<00:03:40.139> under<00:03:40.919> settings<00:03:41.459> and<00:03:41.910> you

sprint store to get it which is a minor

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.599 
sprint store to get it which is a minor
nuisance<00:03:57.690> but<00:03:58.230> it<00:03:58.949> prevents<00:03:59.400> you<00:03:59.579> from

you didn't want to on other HTC phones

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.849 
you didn't want to on other HTC phones
it's<00:04:05.519> actually<00:04:05.909> under<00:04:06.000> settings<00:04:06.599> and<00:04:06.959> if<00:04:07.739> you
