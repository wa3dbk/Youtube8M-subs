 select five reasons to buy one 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.480
 automatic is harder than it looks 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.280
 not that it does not have five qualities 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.780
 but rather because we have to 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.580
 select five from a number well 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.380
 higher since motorola did a job 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.380
 and so much here we go to them 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.830
 the battery is sure to call it the most 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.779
 attention to the automatic that even 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.579
 responsible for naming the device 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.610
 we're talking about nothing less than 3 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.680
 one thousand and 900 thousand in skins or mine 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.320
 damn leg capable of rivaling until 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.570
 even with 7-inch tablets, which 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.280
 it means in the real world or the worst 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.899
 of the hypotheses the guarantee of one day 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.360
 intense use for those who can not 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.950
 stay away from the smartphone in the best two 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.950
 days out of the moderate use outlet 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.870
 if the x2014 engine already surprised us with 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.420
 32 GB of internal memory by default 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.970
 64 gb of moto max is still news 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.650
 better is plenty of space for those who 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.700
 likes to carry all kinds of files in the 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.020
 smartphone 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.610
 the max motor is one of the first 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.530
 models to arrive in brazil with this 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.360
 all internal memory space 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.400
 most of the manufacturers settled the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.500
 16 gigabytes and outsourcing the increase 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.200
 from the space on a micro sd card to the 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.790
 User to buy the part that is 64 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.100
 gigabytes begins to give a little more 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.970
 competitiveness in the high end segment 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.970
 that is very welcome 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.320
 the 805 snapdragon is the top of the pyramid 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.180
 android world in 2014 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.130
 just the most advanced chips than 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.500
 This is the moment that counts on excellent 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.970
 performance for the most demanding public 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.160
 with fast it is fast enough 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.410
 to allow multitasking between two 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.030
 advanced games fast to endure 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.250
 any season place thor for a good 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.890
 fast enough to run a 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.690
 video hd fast for almost everything 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.690
 you need your smartphone now 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.659
 even though it uses an almost pure version 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.369
 from android to motorola puts a set 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.360
 of software to differentiate between 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.940
 your appliances 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.670
 as well as the x2014 engine we have the active 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.010
 display migration motorola watch 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.480
 google nal always active this shows that 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.069
 you do not have to change the 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.200
 device and put a lot of apps 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.610
 useless to differentiate the brand as good 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.650
 part of the manufacturers do with their 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.239
 models and weigh more than they should in the 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.610
 memory and do not bring as many benefits 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:32.780
 so just add some software 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.780
 cool and full stop 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.769
 Let's convene 2,200 reais is nothing. 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.870
 Cheap but worth a value in the 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.370
 case of tomato that is both a smartphone 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.230
 and costs much cheaper than 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.819
 virtually any direct competitor 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.440
 is the first time that my bike 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.880
 through the band of 2 thousand reais 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.709
 while other manufacturers are 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.480
 coming close to 3 thousand reais without 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.310
 offer benefits compatible with 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.680
 that's what it's already possible to find 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.810
 a tomato with lower values 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.560
 further improving the cost benefit 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.110
 these were the top five 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.950
 advantages of the moto max but he also does not 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.569
 it's perfect 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.519
 this other video see five points that 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.959
 could be improved in the apparatus 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.880
 if you liked it short here below and so 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.660
