 news about game with games 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.590
 month of June which 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.660
 obviously they were already confirmed and well 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.279
 with the end of the month it's time to reveal the 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.380
 games that will be given away in the services 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.390
 of subscription of the following month and we 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.579
 it's time to know what the games of the month are 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.500
 June gold kenwood so good 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.030
 As usual, we have what 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.010
 which is a game not for this usual 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.469
 during what is the whole month in this 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.120
 case is massify live a game of 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.609
 tactical action developed by double 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.190
 fine the broking game developers 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:48.920
 among others the game that is repeated is a 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.230
 action fx which already has enough 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.940
 months being given almost almost almost 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.739
 almost like three months I think if I do not 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.989
 wrong is a game the truth that is 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.370
 very well then repetitive truth I do not know 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.769
 what are you thinking then microsoft 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.879
 to give what is this game 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.920
 only the only new game is the most 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.900
 already light which obviously I hope that 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.150
 they like it very much but good in 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.070
 case of the 360 ​​because we have two games very 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.170
 funny square-enix during the 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.330
 the first fortnight we will be able to untie what 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.750
 Chaos is more absolute what 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.790
 they 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.980
 it's a very entertaining game I liked it 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.930
 very much I played it and I hope that they 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.790
 like it too so take advantage and 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.110
 download everything else later what 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.510
 I will warn about this game not 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.460
 but good while during what 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.830
 the second fortnight then we have to do 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.690
 a little more stealthy with time a game 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.070
 the very very very addictive truth very 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.630
 Entertaining the truth they will not happen 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.270
 pretty good I think this game I'm going 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.530
 brand new so stay tuned to 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.510
 that the lower part I find that is the 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.979
 channel tweets to go and then 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.290
 well look what this game is what 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.180
 length of what is the stream so that 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.890
 obviously, they spend it there 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.080
 Well, no, but I hope you have them 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.399
 really liked this little video 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.259
 I count that louis what are networks 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.729
 and the channel for more videos if 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.229
 have any doubt you already know comment on 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.640
 the bottom part go directly what 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.160
 I studied because I answer a lot 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.360
 faster so well I must also 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.770
 leave a small question what what 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.110
 they think about the games that are 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.149
 giving away microsoft so let's leave 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.739
 comment the part below either 360 or 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.630
 from the one you know I am the principal 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.630
 Now we are in the next I
