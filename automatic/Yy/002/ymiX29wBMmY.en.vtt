 sight 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.200
 video file count and also 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.200
 caching plan to view descendants ok 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:26.710
 and here it is 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.390
 protection interface pretty 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.410
 pretty here on this planet 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.030

 tourist board 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.780
 playlists and here they are added 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.600
 Well, let's order 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.390
 but let's go 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.860
 first of all 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.570
 settings let's see what their settings 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.540
 it means our settings 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.700
 Search 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.390
 the purpose of his floated camp 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.010
 by keyword 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.360
 but the search can be entrusted to management 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.560
 of course 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.390
 can 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.680
 current boyfriend sleeping girl all 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.630
 tracks 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.450
 according to the old rules white dress for 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.750
 the differences 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:15.550
 to cache 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.670
 the form of management of the chestnut that is, if 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.130
 A percentage of this is already viewed 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.430
 experts believe if you use 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.660
 even 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.090
 proton m 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.360
 why by the way immediately take shape so here 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.590
 layout of buttons for example with the participation of 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.590
 that almost 100 porn hour we will see what 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.000
 also here you can timer 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.140
 to put 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.060
 background replay that's what's interesting how 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.470
 fee for not say 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.620
 so that 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.420
 play background 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.939
 because in order in this window 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:51.720
 games and catching which will be considered you can 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.320
 compare there to look for another bucket 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.460
 so cats will play current 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.619
 can choose video quality 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.360
 reproduces play mini 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.510
 turntable 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.510
 here is the son of 320 letters 125080 russia 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.590
 kisa 29 is more than enough for 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.229
 telephone interrogation because in 720 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.029
 will put 

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:12.250
 well and then 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.040
 save the play point that 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.959
 conveniently forge elements skp 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.329
 the growth from the works quickly in 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.589
 seeking control gesture 

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:21.750
 with this you can 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.989
 in a matchmaker various works like these players 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.669
 but in principle not to show everything 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:29.389
 motion 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:31.579
 now let's see how in the elite 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.679
 to the scammers what 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:36.079
 all represent get up go accounting 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.009
 The subscription interest record is given 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:44.349
 let's see defense and he 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:45.379
 anything 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.699
 I like the question 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:50.389
 tons 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:53.029
 but then you can send what is not 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:55.599
 what have you got 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.679
 but time from quality 

00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:59.549
 click on add that is 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.409
 let's say there will be tourists founded and 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:02.379
 proteins 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.079
 can find click save 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.699
 shorten as a local list 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:09.429
 play 

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:12.739
 let the day here on the shoulders of this and that 

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:16.569
 and wow let Beijing go cash 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.649
 cache safarov 

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:22.649
 attempts are expanding we can about see 

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:31.029
 Hello 

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:33.259
 protocol for implementation 

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:36.309
 planned like this 

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:38.399
 treatment works here 

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:40.129
 this is what planets look like 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:42.699
 employees can be funny 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:44.529
 from where there is a certain point 

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:46.349
 let's say ap 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.299
 and here we are bypassing the tourist product 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:49.439
 loudness 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.779
 but let's say here it will be necessary point b 

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:55.149
 now you will play about what to 

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:56.879
 points b then treat cyclically 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.739
 naturally you can through 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:03:59.909
 Further 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:00.999
 Clay 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:02.449
 play video 

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:05.449
 repeat doing speed 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:12.109
 here is slider background broth speed 

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:17.429
 12 grew 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:23.599
 let be 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:25.550
 but in general 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.400
 because there is still a small menu 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.659
 but why 

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:32.090
 show hawi 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.810
 it means you can loop 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.710
 view information 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.210
 here is the name 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.999
 which means 

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:42.020
 however, there is nothing to include 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.879
 Search 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:47.080
 provocateurs well if unavailable 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.080
 why not show a ton 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.889
 here it means so 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:56.490
 we are just at the beginning 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.729
 and on the bookmark I suppose the bookmark rulebook 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:01.849
 on video som which is very convenient 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:04.849
 can move on purchases 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.139
 still as possible 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:12.139
 finger attacks to act 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.419
 two Pakistani cavity 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:23.339
 see children want to buy 

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:26.339

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:30.069
 that is, you can install 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:32.680
 and now see where we appear 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.050

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.849

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:54.939
 I strongly advise everyone this application but how 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:58.439
 all this testifies to anyone 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:59.719
 who needs it 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:01.919
 and to be really comfortable especially 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:03.080
 for occasions 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.509
 in which only in Spain it is not to 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:07.309
 this is just a fairy tale 

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:08.750
 Thanks for watching 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.129
 I hope this review is for you 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:13.430
 basically liked 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.199
 I had to remove this perspective 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:17.270
 video camera 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.669
 the poet camera is lame 5 5 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:21.520
