00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
that so as far as the gameplay goes i

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.940 
that so as far as the gameplay goes i
know<00:05:34.030> i'm<00:05:34.360> just<00:05:34.630> like<00:05:34.750> 19<00:05:35.320> and<00:05:35.350> 8<00:05:35.590> in<00:05:35.770> this

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
know i'm just like 19 and 8 in this

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.670

which<00:05:36.190> is<00:05:36.340> more<00:05:36.520> than<00:05:36.550> two<00:05:36.850> point<00:05:37.060> oh<00:05:37.300> but<00:05:37.780> I'm

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
which is more than two point oh but I'm

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.380 
which is more than two point oh but I'm
not<00:05:38.860> the<00:05:39.010> best<00:05:39.190> player<00:05:39.490> and<00:05:39.790> I<00:05:39.880> specifically

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
not the best player and I specifically

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.030 
not the best player and I specifically
chose<00:05:40.510> this<00:05:40.900> foot<00:05:41.230> not<00:05:41.470> only<00:05:41.650> for<00:05:41.890> the<00:05:42.010> time

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.040 
chose this foot not only for the time

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.150 
chose this foot not only for the time
but<00:05:43.000> also<00:05:43.600> for<00:05:43.930> the<00:05:44.020> quality<00:05:44.380> of<00:05:44.410> gameplay<00:05:44.860> I

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
but also for the quality of gameplay I

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.830 
but also for the quality of gameplay I
know<00:05:45.430> it's<00:05:45.700> not<00:05:45.820> the<00:05:46.000> best<00:05:46.180> and<00:05:46.480> like<00:05:46.600> you<00:05:46.810> know

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.450 
know it's not the best and like you know
I<00:05:46.930> just<00:05:47.020> completely<00:05:47.530> owned<00:05:47.800> that<00:05:48.010> guy<00:05:48.220> but<00:05:48.400> it

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
I just completely owned that guy but it

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.900 
I just completely owned that guy but it
look<00:05:48.580> like<00:05:48.700> a<00:05:48.730> no<00:05:48.910> scope<00:05:49.180> I<00:05:50.520> put<00:05:51.520> it<00:05:51.640> up<00:05:51.730> because

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
look like a no scope I put it up because

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.730 
look like a no scope I put it up because
I<00:05:52.210> wanted<00:05:52.450> to<00:05:52.510> showcase<00:05:52.780> the<00:05:53.200> fact<00:05:53.440> that<00:05:53.560> i'm

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
human and this is not exactly typical of

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:00.900 
human and this is not exactly typical of

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.590 
you know what I mean more domination in
the<00:06:08.320> game<00:06:08.500> like<00:06:08.950> not<00:06:09.310> the<00:06:09.490> mode<00:06:09.670> but<00:06:09.940> actual

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600 
the game like not the mode but actual

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.200 
the game like not the mode but actual
domination<00:06:11.200> of<00:06:11.260> the<00:06:11.320> other<00:06:11.500> players

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210
