service<00:00:09.019> and<00:00:10.019> we<00:00:10.110> do<00:00:10.260> it<00:00:10.320> on<00:00:10.379> the<00:00:10.410> basis<00:00:10.860> of<00:00:11.039> a

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
service and we do it on the basis of a

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.060 
service and we do it on the basis of a
single<00:00:12.209> polygon<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:12.750> that's<00:00:13.590> just<00:00:13.740> correct

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
single polygon and that's just correct

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:25.939 
single polygon and that's just correct
something<00:00:14.219> very<00:00:14.549> quick<00:00:14.879> here

do is I want to actually create another

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.600 
do is I want to actually create another
polygon<00:00:37.750> between<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:39.280> face<00:00:39.640> and<00:00:39.970> that<00:00:40.320> face

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
polygon between that face and that face

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.009 
polygon between that face and that face
well<00:00:42.610> this<00:00:42.790> is<00:00:42.820> where<00:00:43.120> the<00:00:43.300> bridge<00:00:43.510> tool<00:00:43.780> comes

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:44.019 
well this is where the bridge tool comes

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:45.869 
well this is where the bridge tool comes
in<00:00:44.230> I'm<00:00:44.559> just<00:00:44.680> going<00:00:44.890> to<00:00:44.920> show<00:00:45.100> you<00:00:45.160> this<00:00:45.339> so

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
you slept two faces and you can click on

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.280 
you slept two faces and you can click on
the<00:00:47.830> bridge<00:00:48.040> and<00:00:48.960> while<00:00:49.960> up<00:00:50.170> there<00:00:50.550> we<00:00:51.550> go<00:00:51.730> and

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
the bridge and while up there we go and

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.840 
the bridge and while up there we go and
it's<00:00:53.290> also<00:00:53.559> handy<00:00:53.980> when<00:00:54.280> you've<00:00:54.430> got<00:00:54.610> two

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
it's also handy when you've got two

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.689 
it's also handy when you've got two
objects<00:00:55.329> that<00:00:55.570> you<00:00:55.659> want<00:00:55.870> to<00:00:55.930> join<00:00:56.020> together

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
objects that you want to join together

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.639 
objects that you want to join together
now<00:00:57.699> justice<00:00:58.360> demonstrate<00:00:59.020> this<00:00:59.140> I'm<00:00:59.350> going

now justice demonstrate this I'm going

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:05.639 
now justice demonstrate this I'm going
to<00:00:59.770> bring<00:00:59.980> on<00:01:00.129> two<00:01:00.460> cubes<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.730> when<00:01:03.879> a<00:01:04.649> copy

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:05.649 
to bring on two cubes and when a copy

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:07.050 
to bring on two cubes and when a copy
and<00:01:05.800> paste<00:01:06.039> so<00:01:06.220> we've<00:01:06.369> got<00:01:06.460> a<00:01:06.490> duplicate<00:01:06.729> of

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
and paste so we've got a duplicate of

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.240 
and paste so we've got a duplicate of
these<00:01:07.270> cubes<00:01:09.690> to<00:01:10.690> shift<00:01:11.020> click<00:01:11.740> so<00:01:12.100> we've

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
these cubes to shift click so we've

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.999 
these cubes to shift click so we've
split<00:01:12.550> them<00:01:12.700> both<00:01:12.850> at<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.119> same<00:01:13.330> time<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:17.009> you

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
split them both at the same time and you

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:19.740 
split them both at the same time and you
can<00:01:18.160> just<00:01:18.340> right<00:01:18.580> click<00:01:18.610> in<00:01:18.940> the<00:01:19.030> century<00:01:19.539> and

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
can just right click in the century and

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:30.510 
can just right click in the century and
click<00:01:20.020> on<00:01:20.200> group<00:01:20.619> in<00:01:20.860> route<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:29.229> there<00:01:30.069> we<00:01:30.280> can

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
click on group in route and there we can

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:38.029 
click on group in route and there we can
just<00:01:30.550> simply<00:01:34.740> click<00:01:35.740> on<00:01:35.890> these<00:01:36.009> two<00:01:36.660> and

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
just simply click on these two and

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:40.320 
just simply click on these two and
bridge<00:01:39.039> them<00:01:39.220> together<00:01:39.550> any<00:01:39.819> qualms<00:01:40.090> it

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
bridge them together any qualms it

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.790 
bridge them together any qualms it
becomes<00:01:40.660> one<00:01:40.929> single<00:01:41.470> object<00:01:41.649> now<00:01:43.619> now<00:01:44.619> that's

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
becomes one single object now now that's

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.080 
becomes one single object now now that's
one<00:01:44.920> of<00:01:45.009> those<00:01:45.099> things<00:01:45.160> you<00:01:45.459> just<00:01:45.580> gotta<00:01:45.910> play

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
one of those things you just gotta play

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.969 
one of those things you just gotta play
with<00:01:46.390> it<00:01:46.539> but<00:01:46.869> there'd<00:01:47.050> be<00:01:47.140> times<00:01:47.500> where<00:01:47.860> you

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
with it but there'd be times where you

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.240 
with it but there'd be times where you
really<00:01:48.340> do<00:01:48.550> need<00:01:49.000> that<00:01:49.060> bridge<00:01:49.649> when<00:01:50.649> you've

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
really do need that bridge when you've

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.070 
really do need that bridge when you've
got<00:01:51.399> open<00:01:51.729> gaps<00:01:51.970> and<00:01:52.390> when<00:01:52.539> you've<00:01:52.660> got<00:01:52.780> areas

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
got open gaps and when you've got areas

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.809

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
you want to fill in it can be very very

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:57.479 
you want to fill in it can be very very
handy<00:01:55.590> just<00:01:56.590> to<00:01:56.679> demonstrate<00:01:56.860> another

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:57.489 
handy just to demonstrate another

00:01:57.489 --> 00:02:01.589 
handy just to demonstrate another
feature<00:01:58.060> of<00:01:58.239> be<00:01:58.630> able<00:01:58.810> to<00:01:58.869> use<00:01:59.110> this<00:02:00.599> let's

00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:01.599

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:06.680 
feature of be able to use this let's
just<00:02:01.810> create<00:02:02.020> this<00:02:02.170> cube<00:02:02.770> as<00:02:03.009> an<00:02:03.160> example

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:15.750 

select<00:02:07.690> both<00:02:07.899> sides

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:26.850 

let's<00:02:16.760> just<00:02:16.880> people<00:02:17.300> in

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.200 

now<00:02:27.860> with<00:02:28.070> those<00:02:28.220> both<00:02:28.490> select<00:02:28.820> is<00:02:28.970> still<00:02:29.150> on

now with those both select is still on

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.780 
now with those both select is still on
both<00:02:29.360> sides<00:02:29.660> I'm<00:02:29.870> going<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:30.170> select<00:02:31.040> the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
both sides I'm going to select the

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.870 
both sides I'm going to select the
bridge<00:02:32.060> and<00:02:33.130> then<00:02:34.130> it<00:02:34.220> will<00:02:34.340> bridge<00:02:34.550> it<00:02:34.730> all

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
bridge and then it will bridge it all

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:43.360 
bridge and then it will bridge it all
the<00:02:35.030> way<00:02:35.150> through<00:02:35.480> I<00:02:41.740> love<00:02:42.740> of<00:02:42.890> such<00:02:43.070> case

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
where you would need a bridge if you've

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.020 
where you would need a bridge if you've
got<00:02:44.840> two<00:02:44.990> edges<00:02:45.350> and<00:02:45.560> you<00:02:46.250> wish<00:02:46.430> to<00:02:46.610> have<00:02:46.640> them

got two edges and you wish to have them

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.750 
got two edges and you wish to have them
joined<00:02:47.390> over<00:02:47.750> to<00:02:48.200> get<00:02:48.350> rid<00:02:48.470> of<00:02:48.500> a<00:02:48.650> gap<00:02:48.830> then<00:02:49.640> you

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
joined over to get rid of a gap then you

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.370 
joined over to get rid of a gap then you
can<00:02:49.910> simply<00:02:50.090> slip<00:02:50.480> those<00:02:50.630> two<00:02:50.810> edges<00:02:51.170> and

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
can simply slip those two edges and

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.370 
can simply slip those two edges and
bridge<00:02:51.740> them<00:02:51.950> over<00:02:52.220> as<00:02:52.340> well
