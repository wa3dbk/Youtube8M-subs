this drive test but out here it is pure
racing<00:00:33.780> environment<00:00:34.379> I<00:00:34.559> don't<00:00:35.070> think<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.550> can

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
racing environment I don't think it can

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.689 
racing environment I don't think it can
be<00:00:35.699> surpassed<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.870> that's<00:00:37.140> saying<00:00:37.410> something

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:42.560 

first<00:00:41.699> thing<00:00:41.850> as<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.000> head<00:00:42.120> out<00:00:42.150> onto<00:00:42.449> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
first thing as I head out onto the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.509 
first thing as I head out onto the
Laguna<00:00:42.930> track<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.100> push<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:44.400> little

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
Laguna track is I push this little

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.720 
Laguna track is I push this little
button<00:00:44.790> here<00:00:45.710> which<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.890> M<00:00:47.160> mode<00:00:47.489> which

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
button here which is the M mode which

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.120 
button here which is the M mode which
gives<00:00:47.760> me<00:00:48.090> just<00:00:48.379> enough<00:00:49.379> enhanced

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.130 
gives me just enough enhanced

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.660 
gives me just enough enhanced
performance<00:00:50.250> all<00:00:51.210> around<00:00:52.309> suitable<00:00:53.309> for<00:00:53.579> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
performance all around suitable for the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.190 
performance all around suitable for the
track<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.120> they<00:00:54.180> really<00:00:54.510> set<00:00:54.899> up<00:00:55.020> these

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
track and they really set up these

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.189 
track and they really set up these
parameters<00:00:55.800> very<00:00:56.190> very<00:00:56.430> well

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.840 

and<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.769> did<00:01:02.010> mention<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.399> steering<00:01:02.730> wheel

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
and I did mention the steering wheel

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.939 
and I did mention the steering wheel
earlier<00:01:03.149> but<00:01:03.539> my<00:01:03.570> goodness<00:01:04.259> it<00:01:04.470> all<00:01:04.710> goes

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
earlier but my goodness it all goes

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.219 
earlier but my goodness it all goes
right<00:01:05.250> from<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.580> minute<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.840> hold<00:01:07.080> this

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
right from the minute you hold this

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.100 
right from the minute you hold this
wheel<00:01:07.530> just<00:01:08.220> just<00:01:09.119> look<00:01:09.360> at<00:01:09.509> this<00:01:09.570> just<00:01:09.810> feel

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
wheel just just look at this just feel

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.219 
wheel just just look at this just feel
it<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.500> it's<00:01:11.009> rather<00:01:11.759> like<00:01:12.140> putting<00:01:13.140> your

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
it it it's rather like putting your

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.740 
it it it's rather like putting your
hands<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.740> hips<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.189> your<00:01:14.399> lovely<00:01:15.149> lady<00:01:15.450> it

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
hands on the hips of your lovely lady it

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.490 
hands on the hips of your lovely lady it
just<00:01:16.080> feels<00:01:16.490> perfectly<00:01:17.490> right<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.500> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
just feels perfectly right and the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.320 
just feels perfectly right and the
feedback<00:01:19.950> through<00:01:20.190> the<00:01:20.220> steering<00:01:20.340> as<00:01:21.119> they

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
feedback through the steering as they

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.490 
feedback through the steering as they
progressed<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:22.320> left-hand<00:01:22.799> or<00:01:22.920> uphill

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
progressed to this left-hand or uphill

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.100 
progressed to this left-hand or uphill
it's<00:01:25.500> very<00:01:25.740> progressive<00:01:26.539> and<00:01:27.539> just<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.080> right

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
it's very progressive and just the right

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.440 
it's very progressive and just the right
amount<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.710> feedback<00:01:29.119> through<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.149> wheel

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
amount of feedback through the wheel

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.480 
amount of feedback through the wheel
which<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.080> not<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.439> easy<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.799> achieve<00:01:32.039> on<00:01:32.460> a

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
which is not that easy to achieve on a

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.340 
which is not that easy to achieve on a
track<00:01:32.789> with<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.119> much<00:01:33.330> elevation<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:34.170> car

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
track with this much elevation the car

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.139 
track with this much elevation the car
goes<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.560> little<00:01:34.830> light<00:01:35.039> then<00:01:35.610> gets<00:01:35.789> down<00:01:35.970> into

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
goes a little light then gets down into

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:41.180 
goes a little light then gets down into
the<00:01:36.300> compression<00:01:37.729> turn<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:39.140> and<00:01:40.140> let<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.979> car

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
the compression turn in and let the car

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.760 
the compression turn in and let the car
roll<00:01:41.940> out<00:01:42.240> it's<00:01:42.630> almost<00:01:42.780> like<00:01:43.140> downhill

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
roll out it's almost like downhill

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.809 
roll out it's almost like downhill
skiing<00:01:44.429> it<00:01:44.970> absolutely<00:01:45.810> has<00:01:46.080> a<00:01:46.110> flow<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.530> it

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
skiing it absolutely has a flow to it
