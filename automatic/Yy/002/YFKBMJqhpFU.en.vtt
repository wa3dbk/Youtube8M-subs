00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.950
 oh well in the meantime today took place 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.660
 female national team announcements 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.940
 hockey russia olympiad 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.730
 bid hit one of the hitters 7 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.379
 defenders and three goalkeeper intrigue disputes in 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.920
 but we did not see the coffin of the women's team 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.080
 did not hear 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.480
 difference from the male meanwhile our 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.769
 girls go sochi just for medals 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.900
 reporting Dmitri the woodpecker with mind this 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.060
 the usual training of the women's team but 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.369
 exercise players perform with different 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.940
 feelings and mood of several 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.040
 of girls 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.110
 learned in the morning that they do not go to Sochi 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.329
 coaching staff was forced to someone 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.700
 say no in this case was the reverse 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.739
 The situation became known that from the Olympiad 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.149
 forced to abandon the main goalkeeper 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.260
 Hope Alexandrova 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.949
 but she just made a decision to become a mother 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:55.649
 on time she would have time that is 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.670
 got into the olympic games but doctors 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.550
 stated for 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.570
 due to the nature of the body may 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.769
 there may be a crisis 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.290
 so we people understand everything because 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.990
 the word women and for me it is holy 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.540
 about the nuances of working with women coach 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.729
 Mikhail Chekanov spoke a lot and with humor 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.130
 in particular the need for long fees 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.960
 he explains so by the way I want to say it 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.689
 features of the female team namely 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.000
 44 days menu you need to get together 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.729
 talk where you were and what you saw 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.979
 what blouses sell there and this 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.490
 I think Tatar coach 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.500
 knowing from the side sees on me it seems so 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.200
 weight you run Che discussed there and that 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.720
 who is what skirt and I am not and what shoes yes 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.909
 Conversely, we do not have a public task on 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.590
 olympiad before the national team clearly 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.140
 bronze 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.000
 medal and because canada and usa plays 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.310
 in the alien are inaccessible to everyone 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.799
 rest hockey and defeat them will help 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.759
 just a miracle to beat 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:58.429
 America or Canada I think the moon 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.950
 should turn the opposite skates 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:04.819
 ground across and they have to play 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.039
 lids on the contrary but this is of course humor 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:08.030
 but in life everything happens on this 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.390
 life happens 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.010
 we do not set up our national team 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.079
 kind so unique in one triple 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.230
 play up Catherine Pashkevich and she 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:20.569
 Shokhina age difference they have 25 years 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.610
 for journalists once again did not see 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.099
 on ice next to her manager gene 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.930
 Alexey Yashin but the fact that he helps them 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.810
 improve not only with the word but also 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.230
 deed like no myth at the end of each 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.000
 workouts we played politics with him 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.099
 pc nightlight and it was very interesting and 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.709
 fun enough and more 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:42.140
 spurred you who more often won 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.360
 he's more sneakers and honestly not even 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.379
 always remember differently you when he yes 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.720
 of course in no time and 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:50.030
 Russian national team in Novogorsk still play 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.549
 control matches 16 year old boys 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.350
 then go to Sochi where February 9 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.310
 will start the olympiad match with the team 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.470
 germany 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.799
 Dmitry Woodpeckers Michael Antonov Great 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.799
