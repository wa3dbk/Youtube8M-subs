one rage quitted now if you look at my

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.250 
one rage quitted now if you look at my
record<00:04:23.700> just<00:04:24.060> quickly

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260

this is team we got the moment is quite
you<00:04:49.500> know<00:04:49.530> average<00:04:50.190> chemistry<00:04:50.580> 47<00:04:51.030> chemistry

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
you know average chemistry 47 chemistry

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.380 
you know average chemistry 47 chemistry
48<00:04:51.900> their<00:04:52.080> type<00:04:52.380> that<00:04:52.530> going<00:04:52.740> and<00:04:53.270> you<00:04:54.270> know
