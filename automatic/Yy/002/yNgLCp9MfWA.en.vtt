00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.990
 I am well aware that many of them 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.450
 you probably the animate energy 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.189
 I want to know for a long time anyway 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.630
 like to introduce them to you 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.630
 you also think that is my opinion 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.870
 yukiya amano is a loner 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.370
 everything that happens around him in 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.860
 a diary in his cellphone 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.880
 he does not have any inscriptions 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.430
 real friends 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.760
 except two imaginary namely the 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.250
 ruler over space and time 36 and 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.050
 his helper murmur 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.760
 exactly Yuki learns of the two now 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.770
 that he is using his cellphone in the future 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.879
 can look ahead 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.220
 Soon after, yuki hits the 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.440
 pupil juno alley to the 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.710
 real reason is why me a key 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.140
 june is so successful that learns 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.970
 Also juno has a future diary and 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.009
 it warns that he will be killed soon 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.450
 becomes 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.940
 it all got pretty confused and 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.729
 strange but that's all 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.190
 balances is the incredible juno the 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.390
 It's just amazing! 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.560
 in this first episode 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:29.979
 I have never had a series yet 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.380
 so convinced to continue watching 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:37.630
 more energy in the first place alone 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:39.490
 by the appearance of juno gast around the 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.400
 first consequence still fast to complete 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.620
 yuki and juno kill the pursuer more 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.960
 or less but also learn quickly 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.060
 that he too has a future diary 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.700
 owns the whole but is fast 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.350
 enlightened by the 6 maybe you can 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.729
 you remember that's the god over 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.350
 space and time exactly the jugi can be found 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.170
 again in a classic battle 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.060
 Royale against eleven other players all 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.990
 That's why the new gold is fighting over space 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.049
 and to be time 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.729
 with the help of her future diaries that 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.220
 means that a certain similarity to 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.480
 the tribute of panem is present 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.250
 but I would not like the two 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.630
 compare with each other that means that 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.000
 concept of me the idea is actually 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.459
 not really new but through the whole 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.320
 crazy characters which occur 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.240
 you feel that it never really 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.580
 really monotonous 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.020
 and where we are at character 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.690
 we can also the same time 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.680
 main characters yuki and juno closer 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.360
 inspect 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.490
 then we have one side 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.980
 namely yukiya amano the actual 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.020
 main characters of the series is and the 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.360
 one also accompanies most of the time 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.400
 But he will not be of many micky fans 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.770
 made there the typical parties 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.750
 behave weak and timid 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.190
 Boys in the beginning takes over it finds 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.020
 Although more or less a character 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.550
 change , but not enough, is enough 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.350
 just not and I have to do it myself 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.970
 Admit it at the beginning of the series 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.220
 was a bit annoying that 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.380
 jogi's counterpart is juno and with her 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.720
 From our point of view we have one of the 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.120
 best shape the other characters 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.990
 that there is even if I even the 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:14.140
 best stop but what is it please 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.910
 nice the other wikipedia means 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.200
 that this before the other one particular 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.850
 Character types referred to 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.320
 this character 40 mostly in relationship 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.190
 not to other character's love 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.690
 In return, that would be possible 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.880
 psychotic state expires with 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.740
 In other words, he goes mad, the 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.330
 means in june near juki ist 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.280
 then she is just innocent 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.860
 pretty and sweet and you ask yourself 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:38.530
 just wild anyone has secured face 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.900
 yes, why would he just want that 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.060
 other side of juno alley gives the 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.830
 page that just does everything for 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.260
 to protect her yuki 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.810
 and that's exactly what he does to me energy 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.380
 a wonderful crazy psycho resp 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.360
 splatter anime and yes i just got in 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.000
 swear because I agree as in the 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.000
 best moments of juno just like that 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.310
 is incredibly horny because it is not too 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.810
 compare with the reality and 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.330
 is almost absurd 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.040
 And in these very scenes I have myself 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.990
 quite often myself with a smile 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.960
 Face caught because of these scenes 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.580
 just so incredibly absurd are that 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.620
 not comparable to anything in the world 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.739
 and they are fun again 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.940
 Do that and that's why 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.430
 I look at ines 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.440
 i watch animes because i have some 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.889
 Do not experience things in reality 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.110
 should want or want 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.240
 in an anime i always know im 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.680
 hinterkopf that drew it from scratch 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.909
 is through me on the other 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.749
 Include the characters inside 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:38.819
 offset 

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:40.560
 For this reason, june is not the 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:43.229
 most profound character or the 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.180
 most brilliant but if you have several 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:49.529
 equipment then you actually talk about 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.409
 juno gast and without juli I would like some 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:53.999
 not half as good 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:55.800
 apart from the characters, there are still 

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:58.409
 many smaller things we look at 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.360
 have liked so for example the 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:01.710
 peak and events always in the 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.120
 right moment happen 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.159
 it is said that it is not like that 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.900
 Paprika is one event to another 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:09.000
 But immediately it does not follow as well 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.189
 school days it is slower and slower 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.629
 slower and slower to roll 

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:15.029
 more energy has exactly the right one 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:16.860
 time span and you never have that 

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:18.060
 feeling that it gets boring somehow 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.310
 or that one with the thoughts not 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.349
 more, besides, he is one 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.229
 Ideal anime where to start 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:27.539
 thinks I know exactly how you look 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:28.919
 if you think that then you get on 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:31.889
 end a ring from me energy 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.509
 because so much can I reveal with this 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:36.180
 Nobody would have expected anything in the end 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:38.939
 what's more is that it's so good 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.689
 like no window what gives and knows 

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:43.680
 you what that really does me really good 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:46.620
 Of course there is still one or 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.689
 two see but most of the time it is 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.430
 really designed for real feelings and 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:53.149
 Something like that makes you anime a lot 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.149
 to take seriously 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:06:00.930
 more a plaster the name of the anime 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.610
 world already matters and you should 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.830
 can connect something with this name 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.210
 Last but not least, you and i owe it 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.569
 I can only repeat that 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.340
 great character juno should be there 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:13.800
 Give someone out there to me 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.689
 Some have not looked at then 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.599
 would be in my view, the next to 

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:20.340
 the media should look at here 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:22.590
 beautiful style the music is quite good 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.759
 and the end is a bit sad but it 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.590
 is different from the whole 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:27.569
 other mainstream I end up real 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.879
 can not see anymore and that 's it 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:31.229
 just great for the next one 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:33.419
 you have all your video as always 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:36.210
 Auswahl just gives a thumbs up 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:37.560
 for the slice of life anime gates dollar 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.379
 or he just gives a thumb down 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.409
 for the anime movie if you have us 

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:42.409
 president 

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:54.629
 that was already known with this review 

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:56.370
 I hope you liked it 

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:59.009
 I thank you for watching 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.300
 I look forward to your comments and hope 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:03.020
 to be there again next time 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.020
 is then
