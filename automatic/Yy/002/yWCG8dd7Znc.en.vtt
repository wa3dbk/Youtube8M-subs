00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:36.969 
it's the same exact thing we just did

you quick shake to get everything
activated<00:00:39.160> and<00:00:39.280> moving<00:00:39.550> and<00:00:39.730> then<00:00:40.120> just<00:00:40.300> one

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:40.630 
activated and moving and then just one

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.490 
activated and moving and then just one
two<00:00:41.230> three<00:00:42.040> four<00:00:42.610> an<00:00:42.880> X<00:00:43.300> and<00:00:43.570> a<00:00:43.750> tee<00:00:43.960> like<00:00:44.230> that

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
two three four an X and a tee like that

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.190 
two three four an X and a tee like that
right<00:00:44.950> and<00:00:45.220> then<00:00:45.489> what<00:00:46.150> me<00:00:46.360> is<00:00:46.480> actually<00:00:46.930> doing

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
right and then what me is actually doing

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.889 
right and then what me is actually doing
is<00:00:47.590> well<00:00:48.579> it's<00:00:48.790> it's<00:00:49.150> a<00:00:49.270> test<00:00:49.540> that<00:00:49.690> we<00:00:49.750> did

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:49.899 
is well it's it's a test that we did

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:52.440 
is well it's it's a test that we did
when<00:00:50.050> we<00:00:50.079> were<00:00:50.560> starting<00:00:50.800> the<00:00:51.100> brand<00:00:51.370> and<00:00:51.670> I

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
when we were starting the brand and I

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.210 
when we were starting the brand and I
think<00:00:52.989> the<00:00:53.079> challenge<00:00:53.500> becomes<00:00:53.680> when<00:00:54.160> you

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
think the challenge becomes when you

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.850 
think the challenge becomes when you
have<00:00:54.399> a<00:00:54.430> product<00:00:54.850> that's<00:00:55.180> unusual<00:00:55.989> sort<00:00:56.800> of

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
have a product that's unusual sort of

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.549 
have a product that's unusual sort of
first<00:00:57.130> in<00:00:57.280> its<00:00:57.430> category<00:00:57.670> and<00:00:58.270> of<00:00:58.690> course<00:00:58.720> in<00:00:59.230> a

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
first in its category and of course in a

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.549 
first in its category and of course in a
sea<00:01:00.130> of<00:01:00.160> beauty<00:01:00.640> products<00:01:01.090> it's<00:01:01.960> hard<00:01:02.290> for

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
sea of beauty products it's hard for

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.889 
sea of beauty products it's hard for
someone<00:01:02.800> to<00:01:03.040> believe<00:01:03.340> that<00:01:03.550> it<00:01:03.670> works<00:01:03.910> so<00:01:04.689> as<00:01:04.869> a

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:04.899 
someone to believe that it works so as a

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:06.420 
someone to believe that it works so as a
brand<00:01:05.350> and<00:01:05.590> I'll<00:01:05.680> certainly<00:01:06.040> get<00:01:06.189> into<00:01:06.310> more

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
brand and I'll certainly get into more

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.800 
brand and I'll certainly get into more
detail<00:01:06.790> on<00:01:06.820> some<00:01:07.030> of<00:01:07.119> the<00:01:07.180> wacky<00:01:07.360> things<00:01:07.540> that

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
maybe 30 minutes or so and the idea is

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.440 
maybe 30 minutes or so and the idea is
like<00:02:32.380> I<00:02:32.530> said<00:02:32.770> the<00:02:33.220> finish<00:02:33.580> of<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.850> product<00:02:34.300> is

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
like I said the finish of the product is

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.830 
like I said the finish of the product is
a<00:02:34.510> dewy<00:02:35.200> luminous<00:02:35.920> finish<00:02:36.130> but<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.420> critical

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
a dewy luminous finish but the critical

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.540 
a dewy luminous finish but the critical
thing<00:02:38.050> to<00:02:38.170> note<00:02:38.380> about<00:02:38.410> that<00:02:38.830> is<00:02:39.010> there's<00:02:39.490> a

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
thing to note about that is there's a

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.060 
thing to note about that is there's a
fine<00:02:39.970> line<00:02:40.000> between<00:02:40.330> being<00:02:41.170> doing<00:02:41.860> and

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
fine line between being doing and

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.910 
fine line between being doing and
luminous<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:42.910> oily<00:02:43.690> yeah<00:02:44.080> so<00:02:44.320> it's<00:02:44.560> just<00:02:44.800> a

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
luminous and oily yeah so it's just a

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.310 
luminous and oily yeah so it's just a
fresh<00:02:45.370> healthy<00:02:45.760> glow<00:02:46.180> but<00:02:46.780> normally<00:02:47.170> at<00:02:47.260> this
