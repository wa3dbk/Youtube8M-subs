now<00:00:21.880> on<00:00:22.029> to<00:00:22.150> the<00:00:22.269> 2008<00:00:22.930> beaking<00:00:23.380> and<00:00:23.590> the<00:00:24.369> folks

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
now on to the 2008 beaking and the folks

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.150 
now on to the 2008 beaking and the folks
we<00:00:24.759> have<00:00:24.910> preload<00:00:25.390> compression<00:00:25.930> and<00:00:26.199> rebound

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
we have preload compression and rebound

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.370 
we have preload compression and rebound
damping<00:00:27.609> and<00:00:27.970> in<00:00:28.599> the<00:00:28.689> shock<00:00:28.960> we<00:00:29.140> have<00:00:29.259> the

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
damping and in the shock we have the

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.220 
damping and in the shock we have the
same<00:00:29.619> preload<00:00:30.279> compression<00:00:30.970> and<00:00:31.060> rebound

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
same preload compression and rebound

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.360 
same preload compression and rebound
given<00:00:32.230> the<00:00:32.320> configuration<00:00:32.619> of<00:00:33.070> the<00:00:33.160> shock

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
given the configuration of the shock

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.970 
given the configuration of the shock
most<00:00:33.670> uzuki's<00:00:34.270> didn't<00:00:35.079> have<00:00:35.230> a<00:00:35.260> stud<00:00:35.680> going

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
most uzuki's didn't have a stud going

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.070 
most uzuki's didn't have a stud going
through<00:00:36.160> the<00:00:36.280> frame<00:00:36.520> so<00:00:37.210> you<00:00:37.239> can<00:00:37.510> put<00:00:37.660> washers

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.080 
through the frame so you can put washers

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.170 
through the frame so you can put washers
or<00:00:38.290> spaces<00:00:38.739> underneath<00:00:39.040> that<00:00:39.339> to<00:00:39.640> take<00:00:39.910> the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
or spaces underneath that to take the

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.759 
or spaces underneath that to take the
back<00:00:40.330> of<00:00:40.360> the<00:00:40.510> backup<00:00:40.870> now<00:00:41.080> in<00:00:41.199> this<00:00:41.350> instance

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
back of the backup now in this instance

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:43.680 
back of the backup now in this instance
this<00:00:42.370> is<00:00:42.550> a<00:00:42.580> straight<00:00:42.910> bolt<00:00:43.150> through<00:00:43.390> so<00:00:43.629> you

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
this is a straight bolt through so you

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.290 
this is a straight bolt through so you
don't<00:00:44.079> have<00:00:44.290> the<00:00:44.730> ability<00:00:45.730> to<00:00:45.760> change<00:00:46.150> the

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
don't have the ability to change the

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.030 
don't have the ability to change the
rear<00:00:46.480> I'd<00:00:46.629> Heights<00:00:46.930> you'd<00:00:47.559> have<00:00:47.710> to<00:00:47.829> go<00:00:47.920> ahead

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
rear I'd Heights you'd have to go ahead

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.950 
rear I'd Heights you'd have to go ahead
and<00:00:48.250> get<00:00:48.339> an<00:00:48.460> aftermarket<00:00:48.790> shock<00:00:49.180> for<00:00:49.360> that<00:00:49.510> so

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
and get an aftermarket shock for that so

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.039 
and get an aftermarket shock for that so
let's<00:00:50.110> get<00:00:50.230> to<00:00:50.379> measuring<00:00:51.720> okay<00:00:52.720> let's<00:00:52.900> put

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:53.049 
let's get to measuring okay let's put

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:55.649 
let's get to measuring okay let's put
Dave<00:00:53.229> on<00:00:53.350> the<00:00:53.470> bike<00:00:53.589> at<00:00:54.000> 180<00:00:55.000> pounds<00:00:55.449> now<00:00:55.600> we

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:55.659 
Dave on the bike at 180 pounds now we

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:57.390 
Dave on the bike at 180 pounds now we
know<00:00:55.869> this<00:00:56.049> has<00:00:56.260> ten<00:00:56.530> millimeters<00:00:57.040> of<00:00:57.190> free

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
know this has ten millimeters of free

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.320 
know this has ten millimeters of free
sac<00:00:57.839> so<00:00:58.839> what<00:00:59.049> I<00:00:59.080> did<00:00:59.199> was<00:00:59.439> measure<00:01:00.180> from<00:01:01.180> the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
sac so what I did was measure from the

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.859 
sac so what I did was measure from the
end<00:01:01.479> of<00:01:01.629> the<00:01:01.689> axle<00:01:02.049> casting<00:01:02.530> here<00:01:03.479> up<00:01:04.479> to<00:01:04.750> the

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
end of the axle casting here up to the

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:15.580 
end of the axle casting here up to the
joint<00:01:05.110> of<00:01:05.260> the<00:01:05.320> fender<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:08.619> exhaust

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.770 

now<00:01:16.590> right<00:01:17.040> now<00:01:17.220> given<00:01:17.610> Dave's<00:01:17.880> weight<00:01:18.150> at<00:01:18.720> a

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
now right now given Dave's weight at a

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.550 
now right now given Dave's weight at a
hundred<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.320> AC<00:01:20.660> we<00:01:21.660> have<00:01:21.750> fifty<00:01:22.080> millimeters

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
hundred and AC we have fifty millimeters

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.800 
hundred and AC we have fifty millimeters
of<00:01:22.710> SAG<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:23.010> the<00:01:23.100> back<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.970> that's<00:01:24.120> way<00:01:24.330> where

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
of SAG in the back so that's way where

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.540 
of SAG in the back so that's way where
you're<00:01:24.960> way<00:01:25.080> too<00:01:25.170> much<00:01:25.470> if<00:01:25.800> we<00:01:25.950> tightened<00:01:26.460> it

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
you're way too much if we tightened it

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.010 
you're way too much if we tightened it
up<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:27.000> might<00:01:27.210> be<00:01:27.390> usable<00:01:28.310> if<00:01:29.310> you're<00:01:30.210> 200-plus

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
up it might be usable if you're 200-plus

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.690 
up it might be usable if you're 200-plus
pounds<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.070> not<00:01:32.310> gonna<00:01:32.460> work<00:01:32.670> for

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
pounds and this is not gonna work for

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.250 
pounds and this is not gonna work for
you<00:01:36.440> moving<00:01:37.440> on<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.860> front<00:01:38.010> of<00:01:38.190> the<00:01:38.250> bike

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
you moving on to the front of the bike

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.410 
you moving on to the front of the bike
we<00:01:40.260> know<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.530> topped<00:01:41.490> out<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.880> was<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> hundred

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
we know that topped out it was a hundred

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.880 
we know that topped out it was a hundred
and<00:01:42.540> thirty<00:01:42.900> millimeters<00:01:44.030> so<00:01:45.030> here<00:01:45.390> now<00:01:45.890> we're

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
and thirty millimeters so here now we're

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.660 
and thirty millimeters so here now we're
at<00:01:47.040> 80

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
at 80

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.719 
at 80
so<00:01:48.210> again<00:01:48.800> fifty<00:01:49.800> millimeters<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.400> sag<00:01:50.550> in<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
so again fifty millimeters of sag in the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.550 
so again fifty millimeters of sag in the
back<00:01:50.910> the<00:01:51.540> good<00:01:51.690> thing<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.140> springs<00:01:52.440> a

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
back the good thing is the springs a

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.080 
back the good thing is the springs a
balanced<00:01:52.920> front<00:01:53.160> to<00:01:53.280> back<00:01:53.430> because<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.880> SAG

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
balanced front to back because the SAG

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.960 
balanced front to back because the SAG
is<00:01:54.210> very<00:01:54.390> comparable<00:01:55.040> the<00:01:56.040> bad<00:01:56.220> thing<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.520> if

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
is very comparable the bad thing is if

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.380 
is very comparable the bad thing is if
you're<00:01:57.540> anywhere<00:01:57.990> above<00:01:58.910> 150<00:01:59.910> pounds<00:02:00.300> the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
you're anywhere above 150 pounds the

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.390 
you're anywhere above 150 pounds the
bikes<00:02:00.570> way<00:02:00.840> too<00:02:01.050> soft<00:02:01.440> for<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:04.190> now<00:02:05.190> if<00:02:05.280> this

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
bikes way too soft for you now if this

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.550 
bikes way too soft for you now if this
bike<00:02:05.700> was<00:02:05.940> too<00:02:06.180> soft<00:02:06.479> for<00:02:06.540> 180<00:02:07.080> pound<00:02:07.350> rider

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
bike was too soft for 180 pound rider

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.219 
bike was too soft for 180 pound rider
with<00:02:07.950> we've<00:02:08.880> got<00:02:09.030> some<00:02:09.239> significant<00:02:09.840> problems

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
with we've got some significant problems

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:21.890 
with we've got some significant problems
here<00:02:18.170> 65<00:02:19.170> millimeters<00:02:20.160> of<00:02:20.310> sag<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:21.030> if<00:02:21.480> you're

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900

great<00:02:34.290> for<00:02:34.470> wheelies<00:02:34.769> but<00:02:35.040> extremely

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
great for wheelies but extremely

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.430 
great for wheelies but extremely
dangerous<00:02:35.760> especially<00:02:36.330> on<00:02:36.690> downhill<00:02:37.170> turns

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
dangerous especially on downhill turns

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.930 
dangerous especially on downhill turns
because<00:02:37.830> you'd<00:02:37.980> have<00:02:38.010> no<00:02:38.340> weight<00:02:38.610> on<00:02:38.640> the

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
because you'd have no weight on the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:47.890 
because you'd have no weight on the
front<00:02:39.060> wheel<00:02:39.299> at<00:02:39.690> all<00:02:42.500> moving<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.709> front

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.449 

just<00:02:48.900> under<00:02:49.170> half<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.380> travel<00:02:49.950> is<00:02:50.010> gone

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
just under half the travel is gone

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.630 
just under half the travel is gone
so<00:02:51.360> again<00:02:51.600> at<00:02:51.900> this<00:02:52.200> way<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:52.650> 200-plus<00:02:53.280> you

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
so again at this way that 200-plus you

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.100 
so again at this way that 200-plus you
have<00:02:53.910> got<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.420> restring<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:54.959> bike

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
have got to restring the bike

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.140 
have got to restring the bike
significantly<00:02:55.860> now<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.430> one<00:02:56.610> thing<00:02:56.820> we<00:02:56.940> can't

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
significantly now the one thing we can't

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.490 
significantly now the one thing we can't
do<00:02:57.330> on<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.510> showroom<00:02:57.840> floor<00:02:57.989> is<00:02:58.170> check<00:02:58.380> the

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
do on the showroom floor is check the

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.160 
do on the showroom floor is check the
valving<00:02:58.920> so<00:02:59.790> what<00:03:00.360> you'd<00:03:00.510> have<00:03:00.690> to<00:03:00.870> do<00:03:01.019> is

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
valving so what you'd have to do is

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.710 
valving so what you'd have to do is
write<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:01.590> get<00:03:01.860> it<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.160> suspension<00:03:02.730> settled

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
write it get it the suspension settled

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.140 
write it get it the suspension settled
in<00:03:03.870> bring<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.650> back<00:03:04.860> and<00:03:05.160> then<00:03:05.519> based<00:03:05.790> on<00:03:05.970> where

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
in bring it back and then based on where

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.420 
in bring it back and then based on where
the<00:03:06.239> rebound<00:03:06.600> setting<00:03:06.989> is<00:03:07.200> see<00:03:07.980> if<00:03:08.100> you<00:03:08.250> can

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
the rebound setting is see if you can

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.490 
the rebound setting is see if you can
get<00:03:08.549> away<00:03:08.670> we're<00:03:08.940> simply<00:03:09.209> respring<00:03:09.750> or<00:03:10.170> you

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
get away we're simply respring or you

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.259 
get away we're simply respring or you
would<00:03:10.650> have<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.950> go<00:03:11.070> ahead<00:03:11.310> with<00:03:11.580> a<00:03:11.610> spring<00:03:12.060> and

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
would have to go ahead with a spring and

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.560 
would have to go ahead with a spring and
then<00:03:12.510> Reeve<00:03:12.780> al<00:03:13.160> to<00:03:14.160> suit<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:14.970> spring<00:03:15.239> itself

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
then Reeve al to suit the spring itself

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.570 
then Reeve al to suit the spring itself
so<00:03:16.019> that's<00:03:16.470> an<00:03:16.650> option<00:03:16.799> you<00:03:17.010> have<00:03:17.070> to<00:03:17.250> try<00:03:17.430> down

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
so that's an option you have to try down

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:24.600 
so that's an option you have to try down
the<00:03:17.730> rope<00:03:18.080> now<00:03:19.080> in<00:03:19.200> Talisa<00:03:19.530> at<00:03:20.010> 140<00:03:20.940> pounds

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:34.040 

you<00:03:25.610> set

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.950 

35<00:03:34.920> millimeters<00:03:35.430> of<00:03:35.580> sag<00:03:35.790> so<00:03:36.180> on<00:03:36.420> a<00:03:36.450> bike<00:03:36.720> of

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
35 millimeters of sag so on a bike of

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.060 
35 millimeters of sag so on a bike of
this<00:03:37.230> magnitude<00:03:38.160> anything<00:03:39.150> lighter<00:03:39.390> than<00:03:40.070> 140

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
this magnitude anything lighter than 140

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.510 
this magnitude anything lighter than 140
the<00:03:41.280> bikes<00:03:41.490> perfect<00:03:42.060> for<00:03:42.270> you

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
the bikes perfect for you

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:54.350 
the bikes perfect for you
front<00:03:44.520> brake<00:03:52.100> front<00:03:53.100> suspension<00:03:53.670> is<00:03:53.760> just<00:03:54.270> a

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
front brake front suspension is just a

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.300 
front brake front suspension is just a
hair<00:03:54.600> on<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:54.870> soft<00:03:55.080> side<00:03:55.290> but<00:03:55.590> we<00:03:55.710> have<00:03:55.920> lots

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
hair on the soft side but we have lots

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.700 
hair on the soft side but we have lots
of<00:03:56.490> adjustability<00:03:56.970> on<00:03:57.210> preload<00:03:57.690> so<00:03:58.320> this<00:03:58.470> bike

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
of adjustability on preload so this bike

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.620 
of adjustability on preload so this bike
as<00:03:59.040> I<00:03:59.280> said<00:03:59.460> it<00:03:59.580> has<00:03:59.670> balance<00:04:00.060> Springs<00:04:00.390> so<00:04:00.570> if

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
as I said it has balance Springs so if

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.630 
as I said it has balance Springs so if
you<00:04:00.750> were<00:04:00.810> 140<00:04:01.530> to<00:04:02.990> 115<00:04:03.990> bikes<00:04:04.710> perfect<00:04:05.460> right

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
you were 140 to 115 bikes perfect right

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.130 
you were 140 to 115 bikes perfect right
off<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.880> showroom<00:04:06.060> floor<00:04:06.360> anything<00:04:06.840> heavier

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
off the showroom floor anything heavier

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.270 
off the showroom floor anything heavier
than<00:04:07.170> that<00:04:07.380> you're<00:04:07.500> gonna<00:04:07.560> have<00:04:07.740> to<00:04:07.800> respring

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
than that you're gonna have to respring

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.610 
than that you're gonna have to respring
and<00:04:08.600> potentially<00:04:09.600> revolve<00:04:10.020> especially<00:04:10.560> if

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
and potentially revolve especially if

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.460 
and potentially revolve especially if
you're<00:04:10.740> over<00:04:10.950> 200
