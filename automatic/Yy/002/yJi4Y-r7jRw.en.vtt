 one in nine percent and show us just a quarter 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.179

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:28.599
 in the answer the something completely new 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.570
 as the first time a duck as a superhero so im 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.770
 Frederik Format 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.070
 Tobias was there before but that was different 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.610
 yes, it's kind of often because you can say Peitz has been on his roof 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.379
 At the Portland Pirates, Apple has been used when she was in Quark 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:45.860
 or 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.440
 at the KAC Bund per cent Dean 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.390

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.420
 scare off baddies 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.929
 yes to food 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:00:59.830
 I would say that the marriage 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.700
 the easy 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.070
 a novel harm 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.900
 and who has no place 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.860
 Super multiply with others 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.450
 take on the meeting Batman Fernando is direct detective is Bayern 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.740
 "He is a normal person 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.920
 who's all about a duck so-so 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.390
 in fact 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.500
 LG he had 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.210
 EADS wants to stand 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.260
 Fight against crime 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.860
 decided 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.920
 and has a third support of ca and his kind but times 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.620
 hochtief-daughter he involuntarily criticized 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.960
 but well what you played on the one we still played in one 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.110
 instead of carrying names he now has 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.460
 but dwells in one 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.010
 on a bridge 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.500
 are so to speak 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.370
 Bretthauer you can say the 8 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.580
 and 10 he has one 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.799
 a purple costume yes a purple one 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:54.570
 around 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.659
 PD 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.600
 Allusions to it can tell you what you want 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.800
 that's just cult 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.330
 He 's awesome 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.860
 he does not want to burn like most Ernst Benda that he tries 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.670
 his again his sayings 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.670
 the route explained by ca 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:15.230
 I care of the jackal clear rejection 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:20.249
 we would not have had 

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:27.569
 in it Warhol 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.909
 here too the taz a lot 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.359
 comeback has a lot of real ones 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:36.399
 Things gave the core rate because this has said it never really bothers 

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:37.469
 given 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:39.949
 she has made a 90 episodes out of it 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:43.079
 in three seasons the representative Spec numbers to the 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.789
 because there was no other series in my opinion of Disney 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:50.189
 really arrived Atalanta brings down so compare with what you get 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:51.249
 these days 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:53.959
 If you look at 400 it can not compare 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.539
 of course, a few opponents 

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:58.489
 So much Sunday 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.679
 because in negative development said the same with around Doctor Zoom 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:04.549
 the negative which 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:05.910
 because neither want 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.739
 maybe with electric 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.019
 one more off 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.709
 the summit can shoot a mistake and open the title Pat Leahy 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.809
 Back has quite Professor Pandemic boxwood 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.589
 a doctor has made the self-experiment comparable to you 

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:24.979
 Boxwood is best compared to Prussia Reilly 

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:27.379
 then the liquidators 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.449
 one called for a kind of mineral water company and that 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:33.179
 well and very fluid 

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:35.129
 Kniep is often like that 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:36.309
 Water becomes 

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:39.349
 maybe up with Hydro Men 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.349
 thanks Walker Jack the typical allusion to the Jucker 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:47.269
 a matchday, Rick met Dr by childhood and living 

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:49.739
 Finally the web has it 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.359
 and who very often interacts with r Media today and the genitive and 

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:57.360
 yes, and together we form the terrible five 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.160
 Comparisons would have to lead from two Menzel 6 then there are the 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.710
 Organization foul with prizes may already be the typical of the James Bond opponents 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.569
 you say 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:08.909
 yes, um 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.939
 Eisenbeis Fiat Account compared with whites even at the same time 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:15.159
 probably the one that matters most 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:17.049
 is related 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.049
 Then others hit us again but it just counts too much earth 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.159
 To enumerate mountains of organization this similar as switched 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.070
 and because it's the guilty verdict the director Julius 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.879
 Gallen yes 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:32.849
 In the gutter, two employees, so to speak, he works twelve Gerald childhood 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:35.919
 Halftime around Jan you can say 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.080
 furthermore there is still there 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.199
 Kiki them emerge from his deeply dipped Haltiner a bit so close 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.670
 Allusion to the 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.889

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.819
 October 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:02.069
 in the dark 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:05.069
 s 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:10.469
 Have investigators 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.539
 Hannover RPO 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.460
 more than two months ago 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.610
 we have 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.229
 No Langenberg continue negotiations 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:27.319
 what the sand and sea 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:28.669
 Hansa Rostock 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:31.669
 were yesterday 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.990
 together again 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.449
 a year ago 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:40.449
 an ambulance of the hand 

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:44.999
 Would bring in euros 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:49.529
 therefore turn 

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:54.849
 a typical one in the gate once more 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:58.069
 No, the nineties in my opinion that's just awesome 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:05:59.100
 the poor 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.320
 then, of course, that also has certain 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.909
 that would take some weapons 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:06.240
 a Dr a gun out of the most 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.599
 specific 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:09.569
 worth the garage strub 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:12.599
 She still has stuff left in the Park Walk 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:16.050
 a flying duck both offices the ski-wm for this form 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.150
 controlled with cottage cheese 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.659

 1 WestLB reconsidered 

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:39.909

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:41.129
 this has 

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:46.249
 however, dare in front of me with him it is the episode NDR the alternative future 

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:47.759
 is used 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:49.699
 in not a nod to 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:52.699
 Jauch it is really time to say personally 

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:55.909
 the way he looks 

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:59.919
 Jason first turned so oil and enthemmend I hope failed 

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:03.639

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:06.589
 come to make more will have fallen through 

00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:09.969
