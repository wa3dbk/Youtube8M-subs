up wouldn't work we just end up with a

up wouldn't work we just end up with a

swarm of rocks hitting our way but
scientists<00:02:15.320> have<00:02:15.530> been<00:02:15.709> studying<00:02:16.250> and

scientists have been studying and
tracking<00:02:16.850> asteroids<00:02:17.420> for<00:02:17.570> years<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:18.200> then

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
tracking asteroids for years and then

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.540 
tracking asteroids for years and then
come<00:02:18.680> up<00:02:18.860> with<00:02:19.070> an<00:02:19.160> ingenious<00:02:19.340> idea<00:02:21.340> we<00:02:22.340> could

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
come up with an ingenious idea we could

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.640 
come up with an ingenious idea we could
use<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.910> force<00:02:23.150> of<00:02:23.330> gravity<00:02:23.840> to<00:02:23.870> alter<00:02:24.440> the

use the force of gravity to alter the

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.449 
use the force of gravity to alter the
asteroid<00:02:25.130> path

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.949 

it<00:02:30.459> might<00:02:30.670> work<00:02:30.909> like<00:02:31.150> this<00:02:33.480> if<00:02:34.480> you<00:02:34.659> flew<00:02:34.930> a

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
it might work like this if you flew a

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.259 
it might work like this if you flew a
spacecraft<00:02:35.680> from<00:02:35.859> inside<00:02:36.249> an<00:02:36.370> asteroid<00:02:36.849> the

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
spacecraft from inside an asteroid the

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.300 
spacecraft from inside an asteroid the
spacecraft's<00:02:38.019> tiny<00:02:38.290> gravitational<00:02:38.530> pull

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
spacecraft's tiny gravitational pull

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.520 
spacecraft's tiny gravitational pull
might<00:02:40.060> be<00:02:40.239> enough<00:02:40.510> to<00:02:40.540> change<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.230> asteroids

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
might be enough to change the asteroids

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.099 
might be enough to change the asteroids
orbit<00:02:42.030> tugging<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:43.120> a<00:02:43.239> little<00:02:43.510> off<00:02:43.810> course

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:50.160 

then<00:02:47.109> you<00:02:47.230> take<00:02:47.409> years<00:02:47.709> a<00:02:48.329> slowly<00:02:49.329> over<00:02:49.810> time

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
then you take years a slowly over time

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.559 
then you take years a slowly over time
the<00:02:50.650> asteroid<00:02:51.159> would<00:02:51.400> move<00:02:51.639> it<00:02:51.909> was<00:02:52.120> slightly

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
the asteroid would move it was slightly

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.050 
the asteroid would move it was slightly
different<00:02:52.989> orbit<00:02:53.609> eventually<00:02:54.609> ending<00:02:54.969> up

a<00:03:02.480> few<00:03:03.140> hundred<00:03:03.410> miles<00:03:03.590> as<00:03:03.860> much

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:20.040 

but<00:03:07.980> it's<00:03:08.220> all<00:03:08.460> we<00:03:08.670> need<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:09.420> keep<00:03:09.630> us<00:03:09.780> safe

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.020 

right<00:03:21.050> now<00:03:21.200> this<00:03:21.410> is<00:03:21.470> only<00:03:21.710> an<00:03:21.920> idea<00:03:22.010> but<00:03:22.790> it's

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
right now this is only an idea but it's

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.170 
right now this is only an idea but it's
a<00:03:23.120> promising<00:03:24.070> many<00:03:25.070> scientists<00:03:25.730> think<00:03:25.910> it<00:03:26.060> may

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
a promising many scientists think it may

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.930 
a promising many scientists think it may
be<00:03:26.240> our<00:03:26.420> best<00:03:26.690> bet

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
be our best bet

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.640 
be our best bet
someday<00:03:28.940> perhaps<00:03:28.970> one<00:03:29.690> of<00:03:29.780> you<00:03:29.930> will<00:03:30.410> commit

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
someday perhaps one of you will commit

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.190 
someday perhaps one of you will commit
with<00:03:30.800> an<00:03:30.920> even<00:03:31.190> better<00:03:31.400> idea<00:03:31.660> an<00:03:32.660> idea<00:03:33.020> that

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
with an even better idea an idea that

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.570 
with an even better idea an idea that
will<00:03:33.290> help<00:03:33.440> protect<00:03:33.680> Earth<00:03:34.070> from<00:03:34.370> these

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580
