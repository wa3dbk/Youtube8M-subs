00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
correctly I can show you hundreds of

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.230 
correctly I can show you hundreds of
pictures<00:02:01.600> and<00:02:02.170> videos<00:02:02.230> of<00:02:02.530> my<00:02:03.220> scars<00:02:03.550> and<00:02:03.790> what

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
pictures and videos of my scars and what

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.270 
pictures and videos of my scars and what
they<00:02:04.360> look<00:02:04.540> like<00:02:04.570> we<00:02:05.350> correct<00:02:05.770> those<00:02:05.950> scars

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
they look like we correct those scars

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.550 
they look like we correct those scars
now<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:06.730> problem<00:02:07.300> with<00:02:07.420> that<00:02:07.660> is<00:02:07.900> when<00:02:08.440> you

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
now the problem with that is when you

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.980 
now the problem with that is when you
cut<00:02:08.830> out<00:02:08.860> an<00:02:09.160> existing<00:02:09.640> scar<00:02:10.030> while<00:02:10.720> it<00:02:10.840> takes

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
cut out an existing scar while it takes

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.810 
cut out an existing scar while it takes
the<00:02:11.170> scar<00:02:11.470> out<00:02:11.500> there's<00:02:12.010> no<00:02:12.190> hair<00:02:12.490> in<00:02:12.700> that

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
the scar out there's no hair in that

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.240 
the scar out there's no hair in that
area<00:02:13.180> you're<00:02:13.480> getting<00:02:13.750> scar<00:02:14.020> tissue<00:02:14.350> so<00:02:14.680> while

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
area you're getting scar tissue so while

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.460 
area you're getting scar tissue so while
you<00:02:15.370> can<00:02:15.490> get<00:02:15.640> some<00:02:15.910> hair<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.330> actually

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
you can get some hair you actually

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.600 
you can get some hair you actually
sacrificing<00:02:17.470> a<00:02:17.560> little<00:02:17.680> bit<00:02:17.890> of<00:02:17.980> hair<00:02:18.190> by

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
sacrificing a little bit of hair by

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.820 
sacrificing a little bit of hair by
taking<00:02:19.000> out<00:02:19.120> a<00:02:19.150> scar<00:02:19.510> if<00:02:20.170> a<00:02:20.320> patient<00:02:20.740> is

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
taking out a scar if a patient is

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.560 
taking out a scar if a patient is
satisfied<00:02:21.340> with<00:02:21.490> the<00:02:21.640> scar<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:22.210> doesn't

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
satisfied with the scar and doesn't

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.390 
satisfied with the scar and doesn't
limit<00:02:22.930> them<00:02:23.230> as<00:02:23.410> far<00:02:23.620> as<00:02:23.710> where<00:02:23.950> they<00:02:24.070> can<00:02:24.220> wear

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
limit them as far as where they can wear

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.280 
limit them as far as where they can wear
their<00:02:24.610> hair<00:02:24.850> to<00:02:25.210> the<00:02:25.300> length<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.900> bit<00:02:26.050> where

their hair to the length the bit where

their hair I always opt to go either

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.930 
their hair I always opt to go either
above<00:02:28.930> or<00:02:28.990> below<00:02:29.110> that<00:02:29.350> and<00:02:29.740> avoid<00:02:29.980> a<00:02:30.040> scar<00:02:30.400> but

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
above or below that and avoid a scar but

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.880 
above or below that and avoid a scar but
if<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.150> scar<00:02:31.420> is<00:02:31.570> an<00:02:31.690> issue<00:02:31.870> you<00:02:32.260> can't<00:02:32.710> wear

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
if the scar is an issue you can't wear

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.280 
if the scar is an issue you can't wear
your<00:02:32.980> hair<00:02:33.130> short<00:02:33.430> because<00:02:33.910> of<00:02:34.060> it<00:02:34.210> and<00:02:34.630> it's

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
your hair short because of it and it's

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.320 
your hair short because of it and it's
noticeable<00:02:35.830> it's<00:02:36.400> not<00:02:36.670> an<00:02:36.790> issue<00:02:36.880> you<00:02:37.150> have<00:02:37.180> to

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
noticeable it's not an issue you have to

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.420 
noticeable it's not an issue you have to
take<00:02:37.570> the<00:02:37.660> scar<00:02:37.900> out<00:02:38.010> so<00:02:39.010> that's<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.310> other

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
take the scar out so that's the other

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.550 
take the scar out so that's the other
mistake<00:02:39.610> I've<00:02:39.910> seen<00:02:40.120> with<00:02:40.240> that<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:41.410> other

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
mistake I've seen with that the other

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.830 
mistake I've seen with that the other
mistake<00:02:42.100> I<00:02:42.430> see<00:02:42.640> is<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:43.090> types<00:02:43.390> of<00:02:43.570> grafts

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
mistake I see is the types of grafts

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.170 
mistake I see is the types of grafts
that<00:02:44.050> surgeons<00:02:44.560> are<00:02:44.680> using<00:02:45.130> in<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.880> frontal

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
that surgeons are using in the frontal

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.270 
that surgeons are using in the frontal
hairline<00:02:46.770> everything<00:02:47.770> in<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:47.950> frontal

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
hairline everything in the frontal

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.950 
hairline everything in the frontal
hairline<00:02:48.520> should<00:02:48.970> be<00:02:49.120> single<00:02:49.570> and<00:02:49.720> double

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
hairline should be single and double

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.960 
hairline should be single and double
hairs<00:02:50.200> you<00:02:50.830> should<00:02:51.040> never<00:02:51.220> have<00:02:51.370> any<00:02:51.550> big

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
hairs you should never have any big

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.790 
hairs you should never have any big
grafts<00:02:52.330> in<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.780> frontal<00:02:53.110> hairline<00:02:53.350> that's

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
grafts in the frontal hairline that's

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.100 
grafts in the frontal hairline that's
what<00:02:53.980> gives<00:02:54.220> you<00:02:54.310> this<00:02:54.490> pluggy<00:02:55.110> unnatural

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
what gives you this pluggy unnatural

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.470 
what gives you this pluggy unnatural
looking<00:02:56.410> hairline<00:02:56.920> you<00:02:57.580> want<00:02:57.610> single<00:02:58.090> hairs

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
looking hairline you want single hairs

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.630 
looking hairline you want single hairs
and<00:02:58.780> double<00:02:59.140> hairs<00:02:59.350> behind<00:02:59.590> that<00:03:00.100> things

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
and double hairs behind that things

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.610 
and double hairs behind that things
transition<00:03:01.480> that<00:03:01.600> into<00:03:01.780> stronger<00:03:02.380> grafts

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
transition that into stronger grafts

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.770 
transition that into stronger grafts
behind<00:03:03.070> so<00:03:03.730> a<00:03:03.760> lot<00:03:04.030> of<00:03:04.150> times<00:03:04.390> when<00:03:04.570> someone

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
behind so a lot of times when someone

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.520 
behind so a lot of times when someone
will<00:03:04.989> come<00:03:05.200> in<00:03:05.410> with<00:03:05.590> this<00:03:05.850> rafty<00:03:07.140> dolls<00:03:08.140> type

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
will come in with this rafty dolls type

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.880 
will come in with this rafty dolls type
pluggy<00:03:09.010> appearance<00:03:09.940> to<00:03:10.090> their<00:03:10.239> hairline<00:03:10.890> what

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
pluggy appearance to their hairline what

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.979 
pluggy appearance to their hairline what
we'll<00:03:12.040> do<00:03:12.220> is<00:03:12.400> get<00:03:12.970> right<00:03:13.209> in<00:03:13.360> right<00:03:13.630> in<00:03:13.690> front

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
we'll do is get right in right in front

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.479 
we'll do is get right in right in front
of<00:03:14.080> it<00:03:14.200> and<00:03:14.350> soften<00:03:14.800> it<00:03:14.890> up<00:03:14.980> with<00:03:15.220> smaller

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
of it and soften it up with smaller

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.070 
of it and soften it up with smaller
graphs<00:03:15.820> so<00:03:16.450> these<00:03:16.570> are<00:03:16.720> things<00:03:16.810> that<00:03:16.930> we

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
graphs so these are things that we

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.449 
graphs so these are things that we
correct<00:03:17.350> all<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.620> time<00:03:17.830> and<00:03:18.070> the<00:03:18.220> last

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
correct all the time and the last

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.670 
correct all the time and the last
mistake<00:03:18.760> that<00:03:19.000> I<00:03:19.120> see<00:03:19.150> is<00:03:19.840> people<00:03:19.900> don't<00:03:20.500> get

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
mistake that I see is people don't get

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.640 
mistake that I see is people don't get
enough<00:03:20.980> hair<00:03:21.250> people<00:03:21.940> get<00:03:22.360> very<00:03:22.930> very<00:03:23.320> little

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
enough hair people get very very little

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.979 
enough hair people get very very little
result<00:03:24.100> the<00:03:24.580> spacing<00:03:25.120> of<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:25.300> grafts<00:03:25.540> is<00:03:25.780> too

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
result the spacing of the grafts is too

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.860 
result the spacing of the grafts is too
far<00:03:26.260> apart<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:27.790> types<00:03:28.060> of<00:03:28.239> graphs<00:03:28.450> are<00:03:28.630> being

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
far apart the types of graphs are being

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.600 
far apart the types of graphs are being
used<00:03:29.110> in<00:03:29.410> the<00:03:29.530> vertex<00:03:29.920> the<00:03:30.070> center<00:03:30.459> of<00:03:30.550> the

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
used in the vertex the center of the
