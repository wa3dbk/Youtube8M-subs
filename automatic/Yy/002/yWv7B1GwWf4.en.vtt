00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.530
 Highly dangerous drones 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.980
 a young man says he was a victim 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.540
 innocent of a shootout when I was 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.760
 coming out of a nightclub in florida 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.230
 after the fact he lost the mobility of his 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.030
 legs it is reported that the hospital 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.620
 where he is interned two years ago 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.300
 weeks has been delayed with an exam 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:24.230
 which is key to determining its severity 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:27.320
 and we are going out with a live 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:32.239
 when they suddenly started to fight 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:36.890
 outside is an asset we know about health and 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:39.379
 for the mood of the people is the being that 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.480
 he covers and read the shot and so 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.460
 began what would become a 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.220
 true nightmare for this young man of 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.110
 27 years after an intense night of 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.390
 fun in the discoorque luxor of the 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.550
 Florida ended up shot in the middle of a 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.579
 quarrel of which he says got the worst part 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.340
 having nothing to do with it I 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:02.020
 he said as anger walks the walk 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.700
 progression of a disk almost dies 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.820
 he practically arrived dead to the hospital 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.100
 everything 6 well as anguish and after that 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.050
 everything has gotten worse when it left the 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.670
 induced coma realized felipe 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.940
 that he had lost the mobility of his 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.940
 legs 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.420
 I do not see and a fraction of my doctor 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.049
 and as you listen to it, it takes you almost 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.540
 three weeks interned in the hospital 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.369
 Dr. Luisa DÃ­az from Florida and 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.590
 they assure that the experience has not been 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.860
 of the best it goes more and more than 20 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.860
 lives 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:45.520
 today I come back to you to search 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.570
 information but they do not help you at all and 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.120
 The only thing that they want is that 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.220
 probably the new one to walk and everything 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.140
 because this patient needs to be done 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.820
 an MRI with which the 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.560
 medical body can determine the 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.120
 severity of injuries in your spinal cord 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.620
 spinal and what would be the treatment 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.620
 suitable to treat it 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.129
 but the problem is that this center 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:19.139
 Hospital does not have the 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:21.060
 adequate equipment to perform this 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:23.030
 exam so they requested a 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.709
 interconsultation to another care center 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.170
 process in which they are trapped and not 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.180
 they see an early solution I do not know what to do 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.159
 to help him because he is wrong 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.400
 it's wrong in the hospital when it's going to 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:37.409
 both take two months to make him a 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.900
 resonance feels do not know if they are going 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:41.819
 to sit or not via email from 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.459
 hospital reported that the crucial examination to 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.019
 felipe will be held this Friday and 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.760
 assured that the delay was due to 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.310
 they waited for the patient to improve their 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.379
 health status however his family 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.730
 is still incredulous just wait with 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.010
 craving the result of the resonance 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.689
 to know with certainty the future of this 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.189
 young man who never thought it would be 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:01.189
 protagonist of a true nightmare
