00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.730
 we had with a heavy pack and very well 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.890
 paid was very well paid today we 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.400
 is facing a situation at one year of end 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.080
 quotas 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.910
 I think we need to start 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.140
 ask the right questions today 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.199
 we ask ourselves many questions by 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.699
 relation to seasonality 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:31.700
 there is the price of milk but there are all 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.300
 these bonuses there that may be brought to 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.840
 evolve 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.850
 the grain partner negotiated his price of 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.300
 sale of cereals that is to say that there 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.680
 regularly follows and aline certain 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.660
 independence from the 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.079
 marketing but also have 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.690
 cooperators largely but there are 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.749
 this external look and this relevance 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.690
 tracking that makes us roll we did not 

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:57.649
 not at all that the difficulty when 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.269
 we are talking about the price of milk today 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.620
 it's also one of the reasons 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:02.929
 which we arrive we wanted to 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.790
 to make this reference is that the price 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:06.590
 milk we can talk about 50 thousand 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.940
 ways there are so many milk prices 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.100
 medium and who has two cards of 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.690
 producers every month from 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.370
 when we have the information we can 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.120
 always negotiate the fact of being able 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:20.630
 compare dairies finally the price of 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.090
 milk from various dairies in a single 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.810
 region and to the inverted of the same 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.510
 dairies throughout France 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:32.930
 it's an open-mindedness 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:36.080
 relevant ie our guy he 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.740
 dream about this market report 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.900
 a senior cooperative manager who 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.370
 negotiate the price of milk it's also 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.790
 hooked points are ten years goes 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:50.300
 listen to one is operator 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.160
 but have all the points been 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.130
 taken into account and when we talk about 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.210
 seasonality of thau cell etc 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.490
 is that there are things to see 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.380
 alice and from one region to another 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:05.510
 at least we are going to have by people 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:08.000
 independent a costing of the cost of 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.619
 milk compared to dairies by 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.659
 report to the regions but why 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.239
 lactalis let's admit we pay better in 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:14.770
 Normandy that you in the Poitou 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.100
 entry 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.720
 sees the loaches site tell me maybe 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.380
 that we are opting to have 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:27.090
 major upheavals in the in 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.090
 the evolution of hard negotiations
