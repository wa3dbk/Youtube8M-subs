00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.840
 no no 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.450
 this is pro of cotec one more offer of 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:15.210
 electric bicycles for mobility 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.210
 from this chaotic city of mexico 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.940
 good but cotec is a 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.100
 brand of electric bicycles that are 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.710
 made in the United States and that we 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.200
 talks about a lot of things about standards 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.080
 of quality procedures 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:34.470
 guarantees of the company's support what 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.540
 that we have in the brand is like a range 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.630
 of bicycles for all needs 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.270
 300 250 watt engines are going to walk 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.940
 as there from the 24 8 kilometers by 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.720
 hour are usually accompanied by 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:52.350
 6 or 9 amp batteries that go to 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:56.280
 last from 40 to 50 kilometers of autonomy 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.660
 and the big ones a 500 watt andy engine 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.239
 at 32 kilometers per hour 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.880
 and we have batteries usually go 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.729
 accompanied by 12 amp batteries 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.100
 that last up to 60 kilometers and I have 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:13.840
 a bicycle that is 750 watts is 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:17.170
 the something that is very intrepid and I have a 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.360
 battery that is 8 forgiving of 16 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.220
 amps that last 80 kilometers last two 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.830
 thousand cycles that is another of our 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.960
 differentials we have two thousand loads 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.310
 when the competition usually 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.470
 handles 1000 1200 the bicycle aut 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.140
 has a maximum speed of 45 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.690
 kilometers per hour and an autonomy of 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.520
 40 kilometers because it has a battery 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.320
 a little bit younger since it's a 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.180
 much more robust bicycle much more 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.070
 heavy for mountain the wheels are more 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.320
 wide this for example this accelerator 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.850
 it's no longer like motorcycles but more 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.030
 well it's like quad bike that is from 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.840
 of thumb then 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.840
 let's move on 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:03.390
 I have different families the marinera the 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.030
 folding family 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.850
 that is light folds in three the storm 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.400
 which is a more sporting picture but 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.950
 with an adjustable city suspension 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.940
 I have the strike family that is already 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.620
 for a more urban picture or maybe for 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.930
 elderly people who do not want 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.300
 raise your leg a lot to get on the 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.100
 bicycle or for women or for people 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.350
 who wears a suit and then we have 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.790
 good the most sold that is santomé 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.530
 x2 which is the favorite of all 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.720
 men that is also a box 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.069
 folding can be comfortable mountain 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.670
 but good the benefits of it is 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:41.760
 folding and then we have the family 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:45.150
 of the car that would be very rough 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:49.019
 very robust we have from 22 thousand 900 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:53.240
 up to 40 thousand 500 depending a lot 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:55.370
 of the battery motor and the faces 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:59.510
 of the bicycle, now we are 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:02.300
 testing the phantom x2 which weighs 24 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.850
 kilos and has a range of 60 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.100
 kilometers and a maximum speed of 32 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.630
 kilometers per hour this kind of 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.180
 bikes I tried them cotec 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.210
 the technology that they use that accelerate 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.910
 or you pedal and that's how you say 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:21.060
 campechanía not ride your bike no 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.620
 has pedaled this bicycle 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.080
 It has seven speeds 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.420
 in case these embassies or uploads 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.980
 that you get much milder now I'm going 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.129
 to stop pedaling 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.480
 and I will accelerate as if it were a 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.480
 motorcycle here on the handlebar 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.370
 now what is this for here 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.160
 we can realize that it is totally 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.320
 Fill the battery this button is a short 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.080
 current when you press the button is 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.710
 already activated has this support or kirsten 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:57.770
 it is done well and well, it can be folded 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.630
 this battery is 12 amps and lasts 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.610
 approximately 60 kilometers from 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.610
 autonomy and here we can see so 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:07.030
 very friendly and easy if you are leaving 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.030
 Press the button 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.000
 fill half or empty this is the key 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.580
 what is needed to start the 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.359
 bike and we put it here in the slot 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.919
 it's off we give it that way and it's on or 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.959
 on if you want to say that already good 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.870
 you can use the electric motor or if 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.300
 we press the key and turn it 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.040
 another side is a lock that for what 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.630
 It serves to disassemble the battery and 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.950
 load it or good is also to load 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.889
 from here if you have an extension 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:37.260
 long cable the only thing we do is 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:41.210
 pull the focus strong and good then there 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.210
 is for you to download 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.440
 in 2014 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:56.380
 where there is apparently no limit to the 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:00.570
 imagination there we are seeing in the 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.570
 Top is a series
