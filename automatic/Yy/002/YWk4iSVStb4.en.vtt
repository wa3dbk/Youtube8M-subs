00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.319
 hi girls and hi guys here i'm here 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.389
 without makeup and hair I would add 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.490
 quite messy because you know it 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.080
 that I when without touch in the video 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.280
 because I have to smear something in 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.740
 face 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:22.230
 what you ask yourself I thought of them 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:24.300
 to do a cycling that actually you 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.900
 they are all names to say good or bad 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.539
 same thing that is a colored cream with 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.410
 a bit of the protection factors you watch 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.480
 to uniform the color and give a 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.550
 base effect and then dive into it 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.320
 obviously it must though a long time 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.090
 obviously it must be natural must not 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.950
 have bad ingredients in from where 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.960
 find the baby instead cd in 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.960
 completely natural you know a lot 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.550
 very difficult are 77 silicones e 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.500
 dammusi ingredients so I thought 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.969
 from the light bulb we prepare heaven at home 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.399
 however, I made this file very simple 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.410
 just a silly video like I say 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.780
 very simple so it is not 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.369
 absolutely a cosmetic tutorial e 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.530
 just a very simple recipe though 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.909
 I hope he can think that in my opinion 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.070
 really works 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.479
 so what you always have to do first is 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.640
 a powder foundation 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.860
 I use this here that you know that 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.259
 what I did at home did 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.000
 also the video tutorial and what we say 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.220
 and at the end the cut in the area for the 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.210
 silence to mine 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.250
 you know it if you don't know it 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.930
 there is always time to learn jolie 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.880
 that overlay where you can 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.530
 click on it and see how blacksmith in 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.530
 home that really simple natural 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.270
 europe and damage even know were 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.720
 many difficulties even if they do it 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.880
 so let's open then take mine 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.750
 mineral foundation you see that wrongly and 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.180
 seven from above and does it by pouring one 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.980
 small bowl also if you put one 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.470
 small bowl I recommend it fails 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.440
 the recipe as you are kidding me 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.890
 I say for those who do n't know me 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:03.740
 sugar and say this scene a 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.070
 teaspoon of mineral bottom inside 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.450
 of the little heart to disperse my la 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.150
 my dust that the one it sends to 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.070
 coloring the cream I put a gold in it is a 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.200
 I use this case jojoba oil 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.180
 because I have a light gold is fine for 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.130
 any your skin type 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.730
 I know if you have oily skin 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:26.150
 normal dry is therefore taken this 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:31.310
 you see us mixing and absorbing 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.989
 you become like a cream you must 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.900
 mix well well well 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.550
 so that they make everything uniform and not 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.200
 there must be nothing but a mini powder 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.620
 not the shock of it 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.440
 stir until it becomes that way 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.180
 you see that less bad all uniform a 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.640
 this point I go to add some 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.440
 sunscreen I know you have 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.650
 some sunscreen cream that you don't 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.930
 you have finished this summer and what it is 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.310
 does not throw because it is not thrown 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.260
 nothing for next year probably 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.209
 it would not be a large because the filters 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.390
 they give up and therefore no longer protect it 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.489
 you know and then we recite the cream 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.290
 solar and I made this video for 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.959
 research you know because just thought of 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.030
 all the sunscreens that I throw 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.340
 said no I have to find a remedy one 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.470
 solution and then I put this here 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.510
 any sunscreen you have 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:29.120
 protective of course if announcements made 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.120
 well you make me happier sincerely 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.920
 that continues to mix this point 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.760
 you should have something like this 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:43.060
 there is a cream you see beautiful soft 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.989
 uniform all colored that looks like type 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.400
 one thing they have only idea of ​​playing game 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.470
 the cream I know I already put in 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.870
 this bowls because I have some 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.390
 units a bit of regularity samples 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.040
 without stuff eco bio good stuff and me 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.530
 he tells of Italy, it seems he has good 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.530
 showcase a little the speed you see before 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.799
 half a teaspoon and I put it in and 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.510
 add to this you see I'm going to mix 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:10.599
 because at this point as well you have the 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.459
 colored base now you have to modulate into 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:15.129
 based on your characteristics of 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.560
 skin is thirsty but it was very dark 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:19.030
 then add less cream net 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.889
 if you don't know a weigh is clearer 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.300
 you have to add cream until 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:28.840
 bad the color you can also find 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:31.570
 ladle mixes mixes and here it is the 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.250
 will not be cc movies or bb climate notes like 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.960
 well know he can apologize at this point 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.639
 then I look at it then I do 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.110
 to really say they will ask me 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:56.080
 a small one closed a month 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:58.790
 first miss oh so therefore a little 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.470
 expressed this version of cc green 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.900
 homemade that it was already night they have 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.390
 made other than a kidney 3 part of the 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.910
 cc climate then the color part la 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.970
 part of the anti-aging moisturizer that maybe 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.620
 put the precious one on a cream 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.540
 inside with the media is the part of 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.310
 so we did solar protection 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.720
 this homemade version that I hope 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.150
 so much that it is for the face off 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.150
 let me know 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.150
