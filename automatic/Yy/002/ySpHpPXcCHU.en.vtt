at<00:01:54.270> least<00:01:54.509> in<00:01:54.720> my<00:01:54.750> opinion<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:56.040> I'm

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
at least in my opinion it is so I'm

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.520 
at least in my opinion it is so I'm
going<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.310> take<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.329> apply<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.170> right<00:01:58.469> on

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
going to take this and apply it right on

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.520 
going to take this and apply it right on
to<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.829> areas<00:01:59.219> where<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.520> do<00:01:59.640> tend<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.090> get<00:02:00.240> oily

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
to the areas where I do tend to get oily

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.459 
to the areas where I do tend to get oily
first<00:02:01.530> which<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.130> around<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.700> nose<00:02:02.969> on<00:02:03.469> the

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
first which is around the nose on the

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.319 
first which is around the nose on the
top<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.890> forehead<00:02:05.219> right<00:02:05.340> there<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.790> then

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
top of the forehead right there and then

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:12.440 
top of the forehead right there and then

and<00:02:13.450> with<00:02:13.630> little<00:02:13.870> to<00:02:13.990> no<00:02:14.200> effort<00:02:14.230> this<00:02:14.890> sinks

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
and with little to no effort this sinks

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.390 
and with little to no effort this sinks
right<00:02:15.820> into<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:16.180> skin<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.720> dries<00:02:17.400> amazingly

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
right into the skin it dries amazingly

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.880 
right into the skin it dries amazingly
fast<00:02:18.820> I<00:02:19.030> can't<00:02:19.240> believe<00:02:19.480> how<00:02:19.690> fast<00:02:20.020> it<00:02:20.590> dries

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
fast I can't believe how fast it dries

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.400 
fast I can't believe how fast it dries
once<00:02:21.280> you<00:02:21.400> apply<00:02:21.700> it<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:22.030> this<00:02:22.570> is<00:02:22.780> not<00:02:23.170> only

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
once you apply it and this is not only

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.950 
once you apply it and this is not only
great<00:02:23.770> as<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.070> face<00:02:24.550> primer<00:02:24.880> it's<00:02:25.420> really<00:02:25.780> good

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
great as a face primer it's really good

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.560

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
as an eye primer too so it's basically a

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.130 
as an eye primer too so it's basically a
tuned<00:02:28.900> one<00:02:29.230> type<00:02:29.530> product<00:02:30.070> that<00:02:30.340> you<00:02:30.460> can<00:02:30.670> use

tuned one type product that you can use
so<00:02:32.140> I've<00:02:32.230> been<00:02:32.320> sitting<00:02:32.590> here<00:02:32.650> timing<00:02:33.250> this

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
so I've been sitting here timing this

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.090 
so I've been sitting here timing this
application<00:02:34.390> now<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:35.020> it's<00:02:35.260> taken<00:02:35.590> 40

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
application now and it's taken 40

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.040 
application now and it's taken 40
seconds<00:02:36.670> up<00:02:36.820> to<00:02:36.940> this<00:02:37.030> point<00:02:37.330> before<00:02:37.570> it<00:02:37.780> has

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
seconds up to this point before it has

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.860 
seconds up to this point before it has
fully<00:02:38.410> set<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:39.070> I'm<00:02:39.430> ready<00:02:39.610> to<00:02:39.670> apply<00:02:40.180> my

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
fully set and I'm ready to apply my

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.450 
fully set and I'm ready to apply my
regular<00:02:41.380> products<00:02:41.800> early<00:02:42.100> that<00:02:42.220> it's<00:02:42.370> I've

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
regular products early that it's I've

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.250 
regular products early that it's I've
got<00:02:42.610> everything<00:02:42.850> applied<00:02:43.240> over<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:43.810> primer

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
got everything applied over the primer

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.990 
got everything applied over the primer
so<00:02:44.590> this<00:02:44.740> is<00:02:44.830> where<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.100> real<00:02:45.370> test<00:02:45.730> is<00:02:45.880> going

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
so this is where the real test is going

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.280 
so this is where the real test is going
to<00:02:46.120> start<00:02:46.420> I'm<00:02:46.540> going<00:02:46.600> to<00:02:46.750> come<00:02:46.870> back<00:02:47.020> in<00:02:47.200> about

forehead or on the chin at all so I'm
actually<00:03:23.470> pretty<00:03:23.680> impressed<00:03:23.920> at<00:03:24.370> this<00:03:24.550> point

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
actually pretty impressed at this point

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.330 
actually pretty impressed at this point
I'm<00:03:25.060> going<00:03:25.360> to<00:03:25.420> push<00:03:25.690> this<00:03:25.989> to<00:03:26.410> the<00:03:26.440> nine-hour

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
I'm going to push this to the nine-hour

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.160 
I'm going to push this to the nine-hour
mark<00:03:27.970> so<00:03:28.180> we're<00:03:28.300> going<00:03:28.420> to<00:03:28.510> go<00:03:28.570> three<00:03:28.930> more

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
mark so we're going to go three more

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.770 
mark so we're going to go three more
hours<00:03:29.590> with<00:03:29.800> this<00:03:30.040> primer<00:03:30.400> to<00:03:30.970> see<00:03:31.180> if<00:03:31.420> this

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
hours with this primer to see if this

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.870 
hours with this primer to see if this
area<00:03:32.110> in<00:03:32.440> this<00:03:32.620> area<00:03:32.860> will<00:03:33.220> catch<00:03:33.430> up<00:03:33.670> with

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
area in this area will catch up with

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.300 
area in this area will catch up with
this<00:03:34.150> I'm<00:03:34.420> sure<00:03:34.450> this<00:03:34.780> will<00:03:34.930> be<00:03:34.989> much<00:03:35.739> worse<00:03:36.040> at

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
this I'm sure this will be much worse at

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.550 
this I'm sure this will be much worse at
the<00:03:36.400> 9<00:03:36.580> hour<00:03:36.760> mark<00:03:37.120> but<00:03:37.390> still<00:03:37.720> very

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
the 9 hour mark but still very
