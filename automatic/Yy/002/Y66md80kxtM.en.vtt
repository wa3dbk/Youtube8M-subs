quite<00:00:06.359> the<00:00:06.390> paradox<00:00:06.870> Harrison<00:00:07.680> has<00:00:07.770> presented

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
quite the paradox Harrison has presented

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.339 
quite the paradox Harrison has presented
you<00:00:08.309> with<00:00:08.340> mr.<00:00:08.730> hella<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.330> chance<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:10.050> be<00:00:10.170> with

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
you with mr. hella the chance to be with

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.160 
you with mr. hella the chance to be with
someone<00:00:10.679> you<00:00:10.830> love<00:00:11.330> seems<00:00:12.330> pretty<00:00:12.840> cut<00:00:13.139> and

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
someone you love seems pretty cut and

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.680 
someone you love seems pretty cut and
dry<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.440> me<00:00:13.710> that<00:00:14.099> first<00:00:14.580> blush<00:00:15.210> don't<00:00:15.599> know

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
dry to me that first blush don't know

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.840 
dry to me that first blush don't know
why<00:00:15.900> so<00:00:16.500> for<00:00:16.710> this<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.949> actually<00:00:17.100> work<00:00:17.430> how

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
why so for this to actually work how

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.000 
why so for this to actually work how
fast<00:00:18.180> would<00:00:18.390> Barry<00:00:18.630> have<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:18.990> go<00:00:19.109> by<00:00:19.830> my

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
fast would Barry have to go by my

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.960 
fast would Barry have to go by my
estimates<00:00:20.520> MUC<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.539> at<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.750> minimum<00:00:22.760> you<00:00:23.760> never

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
estimates MUC to at a minimum you never

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.929 
estimates MUC to at a minimum you never
gone<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.300> fast<00:00:24.359> so<00:00:25.199> what<00:00:25.980> happens<00:00:26.340> if<00:00:26.519> bear

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
gone that fast so what happens if bear

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.880 
gone that fast so what happens if bear
doesn't<00:00:27.240> reach<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.570> speed<00:00:30.590> it<00:00:31.590> was<00:00:31.710> all

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
doesn't reach that speed it was all

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.920 
doesn't reach that speed it was all
right<00:00:32.009> with<00:00:32.160> everyone<00:00:32.399> I'd<00:00:32.669> like<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:33.420> skip<00:00:33.780> all

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
right with everyone I'd like to skip all

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.979 
right with everyone I'd like to skip all
the<00:00:34.020> Hebrew<00:00:35.149> estimates<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.360> science<00:00:36.809> we've

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
the Hebrew estimates in science we've

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.229 
the Hebrew estimates in science we've
all<00:00:37.110> been<00:00:37.290> party<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:37.920> sir<00:00:38.610> room<00:00:38.760> on<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.059> Rings

if<00:00:52.170> all<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.590> events<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.130> past<00:00:53.430> year<00:00:53.670> have<00:00:53.940> led

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
if all the events the past year have led

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.800 
if all the events the past year have led
us<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.540> moment<00:00:56.540> it<00:00:57.540> was<00:00:57.690> worth<00:00:57.870> it

00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810 
us to this moment it was worth it

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.770 
us to this moment it was worth it
I<00:00:59.840> love<00:01:00.530> you<00:01:00.650> honey

may kiss the bride
stop<00:01:06.610> telling<00:01:06.910> me<00:01:06.940> what<00:01:07.150> to<00:01:07.180> do

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:37.719 

okay<00:01:28.590> he<00:01:29.100> just<00:01:29.310> passed<00:01:29.580> mountain

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729

having<00:01:38.729> Barry<00:01:39.090> he's<00:01:39.689> gone<00:01:39.899> a<00:01:40.109> few<00:01:40.380> spiria

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
having Barry he's gone a few spiria

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:42.560 
having Barry he's gone a few spiria
that's<00:01:41.280> an<00:01:41.399> orbital<00:01:41.820> motion<00:01:42.149> around<00:01:42.450> the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
that's an orbital motion around the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.450 
that's an orbital motion around the
singularity<00:01:42.840> what<00:01:43.380> does<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.590> mean<00:01:44.009> we<00:01:44.429> have

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
singularity what does that mean we have

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.999 
singularity what does that mean we have
to<00:01:44.579> disrupt<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.149> motion<00:01:45.860> basically<00:01:46.860> it's

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
to disrupt the motion basically it's

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.399 
to disrupt the motion basically it's
just<00:01:47.070> like<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.520> tornado<00:01:47.729> only<00:01:48.270> upside<00:01:48.600> down
