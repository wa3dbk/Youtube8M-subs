00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.240
 yes and then what will happen to the 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:10.190
 Rotterdam cockpit 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.200
 everything seemed in jugs and jugs but the 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.090
 future is again uncertain for new 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.960
 build them as they are millions or one 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.599
 new stadium 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.490
 everything is open again for Kees Veerdonk 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:22.279
 remains the current cockpit in any case 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:26.410
 kept on his back for eternity 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.410
 well that's nice 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.199
 This is also known as a place where 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.330
 his rights at coincidence or trust 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.800
 not exactly today let kees at 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.129
 it does that on the tub on its back 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.260
 put 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.970
 so you would actually think stadium 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.780
 love to keep but nothing turns out 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.979
 less true 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.089
 we just entered a new stadium 

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:43.269
 it is of course improvement for the 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:43.269
 club 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.690
 say they say ok do it 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.659
 new cockpit we have a new stadium 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.619
 built we committed to demolish the old tub 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:53.089
 then I would really mind 

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:54.710
 therefore nobody mixes with the acting 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:55.879
 old cape natural to have back 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.330
 we no longer know how to take them from me 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.250
 no plan for 10 months has been thrown away 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.180
 because no matter how beautiful the plans were 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.860
 can in the trash 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.869
 the total costs would be 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.350
 at least 15 million euros too high 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.350
 Hatch 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.880
 and where the one must clear the field 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.530
 the other jumps into the reddekuip foundation 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.130
 the last time just next to the pot 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.930
 ski slope 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.750
 out why his chance with your plan 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.700
 better because we have the three and a half years 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.200
 have worked and you only have one 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.649
 full plan with a real sliding roof 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.149
 a membrane roof third ring what really 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.590
 about pendants over the second ring that 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.580
 is really a trait of want now 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.170
 preserve 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.430
 we keep it within 12 million and we 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.270
 think we can do our best a little bit better 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.039
 then 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.930
 then the tree has done we must for 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.299
 visible the new one 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:47.550
 not a whole new stadium to this one 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:50.490
 the tub should stay refresh because there 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:54.240
 is only one tub and it is not allowed to leave 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.350
 I think they put it on that new driver 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.560
 don't sit 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.000
 but you are there if we already have the 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.750
 because of that thea that atmosphere namely 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.610
 where i now know that back to what's there 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.390
 is also going to happen for new build or 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.640
 build new 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.110
 cees has his own bowl of horror 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.420
 wimer of course yes 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.620
 taking the hijack on my back is too good 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.700
 always in my life 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.700
 but this one I'm too happy with
