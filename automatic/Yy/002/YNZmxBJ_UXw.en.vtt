00:00:37.849 --> 00:00:37.859 
this foundation i would call it a medium

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:40.160 
this foundation i would call it a medium
to<00:00:38.370> full<00:00:38.670> but<00:00:38.969> more<00:00:39.210> towards<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.750> medium

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
to full but more towards the medium

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.680 
to full but more towards the medium
sized<00:00:40.469> coverage<00:00:41.039> foundation<00:00:41.699> it<00:00:41.969> gives<00:00:42.329> an

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
sized coverage foundation it gives an

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.520 
sized coverage foundation it gives an
amazing<00:00:43.199> satin<00:00:43.649> finish<00:00:44.039> and<00:00:44.989> i<00:00:45.989> think<00:00:46.320> the

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
amazing satin finish and i think the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.029 
amazing satin finish and i think the
amount<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.340> get<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.090> 30<00:00:49.079> mil<00:00:49.589> which<00:00:49.859> i

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
amount you get in it is 30 mil which i

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.349 
amount you get in it is 30 mil which i
think<00:00:50.100> it's<00:00:50.460> pretty<00:00:50.640> much<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.940> standard

00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:51.359 
think it's pretty much the standard

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:53.840 
think it's pretty much the standard
amount<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:52.019> most<00:00:52.320> foundations<00:00:53.219> isn't<00:00:53.519> it<00:00:53.640> is

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
amount of most foundations isn't it is

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.000 
amount of most foundations isn't it is

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
is great the durability the amount that

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.340 
is great the durability the amount that
it<00:03:43.049> stays<00:03:43.290> on<00:03:43.500> my<00:03:43.530> skin<00:03:43.890> is<00:03:44.040> great<00:03:44.280> as<00:03:44.459> well

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
unfortunately the color range isn't so

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.539 
unfortunately the color range isn't so
large<00:03:48.180> i<00:03:48.420> think<00:03:48.660> it's<00:03:48.810> only<00:03:49.140> got<00:03:49.290> about<00:03:49.549> six

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
large i think it's only got about six

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.539 
large i think it's only got about six
colors<00:03:51.120> there<00:03:52.019> was<00:03:52.170> one<00:03:52.440> up<00:03:52.650> darker<00:03:53.220> than<00:03:53.340> this

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
colors there was one up darker than this

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.550 
colors there was one up darker than this
one<00:03:53.820> and<00:03:54.030> then<00:03:54.150> that's<00:03:54.269> it<00:03:54.540> so<00:03:55.140> if<00:03:55.260> you're<00:03:55.409> any

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
one and then that's it so if you're any

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.270 
one and then that's it so if you're any
