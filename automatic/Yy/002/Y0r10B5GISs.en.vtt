00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.340
 hi to you all giuseppe agozzino later 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.680
 having unpacked that photograph 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.580
 the samsung galaxy s iii is the time 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.400
 to insert the micro sd battery 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:26.000
 eventual the microsim close the whole 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.790
 especially with regard to the micro 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.500
 sd specifically we talk about a 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.640
 32 GB model 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:37.190
 so let's proceed with fixing 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.220
 battery and whatever else we will proceed 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.710
 even with the first ignition as 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.870
 concerns the micro sd as for how much 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.480
 covers the rest of the various details 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.239
 always be delicate when 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:55.010
 proceed to insert components 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:59.110
 so compact you only need one hand 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:06.410
 and true totals to use a little 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:10.009
 caution in short, it is always good if you say 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:12.619
 one click for both as you have seen 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:16.940
 then they fit in firmly 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:25.009
 ease at this point we can 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:28.090
 proceed to ignition use the 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:34.780
 button on the side as we did 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.780
 see us is the samsung greets you 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.570
 at this point inserted to the eventual 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.570
 pin 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.220
 us that the startup procedure does not 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.220
 we will cut nothing 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.280
 insert the pin 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.770
 the moment you down a 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.450
 left 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:56.680
 read safe mode as you 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:03:00.510
 he simply saw first 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.510
 proceed to reboot 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.510
 ok the message aside that obviously 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.070
 they arrive at the moment you are there 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.260
 find the configuration for example 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.480
 which connections to make for example 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.320
 turn off test phone and while 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.180
 someone sends communications to you 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.040
 let's remove to make the movie 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.200
 still clean but the important thing was 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.680
 however highlight the fact that if 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.910
 happens as it happened now a 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.640
 initial start in safe mode 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:34.120
 a simple reboot as you see the 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:37.240
 then allows you to start using the 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.950
 phone with firm satisfaction on 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.890
 first start the insertion of the micro 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.600
 sim battery microsd sum 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.500
 it ends so there is nothing else to show to 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.440
 this point I can simply 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.140

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.580
