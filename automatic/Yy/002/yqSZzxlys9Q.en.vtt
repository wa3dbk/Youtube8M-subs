 of course very happy to get out but today 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.700
 I 'm sure you want to know who the 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:38.340
 won has won and we ask 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.420
 This time we really have because we man 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.860
 last time had the problem that 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.450
 something with the comments not 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.129
 We voted in parallel both 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.559
 Looked like we are alike 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.910
 comments have similar numbers so the 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.670
 first comment is here from this beat 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.449
 bulette the range exactly with a 500 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.750
 gb hard drive from western digital now 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:03.899
 let's go to what generator times 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:08.030
 enter google and then we'll look 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:11.119
 have said between 1 and 9 199 or 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:17.009
 a general one of our first winners 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:19.110
 that is the number 732 as a cure to the 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.520
 number is as always curious looking for 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:28.710
 732 Sunday the number does not exist then 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:33.240
 If we look again 863 then we know 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:38.189
 the hard disk unfortunately retain 863 there 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.189
 it is not okay then again 692 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:46.680
 always pay so high 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:52.829
 not even then again it will be 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.509
 always lower 402 not even older 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.710
 Swede 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:59.939
 114 someone has 214 ears 218 I have 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.869

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.939
 you're just about colleague 11 the number 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.700
 11 that is the need to be there now 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.679
 or 11 I think the numbers are 14 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.689
 I see here has my master 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:17.939

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:19.829
 it's already low , though 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:22.769
 Unfortunately , I 've had it several times 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:26.310
 have 111 311 and that's it 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.659
 So we did not have 11 that is 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.659
 but that's a number that should be 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:34.889
