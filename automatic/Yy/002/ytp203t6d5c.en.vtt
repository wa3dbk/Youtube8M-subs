00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.980
 hello babies 

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:08.360
 [Music] 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.430
 the day of we will have a video that stops 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.040
 many can be terrifying apocalyptic 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.260
 and so macabre dying acapulco in week 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.119
 santa or weekdays a weekend or 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.279
 go to acapulco and that from 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.500
 various studies done by experts in 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.419
 different branches these are the biggest 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.880
 threats facing our humanity 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:27.050
 and they are real threats and not things like 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.140
 those that appear in films of 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.790
 hollywood or in the new testament 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.800
 supervolcano in short a volcano is a 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.570
 archaeological site where material leaves 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.340
 from the interior of the land 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.039
 I shin but instead of fat 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.050
 they eject magma and that must have been the 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:46.160
 worst analogy in this channel 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.980
 a supervolcano like the superbowl is 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.780
 I do not know anything about American women they said a 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.670
 Supervolcano is the same as a volcano 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.769
 but with superpower superpower is 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.870
 destructive and nothing else for them to know 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.699
 mexico is land of volcanoes we go like 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.100
 of the world has and the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.140
 supervolcanoes have a thousand times more power 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.630
 that the volcanoes and eruption of one of 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.400
 they would not only destroy everything to hundreds 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.170
 of kilometers but that would cause a 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.300
 fatal climate change are like women 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.640
 in their days to which all of them also 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.560
 more women with 90 kilometers of 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.869
 extension about to expel materials 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.060
 incandescent or everything is normal is super 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.250
 The most famous volcano is that of ice 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.200
 there are many others around the world 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.060
 so without knowing it we are seeing about 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.979
 a huge piece of land that in any 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.780
 moment can explode as if the world 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.210
 whole outside of pemex nanotechnology 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.640
 in synthesis is the manipulation of 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.770
 level matter does not scale or be as 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.570
 little one they can imagine would say that 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.310
 like Asian penis but here not 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.960
 we recycle our own jokes to 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.610
 That 's what the last eight seasons 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.810
 the simpsons nanotechnology is the 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.310
 equivalent to the industrial revolution 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.899
 of our time 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.549
 are the ones we have seen in all 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.470
 James Bond movies and fall into hands 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.939
 of terrorists years irreversible to 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.610
 overexploitation environment 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.259
 room the patent graphic that is 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.689
 everything that already happens in companies 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.189
 Mexican llaneros of impact science 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.500
 of an asteroid if you think this is 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.420
 joke exists the turin scale that measures 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.550
 the risk of an asteroid impacting the 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.410
 ground from zero level to day and 10 is 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.930
 sure collision capable of destroying everything 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.269
 Even the believers and nobody wants that 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.769
 nobody according to nasa the probability of 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.450
 that a large asteroid collides with the 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.310
 Earth is like having a drunken boyfriend 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.140
 says that she has not taken you do not know with 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.430
 certainty when it will be all the time is 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.319
 in the possibility you have plans of 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.090
 emergency but in the end it will not return to 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.220
 be the bastard and cause a cataclysm 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.890
 that neither ben affleck will be able to help you 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.170
 of dolly that hope is that there is no 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.060
 hope another prohibition does not either 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.340
 the same does not matter the probability that 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.170
 die for an asteroid is one in 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.849
 seven hundred thousand that is more likely 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.830
 that you die when falling covering your 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.780
 unicorn loves to ride me 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.760
 unicorn and unicorn I mean the 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.860
 same sea but to me the marijuana is 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.800
 illegal apart from riding unicorns 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.270
 I do not care about the asteroid I love you pandemic 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.040
 and a global one of a disease 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.820
 infectious or like the video of 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.010
 won 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.200
 humanity has suffered many like the 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.170
 smallpox champion flu the black plague 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.570
 which together total more than 700 million 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.970
 deaths that are millions of views less 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.830
 that my hot bikini videos for 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.300
 stay in the terrible damage that suffers 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.160
 our generation today 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.110
 there is a risk of a pandemic due to fevers 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.880
 viral hemorrhages such as Ebola 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.770
 example has a mortality rate of 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.720
 up to 90 percent that is almost the 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.970
 same mortality figure as eating 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.490
 in a taco of ecatepec or 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.260
 live in ecatepec there are also the 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.120
 microbes resistant to antibiotics 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.010
 which are pathogens that can cause 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.600
 which controlled diseases reappears 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.340
 it's pretty much what's going to happen with the 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.200
 Star Wars fans we have already gotten rid of 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.170
 of them and now they are going to come back more 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.480
 deadly and more pathogenic thanks george 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.430
 lucas in addition to these risks you do not have to 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.050
 forget the extreme climate change that 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.090
 will cause the same thing as the change 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.030
 climatic but in areas targeted to 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.620
 worst effects and more 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.080
 fast the good thing is that the pretty ones 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.760
 We can use your successes for a longer time 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.040
 bad is that the teddy bears are going to die 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.900
 polar ones for each other is also the 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.090
 risk of a nuclear war but that yes 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.950
 nobody wants to bomb Mexico 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.020
 Only Belize always announced us in 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.640
 Central America is the deforestation that 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.489
 puts at risk the large amount of 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.200
 animal plants communities the 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.420
 Water supply balance 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.220
 climate in Mexico we are in the fifth 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.049
 global place of deforestation but here 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.910
 in the df we are wanting to 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.040
 rise of position to all the country we go 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.570
 for the first Chilean friends these are 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.940
 just some of the main threats 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.830
 for humanity but there are also other 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.020
 just as serious as the shortage of 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.330
 food or send a wrong whatsapp 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.310
 or soap operas or hate but for me 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.169
 the biggest risk is that humanity 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.419
 do not listen to my boyfriend's band ken 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.460
 italic fact here I leave the video 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.860
 of his last single that will be compacted 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.169
 the neighborhood and they 're going to listen to them 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.300
 I call - thanks for giving me this 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.580
 talk and your heart the good news 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.900
 baby is that no scientific hypothesis 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.790
 think that humanity ends in 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.710
 less than 100 years and that we can 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.050
 keep watching 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.690
 this we can concentrate only on 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.100
 have fun but I'm good baby that was 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.440
 everything for me in this video we see ourselves in 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.240
 the next follow us on twitter subscribe

 we played here in the channel activate the 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:16.050
 notifications I send a message and
