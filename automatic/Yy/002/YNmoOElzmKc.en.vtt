okay<00:00:00.810> doesn't<00:00:01.170> matter<00:00:01.410> what<00:00:01.949> size<00:00:02.250> the<00:00:02.520> square

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
okay doesn't matter what size the square

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.120 
okay doesn't matter what size the square
is<00:00:03.090> it<00:00:03.330> just<00:00:03.540> depends<00:00:03.990> on<00:00:04.080> what<00:00:04.290> size<00:00:04.589> by<00:00:04.950> all

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
is it just depends on what size by all

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.309 
is it just depends on what size by all
you<00:00:05.339> want<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:05.700> make<00:00:05.730> we're<00:00:06.509> going<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.750> start<00:00:07.080> on

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
you want to make we're going to start on

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.049 
you want to make we're going to start on
one<00:00:07.350> side<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:08.250> make<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.059> slit<00:00:10.820> then<00:00:11.820> we're

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
one side and make a slit then we're

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.079 
one side and make a slit then we're
going<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.360> cut<00:00:12.980> on<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.070> other<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.790> make<00:00:15.059> a

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
going to cut on the other and make a

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.359 
going to cut on the other and make a
triangle<00:00:18.020> and<00:00:19.020> flip<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:19.410> over<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:19.920> do<00:00:20.340> the

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
triangle and flip it over and do the

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.019 
triangle and flip it over and do the
exact<00:00:20.939> same<00:00:21.090> thing<00:00:21.689> on<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.500> other<00:00:22.529> side<00:00:23.029> so

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
exact same thing on the other side so

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:35.000 
exact same thing on the other side so
that<00:00:24.060> both<00:00:24.420> sides<00:00:24.840> are<00:00:25.170> just<00:00:25.260> alive<00:00:34.010> then

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
that both sides are just alive then

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.370 
that both sides are just alive then
we're<00:00:35.219> going<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.579> fold<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.180> top<00:00:36.480> over<00:00:36.780> and

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
we're going to fold the top over and

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.360 
we're going to fold the top over and
this<00:00:38.190> makes<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.910> else<00:00:39.149> head<00:00:39.860> using<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:41.129> brown

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
this makes the else head using a brown

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.850 
this makes the else head using a brown
crayon<00:00:41.790> we're<00:00:42.239> going<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.480> make<00:00:42.690> little<00:00:43.559> letter

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
crayon we're going to make little letter

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.549 
crayon we're going to make little letter
B's<00:00:44.899> that<00:00:45.899> make<00:00:47.000> look<00:00:48.000> like<00:00:48.059> it's<00:00:48.629> feathers<00:00:48.989> on

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
B's that make look like it's feathers on

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.850 
B's that make look like it's feathers on
the<00:00:49.770> Higgin<00:00:50.809> the<00:00:51.809> next<00:00:52.230> thing<00:00:52.440> we're<00:00:52.649> going<00:00:52.770> to

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
the Higgin the next thing we're going to

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.619 
the Higgin the next thing we're going to
do<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.250> color<00:00:54.110> the<00:00:55.110> point<00:00:55.760> orange<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.510> it

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
do is color the point orange so that it

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.549 
do is color the point orange so that it
looks<00:00:57.870> like<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.230> beak<00:00:59.600> pressing<00:01:00.600> down<00:01:00.780> hard<00:01:00.809> so

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
looks like a beak pressing down hard so

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:09.590 
looks like a beak pressing down hard so
that<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.890> shows<00:01:02.129> up<00:01:02.190> well<00:01:07.670> the<00:01:08.670> next<00:01:08.909> step<00:01:09.119> is

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
that it shows up well the next step is

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.990 
that it shows up well the next step is
to<00:01:09.869> fringe<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.890> tail<00:01:11.159> feathers<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.820> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
to fringe the tail feathers and the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.539 
to fringe the tail feathers and the
wings<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:13.049> best<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.590> start<00:01:13.979> at<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.340> very

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
wings it's best to start at the very

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:25.219 
wings it's best to start at the very
point<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.470> work<00:01:16.470> outward<00:01:23.210> now<00:01:24.210> with<00:01:24.689> fold<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
point and work outward now with fold the

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.800 
point and work outward now with fold the
wings<00:01:25.470> down

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.219 

and<00:01:31.560> we're<00:01:32.070> ready<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.400> make<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.299> eyes<00:01:36.229> start

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
and we're ready to make the eyes start

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.160 
and we're ready to make the eyes start
with<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.440> black<00:01:38.450> and<00:01:39.450> make<00:01:39.659> us<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.960> little

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
with a black and make us a little

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.280 
with a black and make us a little
straight<00:01:40.470> line<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:41.009> slit<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:42.110> around<00:01:43.110> these

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
straight line of slit and around these

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.600 
straight line of slit and around these
slits<00:01:43.650> we're<00:01:44.009> going<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.310> make<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.990> circle<00:01:48.080> and

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
slits we're going to make a circle and

00:01:49.610 --> 00:02:03.830 
slits we're going to make a circle and
color<00:01:50.610> inside<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.330> circle<00:01:52.050> with<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.290> white

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.779 

this<00:02:04.829> finishes<00:02:05.390> our<00:02:06.500> project<00:02:07.500> for<00:02:07.829> today<00:02:07.979> and

here's an example of some of the

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.610 
here's an example of some of the
students<00:02:11.550> work<00:02:11.910> making<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.930> different<00:02:13.379> size

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
students work making a different size
