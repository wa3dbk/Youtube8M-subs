secure

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.300 

well<00:04:17.109> I<00:04:17.470> stood<00:04:18.400> told<00:04:19.120> me<00:04:19.299> that<00:04:19.510> I<00:04:20.049> must<00:04:20.590> run

I<00:04:24.510> only<00:04:24.900> hear<00:04:28.940> scary

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.310 

it's<00:04:36.490> nice<00:04:36.669> having<00:04:36.850> troops<00:04:37.570> I<00:04:37.600> think<00:04:38.020> gin<00:04:38.199> she

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
it's nice having troops I think gin she

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.320 
it's nice having troops I think gin she
just<00:04:38.500> needs<00:04:38.650> a<00:04:38.740> little<00:04:38.860> liquid<00:04:39.580> courage<00:04:40.090> what

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
just needs a little liquid courage what

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.640 
just needs a little liquid courage what
he's<00:04:40.479> saying

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:05:03.680 

think<00:04:44.860> of<00:04:44.949> a<00:04:45.009> property<00:04:45.340> damage

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:19.940 

it's<00:05:04.690> hard<00:05:04.960> empty<00:05:16.650> well<00:05:17.650> she's<00:05:18.040> gonna<00:05:18.190> talk

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
it's hard empty well she's gonna talk

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:25.830 
it's hard empty well she's gonna talk
play<00:05:23.310> I<00:05:24.310> think<00:05:24.880> this<00:05:25.150> means<00:05:25.330> that<00:05:25.570> probably

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
play I think this means that probably

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.280 
play I think this means that probably
start<00:05:26.490> all<00:05:27.490> right<00:05:27.730> I<00:05:27.940> guess<00:05:28.270> since<00:05:28.930> they<00:05:29.170> have

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
start all right I guess since they have

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.530 
start all right I guess since they have
