00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 Hello I love you today again 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.960
 a new video for you at 2 is that 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:11.160
 for the dear sandy she has me 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.690
 asked how the concealer holds and long 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.330
 That's why I wanted a video about it 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.920
 turn exactly so I'm done now 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.340
 make-up I do not have a concealer now 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.100
 I have to say I 've got that before 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.449
 nivea pure nhl rich 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.680
 facial care taken 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.449
 I have the complete one 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.220
 face give I've also 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.539
 complete face given and of course 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.969
 He also let his eyes down 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:38.820
 meanwhile, is pretty well fed 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:41.430
 I have nothing under my eyes 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.300
 and that's why I'll show you now 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.020
 how it works 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:50.700
 So I have professional here 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.829
 benefits just that primer the man so 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.320
 on the face goes to the pores 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:01.020
 Refine and I take one 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.550
 small amount surround this under mine 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.510
 eyes i know that's not really 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.070
 thought for that but why not me 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.400
 Just think and I already have it 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.640
 Tested only really holds 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.830
 bombenfest 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:19.439
 I just paint it under mine 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:21.200
 eyes so finished we already have 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.970
 a perfect underlay 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.130
 I have already tried this with 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.450
 an eye without this professional and 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.880
 a match and I have to say so 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.200
 really great with it if you 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.579
 another better course, that must be 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.590
 Do not be fit. I have it 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.159
 that's just as good then I'll take 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:44.820
 here max studio finish concealer in nb 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:46.860
 25 by the way has spf 35 I can you 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.990
 only very well recommend this is really 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.640
 it keeps forever so this droplet stops 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.740
 really very long is about 20 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.579
 euro glock 19 or 20 euros 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.130
 and what I say to the way countern 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.600
 I did not want him 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.299
 sebastian both foundation that so 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.470
 yellowish is I'll have it easy 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.539
 not so good at consulting 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.310
 that's why you make a concealer on it 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.959
 even if we give you one too dark 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.580
 give it to the daylight and 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.860
 Look, because that's what you see 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.420
 a little bit distorted makes it through 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.500
 it goes on the daylight and looks 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.810
 again, if that really the right one 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.580
 because I buy the wrong one 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.860
 then I always bought the wrong one 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.630
 I have the w 35 last time 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.400
 and there it was so dark that should be 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:31.830
 bit keeps back his under the eyes 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.120
 and not darken then I have to 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.290
 luck did not put in then 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.630
 returned mostly tried 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.459
 you in it then the outside suggests the 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.140
 tried that does not work that way 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.850
 In any case, I'll take that now 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.440
 go with my ring finger because so pure 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.600
 you are welcome with my middle finger 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.069
 so pure you can like the ring finger 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.110
 Of course, taking a lot is better 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.470
 because not so much pressure is on it 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.860
 and then I make such a place and here 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.860
 have an eye 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:09.329
 so stay just then stay 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:12.959
 I with the middle finger and swab the 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:14.760
 just so long here and if you 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.189
 the fragrance and if you do that with your finger 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.299
 do you also have that heat from 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:21.359
 fingering that can be much better 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.599
 does not have to fade even now 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.709
 the same will be perfect singh why 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:28.609
 and of course I do the same 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.609
 the other side 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.160
 and the surplus I still have here 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.190
 I have on my middle finger 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.910
 mostly here under it 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.739
 as a highlight the outstation you 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.750
 a little highlight and then take 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:57.880
 me from to about the concealer weapon 142 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.530
 should you really I would you 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.120
 recommend the is the great come on 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.160
 all corners where your finger is not 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.980
 So good is down here 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:12.280
 a lash line and here in this 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:15.239
 corner I forgot here too 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:20.650
 Concealer is important 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:23.050
 the same on the other side than 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:28.510
 next i have mccabe im here 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:30.040
 prime that's mine so that you me 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.050
 very happy to be under the eyes because that is 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.210
 a white powder that does not darken 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.110
 I still have a skin color but me 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.389
 I always have the feeling that that 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.960
 darkens that's why I take the tram 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:43.450
 and he macabre this fluffy one 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.880
 Of course, brushes can also do one 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.620
 take other fluffy brush or the 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.820
 at your finger could also, of course, 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:56.440
 take that is once so white here 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:05:01.650
 Powder and I think the brush here 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:05.850
 therein so take a lot to approximately 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.850
 and for the whole 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:15.680
 so now I'm full of brother 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:19.219
 maybe not so much and the whole 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:24.849
 we'll just give it over 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:24.849
 in any case consolidate everything again 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:34.630
 so that's about it much more 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.350
 I also do not say anything so I have 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.400
 really tried this out for a long time 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.720
 Honestly, I knew that before too 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.220
 not really concealer again 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.110
 Best keeps because this is always me 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.090
 everything slipped into the eyelid and indeed 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.400
 I had everything complete then 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.840
 the isle of xtreme sometimes on the 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.440
 lower lash line then I had here 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:56.410
 nice black lumps still and the 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.980
 fold inside really stylish sport 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:01.150
 it then definitely I can tell you that 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.150
 So I recommend that for a long time 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:08.980
 Tried and that really holds down 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:10.990
 place that was it already 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.340
 that was just such a quicktipp for 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.020
 I wish you one more 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.370
 wonderful day and follows up 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.110
