00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
not for the right reasons though well I

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.920 
not for the right reasons though well I
mean<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.549> have<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.909> imagine<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.509> he<00:02:03.719> has

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.300 
apologized a million times and I imagine
when<00:02:06.869> if<00:02:07.049> Bellator<00:02:07.590> was<00:02:07.710> interested<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.220> they

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
when if Bellator was interested and they

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.190 
when if Bellator was interested and they
probably<00:02:08.520> had<00:02:08.729> conversations<00:02:09.450> they<00:02:09.869> should

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
probably had conversations they should

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.960 
probably had conversations they should
have<00:02:10.349> had<00:02:10.500> conversations<00:02:10.800> with<00:02:11.340> got<00:02:11.640> this<00:02:11.790> guy

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
interesting he presents so many

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.170 
interesting he presents so many
interesting<00:02:22.950> problems<00:02:23.400> because<00:02:23.700> it's<00:02:24.000> like

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
interesting problems because it's like

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.089 
interesting problems because it's like
Ronda<00:02:24.510> Rousey<00:02:24.840> Ronda<00:02:25.140> Rousey<00:02:25.319> when<00:02:25.590> everybody

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
Ronda Rousey Ronda Rousey when everybody

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.740 
Ronda Rousey Ronda Rousey when everybody
expects<00:02:26.519> when<00:02:26.700> she<00:02:26.939> wins<00:02:27.150> she's<00:02:27.390> going<00:02:27.599> for

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
expects when she wins she's going for

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.140 
expects when she wins she's going for
the<00:02:27.840> armbar<00:02:28.140> who<00:02:28.739> smart<00:02:29.040> Polaris<00:02:29.489> wins<00:02:29.730> he

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
the armbar who smart Polaris wins he

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.699 
the armbar who smart Polaris wins he
goes<00:02:30.359> for<00:02:30.599> heel<00:02:30.780> hook<00:02:30.959> so<00:02:31.109> I<00:02:31.140> think<00:02:31.260> the

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
goes for heel hook so I think the

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:32.990 
goes for heel hook so I think the
difference<00:02:32.069> being<00:02:32.310> though<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:32.640> we<00:02:32.790> have<00:02:32.970> a

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
difference being though that we have a

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.789 
difference being though that we have a
pattern<00:02:33.540> here<00:02:33.750> with<00:02:33.870> toe<00:02:34.019> Harris<00:02:34.290> this<00:02:34.470> wasn't

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
pattern here with toe Harris this wasn't

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.920 
pattern here with toe Harris this wasn't
simply<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.129> mental<00:02:35.549> slip<00:02:35.849> and<00:02:36.060> I<00:02:36.480> can't<00:02:36.750> really

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
simply a mental slip and I can't really

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.349 
simply a mental slip and I can't really
blame<00:02:37.170> Bellator<00:02:37.799> here<00:02:38.099> who<00:02:38.459> this<00:02:38.730> guy<00:02:38.909> catches

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
blame Bellator here who this guy catches
