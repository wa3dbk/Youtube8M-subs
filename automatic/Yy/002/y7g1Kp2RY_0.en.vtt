00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.690
 you like this spark and you look at the 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.400
 series on game one so in french and 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.170
 for this localized version to exist 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.880
 it obviously took double and 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.859
 a dubbing that is provided by 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.330
 professional comedians who endorse 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.699
 often multiple roles by changing 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.730
 their voice among these comedians there was 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.189
 there is even corinne and christophe lemoine 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.760
 hello because she greets cartman how 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.410
 it's okay both actors have 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.980
 hosted the gameone teams in 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.980
 their recording studio 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.280
 when you see I'm sure you have 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.620
 China right now the little chaperones 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.360
 towards adapting seasons 15 and 16 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.309
 being currently underway because 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.150
 adaptation it is a good translation 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:55.559
 and dubbing is intimately related its very 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.659
 of adapters the translator first 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.949
 adapters so that it is synchronous 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.329
 and that it moves along with the 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.010
 mouth is obviously a work of 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.369
 actor to interpret what is playing 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.750
 on the screen revives a character 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.580
 fictional is to understand the 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.270
 subtleties approaching closer to his 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.850
 personality 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.200
 to make her own when we knew that 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.750
 christophe go do the tests on 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.780
 kart manon did not have the slightest doubt 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.690
 we knew he was going to be caught because 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.530
 that he has this kind of faculty to be 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.509
 a crap now explains 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.520
 how did you approach this beautiful role of 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.710
 cartman I do not know how it is 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.520
 a very character 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.010
 very lyrical Wagnerian sealed itself 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.110
 shakespearian sometimes the staff there 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.450
 flies off he becomes etc becomes 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.500
 remarkable but it is this part 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.400
 of humanity in which I recognize myself 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.170
 cartman is also known for 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.390
 coarse a trait that he shares with 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.649
 many other characters the trashy side 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.600
 is also the strength of the 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.280
 series a characteristic feature that 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.720
 kept in French according to certain 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.090
 rules I always tried to keep a 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.729
 childish language say that cartman is going 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.710
 to be able to say I'm coming home and 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.170
 treat his attic mother to this because 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.940
 that we can imagine that it was not 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.340
 frankly what does attic mean to 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.170
 soum street after 16 seasons no 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.790
 lassitude quite the contrary thanks to a 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.380
 long-time complicity the actors 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.940
 continues to enjoy and 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.290
 communicate to the public a real job 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.910
 of successfully equipped it is always a 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.650
 pleasure to make you this series there 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.880
 really it's very very very boring 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.380
 we must meet each other 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.590
 time because we support more what 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.180
 make 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.180
 yes but that's another daily
