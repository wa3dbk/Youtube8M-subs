00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:03.739
 the specific weight of a muscle 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.280
 you need 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.559
 a piece of chicken breast just a long narrow strip of muscle 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:15.599
 1 of distilled water 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.599
 in the kitchen salt 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:21.039
 a graduated cylinder 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:22.279
 Facebook 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:23.860
 an electric scale 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.860
 with sensitivity of at least zero, 1 gram 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.920
 a becker and is an agitator ie a glass rod 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.519

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.930
 Courier service 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.200
 the first part of the experiment canvas measures in the neck muscle films above 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.200
 the cretin who record the weight in grams 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.700
 take note of the measure 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.090
 kuoni graduated cylinder measures by immersion the muscle volume 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.690
 I record the measurement 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.890
 nothing 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.600
 calculates the specific weight of the muscle 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.920
 dividend intended for volume 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.920
 death note result 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.080
 the second part of the experiment and the verification of water bakers 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.080
 distilled

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.160
 Milan 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.060
 observes if the muscle floats 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:21.329
 After removing the muscle, the belly is emptied and prepared with distilled water 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.329
 a saturated solution of salt 

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:51.639
 I would say that the solution is saturated when you see that it is deposited on the bottom 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.039
 salt without melting anymore 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:57.039
 mixes with quotes 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:12.369
 immerse the muscle in the saturated solution and observe if it floats
