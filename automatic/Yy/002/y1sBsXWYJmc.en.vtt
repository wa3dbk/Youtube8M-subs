00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.560 
signature skill actually worse that pick
and<00:01:25.409> roll<00:01:25.560> my<00:01:25.860> stroke<00:01:26.220> boy<00:01:26.460> all<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.150> lights<00:01:27.330> up

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
and roll my stroke boy all the lights up

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.660 
and roll my stroke boy all the lights up
so<00:01:27.600> maybe<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.770> does<00:01:28.920> have<00:01:29.070> something<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.490> do

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
so maybe it does have something to do

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.370 
so maybe it does have something to do
but<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:29.970> was<00:01:30.360> there<00:01:30.509> William<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:31.049> was<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> nice

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
but I was there William that was a nice

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.170 
but I was there William that was a nice
pinch<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.829> here<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.040> beat<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.340> buzzer<00:01:32.939> get

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
pinch and here to beat the buzzer get

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.850 
pinch and here to beat the buzzer get
the<00:01:33.360> first<00:01:33.570> quarter<00:01:34.020> they<00:01:34.320> give<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.650> Chris

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
the first quarter they give the Chris

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.370 
the first quarter they give the Chris
Johnson<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.549> he<00:01:35.909> gets<00:01:36.150> fouled<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.900> goes<00:01:37.259> to

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
Johnson and he gets fouled and goes to

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.660 
Johnson and he gets fouled and goes to
the<00:01:37.470> free-throw<00:01:37.680> line<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.040> think<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.369> only<00:01:38.460> made

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
the free-throw line I think I only made

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.340 
the free-throw line I think I only made
one<00:01:38.700> but<00:01:39.150> it's<00:01:39.750> better<00:01:39.869> than<00:01:39.930> nothing<00:01:40.290> right

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
one but it's better than nothing right

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.230 
one but it's better than nothing right
and<00:01:40.650> here<00:01:40.979> we<00:01:41.070> give<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.369> Corey<00:01:41.640> Brewer<00:01:41.909> Corey

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
and here we give the Corey Brewer Corey

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.870 
and here we give the Corey Brewer Corey
Brewer<00:01:42.450> gets<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.930> go<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:44.250> know<00:01:44.399> once

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880
