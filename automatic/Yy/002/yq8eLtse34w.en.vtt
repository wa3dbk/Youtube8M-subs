00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:15.969
 It is so that we believe in my opinion 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:18.340
 interesting party was i played one 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.990
 opening week pretty well also know of 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.450
 and I was just curious how 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.970
 he how he plays people during the day 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.850
 internal d4 he is certainly always playing 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.310
 few success and to c4 has that 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.679
 all kinds of choices in neighborhood is a player 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.050
 which is a variation on the queen is against 

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:37.780
 I have also called Budapest he played 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.699
 also plays systems with but with d66 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.800
 does this have it let them there 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.960
 not played but it used to be a lot of it 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.269
 quite often that the Indian ball finally 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.440
 a chess b4 which is I 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:49.449
 accidentally 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.620
 prepared but it is a statement that 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.749
 I know pretty well 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.579
 but so can very quickly to 

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:57.309
 saying an original 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:01.179
 position in which we are the party 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.120
 had to play really sharp and on it 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:04.879
 end 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.990
 it was still 5 early with 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.549
 repeated 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.080
 yes i got him to give me picks 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.360
 because I have no clear advantage for that 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.610
 ride saw I saw that it was possible 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.610
 to maintain any small benefit 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.800
 but the problem was that maintaining me 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.600
 didn't see the way to really do that 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.430
 perpetuate 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.220
 okay here mentions a lot of openings 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.860
 I assume that you might 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.390
 very serious fullness or of course 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.670
 have been seriously prepared 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.070
 Your grandmother was a particularly interesting one 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.690
 play and has a very extensive one too 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.990
 mix zero point wide 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.729
 I am in all sorts of yes unusual 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.560
 deepening openings so that today we have one 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.619
 plate I got was actually there 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.369
 more a kind of fairly normal opening that 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.750
 still became interesting yes 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:54.050
 of course enormous experience 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.880
 it is about two kampala shorter 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.350
 do you think you still use it there 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.789
 can make you feel that way 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.110
 maybe have a slight advantage 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:01.909
 in this match 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.420
 well she would n't say that about it 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:08.750
 sometimes thirty years younger than me 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.150
 him nearly 30 years young and that's that 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.010
 also counts from menen matches 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.790
 it's not always that match 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.379
 experience that it really benefits you 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.989
 it is true that you give up human 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:24.230
 slowly in a situation like this 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.060
 no decision to take the place also 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.530
 to prevent you from giving up my 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.599
 making mistakes that is of course also 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:35.120
 very important and find the match and yes 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.770
 you like it first you have you again 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.349
 evening it will never be closed after 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.670
 few years that you might agree again 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.020
 likes to play one with you 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.700
 yes women draw such an interesting 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.220
 opponent this is really one 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.830
 challenge for it is a very good idea 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.290
 these and matches we used to have the 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.690
 I play canoe with his wife CMS 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.000
 the top players now have him 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.530
 we two matches all interesting 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.330
 player for virus exalted several 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.860
 generations and also an open one 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.340
 tournament that is really very beautiful 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.340
 taken along
