00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 yes 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.240
 My name is IvÃ¡n Acuna and this is the tip 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.190
 of the week I wanted to talk to you a little 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.260
 about salt 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.180
 they asked me a lot about the group 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.730
 about what kind of greeting for the tank 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.930
 about what type of salty and what is the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.840
 better what is the worst and good I wanted today 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.760
 in the tip of the week clarify certain 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.250
 certain details about the type of salt 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.410
 which is used in the tank and what we see 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.110
 the one to use the first thing that we should 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.239
 understand is that basically there are two 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.120
 types of sauces for only fish and salt 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.860
 for corals if we have are the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.440
 fish we can choose any of 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.690
 these of these salt brands that are 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.659
 only for fish it is very simple the only thing 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.489
 we must ensure is after 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:58.019
 let's make the mixture with our water as 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.629
 If I use the water that you use to 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.300
 your tanks make sure it's free to 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.239
 phosphates 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.180
 nitrites and nitrates and ammonium simply 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.510
 with our test 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.310
 of levels make them measure the levels 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.120
 waters to make sure we're not 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.790
 introducing anything to the tank that is not 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.610
 good for them and good when we have 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.610
 corals is good to choose a salt and a 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.290
 little more expensive a salt that brings 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.570
 already then a little more calcium 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.220
 magnesium and all those elements that 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.920
 we need us in our tanks 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.090
 so that corals can be happy 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.280
 that's why I tell him it's so 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.670
 important that 10 percent change 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:43.120
 weekly water since only not only 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.910
 let's keep the water cool not only 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.710
 let's try to lower the levels that 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.830
 can be raised as the levels of 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.600
 nitrates but also then we go 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.640
 to replenish all that calcium all that 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.860
 magnesium that our corals are 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.810
 consuming of course it depends on 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.140
 the large number of corals that we can 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.310
 have and the good demand for calcium 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.530
 with the tank already after then 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.470
 we can start thinking if we are going to 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.170
 edit to edit or not any kind of 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.940
 elements such as calcium magnesium carb 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.900
 be that later I will go making videos 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.100
 explaining that kind of thing good friend 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.510
 this has been the tip of the week 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.250
 remember to go to the facebook marine aquarium 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.470
 my personal page marine aquarium tv in 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.950
 facebook will also have in the 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.079
 description of the video my personal page 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.079
 which good I 'm always helping 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.750
 always trying to help all 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:38.300
 people 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.940
 subscribe to the channel if you subscribe each 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.890
 more and more people the video comes out more 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.170
 reach more people and so we continue 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.410
 growing in the group that we are already two 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.360
 one thousand two thousand three hundred two thousand 400 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.340
 people and really good the group has 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.990
 reached a fairly pretty level 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.390
 great I'm quite happy with the 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:01.330
 results and good friends remember 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.670
 take care of your aquariums take care 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.130
 co-responsibilities enjoy the but 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.840
 always remember that they are living beings and 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.270
 we must take care of them 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.750
 this was marine aquarium tb with the tip of 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.750
 week
