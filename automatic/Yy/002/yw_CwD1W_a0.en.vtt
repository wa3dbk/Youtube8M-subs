00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.390
 the title accor made with me it's a pretty special job to be wrong 

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:12.339
 we are in front of them but it happened the team was stormy summer 

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:15.569
 this walk all image 

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:17.249
 at the evening of the st 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:19.130
 soft 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.130
 2 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:29.909
 at this point but where I'm pretty square to the one that existed 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:33.800
 with the future of species 2 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.080
 as for traces 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.430
 with each step between them what is on stage and six virtual pages like the 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.430
 thing 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.310
 when we left to speak and it is unfortunately every article that we 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.160
 interested 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.160
 and we work mostly to conclude still working with performance 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.390
 or dancers of the actors of the room but we get along with the cinema 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.480
 so yes maybe it's me assad and it's doing something wrong 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.230
 not totally satisfied it may be a little bit there it is at 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.230
 besides expected then why talk about them 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.740
 how is my master 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.329
 I'll put you in life in accidents bpa I always think years 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.130
 while sex and the city ironing tea 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.700
 these excesses of different disciplines that relates 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.980
 because you will see an intense show with that 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.350
 a call that said a few years when you have this morning in series and 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.700
 we stick to it more customers what is clear h and more and more we see 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.480
 videos 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.220
 my performance unlike the dancers' movement movements 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.330
 they regretted the lack of progress on sex and the golden age 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.550
 sometimes the weekend edition of the 7th and enters to create a new form 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.820
 wing 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.370
 the show begins 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.380
 do you suspect that action repair timeframes continue 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.380
 Mexico 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.140

 at this date 6 years it is itf 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:19.469
 disappear borders borders between them between countries the 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:23.589
 boundaries between genders and boundaries between different types 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:24.109
