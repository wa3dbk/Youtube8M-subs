available maybe he would be able to get

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.609 
available maybe he would be able to get
some<00:01:20.310> more<00:01:20.490> builders<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.299> or<00:01:21.930> maybe<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.500> was

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
some more builders and or maybe it was

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.810 
some more builders and or maybe it was
just<00:01:22.650> build<00:01:23.100> as<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.580> um<00:01:25.400> it<00:01:26.400> was<00:01:26.549> just

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
just build as that um it was just

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.130 
just build as that um it was just
builders<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.360> hadn't<00:01:27.630> actually<00:01:27.750> been<00:01:27.960> on

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
builders that hadn't actually been on

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.069 
builders that hadn't actually been on
serviette<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:28.890> thought<00:01:29.100> hey<00:01:29.820> why<00:01:30.090> not<00:01:30.119> if<00:01:30.630> he

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
serviette so I thought hey why not if he

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.990 
serviette so I thought hey why not if he
if<00:01:31.259> he<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.530> going<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.860> go<00:01:32.009> for<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.549> few<00:01:32.790> more

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
if he is going to go for a few more

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.330 
if he is going to go for a few more
builders<00:01:33.479> then<00:01:34.170> I'm<00:01:34.560> gonna<00:01:34.680> make<00:01:34.979> an<00:01:35.189> effort

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340
