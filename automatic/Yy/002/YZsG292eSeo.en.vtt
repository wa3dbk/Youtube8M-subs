you use need to have powered from an

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.119 
you use need to have powered from an
amplifier<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:35.130> order<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.489> work<00:00:36.800> most<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.950> the

amplifier in order to work most of the

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.549 
amplifier in order to work most of the
time<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.520> can<00:00:38.670> find<00:00:38.989> adequate<00:00:39.989> near-field

time you can find adequate near-field
monitors<00:00:41.129> for<00:00:41.670> use<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.239> home<00:00:42.390> recording

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
monitors for use in a home recording

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.700 
monitors for use in a home recording
situation<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:44.750> are<00:00:45.750> powered<00:00:46.260> they<00:00:46.559> have

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
situation that are powered they have

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.380 
situation that are powered they have
their<00:00:46.860> own<00:00:46.890> amplifiers<00:00:47.489> built<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.300> will

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
their own amplifiers built in that will

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.350 
their own amplifiers built in that will
save<00:00:48.600> space<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.800> also<00:00:49.829> will<00:00:50.789> make<00:00:50.850> the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
save space and that also will make the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.389 
save space and that also will make the
consistency<00:00:52.289> better<00:00:52.559> between<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:53.039> speakers

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
consistency better between the speakers

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.479 
consistency better between the speakers
because<00:00:53.699> they<00:00:53.820> have<00:00:53.969> their<00:00:54.120> own<00:00:54.149> amplifier

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
because they have their own amplifier

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.160 
because they have their own amplifier
the<00:00:56.489> other<00:00:56.610> thing<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.969> consider<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.750> the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
the other thing to consider is the

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.779 
the other thing to consider is the
frequency<00:00:58.620> range<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.070> speakers<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.489> you

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
frequency range of the speakers that you

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.389 
frequency range of the speakers that you
use<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.660> frequency<00:01:01.050> range<00:01:01.500> can<00:01:01.829> be<00:01:01.859> anywhere

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
use the frequency range can be anywhere

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.969 
use the frequency range can be anywhere
from<00:01:02.460> five<00:01:02.820> Hertz<00:01:03.090> on<00:01:03.329> up<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.629> 25,000<00:01:04.559> Hertz<00:01:04.710> or

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
from five Hertz on up to 25,000 Hertz or

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.399 
from five Hertz on up to 25,000 Hertz or
higher<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:06.500> it's<00:01:07.500> really<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.400> best<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:09.060> find

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
higher and it's really the best to find

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.289 
higher and it's really the best to find
speaker<00:01:10.409> setup<00:01:10.770> or<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.010> headphone<00:01:11.460> setup<00:01:11.909> that

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
your monitor is totally up to you keep

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.789 
your monitor is totally up to you keep
in<00:02:00.210> mind<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.750> smaller<00:02:01.140> monitors

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
in mind that the smaller monitors

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.819 
in mind that the smaller monitors
sometimes<00:02:02.369> have<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:03.210> limited<00:02:04.200> base<00:02:04.439> response

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
sometimes have a limited base response

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.889 
sometimes have a limited base response
because<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.579> size<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:06.000> their<00:02:06.180> woofer<00:02:06.719> cone

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
because of the size of their woofer cone

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.320 
because of the size of their woofer cone
and<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:07.920> if<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.220> can<00:02:08.369> find<00:02:08.700> one<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:08.970> will

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
and so if you can find one that will

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.999 
and so if you can find one that will
give<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.810> kind<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.140> bass<00:02:10.289> response<00:02:10.530> that
