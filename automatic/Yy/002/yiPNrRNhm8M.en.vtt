because<00:02:16.180> our<00:02:16.510> official<00:02:17.500> release<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.340> home

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
because our official release the home

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.839 
because our official release the home
buying<00:02:18.730> tools<00:02:19.140> because<00:02:20.140> let's<00:02:21.069> just<00:02:21.280> see<00:02:21.790> how

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
buying tools because let's just see how

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.150 
buying tools because let's just see how
much<00:02:22.090> power<00:02:22.330> on<00:02:22.840> order<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.319> be<00:02:23.410> super<00:02:23.770> powerful

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
much power on order to be super powerful

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.699 
much power on order to be super powerful
but<00:02:24.580> that's<00:02:24.790> just<00:02:24.970> not<00:02:25.090> even<00:02:25.209> his<00:02:25.720> power<00:02:25.989> so<00:02:26.440> I

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
but that's just not even his power so I

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.410 
but that's just not even his power so I
think<00:02:27.400> he<00:02:27.520> knows<00:02:27.670> that<00:02:27.700> I<00:02:27.910> don't<00:02:28.030> think<00:02:28.330> he's

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
think he knows that I don't think he's

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.199 
think he knows that I don't think he's
going<00:02:28.630> to<00:02:28.690> do<00:02:28.870> it<00:02:28.900> I<00:02:29.260> could<00:02:30.220> do<00:02:30.519> although<00:02:30.730> it

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
going to do it I could do although it

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.690 
going to do it I could do although it
wouldn't<00:02:31.390> be<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.660> first<00:02:31.810> time<00:02:32.140> I<00:02:32.440> think<00:02:33.430> them

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
wouldn't be the first time I think them

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.300 
wouldn't be the first time I think them
I<00:02:34.000> don't<00:02:34.930> know<00:02:35.019> were<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.650> missing<00:02:35.860> but<00:02:36.280> I

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
I don't know were you missing but I

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.430 
I don't know were you missing but I
think<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.760> whole<00:02:37.480> thing<00:02:37.510> no<00:02:38.019> it's

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
think the whole thing no it's

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.290 
think the whole thing no it's
kind<00:02:38.709> of<00:02:38.769> an<00:02:38.890> act<00:02:39.160> like<00:02:39.459> I<00:02:39.640> feel<00:02:39.970> like<00:02:40.230> he<00:02:42.300> had

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
kind of an act like I feel like he had

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.390 
kind of an act like I feel like he had
Itachi's<00:02:43.840> eyes<00:02:44.050> and<00:02:44.380> I<00:02:44.440> feel<00:02:44.650> like<00:02:44.680> they're

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
Itachi's eyes and I feel like they're

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.280 
Itachi's eyes and I feel like they're
eventually<00:02:45.819> he's<00:02:46.420> going<00:02:46.600> to<00:02:46.690> fight<00:02:46.930> with

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
eventually he's going to fight with

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.470 
eventually he's going to fight with
Naruto<00:02:47.950> that's<00:02:48.310> just<00:02:48.519> and<00:02:49.000> I<00:02:49.030> just<00:02:49.269> want<00:02:49.420> to

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
it is Sasuke is kind of I don't know if

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.630 
it is Sasuke is kind of I don't know if
he's<00:03:16.390> really<00:03:16.569> faded<00:03:16.930> with<00:03:17.500> Akatsuki<00:03:18.250> anymore

but<00:03:19.510> Sasuke<00:03:20.079> killed<00:03:20.380> Orochimaru<00:03:21.010> now<00:03:21.970> Caputo

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
but Sasuke killed Orochimaru now Caputo

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.470 
but Sasuke killed Orochimaru now Caputo
is<00:03:22.690> Orochimaru<00:03:23.200> so<00:03:23.769> I<00:03:23.859> don't<00:03:24.070> think<00:03:24.489> Caputo<00:03:25.450> is

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
is Orochimaru so I don't think Caputo is

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.020 
is Orochimaru so I don't think Caputo is
