00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:06.009
 there are very good everyone here I bring you 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:09.549
 a new video and this time it's a seed 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:13.119
 of minecraft for a general in 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:17.500
 good world generation is how to see 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:20.060
 the title is flat plain flat and it's 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.960
 the seed called 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.690
 turn of the best I do not know how I kept on 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.480
 English but 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.160
 I'm not going to write it 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.200
 excuse me if I go a little slow but it is that 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.200
 I do not have a keyboard 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.940
 turns 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.940
 two 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.980
 while I'm writing it 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.600
 a subscriber told me and told me that 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:06.610
 I made a series where I am 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.890
 downloading several maps and this one what 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.909
 upload this link where you are going to download 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.100
 and do a review of the map 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.249
 I'll be seeing it because sometimes it's 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.159
 very difficult to find maps but also 

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:22.060
 I'm going to make maps with some maps friends 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.530
 of clear adventure 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:29.950
 Well, this is why we continue, it is 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.579
 give so I think it's going to create 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.579
 world 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:43.050
 and then we wait for him to believe 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.140
 the world is regenerated 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.680
 forgiveness is being generated 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.340
 well 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.690
 Well, if this is also going to be 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.360
 asking for help to make maps of 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.990
 adventures if you want to help leave your 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.000
 gamertag in the in a comment 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.800
 in gamertag and I will add because 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.800
 I still have space in friends 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.550
 and I'm planning to make a map of 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:16.380
 adventures but of course also 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:19.900
 we will rise of other other types as of 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.239
 well of several things for example 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.480
 like this is a seed I'm also going to 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:29.530
 upload a map of extra flat 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:32.680
 Well, several things, as you can see, 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.670
 here we are going to walk a bit because the 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.959
 truth we say in a very area 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.640
 very this well as he explained very full 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.730
 of capsules because there are several fields 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.850
 for pixel art 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:51.880
 and this is tomas look there are also many 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:57.280
 with natives and look for example here 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:03:00.010
 this map is more this requested by a 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.160
 friend who wanted to say that if I 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.280
 he asked if he had a seed or a 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.220
 map where this plane to make pixel 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.970
 art and well here I bring you one that 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.340
 be there is a little flat young is the 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.400
 puntito is the only one where there is orange on 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.680
 orange map that sand on the map but 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.230
 more here is more and also has a 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:27.520
 little bit of mountains and a few areas of 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.290
 where there are many trees to fell and 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.960
 also very good natural things for 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.060
 example here is 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:38.209
 very good natural games 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.099
 look what part of this part is fine 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.160
 flat there are the coordinates so that 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:47.680
 they see it and in the paw mind can see 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:50.469
 those extra-flat parts 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.739
 look at that door there is a part like 

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:52.739
 Gray 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:03.620
 and it 's like from this part where there's 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:06.800
 between mountain and mountain because as 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:10.550
 here something like that is destroyed 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.440
 it serves as to pixelate it is thus flat and 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.770
 Well I hope you liked this 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.709
 seed do not forget to comment like and 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.260
 favorites and well see you 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.020
 troll duckling 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.500
 and because we are good until the next 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.500
