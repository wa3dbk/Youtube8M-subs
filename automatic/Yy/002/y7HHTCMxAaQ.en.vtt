as we'll demonstrate a couple of
observations<00:00:37.290> when<00:00:37.559> choosing<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:38.160> grinder<00:00:38.610> a

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
observations when choosing a grinder a

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.720 
observations when choosing a grinder a
lot<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.780> matter<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.280> personal<00:00:41.280> taste

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
lot of it is a matter of personal taste

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.700 
lot of it is a matter of personal taste
or<00:00:42.000> personal<00:00:42.390> preference<00:00:42.840> how<00:00:43.230> does<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.530> tool

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
or personal preference how does the tool

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.500 
or personal preference how does the tool
feel<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.160> your<00:00:44.280> hand<00:00:44.520> but<00:00:45.059> some<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.420> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
feel in your hand but some of the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.529 
feel in your hand but some of the
specifics<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.260> look<00:00:46.559> for<00:00:46.800> are<00:00:47.640> things

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
specifics that I look for are things

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.209 
specifics that I look for are things
like<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.110> rpm<00:00:49.590> speed

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
like the rpm speed

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.610 
like the rpm speed
I<00:00:50.250> want<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.820> very<00:00:51.059> high<00:00:51.420> rpm<00:00:52.020> generally

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
I want a very high rpm generally

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.709 
I want a very high rpm generally
somewhere<00:00:52.890> around<00:00:52.980> 10,000<00:00:53.910> rpm<00:00:54.360> when<00:00:54.629> I'm

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
somewhere around 10,000 rpm when I'm

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.990 
somewhere around 10,000 rpm when I'm
choosing<00:00:54.960> my<00:00:55.289> grinder<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.309> high<00:00:56.489> rpm

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
choosing my grinder and the high rpm

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.389 
choosing my grinder and the high rpm
speed<00:00:57.329> what<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.960> does<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.770> smoothes<00:00:59.190> out

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
speed what that does is it smoothes out

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.639 
speed what that does is it smoothes out
the<00:00:59.460> blade<00:00:59.879> I've<00:01:00.149> found<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.109> slower<00:01:01.410> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
the blade I've found that the slower the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.979 
the blade I've found that the slower the
speed<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.850> blade<00:01:03.059> has<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.270> tendency<00:01:03.809> to

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
speed the the blade has a tendency to

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.020 
speed the the blade has a tendency to
wobble<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:05.430> could<00:01:05.580> be<00:01:05.670> troublesome

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
wobble and that could be troublesome

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.340 
wobble and that could be troublesome
especially<00:01:06.570> if<00:01:06.659> you're<00:01:06.750> trying<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.140> create

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
especially if you're trying to create

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.440 
especially if you're trying to create
some<00:01:07.560> high-end<00:01:08.130> decorative<00:01:08.340> cuts<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.270> like

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
some high-end decorative cuts so I like

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.620 
some high-end decorative cuts so I like
a<00:01:09.479> very<00:01:09.659> high<00:01:09.930> rpm<00:01:10.439> blade<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:11.040> addition<00:01:11.970> again

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
a very high rpm blade in addition again

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.800 
a very high rpm blade in addition again
it's<00:01:13.110> really<00:01:13.680> up<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.250> individual<00:01:14.939> on<00:01:15.180> the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
it's really up to the individual on the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.899 
it's really up to the individual on the
start<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.470> stop<00:01:16.530> button<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.549> button<00:01:17.880> for

example<00:01:18.119> locks<00:01:19.020> into<00:01:19.290> place<00:01:19.560> as<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.130> can<00:01:20.310> see

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
example locks into place as you can see

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.370 
example locks into place as you can see
here<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.939> turn<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.119> off<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.869> simply<00:01:22.080> go

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
here and to turn it off you simply go

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.649 
here and to turn it off you simply go
like<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:23.009> like<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.880> lock<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.270> into<00:01:24.390> place

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
like that I like to lock it into place

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.960 
like that I like to lock it into place
simply<00:01:25.409> because<00:01:25.530> your<00:01:26.130> hand<00:01:26.369> would<00:01:26.520> get<00:01:26.670> tired

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
simply because your hand would get tired

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.460 
simply because your hand would get tired
if<00:01:27.240> you're<00:01:27.330> trying<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.659> hold<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.080> down<00:01:28.259> into

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
if you're trying to hold it down into

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.380 
if you're trying to hold it down into
place<00:01:28.740> during<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.490> duration<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> saw

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
place during the duration of the saw

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.620 
place during the duration of the saw
cuts<00:01:31.640> will<00:01:32.640> show<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:33.030> variety<00:01:33.240> of

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
cuts will show you a variety of

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.600 
cuts will show you a variety of
different<00:01:33.720> blades<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.740> can<00:01:35.280> attach<00:01:35.579> to

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
different blades that can attach to

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.399 
different blades that can attach to
these<00:01:35.970> blades<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.780> actually<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> blade

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
these blades this is actually a blade

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.920 
these blades this is actually a blade
that<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.590> developed<00:01:38.189> had<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.180> lot<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.750> our

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
that I developed had a lot of our

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.270 
that I developed had a lot of our
students<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.409> have<00:01:40.530> asked<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.860> question

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
students that have asked the question

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.560 
students that have asked the question
why<00:01:41.700> don't<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:41.909> come<00:01:42.060> up<00:01:42.150> with<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.329> two<00:01:42.540> inch

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
why don't you come up with a two inch

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.899 
why don't you come up with a two inch
blade<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.259> finally<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.920> came<00:01:44.490> up<00:01:44.610> with<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.790> two

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
blade so finally I came up with a two

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.179 
blade so finally I came up with a two
inch<00:01:44.939> blade<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.570> it'll<00:01:46.350> attach<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:47.009> most

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
inch blade and it'll attach to most

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.450 
inch blade and it'll attach to most
standard<00:01:48.030> arbors<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:48.930> on<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.799> grinder<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.310> has

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
standard arbors so on the grinder it has

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.670 
standard arbors so on the grinder it has
a<00:01:50.490> lock<00:01:50.790> position<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.960> can<00:01:51.990> see<00:01:52.439> it

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
a lock position and you can see it

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.630 
a lock position and you can see it
simply<00:01:53.250> threads<00:01:53.579> off<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:55.170> case<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.740> once

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640
