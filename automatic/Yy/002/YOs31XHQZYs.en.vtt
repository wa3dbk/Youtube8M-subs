 chalk that is not going to go hard all the 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.219
 day you just have to keep watching 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.619
 good girls let's start on one side 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:53.689
 clean as a strider and let's start 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.140
 with the first one on my face I'm using 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:02:00.230
 the make up forever and step 1 to 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.260
 fill the pores and all that 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.930
 in the face and I go to two new people 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:11.250
 in the night and he managed it safely the two 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:14.730
 They are hard 24 hours all day 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.730
 and with a 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.250
 the product on my face so that it 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:25.550
 absorb on the skin and see a little 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.990
 more flowers the block 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.590
 that what they do to you by passing it by 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.590
 the whole face 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.250
 and after that what I do is that 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.800
 applied the second that would be the night 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.530
 it's in it gives me a little bit of mate 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.750
 coverage on the face and with another type 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.660
 of gross to what I do is blur the 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.090
 base all over the face after I do 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.210
 this step I put the seris king of gold 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.200
 and I do my be what the spray dries 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.090
 in the face 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.040
 after doing the eyebrows I will be 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.010
 using a concealer 's correctors 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.260
 from the next and with a brush to confirm 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.989
 I will be applying less in below 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.480
 the eyes to cover all the dark circles and 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.970
 all the purple color that I have below 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.730
 the men 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.680
 and with my finger what I'm going to do is 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.630
 ensure mind between and incorporate in 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.310
 face and with a little dust I'm going to 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.550
 to be wearing it on the face so that 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.520
 look at all the fat and especially 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.500
 can accept the very much consider 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:34.010
 better than the proofreader here I am using 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.620
 the pay back and drive by pass marks and what 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.650
 that applying in a triangular way to 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.260
 attract lighting to the face I have the 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.760
 lighting video and outline that I made 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.680
 and I'm going to leave it down for those who 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.680
 you can see so they can see how I do 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.080
 it helps that I can blur it 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.160
 pretty well the area where I want 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.440
 bring lighting to the bed 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.900
 after that what I do is that I'm going to 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.360
 be using the oil 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.250
 here and with those two colors of powder 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.140
 first I go 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.500
 a little yellowish to cover 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.300
 any bluish or purple color in the 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.340
 eyes and with the powder what I'm going to do 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.319
 is to brush the concealer and to know a 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.310
 little bit more lighting at 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.310
 and with the vase 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.200
 contour 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.270
 and after that like in summer 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.270
 and what it is 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.550
 and now what I'm doing is 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.040
 go 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.480
 and what I do is blur what now 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.100
 may be using a bronzer is 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.100
 sensational and that 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.900
 wants 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:55.979
 my favorite palette 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.930
 as with blues blues and stop losses are 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.300
 they stay all day or I love using it 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.509
 and then I'll use a number and here 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.130

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:08.720
 important so that your stay stays 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.720
