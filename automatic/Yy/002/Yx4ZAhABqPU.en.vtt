this day quite frequently last but not

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.560 
this day quite frequently last but not
least<00:04:03.540> is<00:04:03.840> licensing<00:04:04.739> and<00:04:05.209> customization<00:04:06.209> so

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
least is licensing and customization so

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.590 
least is licensing and customization so
the<00:04:07.380> man<00:04:07.620> of<00:04:07.799> Licensing<00:04:08.790> in<00:04:08.940> these<00:04:09.120> two<00:04:09.329> games

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
the man of Licensing in these two games

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.009 
the man of Licensing in these two games
is<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:10.140> most<00:04:10.350> we've<00:04:10.530> ever<00:04:10.680> had<00:04:10.920> it<00:04:11.280> was<00:04:11.459> great

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
is the most we've ever had it was great

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.750 
is the most we've ever had it was great
rugby<00:04:13.019> challenge<00:04:13.230> to<00:04:13.590> got<00:04:14.010> their<00:04:14.220> hands<00:04:14.640> and

rugby challenge to got their hands and
so<00:04:14.970> much<00:04:15.180> licensing<00:04:15.900> but<00:04:16.109> they<00:04:16.229> just<00:04:16.440> didn't

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
so much licensing but they just didn't

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.289 
so much licensing but they just didn't
have<00:04:16.709> all<00:04:17.039> the<00:04:17.190> international<00:04:17.820> teams<00:04:18.030> but<00:04:18.239> I

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
have all the international teams but I

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.899 
have all the international teams but I
know<00:04:18.419> they<00:04:18.660> had<00:04:18.750> more<00:04:19.190> domestic<00:04:20.190> league<00:04:20.430> and

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:20.909 
know they had more domestic league and

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:24.050 
know they had more domestic league and
rugby<00:04:20.940> o8<00:04:21.630> but<00:04:22.590> which<00:04:23.340> wins

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
rugby o8 but which wins

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.760 
rugby o8 but which wins
depending<00:04:24.659> on<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.840> licensing

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
depending on the licensing

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.860 
depending on the licensing
you've<00:04:25.889> had<00:04:26.069> the<00:04:26.310> better<00:04:26.460> licensing<00:04:27.060> in<00:04:27.330> my

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
you've had the better licensing in my

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.520 
you've had the better licensing in my
opinion<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:28.800> better<00:04:29.120> licensing<00:04:30.120> overall<00:04:30.900> was

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
opinion the better licensing overall was

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.400 
opinion the better licensing overall was
rug<00:04:32.160> boa<00:04:32.460> on<00:04:32.789> the<00:04:33.210> customization<00:04:34.020> side<00:04:34.259> of

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:36.569
