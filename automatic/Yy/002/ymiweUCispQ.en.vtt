00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 Good day to all my name is 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.240
 blohin peter i'm glad to welcome you 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.340
 on your channel 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.820
 I want to note that it is not easy 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.230
 only breakfast but also tuning 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.599
 although perhaps Iâ€™m not even right 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.869
 put it in general, then even no 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.430
 tuning and just a competent assembly part I 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.510
 I want to draw your attention to some 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:28.890
 good engine assembly aspects 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:32.309
 so that we normally work in 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.809
 first at the beginning of the purge channel 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.860
 which starts in carter should not 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.320
 to be here are such jambs from casting 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.910
 but specifically my case I will leave them 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.120
 because skill is ok sharoshka 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:52.590
 to remove them then such an aspect 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:55.410
 we put on the hairpin case we see that 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.629
 experience dangles on heels ideally 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.160
 this should not be too but for this 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.719
 need to make new studs with 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.609
 other diameter that due to the fact that 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.890
 studs 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:07.380
 girls cinema seed is at 8 that is 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.900
 the factories do so that it is guaranteed 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.760
 ideally, he should go there 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.770
 should so hang out everything he should in 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.390
 one position to go but it's me too 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.049
 redid now I will not be on my own 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.790
 engines too hemorrhoids and that's what i 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.590
 take care let's look at 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:32.570
 purge channel and here we have a cylinder 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.570
 is approximately in the middle position 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:39.060
 purge we see ledges 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.729
 here we have for example channel 5 scriber 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.680
 rests 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.189
 but it's not so bad 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.189
 half a millimeter 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:56.149
 right here 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.149
 a chair is much more than a millimeter 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.070
 mods the other side 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.319
 the situation is not so bad because here u 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.519
 us concessions on the part of aluminum 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:18.709
 chain mail and he is very small also 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:23.010
 visible ledge here here is aluminum 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:29.370
 cast iron abuts further than aluminum here 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:32.880
 here, too, and here at the soup such 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:36.900
 shoals we should not be 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.980
 I will now fix a drill with 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.849
 diamond nozzle 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.760
 small so what else do they do here 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:47.700
 cylinder for example here this partition 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.650
 which divides our channels into very 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:56.310
 thick it can also be made thinner 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:59.450
 then this transition can be done 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.450
 also sharper 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:10.440
 here also this one can 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:15.000
 remove try so well what else are we 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:23.100
 I don't like doing this here anymore 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 light here here in the channel too 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:32.299
 here is such here also desirable 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.340
 choose but probably will not work 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.290
 presentations on a little there not what 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.670
 the tool is not particularly climb well though 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:44.579
 would need to remove cartoons in the bypass 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.090
 channels and refine this jumper than 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.090
 I'll do it now 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:19.310
 unambiguous slag cylinder that is something 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.109
 in general it is but it is even somewhat 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.850
 some kind of advantage because 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:27.080
 you can drink you do not mind it 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:34.220
 zamorochilsya in measure his opportunity 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:36.790
 bormashki then let's see here at 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:41.030
 channel inlet cylinder 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:49.490
 the grant has become more acute these jumpers 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:52.430
 I also did more sharp so 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:55.010
 corrected this channel in fact I corrected 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.919
 how all the channels had to 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:00.680
 toxic pass cutter because casting was 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:07.610
 very very rough so how could he 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:09.500
 so delivered so did here here 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:15.400
 jumper also made a thin 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:17.960
 walked the whole channel as best I could 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:22.840
 a little he brushed the issue 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:26.380
 more from dirt and scrubbed from soot 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.380
 chamfered 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.200
 small prominent face 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.169
 Channel 5 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:46.510
 there finished 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:52.400
 more or less, the output is normally done 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:56.900
 apart from each cat also corrected course 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:06:01.669
 work is so-so but obviously did not become worse 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:03.470
 there is more or less we led the cylinder in 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:08.450
 order though of course 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:11.650
 blowing another channel of the curve inside too he 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.650
 treated incomprehensible 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:19.970
 all kind of curved cylinder i'm not a fountain 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:23.030
 and he will not work with him 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:25.010
 OK, but maybe I'll get it later. 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.710
 the head of the machine can be 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:33.860
 fix the channel and everything is fine to do 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:35.650
 it's already better than it will work 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:44.780
 some fun 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:46.130
 naturally selected all in Africa in a skid 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:50.840
 cylinder with 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:54.560
 where the cylinder fit in with the crankcase now 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:07:00.940
 there is no ledge here by 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:06.440
 cast iron, he also matches perfectly 5 channel 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:13.000
 also there is no other ledge 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:13.000
 crankcase halves all in principle also 

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:40.130
 too give way almost absent there 

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:47.200
 cylinder 5 dodging error limits 

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:49.840
 the channel is the same all right here 

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:54.430
 Perhaps on this revision finished 

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.430
 enough let ride for now bye
