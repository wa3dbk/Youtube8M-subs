basically<00:00:28.410> just<00:00:29.099> quickly<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.390> bought<00:00:30.779> myself<00:00:31.610> a

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
basically just quickly I bought myself a

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.560 
basically just quickly I bought myself a
scale<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.710> weigh<00:00:35.370> my<00:00:35.520> beyblades<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.360> it's
