00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 and today we will talk about the wolf dog 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.839
 Czechoslovakian then what is an animal 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.019
 of the forest a pet a 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.090
 fierce predator a tender puppy does not 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.349
 I know we discover it with our weather 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.680
 pin the vet 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.170
 good morning good morning these two 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.710
 beautiful specimens accompanied by 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.380
 mario children and mario bartolini are 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.660
 huge its beautiful but beautiful 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.170
 brings how tall they are samples 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.320
 of course we have a female and a 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.140
 male who by the way are uncle and 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.120
 nephew and I would like to make a farewell to 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.640
 argol friend of the wolf this is his 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.250
 full name because he won the year 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.260
 last European title as a youth 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.360
 champions of race for which a round of applause 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.660
 mental for me it is incredible incredible 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.110
 we are these moon yes yes oh the moon of 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.660
 the moon 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.090
 here it is that is beautiful then what is the 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.300
 history of this fascinating breed no 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.719
 half the dog for adriana the story is 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.840
 history 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.570
 I would say relatively recently born in 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.360
 between the 50s and the 60s 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:15.390
 to be precise in 1957 because 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.130
 in the then Czechoslovakia a major 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.070
 of the then border guard 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.740
 Czechoslovakia precisely took a 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.960
 experiment that is that of coupling a 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.790
 real wolf of carpathians a 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.970
 Carpathian wolf female with a 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.210
 German shepherd would say experiment if 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.479
 so we can call it perfectly 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:39.240
 succeeded because in 1982 it was presented 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:45.149
 in helsinki the approved standard for 12 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.610
 years later in 1994 he was recognized by the 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.930
 international kinological federation 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.360
 indecently we confuse with the pastor 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.180
 German I have absolutely never seen e 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.430
 the other is the Czechoslovakian wolf and wolf but 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.100
 we say that this experiment had it 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.100
 purpose of creating a work subject 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.860
 to combine both qualities, that is 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.260
 that of the wolf is that of character 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.090
 in behavior how much it preserves 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.270
 maybe the wild wolf and how much 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.640
 instead acquired of the domestic dog 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.520
 looks genetically speaking without 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.130
 enter scientific details 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:23.220
 preserves 30 percent of the DNA of the 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.600
 Carpathian wolf and 70 percent 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.990
 therefore it is a little upset because of the first one 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.910
 time be playful but it's the first 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.600
 once in front of the cameras 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:36.120
 certainly not very accustomed I said 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:40.050
 he is a dog however domestic but returning 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.850
 to the dna it conserves 70 percent of the dna 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.440
 instead of the German shepherd then one 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:48.930
 and the other quality, that is, sharpness 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:52.590
 the instinct of the wild wolf and the 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.810
 sweetness affability the intelligence of 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.870
 German shepherd however somatically and 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.700
 somatically it is just a 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.470
 true of a real wolf I have seen that the 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.610
 our director marco aprea in this 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.160
 moment is doing a shot 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.410
 splendid that also incites 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.600
 a certain that of terror however is not the 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.550
 red riding hood wolf we remember is 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.739
 sure but bound by meanwhile maybe 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.690
 feel the call of the forest because 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.230
 for example when there is a full moon 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.930
 we have the image of the wolf screaming 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.200
 regards we must dispel rather explain 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.510
 a myth the howling this issue 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.650
 particular vocal typical of this 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:34.410
 species of this type of canid is 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.280
 just a common place in the fairy tales of the 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.360
 werewolves 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.680
 actually this repeat voice output 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.290
 it is put not only during the moon 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.290
 full but also to make the 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.209
 group is a herd animal in the wild 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.070
 this is this animal because it may have to 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.050
 warn the other elements of the group 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.340
 because there is a danger 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.470
 or because the hunt has opened for 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.690
 example during the full moon, hunt 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.480
 better there is more light and consequently 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.250
 maybe howls are more frequent 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.050
 this is my interpretation but then 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.000
 also with regard to ours 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.760
 dog friend because these are dogs 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.120
 we explain they have 30 percent of it 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.040
 I repeat the DNA of the wild wolf howls 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.959
 that is, they are not able to bark 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.730
 not just barking dogs if they do it is 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.420
 because they learned it from others 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.140
 subjects with whom they live 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.820
 of other low guardatina the elegance is 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.370
 of this dog but what kind of 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.650
 power supply ie what power supply is 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.440
 optimal for this breed there are maybe 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.270
 of the foods they should be 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.970
 avoided or others instead of their own 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.730
 prefers so many think their view 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:43.330
 derivation that this dog and I repeat it 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.130
 is a correct name wolf dog 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.680
 I have to eat live prey to incredible 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.750
 that I feel like asking for raw meat 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.120
 absolutely the same needs he has 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.300
 a normal dog so for example a 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.510
 good dry food a high dry food 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.260
 quality i'm not for power 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.780
 unilateral we can also have the 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.190
 pleasure of cooking a perino meal 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.020
 look how he 's looking at you and a lot 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:10.480
 careful right when the fox does not 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:12.310
 you fascinate it no excuse if you are me 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.770
 interrupted but I said we can have the 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.990
 also pleased to cook for ours 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.360
 our wolf friend who is now 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:24.850
 making friends with italy no always 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:26.620
 in short, salt and oil with rice e 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.690
 Meat should always be the cota 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.700
 celery vegetable celery carrots is then 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.710
 important are breeds we already have 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.080
 said in other headings are races 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:38.110
 great giant frequency the 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.910
 paschi is very important because we know 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.920
 we already said they can suffer from 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.380
 a disease that is not a disease 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.750
 infectious but it is a syndrome called 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.270
 gastric torsion dilatation that can 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.580
 especially to hit big dogs 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.340
 size for which we must divide 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:58.300
 divide the meal into several times at 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.980
 day two terror when giving one 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.170
 once a day but the common place 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.600
 honestly, I can't be a doctor 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.470
 veterinarian and the dog must eat one 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.970
 once a day 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:11.260
 then strafoga excuse the expression 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:12.320
 unscientific and failures occur 23 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:16.790
 games 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:18.170
 and wanting ok it's fine and the dog is there 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.780
 we remember the wolf dog gone 

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.640
 however Czechoslovak has some 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:26.060
 weak point because it seems so 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:29.570
 perfect but it seems to be however they are 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:31.820
 how strong is the somatic point of view 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:35.180
 they have no major weak points let's say 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:37.430
 that like all I repeat the breeds of 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.430
 big size giant can suffer 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:42.320
 of genetically transmitted diseases 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.770
 we talked having had guests 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:48.020
 Europeans St. Bernard or name some 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.880
 they can be carriers of one 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.520
 the dreaded genetic pathology is 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.540
 well-known dysplasia of the hips and 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:58.040
 of the elbows 

00:06:53.540 --> 00:07:01.130
 here is a good breeder and a good one 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:03.170
 owner regularly submits to 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.530
 these diagnostic tests that do not 

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:08.540
 they are nothing but type checks 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:10.940
 radiographic the dog starting from the first 

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:14.180
 months of life until adulthood for 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.380
 then check the without then there are gods 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.510
 remedies but this is not the place 

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:20.650
 obviously to talk about it we refer to 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:23.690
 our veterinary doctors 

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:25.820
 I am fascinated defendants we have 

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:29.660
 said a come de rosa in orders 

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:31.790
 thanks to argo see that people emit 

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:34.970
 if I called him even if I stood up 

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:37.370
 and moon and thanks availability of 

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:40.190
 masters of bringing them here live 

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:43.060
 then mario vannini and mario bartolini e 

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.060
 now weather
