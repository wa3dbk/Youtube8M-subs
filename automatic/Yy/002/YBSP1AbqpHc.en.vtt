of the eye that's all ocular examination

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.640 
of the eye that's all ocular examination
will<00:02:59.280> be<00:02:59.310> normal<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.570> cornea<00:03:01.080> will<00:03:01.200> be<00:03:01.350> clear

will be normal the cornea will be clear

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.039
