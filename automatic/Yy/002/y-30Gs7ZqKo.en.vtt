think<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:16.920> need<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.160> do<00:00:17.400> anything<00:00:17.699> really

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
think you need to do anything really

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.560 
think you need to do anything really
high-tech<00:00:18.470> to<00:00:19.470> make<00:00:19.619> it<00:00:19.770> work<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:20.330> think<00:00:21.330> that

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
high-tech to make it work I think that

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.300 
high-tech to make it work I think that
if<00:00:21.689> you're<00:00:21.869> you're<00:00:22.230> up<00:00:22.350> there<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.710> clearly

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
if you're you're up there you clearly

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.490 
if you're you're up there you clearly
love<00:00:23.580> what<00:00:23.789> you're<00:00:23.970> doing<00:00:24.320> you<00:00:25.320> are

enthusiastic about what you're doing I

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.040 
enthusiastic about what you're doing I
think<00:00:27.119> that's<00:00:27.359> going<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.539> rub<00:00:27.689> off<00:00:27.869> on

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050

four of my grandparents for teachers so
I<00:00:57.510> have<00:00:57.870> teaching<00:00:58.710> in<00:00:58.980> my<00:00:59.100> blood<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.720> think<00:01:00.720> it

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
I have teaching in my blood I think it

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.270 
I have teaching in my blood I think it
was<00:01:00.870> probably<00:01:01.080> natural<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.830> was<00:01:01.980> going<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.220> get

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
was probably natural I was going to get

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.399 
was probably natural I was going to get
there<00:01:02.489> somehow<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:04.489> try<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.519> be<00:01:05.670> as<00:01:06.030> dynamic<00:01:06.990> as

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
there somehow I try to be as dynamic as

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.170 
there somehow I try to be as dynamic as
i<00:01:07.530> can<00:01:07.770> at<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.100> front<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.490> room<00:01:08.610> which<00:01:08.880> I

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
i can at the front of the room which I

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.840 
i can at the front of the room which I
think<00:01:09.930> helps<00:01:10.080> for<00:01:10.409> my<00:01:10.560> music<00:01:10.950> background<00:01:11.729> I

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
think helps for my music background I

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.850 
think helps for my music background I
suppose<00:01:12.479> I'm<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.720> bit<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.110> performer<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.830> a

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
suppose I'm a bit of a performer to a

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.160 
suppose I'm a bit of a performer to a
certain<00:01:14.220> extent<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.940> helps<00:01:15.780> when<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.020> get

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
certain extent that helps when you get

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.070 
certain extent that helps when you get
up<00:01:16.320> in<00:01:16.530> front<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.400> large<00:01:17.580> class<00:01:17.840> so<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.900> have

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
up in front of a large class so you have

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.330 
up in front of a large class so you have
to<00:01:19.200> educate<00:01:19.320> them<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:19.950> entertain

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
to educate them you have to entertain

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.679 
to educate them you have to entertain
him<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.729> little<00:01:20.940> bit<00:01:22.520> started<00:01:23.520> with<00:01:23.670> one<00:01:23.880> bigger

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
him a little bit started with one bigger

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.750 
him a little bit started with one bigger
circle<00:01:25.170> on<00:01:25.260> a<00:01:25.290> smaller<00:01:25.650> circle<00:01:25.950> inside<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
circle on a smaller circle inside of the

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.060 
circle on a smaller circle inside of the
passes<00:01:27.240> through<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.600> center<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.890> bigger

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
passes through the center of the bigger

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.550 
passes through the center of the bigger
circle<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.729> just<00:01:30.330> touches<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.930> outer<00:01:31.080> circle

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
circle and just touches the outer circle

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.770 
circle and just touches the outer circle
over<00:01:31.950> here<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.510> I<00:01:33.540> have<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.080> diameter<00:01:34.320> and

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
over here and so I have a diameter and

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.330 
over here and so I have a diameter and
we<00:01:36.780> started<00:01:37.109> off<00:01:37.259> with<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.590> radius<00:01:38.039> as<00:01:38.250> a

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
we started off with the radius as a

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.240 
we started off with the radius as a
smaller<00:01:38.670> circle<00:01:38.969> being<00:01:39.299> five<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:40.020> then<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.039> was

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
smaller circle being five and then I was

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.849 
smaller circle being five and then I was
trying<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.520> find<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.850> length<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:43.049> this

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:43.859 
trying to find the length of of this

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:46.190 
trying to find the length of of this
distance<00:01:44.520> here<00:01:44.579> on<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.420> line<00:01:45.630> segment<00:01:45.840> BC

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
distance here on this line segment BC

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.800 
distance here on this line segment BC
and<00:01:46.759> my<00:01:47.759> wife<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.210> an<00:01:48.299> elementary<00:01:48.719> school

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.020 
couple of times I don't worked out
pretty<00:02:03.869> nicely<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.649> spent<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.549> lot<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.729> time<00:02:05.850> I

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
pretty nicely I spent a lot of time I

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.870 
pretty nicely I spent a lot of time I
think<00:02:06.469> actually<00:02:07.469> away<00:02:07.979> from<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.340> blackboard

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
think actually away from the blackboard

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.270 
think actually away from the blackboard
all<00:02:09.179> right<00:02:09.660> I'll<00:02:09.840> go<00:02:10.500> through<00:02:10.770> something<00:02:11.039> with

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
all right I'll go through something with

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.120 
all right I'll go through something with
the<00:02:11.400> students<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:11.940> will<00:02:12.210> write<00:02:13.200> whatever<00:02:13.860> it<00:02:14.040> is

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
the students I will write whatever it is

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.250 
the students I will write whatever it is
we<00:02:14.250> need<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.490> write<00:02:14.640> on<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.850> board<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.330> then

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
we need to write on the board and then

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.670 
we need to write on the board and then
I'll<00:02:16.500> often<00:02:17.100> step<00:02:17.610> away<00:02:17.730> from<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.060> board

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
I'll often step away from the board

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.260 
I'll often step away from the board
often<00:02:19.680> often<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.220> lot<00:02:20.340> of<00:02:20.430> our<00:02:20.550> lecture<00:02:20.850> halls

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
often often a lot of our lecture halls

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.820 
often often a lot of our lecture halls
have<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.600> little<00:02:21.930> step<00:02:22.200> at<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.410> fronts<00:02:22.740> will

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
have a little step at the fronts will

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.410 
have a little step at the fronts will
step<00:02:23.069> down<00:02:23.100> onto<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.580> same<00:02:23.850> level<00:02:24.180> as<00:02:24.270> they

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
step down onto the same level as they

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.660 
step down onto the same level as they
are<00:02:24.569> block<00:02:25.350> around<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.920> one<00:02:26.040> of<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.250> sides<00:02:26.430> of

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
are block around to one of the sides of

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.699 
are block around to one of the sides of
the<00:02:26.790> other<00:02:26.910> side<00:02:27.150> talk<00:02:27.990> to<00:02:28.140> them<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.350> little<00:02:28.380> bit

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
the other side talk to them a little bit

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.770 
the other side talk to them a little bit
about<00:02:28.920> what<00:02:29.310> this<00:02:29.490> means<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:30.060> why<00:02:30.209> why<00:02:30.720> this

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
about what this means and why why this

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.020 
about what this means and why why this
is<00:02:31.020> important<00:02:31.560> in<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:32.280> context<00:02:32.790> of<00:02:32.850> what

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
is important in the context of what

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.730 
is important in the context of what
we're<00:02:33.180> doing<00:02:33.209> or<00:02:33.510> in<00:02:33.630> a<00:02:33.720> larger<00:02:34.050> context<00:02:34.470> and

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
we're doing or in a larger context and

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.760 
we're doing or in a larger context and
then<00:02:35.400> move

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
then move

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:42.710 
then move
I<00:02:38.760> think<00:02:39.760> sometimes<00:02:40.000> we<00:02:40.500> probably<00:02:41.500> in<00:02:41.920> math

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
I think sometimes we probably in math

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.000 
I think sometimes we probably in math
more<00:02:43.720> than<00:02:43.900> other<00:02:44.080> areas<00:02:44.170> we<00:02:44.710> make<00:02:44.890> the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
more than other areas we make the

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.950 
more than other areas we make the
mistake<00:02:45.370> of<00:02:45.400> trying<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.790> go<00:02:45.880> too<00:02:45.940> fast<00:02:46.330> I've

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
mistake of trying to go too fast I've

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.020 
mistake of trying to go too fast I've
tried<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:47.560> skip<00:02:47.740> steps<00:02:48.130> that<00:02:48.430> students<00:02:48.880> might

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
tried to skip steps that students might

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.980 
tried to skip steps that students might
not<00:02:49.240> get<00:02:49.510> of<00:02:49.830> trying<00:02:50.830> to<00:02:51.160> assuming<00:02:52.090> they<00:02:52.240> get

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
not get of trying to assuming they get

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.360 
not get of trying to assuming they get
it<00:02:53.110> when<00:02:53.230> they<00:02:53.350> don't<00:02:53.530> get<00:02:53.740> it<00:02:53.890> of<00:02:54.040> trying<00:02:54.310> to

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
it when they don't get it of trying to

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.430 
it when they don't get it of trying to
get<00:02:54.520> through<00:02:54.730> too<00:02:54.880> much<00:02:55.030> material<00:02:55.270> and<00:02:55.810> I

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
get through too much material and I

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.640 
get through too much material and I
think<00:02:56.730> pacing<00:02:57.730> is<00:02:57.850> also<00:02:58.210> a<00:02:58.450> really<00:02:59.200> important

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
think pacing is also a really important

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.730 
think pacing is also a really important
part<00:02:59.940> of<00:03:00.940> teaching<00:03:01.150> of<00:03:01.510> trying<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:02.050> try<00:03:02.680> to

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
part of teaching of trying to try to

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.680 
part of teaching of trying to try to
figure<00:03:02.920> out<00:03:03.040> where<00:03:03.280> that<00:03:03.400> all<00:03:03.580> fits<00:03:03.880> together

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.090 

you<00:03:07.690> need<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:07.990> try<00:03:08.170> to<00:03:08.230> be<00:03:08.350> approachable<00:03:08.830> and

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
you need to try to be approachable and

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.950 
you need to try to be approachable and
you<00:03:09.700> try<00:03:09.940> to<00:03:09.970> I<00:03:10.120> try<00:03:10.450> to<00:03:10.480> learn<00:03:10.660> as<00:03:10.840> many

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
you try to I try to learn as many

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.870 
you try to I try to learn as many
students<00:03:11.440> names<00:03:11.680> as<00:03:11.860> I<00:03:11.980> can<00:03:12.220> in<00:03:12.430> a<00:03:12.490> class<00:03:12.700> of

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
students names as I can in a class of

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.690 
students names as I can in a class of
200<00:03:13.360> I'll<00:03:13.510> I'll<00:03:14.170> get<00:03:14.380> two-thirds<00:03:15.340> of<00:03:15.550> them

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
200 I'll I'll get two-thirds of them

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.410 
200 I'll I'll get two-thirds of them
often<00:03:16.140> and<00:03:17.140> that<00:03:17.520> requires<00:03:18.520> some<00:03:18.790> some<00:03:19.240> work

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
often and that requires some some work

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.410 
often and that requires some some work
but<00:03:19.630> I<00:03:19.690> think<00:03:19.960> it's<00:03:20.080> really<00:03:20.170> worth<00:03:20.290> it<00:03:21.240> we<00:03:22.240> get

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
but I think it's really worth it we get

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.510 
but I think it's really worth it we get
good<00:03:22.600> good<00:03:23.290> class<00:03:23.560> lists<00:03:24.010> and<00:03:24.160> good<00:03:24.280> photo

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
good good class lists and good photo

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.220 
good good class lists and good photo
cloths<00:03:24.910> lists<00:03:25.390> actually<00:03:25.750> so<00:03:25.900> it's<00:03:26.020> a<00:03:26.080> little

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
cloths lists actually so it's a little

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.500 
cloths lists actually so it's a little
easier<00:03:26.410> to<00:03:26.620> try<00:03:26.890> to<00:03:26.950> match<00:03:27.730> students<00:03:28.210> to<00:03:28.330> names

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
easier to try to match students to names

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.530 
easier to try to match students to names
but<00:03:29.410> I<00:03:29.650> think<00:03:30.250> I<00:03:30.370> think<00:03:30.640> it<00:03:30.760> helps<00:03:31.060> it<00:03:31.330> makes

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
but I think I think it helps it makes

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.000 
but I think I think it helps it makes
the<00:03:31.660> students<00:03:32.020> feel<00:03:32.140> a<00:03:32.170> lot<00:03:32.380> more<00:03:32.410> connected

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
the students feel a lot more connected

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.040 
the students feel a lot more connected
to<00:03:33.670> you<00:03:33.700> and<00:03:34.090> makes<00:03:34.240> me<00:03:34.420> feel<00:03:34.600> more<00:03:34.780> connected

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
to you and makes me feel more connected

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.530 
to you and makes me feel more connected
to<00:03:35.320> them<00:03:35.470> I<00:03:35.910> try<00:03:36.910> to<00:03:36.940> have<00:03:37.120> an<00:03:37.210> open<00:03:37.450> door

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
to them I try to have an open door

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.240 
to them I try to have an open door
policy<00:03:37.600> whenever<00:03:38.380> a<00:03:38.440> student's<00:03:38.860> want<00:03:39.040> to<00:03:39.130> come

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
policy whenever a student's want to come

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.050 
policy whenever a student's want to come
see<00:03:39.490> me<00:03:39.520> they<00:03:39.850> are<00:03:40.060> more<00:03:40.390> than<00:03:40.510> welcome<00:03:40.840> to

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
see me they are more than welcome to

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.120 
see me they are more than welcome to
just<00:03:43.060> watching<00:03:43.420> the<00:03:43.510> students<00:03:43.920> reading<00:03:44.920> their

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
you've just written down are they

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.810 
you've just written down are they
reading<00:03:55.120> the<00:03:55.360> latest<00:03:55.510> copy<00:03:55.870> of<00:03:56.050> math<00:03:56.260> news<00:03:56.820> so

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
reading the latest copy of math news so

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.580 
reading the latest copy of math news so
I<00:03:58.120> think<00:03:58.300> just<00:03:58.660> paying<00:03:58.840> attention<00:03:59.260> to<00:03:59.380> all<00:03:59.470> of

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
I think just paying attention to all of

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.949 
I think just paying attention to all of
that<00:03:59.709> being<00:03:59.950> observant<00:04:00.390> to<00:04:01.390> what's<00:04:01.540> going<00:04:01.810> on

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
that being observant to what's going on

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.470 
that being observant to what's going on
you<00:04:02.170> can<00:04:02.320> really<00:04:02.530> read<00:04:02.680> a<00:04:02.709> lot<00:04:03.209> out<00:04:04.209> of<00:04:04.270> that

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
you can really read a lot out of that

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.060 
you can really read a lot out of that
body<00:04:04.750> language<00:04:05.230> I<00:04:06.660> think<00:04:07.660> trying<00:04:07.990> to<00:04:08.230> try<00:04:09.010> to

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
body language I think trying to try to

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.640 
body language I think trying to try to
connect<00:04:09.550> the<00:04:10.230> mathematics<00:04:11.230> we<00:04:11.350> do<00:04:11.500> in

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
connect the mathematics we do in

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.190 
connect the mathematics we do in
whatever<00:04:11.890> class<00:04:12.280> I'm<00:04:12.520> teaching<00:04:12.730> to<00:04:13.180> to<00:04:14.080> the

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
whatever class I'm teaching to to the

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.490 
whatever class I'm teaching to to the
real<00:04:14.350> world<00:04:14.380> of<00:04:14.800> it<00:04:14.950> a<00:04:15.160> lot<00:04:15.760> of<00:04:16.049> what<00:04:17.049> we<00:04:17.170> do<00:04:17.350> in

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
real world of it a lot of what we do in

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.770 
real world of it a lot of what we do in
the<00:04:17.560> real<00:04:17.709> world<00:04:17.980> has<00:04:18.220> has<00:04:18.669> geometry<00:04:19.270> of<00:04:19.299> space

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
the real world has has geometry of space

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.930 
the real world has has geometry of space
so<00:04:20.650> that<00:04:20.680> when<00:04:20.919> you<00:04:21.010> design<00:04:21.310> a<00:04:21.340> bridge<00:04:21.580> or<00:04:21.760> when

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
so that when you design a bridge or when

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.500 
so that when you design a bridge or when
you<00:04:22.380> design<00:04:23.380> an<00:04:23.530> airplane<00:04:23.620> or<00:04:24.300> do<00:04:25.300> anything

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
you design an airplane or do anything

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.909 
you design an airplane or do anything
like<00:04:25.780> that<00:04:26.430> geometry<00:04:27.430> is<00:04:27.520> really<00:04:27.850> important

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
like that geometry is really important

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.790 
like that geometry is really important
geometry<00:04:29.919> is<00:04:29.950> just<00:04:30.190> shape<00:04:30.400> so<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:32.560> shape<00:04:32.770> that

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
geometry is just shape so the shape that

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.350 
geometry is just shape so the shape that
you<00:04:33.040> built<00:04:33.250> something<00:04:33.460> relates<00:04:34.090> to<00:04:34.270> the

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
you built something relates to the

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.790 
you built something relates to the
physics<00:04:34.750> of<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:35.080> object<00:04:35.530> and<00:04:35.740> the

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
physics of the object and the

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.470 
physics of the object and the
mathematics<00:04:36.370> behind<00:04:36.430> it<00:04:36.910> connects<00:04:37.240> it<00:04:37.360> all

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
mathematics behind it connects it all

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.860 
mathematics behind it connects it all
together<00:04:38.400> which<00:04:39.400> can<00:04:39.640> be<00:04:39.730> hard<00:04:39.940> to<00:04:40.030> do<00:04:40.180> try<00:04:40.840> to

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
together which can be hard to do try to

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.200 
together which can be hard to do try to
connect<00:04:41.320> it<00:04:41.500> also<00:04:42.040> to<00:04:42.100> other<00:04:42.460> courses<00:04:42.910> they

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
connect it also to other courses they

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.260 
connect it also to other courses they
may<00:04:43.360> be<00:04:43.419> taking<00:04:43.900> but<00:04:44.740> also<00:04:44.890> I<00:04:45.010> think<00:04:45.100> I<00:04:45.520> think

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
may be taking but also I think I think

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.020 
may be taking but also I think I think
just<00:04:46.900> showing<00:04:47.290> my<00:04:48.160> passion<00:04:48.669> for<00:04:48.700> my

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
just showing my passion for my

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.510 
just showing my passion for my
my<00:04:49.600> passion<00:04:50.020> for<00:04:50.050> teaching<00:04:50.320> I<00:04:50.590> think<00:04:50.860> those

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
my passion for teaching I think those

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.800 
my passion for teaching I think those
are<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.790> things<00:04:51.970> that<00:04:52.150> really<00:04:52.420> inspire

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
are the things that really inspire

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.870 
are the things that really inspire
students<00:04:53.200> we're<00:04:54.010> really<00:04:54.190> lucky<00:04:54.400> here<00:04:54.730> in<00:04:54.790> the

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
students we're really lucky here in the

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.880 
students we're really lucky here in the
math<00:04:55.030> faculty<00:04:55.330> that<00:04:55.660> we<00:04:55.720> have<00:04:55.960> students<00:04:56.350> who

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
math faculty that we have students who

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.260 
math faculty that we have students who
come<00:04:57.070> here<00:04:57.250> because<00:04:57.400> they<00:04:57.520> really<00:04:57.850> liked<00:04:58.000> math

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
come here because they really liked math

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.120 
come here because they really liked math
so<00:04:59.050> trying<00:04:59.290> to<00:04:59.320> connect<00:04:59.620> with<00:04:59.770> them<00:04:59.890> on<00:04:59.980> the

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
so trying to connect with them on the

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.190 
so trying to connect with them on the
level<00:05:00.310> of<00:05:00.430> really<00:05:00.730> liking<00:05:01.060> math<00:05:01.270> shouldn't

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
level of really liking math shouldn't

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.520 
level of really liking math shouldn't
really<00:05:02.350> be<00:05:02.470> that<00:05:02.740> difficult<00:05:02.980> to<00:05:03.280> do
