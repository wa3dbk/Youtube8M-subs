hi I'm Karla Schaffer NT speeds designer

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.650 
hi I'm Karla Schaffer NT speeds designer
and<00:00:05.170> I'm<00:00:05.500> going<00:00:05.710> to<00:00:05.770> go<00:00:05.890> over<00:00:05.920> bead<00:00:06.670> cap<00:00:07.000> basics

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
and I'm going to go over bead cap basics

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.660 
and I'm going to go over bead cap basics
I'm<00:00:10.200> just<00:00:10.410> going<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.650> go<00:00:10.769> over<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.040> few<00:00:11.280> pointers

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
I'm just going to go over a few pointers

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.490 
I'm just going to go over a few pointers
when<00:00:11.880> it<00:00:12.000> comes<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.360> using<00:00:12.510> bead<00:00:12.870> caps<00:00:13.170> I've

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
when it comes to using bead caps I've

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.100 
when it comes to using bead caps I've
got<00:00:13.950> three<00:00:14.400> different<00:00:14.700> size<00:00:14.910> beads<00:00:15.330> in<00:00:15.660> two

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.110 
got three different size beads in two

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.200 
got three different size beads in two
different<00:00:16.470> shapes<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.400> variety<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.910> bead

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
different shapes and a variety of bead

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.670 
different shapes and a variety of bead
caps<00:00:18.540> that<00:00:18.930> I'm<00:00:19.050> just<00:00:19.290> going<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.500> show<00:00:19.650> you

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
caps that I'm just going to show you

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.589 
caps that I'm just going to show you
what<00:00:20.040> the<00:00:20.130> difference<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.640> in<00:00:20.820> between<00:00:20.910> sizes

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:21.599 
what the difference is in between sizes

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.019 
what the difference is in between sizes
and<00:00:22.110> of<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.890> bead<00:00:23.070> cap<00:00:23.279> as<00:00:23.520> well<00:00:23.550> as<00:00:23.910> how

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
and of the bead cap as well as how

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.570 
and of the bead cap as well as how
they're<00:00:24.210> used<00:00:24.390> on<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.869> beads

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
they're used on the beads

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.099 
they're used on the beads
basically<00:00:26.580> what<00:00:26.939> when<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.210> take<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.539> question<00:00:28.019> on

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
basically what when I take a question on

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.550 
basically what when I take a question on
what<00:00:28.380> size<00:00:28.590> bead<00:00:28.890> cap<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.580> use<00:00:29.849> my<00:00:30.380> question<00:00:31.380> to

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
what size bead cap to use my question to

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.070 
what size bead cap to use my question to
their<00:00:31.710> answer<00:00:32.040> as<00:00:32.160> always<00:00:32.550> how<00:00:33.360> much<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.870> the

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.080 
their answer as always how much of the

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.600 
their answer as always how much of the
bead<00:00:34.290> do<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.620> want<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.920> cover<00:00:35.160> with<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.489> bead

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
bead do you want to cover with the bead

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.119 
bead do you want to cover with the bead
cap<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:36.090> this<00:00:36.540> case<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:37.050> am<00:00:37.379> using<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.860> three

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
cap in this case I am using a three

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.729 
cap in this case I am using a three
point<00:00:38.430> five<00:00:38.670> by<00:00:38.910> six<00:00:38.970> point<00:00:39.449> five<00:00:39.739> millimeter

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
point five by six point five millimeter

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.030 
point five by six point five millimeter
rope<00:00:41.670> bead<00:00:42.600> cap<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> six

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
rope bead cap and this is a six

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.740 
rope bead cap and this is a six
millimeter<00:00:44.250> round<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.000> I'm<00:00:45.360> just<00:00:45.570> going<00:00:45.719> to

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
millimeter round and I'm just going to

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.069 
millimeter round and I'm just going to
demonstrate<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:48.030> can<00:00:48.300> use<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.899> know

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
demonstrate that you can use you know

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.049 
demonstrate that you can use you know
this<00:00:49.350> smaller<00:00:49.680> bead<00:00:49.980> cap<00:00:50.219> on<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> small<00:00:50.820> bead

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
this smaller bead cap on a small bead

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.340 
this smaller bead cap on a small bead
then<00:00:51.329> I'm<00:00:51.420> also<00:00:51.570> going<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.840> show<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.079> what<00:00:52.289> it

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
then I'm also going to show you what it

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.799 
then I'm also going to show you what it
looks<00:00:52.500> like<00:00:52.620> on<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.860> larger<00:00:53.219> bead<00:00:53.370> and

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
looks like on the larger bead and

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.000 
looks like on the larger bead and
basically<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:55.110> little<00:00:55.230> beauty<00:00:55.530> cap<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.829> just

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
basically this little beauty cap is just

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.580 
basically this little beauty cap is just
covering<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.820> ends<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:57.690> round<00:00:57.989> bead<00:00:58.320> and

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
covering the ends of this round bead and

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.130 
covering the ends of this round bead and
then<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.460> will<00:00:59.640> show<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.850> how<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.750> looks<00:01:00.780> when

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
then I will show you how it looks when

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.490 
then I will show you how it looks when
you<00:01:01.260> put<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:02.420> bigger<00:01:03.420> round<00:01:03.809> on<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.170> think<00:01:04.379> this

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
you put a a bigger round on I think this

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.580 
you put a a bigger round on I think this
is<00:01:04.649> an<00:01:04.770> 8<00:01:05.009> millimeter<00:01:08.810> and<00:01:09.810> basically<00:01:10.440> what

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
is an 8 millimeter and basically what

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.109 
is an 8 millimeter and basically what
you're<00:01:10.710> doing<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:11.070> you're<00:01:11.250> covering<00:01:11.610> less<00:01:11.880> of

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
you're doing is you're covering less of

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.180 
you're doing is you're covering less of
the<00:01:12.240> bead<00:01:12.420> with<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.810> bead<00:01:13.050> cap<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:13.979> one

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
the bead with this bead cap and this one

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.889 
the bead with this bead cap and this one
is<00:01:14.310> really<00:01:14.520> just<00:01:14.640> capping<00:01:15.149> the<00:01:15.240> very<00:01:15.450> ends<00:01:15.780> of

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
is really just capping the very ends of

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.260 
is really just capping the very ends of
it<00:01:15.959> and<00:01:16.050> you<00:01:16.110> see<00:01:16.319> more<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.709> the<00:01:16.800> of<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:18.000> round

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
it and you see more of the of the round

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.120 
it and you see more of the of the round
and<00:01:18.599> this<00:01:19.259> pretty<00:01:19.709> much<00:01:19.800> works<00:01:20.160> with<00:01:20.399> any

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
and this pretty much works with any

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.949 
and this pretty much works with any
shaped<00:01:23.130> bead<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.700> use<00:01:24.000> with<00:01:24.270> these<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:24.949 --> 00:01:24.959 
shaped bead that you use with these the

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:27.380 
shaped bead that you use with these the
thing<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.890> doesn't<00:01:26.399> have<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.789> be<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
thing is is it doesn't have to be the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.809 
thing is is it doesn't have to be the
same<00:01:27.660> size<00:01:27.959> as<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.410> bead<00:01:28.679> and<00:01:28.920> as<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.520> can<00:01:29.640> see

00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:29.819 
same size as the bead and as you can see

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:32.120 
same size as the bead and as you can see
even<00:01:29.940> on<00:01:30.179> this<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.569> it<00:01:30.780> shows<00:01:31.080> it<00:01:31.380> covers<00:01:31.860> less

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
even on this and it shows it covers less

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.249 
even on this and it shows it covers less
of<00:01:32.399> it<00:01:32.550> but<00:01:32.970> it's<00:01:33.119> just<00:01:33.300> whatever<00:01:33.509> design<00:01:33.959> and

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
of it but it's just whatever design and

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.600 
of it but it's just whatever design and
the<00:01:34.319> fact<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.770> want<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.099> bead<00:01:35.250> cap<00:01:35.459> to

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
the fact that you want the bead cap to

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.059 
the fact that you want the bead cap to
have<00:01:35.789> on<00:01:35.940> the<00:01:36.060> bead<00:01:36.289> okay<00:01:37.289> this<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:37.709> the<00:01:37.830> same

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:38.069 
have on the bead okay this is the same

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:40.130 
have on the bead okay this is the same
bead<00:01:38.310> cap<00:01:38.580> but<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.179> this<00:01:39.300> case<00:01:39.539> I'm<00:01:39.720> using<00:01:39.750> a

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
bead cap but in this case I'm using a

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.839 
bead cap but in this case I'm using a
six<00:01:40.349> millimeter<00:01:40.560> bicone<00:01:41.190> and<00:01:41.220> when<00:01:41.550> you<00:01:41.670> bring

00:01:41.839 --> 00:01:41.849 
six millimeter bicone and when you bring

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:43.880 
six millimeter bicone and when you bring
these<00:01:42.090> together<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:43.110> can<00:01:43.289> hardly<00:01:43.560> tell<00:01:43.860> that

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
these together you can hardly tell that

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.949 
these together you can hardly tell that
this<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.429> bicone<00:01:44.910> it<00:01:45.030> does<00:01:45.209> cover<00:01:45.479> most<00:01:45.810> of

00:01:45.949 --> 00:01:45.959 
this is a bicone it does cover most of

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:47.690 
this is a bicone it does cover most of
the<00:01:46.020> ends<00:01:46.440> and<00:01:46.619> most<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.280> these<00:01:47.399> little

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
the ends and most of these little

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.440 
the ends and most of these little
cone-shaped<00:01:48.360> or<00:01:49.250> bead<00:01:50.250> caps<00:01:50.550> will<00:01:50.849> cover<00:01:51.119> a

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
cone-shaped or bead caps will cover a

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.520 
cone-shaped or bead caps will cover a
bicone<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.170> good<00:01:52.410> portion<00:01:52.739> of<00:01:52.830> the<00:01:52.979> bicone<00:01:53.399> body

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
bicone a good portion of the bicone body

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.979 
bicone a good portion of the bicone body
and<00:01:55.530> then<00:01:55.800> if<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.130> show<00:01:56.580> you<00:01:56.640> on<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.300> larger<00:01:57.840> one

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:57.989 
and then if you show you on a larger one

00:01:57.989 --> 00:02:01.520 
and then if you show you on a larger one
this<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.560> an<00:01:58.679> eight<00:01:58.890> millimeter<00:01:59.099> bicone<00:02:00.530> again

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
this is an eight millimeter bicone again

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.139 
this is an eight millimeter bicone again
it's<00:02:01.709> covering<00:02:02.069> the<00:02:02.160> ends<00:02:02.550> of<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.819> but<00:02:03.000> you're

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
it's covering the ends of it but you're

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.469 
it's covering the ends of it but you're
getting<00:02:03.390> less<00:02:03.599> of<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.190> coverage<00:02:07.340> and<00:02:08.420> now<00:02:09.420> you

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
getting less of the coverage and now you

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.410 
getting less of the coverage and now you
can<00:02:09.869> really<00:02:10.050> tell<00:02:10.349> that<00:02:10.440> it's<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.709> bicone<00:02:11.099> and

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
can really tell that it's a bicone and

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.380 
can really tell that it's a bicone and
then<00:02:12.420> on<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.720> ten<00:02:12.989> millimeter<00:02:13.849> it<00:02:14.849> covers<00:02:15.180> even

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
then on a ten millimeter it covers even

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.660 
then on a ten millimeter it covers even
less

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.760 

and<00:02:21.240> again<00:02:21.540> it's<00:02:21.810> just<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.110> effect<00:02:22.500> that<00:02:22.590> you

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
and again it's just the effect that you

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.490 
and again it's just the effect that you
want<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:23.040> bead<00:02:23.190> cap<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.550> have<00:02:23.670> on<00:02:23.790> your<00:02:23.940> bead

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
want the bead cap to have on your bead

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.770 
want the bead cap to have on your bead
just<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.590> show<00:02:25.770> you<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:26.340> same<00:02:26.670> basic<00:02:27.300> design

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
just to show you the same basic design

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.400 
just to show you the same basic design
this<00:02:28.410> is<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:29.010> sunflower<00:02:29.610> three<00:02:30.209> by<00:02:30.390> six<00:02:30.750> again

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
this is a sunflower three by six again

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.650 
this is a sunflower three by six again
I'm<00:02:31.590> just<00:02:31.740> showing<00:02:31.830> it<00:02:32.100> on<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.280> round<00:02:32.670> eight

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
with a seven millimeter bead cap so you

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.360 
with a seven millimeter bead cap so you
can<00:03:09.570> kind<00:03:09.810> of<00:03:09.870> gauge<00:03:10.110> by<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:10.769> size<00:03:11.100> of<00:03:11.310> the

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
bead cap to your bead again obviously

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.420 
bead cap to your bead again obviously
with<00:03:14.670> that<00:03:14.910> size<00:03:15.690> crystal<00:03:16.440> or<00:03:16.920> bead<00:03:17.190> it's

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
with that size crystal or bead it's

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.360 
with that size crystal or bead it's
gonna<00:03:17.550> cover<00:03:17.820> a<00:03:17.940> majority<00:03:18.480> of<00:03:18.510> it<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:20.220> then

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
gonna cover a majority of it and then

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.009 
gonna cover a majority of it and then
when<00:03:20.519> you<00:03:20.550> try<00:03:21.030> it<00:03:21.150> with<00:03:21.420> an<00:03:21.540> eight<00:03:21.780> millimeter

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
when you try it with an eight millimeter

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:28.520 
when you try it with an eight millimeter
crystal<00:03:25.549> you<00:03:26.549> can<00:03:26.730> see<00:03:26.970> that<00:03:27.209> it<00:03:27.329> caps<00:03:27.780> the

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
crystal you can see that it caps the

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.860 
crystal you can see that it caps the
edges<00:03:29.040> of<00:03:29.250> it<00:03:29.400> but<00:03:29.820> it<00:03:29.910> doesn't<00:03:30.239> cover<00:03:30.420> as<00:03:30.660> much

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
edges of it but it doesn't cover as much

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.210 
edges of it but it doesn't cover as much
of<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.170> body<00:03:31.380> of<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.620> bead<00:03:31.920> and<00:03:34.070> with<00:03:35.070> the

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
of the body of the bead and with the

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.569 
of the body of the bead and with the
bicone<00:03:36.200> you<00:03:37.200> can<00:03:37.500> use<00:03:37.709> this<00:03:37.920> style<00:03:38.280> on<00:03:38.549> a

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
bicone you can use this style on a

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.479 
bicone you can use this style on a
bicone<00:03:39.150> bead<00:03:39.420> and<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:40.350> just<00:03:40.560> changes<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:40.980> look

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
bicone bead and it just changes the look

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:47.060 
bicone bead and it just changes the look
of<00:03:41.700> it<00:03:41.820> completely<00:03:45.079> so<00:03:46.079> just<00:03:46.350> an<00:03:46.440> idea<00:03:46.799> of<00:03:46.920> how

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
of it completely so just an idea of how

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.710 
of it completely so just an idea of how
you<00:03:47.130> can<00:03:47.400> use<00:03:47.579> some<00:03:47.730> of<00:03:47.790> these<00:03:47.940> rounder<00:03:48.510> bead

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
you can use some of these rounder bead

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.080 
you can use some of these rounder bead
caps<00:03:49.049> on<00:03:49.290> rounds<00:03:50.070> and<00:03:50.250> B<00:03:50.400> caps<00:03:50.670> and<00:03:50.910> in

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
caps on rounds and B caps and in

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.960 
caps on rounds and B caps and in
conjunction<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.930> sizes<00:03:52.320> of<00:03:52.350> the<00:03:52.680> bead

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
conjunction to the sizes of the bead

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.630 
conjunction to the sizes of the bead
okay<00:03:53.970> now<00:03:54.090> this<00:03:54.420> is<00:03:54.720> an<00:03:55.170> 8<00:03:55.799> millimeter<00:03:56.070> bead

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
okay now this is an 8 millimeter bead

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.759 
okay now this is an 8 millimeter bead
cap<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.269> I<00:03:58.019> wanted<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:58.320> show<00:03:58.470> you<00:03:58.500> what

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
cap and I wanted to show you what

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.800 
cap and I wanted to show you what
happens<00:03:59.100> when<00:03:59.310> you<00:03:59.430> send<00:03:59.790> an<00:03:59.970> 8<00:04:00.209> millimeter

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
happens when you send an 8 millimeter

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.229 
happens when you send an 8 millimeter
with<00:04:00.989> a<00:04:01.019> 6<00:04:01.410> millimeter<00:04:01.650> bead<00:04:02.100> you<00:04:02.640> really<00:04:03.030> lose

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
with a 6 millimeter bead you really lose

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.720 
with a 6 millimeter bead you really lose
the<00:04:03.540> bead<00:04:03.720> altogether<00:04:04.440> so<00:04:04.920> this<00:04:05.310> might<00:04:05.519> help

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
the bead altogether so this might help

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.220 
the bead altogether so this might help
you<00:04:05.910> kind<00:04:06.090> of<00:04:06.209> decide<00:04:06.510> whether<00:04:06.810> or<00:04:06.959> not<00:04:07.049> an

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
you kind of decide whether or not an

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.449 
you kind of decide whether or not an
eight<00:04:07.380> millimeter<00:04:07.590> works<00:04:07.980> on<00:04:08.160> a<00:04:08.190> six

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
eight millimeter works on a six

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.190 
eight millimeter works on a six
millimeter<00:04:08.670> or<00:04:09.000> not<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:09.390> if<00:04:09.840> that's<00:04:10.049> the

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
millimeter or not and if that's the

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.960 
millimeter or not and if that's the
effect<00:04:10.560> or<00:04:10.769> the<00:04:10.860> look<00:04:11.010> you<00:04:11.160> want<00:04:11.340> then<00:04:11.610> great

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
effect or the look you want then great

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.850 
effect or the look you want then great
but<00:04:12.480> it's<00:04:13.049> probably<00:04:13.260> something<00:04:13.590> that<00:04:13.829> I

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
but it's probably something that I

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.599 
but it's probably something that I
wouldn't<00:04:14.250> do<00:04:14.900> but<00:04:15.900> using<00:04:16.739> this<00:04:16.859> 8<00:04:17.070> millimeter

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
wouldn't do but using this 8 millimeter

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.529 
wouldn't do but using this 8 millimeter
on<00:04:17.910> a<00:04:17.970> 10<00:04:18.329> millimeter<00:04:18.600> bead<00:04:20.060> again<00:04:21.060> changes

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
on a 10 millimeter bead again changes

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:26.270 
on a 10 millimeter bead again changes
the<00:04:21.690> effect<00:04:23.570> and<00:04:24.570> you<00:04:24.720> can<00:04:24.750> just<00:04:25.110> kind<00:04:25.350> of<00:04:25.410> get

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
the effect and you can just kind of get

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.890 
the effect and you can just kind of get
a<00:04:26.310> basic<00:04:26.910> idea<00:04:27.030> when<00:04:27.360> you're<00:04:27.510> looking<00:04:27.720> online

trying to figure out what you want to
use<00:04:29.490> this<00:04:30.450> is<00:04:30.660> one<00:04:30.900> that<00:04:31.410> this<00:04:32.039> little<00:04:32.250> bead

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
use this is one that this little bead

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.700 
use this is one that this little bead
cap<00:04:32.700> here<00:04:32.910> is<00:04:33.030> is<00:04:33.210> really

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
cap here is is really

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.580 
cap here is is really
actually<00:04:33.980> very<00:04:34.190> versatile<00:04:35.150> to<00:04:35.390> me<00:04:35.570> and<00:04:35.840> this

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
actually very versatile to me and this

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.550 
actually very versatile to me and this
is<00:04:36.650> what<00:04:37.520> we<00:04:37.640> call<00:04:37.850> a<00:04:37.880> ten<00:04:38.210> millimeter<00:04:38.560> valley

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
is what we call a ten millimeter valley

is what we call a ten millimeter valley
bead<00:04:39.800> cap<00:04:40.040> flower<00:04:40.520> and<00:04:40.970> what<00:04:41.420> I<00:04:41.630> like<00:04:41.900> about<00:04:42.080> it

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
bead cap flower and what I like about it

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.090 
bead cap flower and what I like about it
is<00:04:42.590> that<00:04:42.800> I<00:04:42.860> use<00:04:43.220> a<00:04:43.250> lock<00:04:43.940> with<00:04:44.150> pendants<00:04:44.780> or

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
is that I use a lock with pendants or

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.320 
is that I use a lock with pendants or
things<00:04:46.100> like<00:04:46.160> this<00:04:46.400> as<00:04:46.610> you<00:04:46.640> can<00:04:46.730> see<00:04:46.880> how<00:04:47.210> it

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
things like this as you can see how it

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.600 
things like this as you can see how it
doesn't<00:04:47.570> really<00:04:47.900> conform<00:04:48.440> to<00:04:48.650> the<00:04:48.740> bicone<00:04:49.130> but

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
doesn't really conform to the bicone but

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.220 
doesn't really conform to the bicone but
the<00:04:49.700> great<00:04:49.910> thing<00:04:49.940> about<00:04:50.180> this<00:04:50.660> one<00:04:50.870> is<00:04:50.900> is

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
the great thing about this one is is

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.990 
the great thing about this one is is
that<00:04:51.440> if<00:04:51.530> you<00:04:51.650> gently<00:04:51.950> mesh<00:04:52.250> down<00:04:52.550> on<00:04:52.850> this

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
that if you gently mesh down on this

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.900 
that if you gently mesh down on this
bead<00:04:53.240> cap<00:04:53.560> you<00:04:54.560> can<00:04:54.770> bring<00:04:54.950> it<00:04:55.100> down<00:04:55.370> around

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
bead cap you can bring it down around

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.000 
bead cap you can bring it down around
the<00:04:56.090> bead<00:04:56.300> that<00:04:56.810> you're<00:04:56.960> using<00:04:57.200> I<00:04:57.500> like<00:04:57.680> to<00:04:57.830> use

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
the bead that you're using I like to use

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.730 
the bead that you're using I like to use
it<00:04:58.190> at<00:04:58.310> the<00:04:58.400> top<00:04:58.640> of<00:04:58.910> a<00:04:59.030> pendant<00:04:59.510> you<00:05:00.380> be<00:05:00.560> it<00:05:00.650> a

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
it at the top of a pendant you be it a

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.430 
it at the top of a pendant you be it a
flat<00:05:01.190> pendant<00:05:01.760> or<00:05:01.940> an<00:05:02.030> oval<00:05:02.510> and<00:05:02.750> then<00:05:03.140> I<00:05:03.260> can

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
flat pendant or an oval and then I can

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.410 
flat pendant or an oval and then I can
just<00:05:03.620> mash<00:05:03.920> the<00:05:03.950> petals<00:05:04.550> down<00:05:04.760> around<00:05:05.090> it<00:05:05.300> and

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
just mash the petals down around it and

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.300 
just mash the petals down around it and
see<00:05:05.510> how<00:05:05.630> that<00:05:05.840> is<00:05:05.960> really<00:05:06.230> conformed<00:05:07.100> to<00:05:07.130> the

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
see how that is really conformed to the

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.310 
see how that is really conformed to the
bicone<00:05:07.700> and<00:05:07.880> that<00:05:08.450> does<00:05:08.660> make<00:05:08.810> a<00:05:08.870> really<00:05:09.170> nice

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
bicone and that does make a really nice

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.920 
bicone and that does make a really nice
cap<00:05:09.680> for<00:05:10.190> a<00:05:10.460> pendant<00:05:11.360> especially<00:05:11.720> if<00:05:11.810> you're

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
cap for a pendant especially if you're

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.560 
cap for a pendant especially if you're
wire<00:05:12.080> wrapping<00:05:12.350> a<00:05:12.560> loop<00:05:12.710> at<00:05:12.860> the<00:05:12.890> top<00:05:13.420> such<00:05:14.420> as

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
wire wrapping a loop at the top such as

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.110 
wire wrapping a loop at the top such as
adds<00:05:14.720> a<00:05:14.870> little<00:05:14.990> interest<00:05:15.440> this<00:05:16.310> is<00:05:16.370> an<00:05:16.700> 11

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
adds a little interest this is an 11

bottom I have a bracelet online that
I've<00:05:40.730> done<00:05:40.910> where<00:05:41.120> I<00:05:41.150> just<00:05:41.390> used<00:05:41.630> one<00:05:41.960> and<00:05:42.320> it

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
I've done where I just used one and it

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.200 
I've done where I just used one and it
will<00:05:42.890> put<00:05:43.070> it<00:05:43.100> on<00:05:43.250> the<00:05:43.400> side<00:05:43.610> bar<00:05:43.820> of<00:05:44.030> this

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
will put it on the side bar of this

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.750 
will put it on the side bar of this
video<00:05:44.570> but<00:05:45.320> this<00:05:45.650> as<00:05:46.010> you<00:05:46.160> can<00:05:46.310> see<00:05:46.490> it<00:05:46.610> just

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
video but this as you can see it just

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.370 
video but this as you can see it just
completely<00:05:47.090> covers<00:05:47.420> the<00:05:47.480> top<00:05:47.750> half<00:05:47.990> of<00:05:48.170> this

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
completely covers the top half of this

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.280 
completely covers the top half of this
bead<00:05:48.680> and<00:05:48.920> this<00:05:49.370> is<00:05:49.550> the<00:05:49.700> bicone<00:05:50.120> and<00:05:50.360> it<00:05:51.140> will

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 
bead and this is the bicone and it will

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.960 
bead and this is the bicone and it will
have<00:05:51.470> this<00:05:51.620> pretty<00:05:52.070> much<00:05:52.220> the<00:05:52.370> same<00:05:52.520> effect<00:05:52.670> on

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
have this pretty much the same effect on

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.180 
have this pretty much the same effect on
this<00:05:53.090> ten<00:05:53.300> millimeter<00:05:53.660> round<00:05:53.960> so<00:05:54.770> just<00:05:54.980> wanted

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
this ten millimeter round so just wanted

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.850 
this ten millimeter round so just wanted
to<00:05:55.280> give<00:05:55.460> you<00:05:55.490> an<00:05:55.610> idea<00:05:55.910> how<00:05:56.120> the<00:05:56.510> sizes<00:05:57.050> work

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
to give you an idea how the sizes work

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.560 
to give you an idea how the sizes work
and<00:05:58.100> this<00:05:58.430> how<00:05:58.610> this<00:05:58.790> one<00:05:58.970> really<00:05:59.210> covers<00:05:59.540> the

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
and this how this one really covers the

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.210 
and this how this one really covers the
majority<00:06:00.230> of<00:06:00.260> the<00:06:00.410> bead<00:06:00.560> and<00:06:00.590> if<00:06:00.860> you<00:06:00.950> wanted

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
majority of the bead and if you wanted

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.580 
majority of the bead and if you wanted
to<00:06:01.280> put<00:06:01.520> the<00:06:02.480> second<00:06:02.870> one<00:06:02.900> on<00:06:03.020> here<00:06:03.410> you're

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
to put the second one on here you're

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.160 
to put the second one on here you're
almost<00:06:03.860> encasing<00:06:04.670> the<00:06:04.850> beef<00:06:05.060> with<00:06:05.870> the<00:06:05.990> bead

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.170 
almost encasing the beef with the bead

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.970 
almost encasing the beef with the bead
caps<00:06:06.640> which<00:06:07.640> has<00:06:07.820> a<00:06:07.850> really<00:06:08.060> neat<00:06:08.300> effect<00:06:08.420> too

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:08.980 
caps which has a really neat effect too

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.380 
caps which has a really neat effect too
one<00:06:09.980> more<00:06:10.160> example<00:06:10.550> that<00:06:10.820> I<00:06:10.880> was<00:06:11.030> just<00:06:11.210> going

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:11.390 
one more example that I was just going

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.360 
one more example that I was just going
to<00:06:11.480> show<00:06:11.660> you<00:06:11.720> this<00:06:12.020> is<00:06:12.200> a<00:06:12.230> 10<00:06:12.680> millimeter<00:06:13.010> this

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
to show you this is a 10 millimeter this

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.690 
to show you this is a 10 millimeter this
is<00:06:13.550> our<00:06:13.730> spotter<00:06:14.150> Bally<00:06:14.840> bead<00:06:15.170> cap<00:06:15.440> and<00:06:15.700> using

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:16.700 
is our spotter Bally bead cap and using

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.730 
is our spotter Bally bead cap and using
it<00:06:16.910> on<00:06:17.090> an<00:06:17.240> 8<00:06:17.450> millimeter<00:06:17.720> bead<00:06:18.140> just<00:06:18.410> as<00:06:18.590> we

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
it on an 8 millimeter bead just as we

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.890 
it on an 8 millimeter bead just as we
did<00:06:18.920> with<00:06:19.010> the<00:06:19.070> 11<00:06:19.640> millimeter<00:06:20.090> on<00:06:20.420> a<00:06:20.570> 10

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
did with the 11 millimeter on a 10

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.080 
did with the 11 millimeter on a 10
millimeter<00:06:21.170> bead<00:06:21.500> this<00:06:22.040> one<00:06:22.310> again<00:06:22.610> almost<00:06:22.970> in

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090 
millimeter bead this one again almost in

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.330 
millimeter bead this one again almost in
cases<00:06:23.480> the<00:06:23.630> whole<00:06:23.660> crystal<00:06:24.620> or<00:06:24.740> bead<00:06:25.070> and

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:25.340 
cases the whole crystal or bead and

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.220 
cases the whole crystal or bead and
within<00:06:26.000> the<00:06:26.120> bead<00:06:26.270> caps<00:06:26.570> and<00:06:26.810> I<00:06:26.840> just<00:06:27.020> wanted

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:27.230 
within the bead caps and I just wanted

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.950 
within the bead caps and I just wanted
to<00:06:27.350> to<00:06:27.920> show<00:06:28.100> you<00:06:28.160> this<00:06:28.550> example<00:06:28.970> to<00:06:29.330> just

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 
to to show you this example to just

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.570 
to to show you this example to just
really<00:06:30.140> scratch<00:06:30.500> the<00:06:30.770> surface<00:06:30.950> on<00:06:31.280> our<00:06:31.400> bead

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
really scratch the surface on our bead

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.910 
really scratch the surface on our bead
caps<00:06:31.990> but<00:06:32.990> I<00:06:33.080> thought<00:06:33.260> kind<00:06:33.710> of<00:06:33.770> hope<00:06:33.890> that

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:33.920 
caps but I thought kind of hope that

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.870 
caps but I thought kind of hope that
this<00:06:34.280> gave<00:06:34.550> you<00:06:34.670> an<00:06:34.790> idea<00:06:34.910> of<00:06:35.210> how<00:06:35.330> to<00:06:35.390> use<00:06:35.600> them
