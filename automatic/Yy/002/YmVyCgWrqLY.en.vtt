this thing that happens is I suppose the

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.230 
this thing that happens is I suppose the
police<00:00:13.169> start<00:00:13.589> a<00:00:13.769> tanning<00:00:14.309> process<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:15.089> the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
police start a tanning process of the

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.950 
police start a tanning process of the
leather<00:00:15.480> so<00:00:15.900> we<00:00:16.110> get<00:00:16.320> it<00:00:16.440> when<00:00:17.280> you<00:00:17.370> get<00:00:17.520> a

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
leather so we get it when you get a

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.380 
leather so we get it when you get a
cowhide<00:00:18.960> or<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> steroid<00:00:20.100> we<00:00:20.460> prefer<00:00:20.880> steers

days in those early days and we followed

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.440 
days in those early days and we followed
that<00:00:45.150> through<00:00:45.860> and<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.310> advantage<00:00:47.790> of<00:00:48.000> an

in<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.079> tanning<00:00:55.399> happens<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.610> leather<00:00:56.820> and

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
in the tanning happens the leather and

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.630 
in the tanning happens the leather and
makes<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.480> or<00:00:58.200> scuff<00:00:58.680> resistant<00:00:59.430> and

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
makes it or scuff resistant and

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.090 
makes it or scuff resistant and
therefore<00:01:00.090> up<00:01:00.239> wears<00:01:00.510> better<00:01:00.920> one<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:01.950> the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
therefore up wears better one of the

quarters into a hemisphere say you saw

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:20.449 
quarters into a hemisphere say you saw
them<00:01:17.939> there<00:01:18.539> shaking<00:01:18.899> this<00:01:19.469> Cutlass<00:01:19.979> certain

00:01:20.449 --> 00:01:20.459 
them there shaking this Cutlass certain

ways under play former a rough

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:25.669 
ways under play former a rough
hemisphere<00:01:23.999> and<00:01:24.299> then<00:01:24.479> you

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
hemisphere and then you

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:28.969 
hemisphere and then you
by<00:01:26.189> using<00:01:26.490> press<00:01:26.939> ilysm<00:01:27.560> stretching<00:01:28.560> methods

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
by using press ilysm stretching methods

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.190 
by using press ilysm stretching methods
you<00:01:29.130> block<00:01:29.459> the<00:01:29.700> cover<00:01:29.969> into<00:01:30.389> that<00:01:30.569> into<00:01:31.109> a

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
you block the cover into that into a

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.340 
you block the cover into that into a
shape<00:01:31.469> which<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.219> like<00:01:32.609> a<00:01:32.639> hemisphere<00:01:33.420> really

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
shape which is like a hemisphere really

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.010 
shape which is like a hemisphere really
so<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.579> can<00:01:35.819> get<00:01:36.060> two<00:01:36.299> halves<00:01:36.630> which

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
so that it you can get two halves which

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.910 
so that it you can get two halves which
represent<00:01:38.299> to<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.509> stitch<00:01:39.749> your<00:01:40.020> autumn<00:01:40.499> to

whilst<00:01:44.969> we're<00:01:45.299> doing<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.990> course<00:01:46.200> we're

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.469 
whilst we're doing that of course we're

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:47.959 
whilst we're doing that of course we're
going<00:01:46.679> to<00:01:46.740> make<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.130> center<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.759> ball

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:47.969 
going to make the center of the ball

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:52.660 
going to make the center of the ball
which<00:01:48.329> traditionally<00:01:49.259> was<00:01:49.439> always<00:01:49.799> made<00:01:50.099> from

cherry<00:02:55.820> red<00:02:56.120> that<00:02:56.360> we<00:02:56.570> know<00:02:57.380> today

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
cherry red that we know today

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.060 
cherry red that we know today
and<00:02:58.750> part<00:02:59.750> of<00:02:59.900> the<00:02:59.989> process<00:03:00.500> is<00:03:00.709> to<00:03:00.920> ensure

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
and part of the process is to ensure

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.890 
and part of the process is to ensure
that<00:03:01.840> during<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:02.959> tanning<00:03:03.320> process<00:03:03.350> and<00:03:04.070> then

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
that during the tanning process and then

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.720 
that during the tanning process and then
the<00:03:05.900> work<00:03:06.110> that<00:03:06.350> we<00:03:06.500> do<00:03:06.709> through<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.220> factory

the work that we do through the factory

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.110 
the work that we do through the factory
we<00:03:07.970> ensure<00:03:08.360> that<00:03:08.390> we<00:03:08.660> get<00:03:08.900> a<00:03:08.959> nice<00:03:09.200> even<00:03:09.470> color

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
we ensure that we get a nice even color

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.720 
we ensure that we get a nice even color
