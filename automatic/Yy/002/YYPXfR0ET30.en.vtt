00:00:06.145 --> 00:00:08.517
 Okay, I finally got here. 

00:00:09.155 --> 00:00:13.243
 It's night ... and you can not see anything. 

00:00:17.775 --> 00:00:19.899
 Is this what it is? 

00:00:20.537 --> 00:00:22.873
 Yeah, I think maybe I was chasing after us! 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.537
 Come on! You son of a bitch! 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.248
 Be careful, you can hook up in one shot! 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.645
 What kind of creature is this ?! 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.310
 Take a look! How could it be !? 

00:01:37.769 --> 00:01:39.775
 Damn, he's dirty! 

00:03:01.595 --> 00:03:03.290
 How's the bullet taste? This dirty child! 

00:03:10.866 --> 00:03:12.897
 How does this guy die? 

00:03:31.098 --> 00:03:36.025
 A shitty guy who does not even need it. What the hell are you doing at night? 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.964
 The antenna has to go up higher. 

00:04:19.443 --> 00:04:23.556
 ... It was so good to be able to drink fresh air. 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.115
 If you go back alive, you can drink tired. 

00:04:27.786 --> 00:04:31.454
 Yes, you are going to live with this. 

00:04:32.035 --> 00:04:35.183
 I hope I can get back to work after I contact headquarters. 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.957
 Let's check the antenna wiring. 

00:05:09.957 --> 00:05:12.389
 It'll be fine now. I'll give it a try. 

00:05:13.113 --> 00:05:14.488
 Please work .. 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.673
 Here is [vermillion], headquarters .... 

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:22.383
 Oh, Brian. Are you both okay? 

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.766
 Good luck! 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.123
 Captain, Parker. This is a very bad situation now. 

00:05:29.731 --> 00:05:33.834
 I know. All of this was a plan by somebody. 

00:05:34.494 --> 00:05:35.580
 How did you know !? 

00:05:41.751 --> 00:05:45.096
 How do you know that? 

00:05:47.552 --> 00:05:50.588
 What is it, Captain !? Please say something! 

00:05:54.743 --> 00:05:57.045
 I'll wait a moment. It's an emergency. 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.501
 It's not possible! now... 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.091
 Commander O'Brien, emergency contact from ESF. 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.030
 It is said that abnormal activity is detected in the current satellite device. 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.354
 European Security Guarantee? Please continue. 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.764
 Okay. The solar system of Terra Grazia 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.195
 It is said to be restarted. 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.275
 It's already working, is not it? 

00:06:30.415 --> 00:06:33.400
 It looks like someone found out the location of [Queen Genovia] ... 

00:06:43.193 --> 00:06:45.844
 You have not changed at all. 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:51.140
 Parker! 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.416
 headquarters! What the hell is going on !? 

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:58.333
 The worst situation is evolving. The solar energy matrix has begun to work. 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.238
 They were disguised as cruise ships on the Mediterranean Sea 

00:07:00.245 --> 00:07:03.014
 I'm aiming for a secret azit in the belt. 

00:07:03.497 --> 00:07:05.748
 It's the satellite device that blew Terra Grazia! 

00:07:06.034 --> 00:07:09.711
 Right on our heads ... they do not have an ultimatum 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.619
 It's a blow to blow this place! 

00:07:12.417 --> 00:07:14.854
 Leader! Get us out of here! 

00:07:18.174 --> 00:07:23.204
 I'm really sorry ... I do not think so.
