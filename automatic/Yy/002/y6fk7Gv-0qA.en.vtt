my finger

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.780 
my finger
actually<00:02:14.000> I<00:02:14.320> used<00:02:15.320> dart<00:02:15.800> which<00:02:16.190> was<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.580> light

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
actually I used dart which was the light

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.270 
actually I used dart which was the light
brown<00:02:17.060> color<00:02:17.480> it's<00:02:18.290> a<00:02:18.350> bronzy<00:02:18.830> kind<00:02:19.040> of<00:02:19.100> color

brown color it's a bronzy kind of color
and<00:02:19.430> that<00:02:19.550> went<00:02:19.820> all<00:02:20.060> over<00:02:20.120> my<00:02:21.010> eyelids<00:02:22.390> and

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
and that went all over my eyelids and

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.540 
and that went all over my eyelids and
really<00:02:24.470> just<00:02:24.590> kind<00:02:24.830> of<00:02:24.860> patting<00:02:25.250> it<00:02:25.400> and

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
really just kind of patting it and

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.480 
really just kind of patting it and
smoothing<00:02:26.060> it<00:02:26.150> over<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.660> eyes<00:02:27.220> really<00:02:28.220> really

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
smoothing it over the eyes really really

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.490 
smoothing it over the eyes really really
quick<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:29.150> formulation<00:02:29.990> means<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.380> it

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
quick and the formulation means that it

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.100 
quick and the formulation means that it
doesn't<00:02:30.770> streak<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:31.460> then<00:02:32.330> I<00:02:32.570> took<00:02:32.690> the

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
doesn't streak and then I took the

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.600 
doesn't streak and then I took the
darker<00:02:33.770> brown<00:02:34.190> shade<00:02:34.700> and<00:02:35.480> that<00:02:35.780> is<00:02:36.080> called

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
darker brown shade and that is called

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.940 
darker brown shade and that is called
acute<00:02:37.610> and<00:02:38.050> use<00:02:39.050> that<00:02:39.080> just<00:02:39.530> on<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.740> outer

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
acute and use that just on the outer

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.800 
acute and use that just on the outer
corner<00:02:40.550> and<00:02:40.760> in<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:41.000> crease<00:02:41.240> just<00:02:41.570> to<00:02:41.660> really

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
corner and in the crease just to really

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.500 
corner and in the crease just to really
define<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.410> crease<00:02:42.650> a<00:02:42.920> little<00:02:42.980> bit<00:02:43.370> and<00:02:43.550> the

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
define the crease a little bit and the

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.660 
define the crease a little bit and the
outer<00:02:44.720> corner<00:02:45.200> so<00:02:45.320> it's<00:02:45.470> a<00:02:45.530> kind<00:02:45.830> of<00:02:46.100> smoky<00:02:46.640> eye

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
outer corner so it's a kind of smoky eye

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.050 
outer corner so it's a kind of smoky eye
but<00:02:47.030> not<00:02:47.330> really<00:02:48.020> too<00:02:48.320> much<00:02:48.850> smokey<00:02:49.850> is<00:02:50.030> a

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
but not really too much smokey is a

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.500 
but not really too much smokey is a
daytime<00:02:50.540> look<00:02:51.130> so<00:02:52.130> that<00:02:52.280> goes<00:02:52.550> on<00:02:52.700> as<00:02:52.940> well<00:02:53.180> and

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
daytime look so that goes on as well and

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.500 
daytime look so that goes on as well and
then<00:02:53.989> I<00:02:54.260> used<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.950> very<00:02:55.100> light<00:02:55.640> colored<00:02:56.180> shade

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
then I used the very light colored shade

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.270 
then I used the very light colored shade
which<00:02:56.810> is<00:02:56.989> called<00:02:57.170> precipice<00:02:57.770> it's<00:02:57.980> kind<00:02:58.220> of

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
which is called precipice it's kind of

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.040 
which is called precipice it's kind of
looks<00:02:58.459> like<00:02:58.520> a<00:02:58.610> lemony<00:02:59.150> shade<00:02:59.450> it<00:02:59.660> has<00:02:59.810> a<00:02:59.840> look

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
looks like a lemony shade it has a look

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.050 
looks like a lemony shade it has a look
at<00:03:00.140> least<00:03:00.320> on<00:03:00.560> it<00:03:00.709> and<00:03:00.860> using<00:03:01.489> a<00:03:01.580> different
