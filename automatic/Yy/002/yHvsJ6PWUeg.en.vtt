00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
small and they're really pretty and I

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.849 
small and they're really pretty and I
thought<00:00:31.050> these<00:00:31.230> would<00:00:31.349> be<00:00:31.439> really<00:00:31.500> fun

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
thought these would be really fun

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:32.990 
thought these would be really fun
because<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.160> lot<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.399> people<00:00:32.640> have<00:00:32.730> been<00:00:32.820> making

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
because a lot of people have been making

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.700 
because a lot of people have been making
these<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.960> can<00:00:34.110> just<00:00:34.260> be<00:00:34.350> really

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
these and you can just be really

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.190 
these and you can just be really
creative<00:00:34.950> with<00:00:35.219> these<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:35.840> every<00:00:36.840> bottle<00:00:37.020> is

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
creative with these so every bottle is

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.389 
creative with these so every bottle is
unique<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.710> that's<00:00:37.890> why<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.070> thought<00:00:38.219> it'd<00:00:38.370> be

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
unique so that's why I thought it'd be

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.130 
unique so that's why I thought it'd be
really<00:00:38.489> cool<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:38.910> make<00:00:39.030> them<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.110> first

put<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:53.970> bottle<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:55.439> mixed<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.860> some

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
put it in the bottle and I mixed it some

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.459 
put it in the bottle and I mixed it some
glue<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:56.969> I'm<00:01:57.270> just<00:01:57.509> gave<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.930> getting<00:01:58.140> moldy

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
glue so I'm just gave it getting moldy

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.719 
glue so I'm just gave it getting moldy
but<00:01:58.680> then<00:01:58.829> I<00:01:58.890> could<00:01:59.040> just<00:01:59.219> throw<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.549> out<00:01:59.670> and

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
but then I could just throw it out and

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.959 
but then I could just throw it out and
make<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.909> new<00:02:00.119> one<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:02.009> really<00:02:02.340> cool<00:02:02.670> and

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
make a new one so it is really cool and

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.370 
make a new one so it is really cool and

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
if you open it up it does smell really

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
which makes it even better and then I

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.330 
which makes it even better and then I
took<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.310> grass<00:03:06.550> idea<00:03:06.940> and<00:03:07.240> I<00:03:07.480> made<00:03:07.750> this<00:03:08.050> one

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
took the grass idea and I made this one

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.340 
took the grass idea and I made this one
which<00:03:09.340> has<00:03:09.730> some<00:03:10.030> sand<00:03:10.360> and<00:03:10.630> then<00:03:10.870> grass<00:03:11.140> at

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
which has some sand and then grass at

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.080 
which has some sand and then grass at
the<00:03:11.440> top<00:03:11.680> so<00:03:12.010> it's<00:03:12.160> kind<00:03:12.370> of<00:03:12.430> like<00:03:12.640> a<00:03:12.670> plant

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
the top so it's kind of like a plant

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.850 
the top so it's kind of like a plant
growing<00:03:13.420> inside<00:03:13.960> of<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.290> little<00:03:14.530> bottle

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
growing inside of the little bottle

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.060 
growing inside of the little bottle
which<00:03:15.490> is<00:03:15.640> really<00:03:15.910> cool<00:03:16.180> idea<00:03:16.480> and<00:03:16.990> then<00:03:17.980> I

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
which is really cool idea and then I

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.470 
which is really cool idea and then I
made<00:03:18.220> this<00:03:18.340> one<00:03:18.400> wish<00:03:18.670> it<00:03:18.790> was<00:03:18.880> a<00:03:18.910> fail<00:03:19.180> so<00:03:19.450> I

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
made this one wish it was a fail so I

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.500 
made this one wish it was a fail so I
just<00:03:19.690> stuffed<00:03:20.110> some<00:03:20.410> shells<00:03:20.709> in<00:03:20.890> here<00:03:20.920> and

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
just stuffed some shells in here and

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.610 
just stuffed some shells in here and
added<00:03:22.510> some<00:03:22.630> sand<00:03:22.930> but<00:03:23.170> it<00:03:23.260> didn't<00:03:23.500> really

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
added some sand but it didn't really

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.580 
added some sand but it didn't really
look<00:03:23.860> well<00:03:24.160> so<00:03:24.489> yeah<00:03:25.150> and<00:03:26.080> then<00:03:26.230> I<00:03:26.260> made<00:03:26.440> this

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
look well so yeah and then I made this

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.740 
look well so yeah and then I made this
one<00:03:26.800> which<00:03:26.920> is<00:03:26.950> kind<00:03:27.220> of<00:03:27.340> like<00:03:27.459> a<00:03:27.640> potion<00:03:27.970> so<00:03:28.450> I

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
one which is kind of like a potion so I

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.570 
one which is kind of like a potion so I
actually<00:03:29.080> forgot<00:03:29.440> what<00:03:29.590> I<00:03:29.650> put<00:03:29.830> in<00:03:29.920> here<00:03:30.130> but<00:03:30.310> I

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
actually forgot what I put in here but I

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.630 
actually forgot what I put in here but I
made<00:03:31.030> this<00:03:31.320> blue<00:03:32.320> substance<00:03:32.680> so<00:03:33.160> I<00:03:33.190> don't<00:03:33.459> even

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
made this blue substance so I don't even

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.970 
made this blue substance so I don't even
know<00:03:33.910> what<00:03:34.060> it<00:03:34.150> is<00:03:34.180> actually<00:03:34.510> at<00:03:34.810> all<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:35.170> I

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
know what it is actually at all and I

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.690 
know what it is actually at all and I
added<00:03:36.160> some<00:03:36.340> water<00:03:36.730> and<00:03:37.090> some<00:03:37.800> glue<00:03:38.800> and<00:03:39.100> this

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
added some water and some glue and this

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.130 
added some water and some glue and this
is<00:03:39.850> what<00:03:40.060> happened<00:03:40.450> so<00:03:40.600> I<00:03:40.630> think<00:03:40.930> it<00:03:40.989> looks

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
is what happened so I think it looks

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.240 
is what happened so I think it looks
really<00:03:41.200> cool<00:03:41.560> it<00:03:41.739> looks<00:03:41.890> like<00:03:42.010> a<00:03:42.040> little

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
really cool it looks like a little

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.940 
really cool it looks like a little
potion<00:03:42.670> from<00:03:42.820> Harry<00:03:43.060> Potter<00:03:43.120> or<00:03:43.540> something<00:03:43.950> so

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
potion from Harry Potter or something so

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.979 
potion from Harry Potter or something so
next<00:03:45.100> I<00:03:45.310> made<00:03:45.459> this<00:03:45.670> rainbow<00:03:46.269> sprinkles<00:03:46.750> one

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
next I made this rainbow sprinkles one

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.630 
next I made this rainbow sprinkles one
which<00:03:47.230> is<00:03:47.410> really<00:03:47.709> cool<00:03:47.890> and<00:03:47.950> simple<00:03:48.250> as<00:03:48.459> well

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
which is really cool and simple as well

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.509 
which is really cool and simple as well
and<00:03:48.880> it's<00:03:49.030> really<00:03:49.239> pretty

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
and it's really pretty

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.190 
and it's really pretty
then<00:03:51.519> I<00:03:51.550> made<00:03:51.970> this<00:03:52.180> one<00:03:52.239> filled<00:03:52.660> this<00:03:52.930> blue

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
then I made this one filled this blue

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.320 
then I made this one filled this blue
micro<00:03:53.590> marbles<00:03:53.739> which<00:03:54.100> is<00:03:54.250> again<00:03:55.000> really

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
micro marbles which is again really

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.420 
micro marbles which is again really
simple<00:03:55.720> but<00:03:56.200> the<00:03:56.500> colors<00:03:56.800> are<00:03:56.980> really<00:03:57.130> nice

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
simple but the colors are really nice

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.970 
simple but the colors are really nice
and<00:03:58.060> then<00:03:58.570> I<00:03:58.600> made<00:03:58.810> some<00:03:58.840> simple<00:03:59.290> ones<00:03:59.620> I<00:03:59.830> made

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
and then I made some simple ones I made

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.830 
and then I made some simple ones I made
this<00:04:00.190> purple<00:04:00.610> one<00:04:00.640> which<00:04:01.239> is<00:04:01.390> just<00:04:01.600> filled

with paint and micro marbles and glitter

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.479 
with paint and micro marbles and glitter
actually<00:04:05.530> not<00:04:05.650> my<00:04:05.800> brother's<00:04:06.040> just<00:04:06.280> glitter

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489
