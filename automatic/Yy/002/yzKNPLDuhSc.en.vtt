00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 much caution x coquito salgado 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.010
 Tells us how to choose the best tan 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.480
 today and it is there be with you hear one 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.429
 you are not going to put anything in your 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.190
 skin of appointment for the sun one has to 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.220
 look for one where freckles do not come out here 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.960
 difficult to fit or good maybe not the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.449
 blame the bronzer to the best in the 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.150
 skin that is not well taken care of and it gets 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.699
 one there in the sun at 85 hours but what is 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.310
 the best, better, better, better, cut into pieces 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.410
 good remember that it depends on the skin 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.989
 of each person not the other types are 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.520
 several and has to do with the with the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.469
 tonality of the skin that each 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.960
 person for example very people 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.210
 white with light eye blond hair are 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.129
 those that most risk run precisely 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.780
 because they can irritate your skin and are the 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.780
 they have to use a blocker 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.059
 much more intense because remember before 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.730
 of welding told us to use a 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.039
 blocker first of all and remember 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.559
 people who normally do not 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.930
 sun and reach the beach 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.769
 we believe the truth is that if we go to 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.650
 lie in the sun 34 hours 5 678 us 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.990
 let's put on good but very tanned and 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.090
 it's not like that we have to start has to 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.979
 be graduate ok you have to 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.540
 identify your skin type of course 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.060
 If you are very white you have to look for your 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.950
 High and good protector determine by 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.630
 example there is like also choosing a 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.509
 little bit according to the oils that you 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.130
 Use your tanning creams 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.720
 people who for example are very white 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.700
 they use the oils they have for 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.290
 example carrot pigment that 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.909
 normally you see that we have been told 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.770
 also that you drink lots of juices 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.180
 carrot before going to sun 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.060
 It helps a lot to the pigmentation of the skin 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.990
 but you will go determining according to 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.540
 your skin type 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.920
 the tan you're going to use now what 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.200
 what we have to do is 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.180
 first block the first 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.220
 of entry the best schedule for 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.250
 Tanning to kiss the first hours 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.469
 of the day and the last of the day ok sometimes 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.240
 we think that at 12 12 good is the 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.790
 better sun and we are there as you saw in the 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.860
 grill and then to turn around and that 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.200
 spend the night because everything burns you 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.539
 move because remember if you have not 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.209
 sunbathed little by little if we do not have 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.709
 because we are always working 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:18.120
 so if we have to do it from 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:21.480
 Gradually the first day the first 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.390
 day about 45 minutes and how much already 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.400
 it's a lot if 30 well 30 better equal 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.540
 you can put a very high blocker 7 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.349
 that you should stay a little bit more in the 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.180
 sun can be 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.019
 let's say better and leave it as the 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.019
 15-20 minutes 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.939
 I have a brawl tell me why 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.730
 someone thinks that if you put sunscreen 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:44.639
 no longer going to tan, that's a lie 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.049
 true long good novel it seems that the 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:48.150
 blocker that is going to be going is a 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.459
 movie that will repel the rays 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.769
 solar but what will happen if 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.709
 us after our blocker 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.359
 we are going to use our bronzer 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.669
 The sun is always going to have a 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:02.040
 reaction on your skin ok now when you 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:04.409
 are you using or are you going to choose your 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.180
 processor remembers that there are some that 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:07.950
 yes they can give us some allergy not 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.799
 all but there are people who are very 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.360
 delicate as we know if it's not going to 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.210
 cause allergy 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.810
 because it's involving sweat not the 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.460
 Sun I'm sorry already then we're going to take 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.650
 there are usually samples and we are going to 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.630
 get on our neck skin that 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.890
 the bun is very delicate and if something 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.690
 it's going to cause you reaction 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.270
 determine immediately in the neck 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.260
 ok then we are preventing now 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.550
 that we are all going on vacation 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.230
 but we can not go to the community of 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.090
 speaks grated and enough 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.070
 I do not think that you are going to 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.230
 go to the beach to the kids we also go 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.240
 to start with a blocker and then with 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.100
 bronzer and if you go you're already in the 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.680
 third day you can already stay about 40 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.720
 minutes in the sun but waters sometimes 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.970
 but we have with that misconception that 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.500
 you have to be many hours look 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.410
 Well, if you're going for a walk in the 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.930
 place where you are going to vacation 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.730
 during your bronzer and believe me sometimes 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.560
 you're going to get a lot more tan 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.660
 are you walking or are you walking to the 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.690
 shore of the beach that if you were there 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.750
 in the ica master the suggestion is that of 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.880
 your pink walk you go back 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.400
 obviously the color much more even 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.560
 because why are you giving this 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.850
 what are you doing a walk when 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.419
 you just stay in one 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.080
 position 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:27.870
 imagine two attentive and so much voltea ble 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.330
 for then they do not suffer not suffer 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.490
 that but here the important thing is the time 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.720
 that we're going to be very careful now 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.150
 I have told you that there is also 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.650
 sunscreen for hair today 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.509
 we are talking specifically if from 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.979
 the skin but if they look for that too 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.389
 have sunscreens because 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.850
 we are talking about tan 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.320
 ok but the hair is going to protect 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.110
 so if you are going to take that walk, 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.510
 enter the sea where you are also a 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.940
 sunscreen for hair that is 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.680
 with atomizer ok this secretary to 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.020
 say that I have a doubt what is the 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.490
 difference between the oil tanner 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.080
 and the cream suntan lotion every time 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.090
 we find the same factor of 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.550
 sunscreen and sometimes you do not know that 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.740
 it is the oil or the cream which is better 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.250
 or because one and the other both are very 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.620
 good ones 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.199
 It definitely has to do with every 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.509
 person I explain there will be people who 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:17.310
 They have very dry skin look good if 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:18.990
 you protect me your skin during all 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.050
 months that you're working not the 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.729
 you increase and you arrive and you put on a cream 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.949
 tanner that has less 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.870
 before let's suppose then that it's going to 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:29.969
 move to feel like chicharrón in the 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.520
 night because that skin was not prepared 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:34.830
 for the sun though then yes 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.559
 we use an oil then to 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.719
 skins let's say a little more moisturized no 

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:44.129
 and that does not suffer so much after the sun 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:46.020
 term are only serve go but what 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:47.789
 important is that you know your skin 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.039
 that you know the risks also that 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:52.439
 implies then that's when we're going to 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:54.180
 use the cream or the oil I suggest 

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:56.999
 that if the skin is very dry 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:00.089
 let's use the oil and if we do not use 

00:05:56.999 --> 00:06:01.800
 the tanning cream ok so it is 

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:03.809
 important to protect the skin and also 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.479
 after the sunny one gel there is no need 

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:08.669
 mix of aloe vera and aloe vera 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:11.430
 It's delicious and there are also fasts 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:13.139
 relaxing in the spray very very rich that 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.649
 they're going to prevent you from having that 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:18.210
 suffering of the sick and aloe vera 

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:19.620
 they're really good then let's go 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.389
 We now let Mr. preventing us from 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.189
 vacation babies please do not 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:24.830
 expose all that is very important 

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:27.050
 them and zero 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.580
 torner is a blocker but not 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.560
 expose them people for nothing perfect 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.210
 thank you very much because today we are going 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.800
 pagans on vacation but also 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.800
 we're going with candles
