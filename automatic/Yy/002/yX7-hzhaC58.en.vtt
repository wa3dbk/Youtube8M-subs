00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
any running so though I thought that we

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.930 
any running so though I thought that we
were<00:00:52.320> going<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.469> see<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.680> CM<00:00:52.980> Punk<00:00:53.280> interference

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
or Brad Maddox or something like that I

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.799 
or Brad Maddox or something like that I
was<00:00:56.730> surprised<00:00:57.059> about<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.360> because<00:00:57.629> that's

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
was surprised about that because that's

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.630 
was surprised about that because that's
that's<00:00:58.199> what<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.379> thought<00:00:58.620> last<00:00:58.859> week<00:00:59.010> didn't<00:00:59.550> I

Daniel<00:04:11.380> Bryan<00:04:11.740> he<00:04:11.950> really<00:04:12.220> had<00:04:12.340> some<00:04:12.520> segments

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
Daniel Bryan he really had some segments

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.310 
Daniel Bryan he really had some segments
in<00:04:13.000> the<00:04:13.060> middle<00:04:13.240> of<00:04:13.270> this<00:04:13.360> match<00:04:13.570> that<00:04:13.840> he<00:04:14.140> was

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
in the middle of this match that he was

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.260 
in the middle of this match that he was
kind<00:04:14.740> of<00:04:14.800> the<00:04:14.920> star<00:04:15.190> of<00:04:15.220> it<00:04:15.520> there<00:04:15.910> was<00:04:16.030> a<00:04:16.060> whole

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:16.270 
kind of the star of it there was a whole

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:19.200 
kind of the star of it there was a whole
part<00:04:16.480> i<00:04:17.380> think<00:04:18.250> was<00:04:18.340> about<00:04:18.549> three<00:04:18.820> quarters<00:04:18.970> of

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:19.210 
part i think was about three quarters of

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.150 
part i think was about three quarters of
the<00:04:19.270> way<00:04:19.330> through<00:04:19.420> the<00:04:19.690> match<00:04:19.840> where<00:04:20.170> he<00:04:20.739> put

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
the way through the match where he put

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.490 
the way through the match where he put
some<00:04:21.720> Dean<00:04:22.720> Ambrose<00:04:23.110> if<00:04:23.260> i<00:04:23.350> remember

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
some Dean Ambrose if i remember

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
and before he gets a chance that's

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:30.460 
and before he gets a chance that's
broken<00:04:28.370> up<00:04:28.639> and<00:04:28.880> he<00:04:29.660> puts<00:04:29.870> like<00:04:30.080> Seth<00:04:30.289> Rollins
