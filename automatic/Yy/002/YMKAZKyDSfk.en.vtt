City why I couldn't have said it better

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.760 
City why I couldn't have said it better
myself<00:01:13.790> if<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:14.939> were<00:01:15.119> him<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.930> would<00:01:16.110> prefer<00:01:16.320> city

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
myself if I were him I would prefer city

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.640 
myself if I were him I would prefer city
I<00:01:16.799> guess<00:01:17.540> what<00:01:18.570> why<00:01:19.790> because<00:01:21.320> unites<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> very

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
I guess what why because unites a very

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.890 
I guess what why because unites a very
great<00:01:22.950> club<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.090> think<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.450> challenge<00:01:24.810> is

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
great club and I think the challenge is

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.570 
great club and I think the challenge is
very<00:01:24.930> little<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.740> he<00:01:25.799> will<00:01:26.070> play<00:01:26.220> you're<00:01:26.460> in

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
very little that he will play you're in

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.840 
very little that he will play you're in
there<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.909> first<00:01:27.150> team<00:01:28.490> that's<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.640> good

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
there in the first team that's a good

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.670 
there in the first team that's a good
reason<00:01:30.270> they<00:01:31.110> don't<00:01:31.350> have<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.619> history<00:01:32.720> so<00:01:33.720> no

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
reason they don't have a history so no

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.929 
reason they don't have a history so no
they<00:01:34.920> have<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.460> lot<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.970> big<00:01:36.619> money<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.950> they

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
they have a lot a big money and they

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.390 
they have a lot a big money and they
spend<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.170> they<00:01:40.409> become<00:01:40.770> champion

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
spend it and so they become champion

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.539 
spend it and so they become champion
with<00:01:42.270> their<00:01:42.450> with<00:01:42.780> their<00:01:42.930> money<00:01:43.369> who<00:01:44.369> would

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
with their with their money who would

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.609 
with their with their money who would
you<00:01:44.729> choose<00:01:45.770> choose<00:01:47.930> Chelsea<00:01:48.930> would<00:01:49.470> you
