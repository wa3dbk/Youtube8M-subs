00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.850 
I think that just because a woman was
something<00:01:47.780> sexy<00:01:48.260> doesn't<00:01:48.560> mean<00:01:48.680> she's

something sexy doesn't mean she's

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.040 
something sexy doesn't mean she's
selling<00:01:49.370> sex<00:01:49.700> I<00:01:50.210> think<00:01:50.420> it<00:01:50.510> was<00:01:50.600> coming<00:01:50.930> from
