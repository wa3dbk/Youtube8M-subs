00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
remember what it's called but there we

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.470 
remember what it's called but there we
go<00:00:49.110> it's<00:00:50.070> just<00:00:50.160> some<00:00:50.489> Sanyo<00:00:51.239> action<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:51.930> there

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
go it's just some Sanyo action in there

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.080 
go it's just some Sanyo action in there
23.3<00:00:54.480> at<00:00:54.600> sixteen<00:00:54.989> volts

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.569 

see<00:00:59.750> I<00:00:59.780> don't<00:00:59.960> get<00:01:00.350> why<00:01:00.680> this<00:01:00.739> camera<00:01:01.280> has<00:01:01.430> to

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
see I don't get why this camera has to

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.719 
see I don't get why this camera has to
take<00:01:01.820> so<00:01:02.090> long<00:01:02.329> I<00:01:02.719> mean<00:01:03.410> it's<00:01:04.100> done<00:01:04.339> it<00:01:04.489> faster

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
take so long I mean it's done it faster

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.109 
take so long I mean it's done it faster
before<00:01:05.180> but<00:01:05.659> I<00:01:05.690> think<00:01:06.200> there's<00:01:06.619> times<00:01:07.119> that

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
before but I think there's times that

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:09.880 
before but I think there's times that
this<00:01:08.240> thing<00:01:08.509> just<00:01:08.720> wants<00:01:09.020> to<00:01:09.140> takes<00:01:09.350> you<00:01:09.799> know

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
this thing just wants to takes you know

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.070 
this thing just wants to takes you know
just<00:01:10.790> wants<00:01:11.030> to<00:01:11.090> go<00:01:11.240> slow<00:01:12.100> it<00:01:13.100> pisses<00:01:13.400> me<00:01:13.430> off

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
just wants to go slow it pisses me off

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.810 
just wants to go slow it pisses me off
there's<00:01:15.080> also<00:01:15.200> I<00:01:15.680> mean<00:01:15.830> I<00:01:15.979> got<00:01:16.130> a<00:01:16.159> question<00:01:16.430> for

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
there's also I mean I got a question for

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.930 
there's also I mean I got a question for
anybody<00:01:17.000> who<00:01:17.360> would<00:01:17.509> know<00:01:17.659> where<00:01:17.869> these<00:01:17.990> are

anybody who would know where these are

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.609 
anybody who would know where these are
these<00:01:19.940> speaker<00:01:20.479> connectors<00:01:21.020> I<00:01:21.229> just<00:01:21.470> have<00:01:21.560> to

if<00:01:24.350> I<00:01:24.440> pull<00:01:24.619> the<00:01:24.710> receiver<00:01:25.009> out<00:01:25.130> to<00:01:25.490> look<00:01:25.610> at<00:01:25.820> it

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
if I pull the receiver out to look at it

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.580 
if I pull the receiver out to look at it
or<00:01:26.030> something<00:01:26.299> and<00:01:26.930> why<00:01:27.110> is<00:01:27.170> it<00:01:27.229> gonna<00:01:27.380> come

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
or something and why is it gonna come

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.169 
or something and why is it gonna come
out<00:01:27.799> and<00:01:28.009> I<00:01:28.869> know<00:01:29.869> that<00:01:30.080> the<00:01:30.490> bottom<00:01:31.490> rails<00:01:31.910> on

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:32.179 
out and I know that the bottom rails on

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:33.790 
out and I know that the bottom rails on
each<00:01:32.390> of<00:01:32.539> these<00:01:32.600> are<00:01:32.869> the<00:01:32.960> negatives<00:01:33.410> just<00:01:33.679> by

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
each of these are the negatives just by

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.840 
each of these are the negatives just by
looking<00:01:34.160> oh<00:01:34.280> they're<00:01:34.429> all<00:01:34.550> connected

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
looking oh they're all connected

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
together that's the negative same thing

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.469 
together that's the negative same thing
over<00:01:38.929> here<00:01:39.050> the<00:01:39.830> tops<00:01:40.130> going<00:01:40.729> are<00:01:41.060> going<00:01:41.390> to

front speakers do this kinds there and
I'm<00:02:55.159> sure<00:02:55.400> that's<00:02:55.609> not<00:02:55.669> good<00:02:56.030> for<00:02:56.060> them

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
know somewhat funny for I can't imagine

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.240 
know somewhat funny for I can't imagine
having<00:04:54.360> the<00:04:54.479> oil<00:04:54.509> those<00:04:54.870> which<00:04:55.139> I<00:04:55.259> do<00:04:55.319> actually

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
having the oil those which I do actually

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.300 
having the oil those which I do actually
all<00:04:56.550> those<00:04:57.199> people<00:04:58.199> drop<00:04:58.590> some<00:04:58.800> contact

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
all those people drop some contact

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.420 
all those people drop some contact
cleaner<00:04:59.990> they'll<00:05:00.990> use<00:05:01.139> uh<00:05:01.289> this<00:05:01.949> stuff<00:05:02.250> up

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
cleaner they'll use uh this stuff up

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.950 
cleaner they'll use uh this stuff up
here<00:05:02.460> it<00:05:02.789> works<00:05:02.970> just<00:05:03.210> fine<00:05:03.330> I<00:05:03.479> know<00:05:03.720> that's

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
here it works just fine I know that's

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.080 
here it works just fine I know that's
probably<00:05:04.050> not<00:05:04.259> the<00:05:04.319> right<00:05:04.409> stuff<00:05:04.740> to<00:05:04.770> use<00:05:05.130> and

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
probably not the right stuff to use and

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.820 
probably not the right stuff to use and
if<00:05:06.210> I<00:05:06.330> can't<00:05:06.599> find<00:05:06.840> that<00:05:07.020> I<00:05:07.080> use<00:05:07.289> a<00:05:07.319> few<00:05:07.650> drops

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
if I can't find that I use a few drops

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.670 
if I can't find that I use a few drops
of<00:05:08.009> wd-40<00:05:08.669> I<00:05:08.970> know<00:05:09.659> it<00:05:09.840> works<00:05:10.020> just<00:05:10.229> fine<00:05:10.440> it's

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
of wd-40 I know it works just fine it's

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.499 
of wd-40 I know it works just fine it's
never<00:05:10.889> let<00:05:11.099> me<00:05:11.219> down<00:05:11.370> although<00:05:11.849> I<00:05:12.090> don't<00:05:12.360> use

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:12.509 
never let me down although I don't use

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:15.110 
never let me down although I don't use
very<00:05:12.599> much<00:05:12.840> of<00:05:13.259> it<00:05:13.380> I<00:05:13.560> use<00:05:14.099> it<00:05:14.130> just<00:05:14.520> enough<00:05:14.819> to

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
very much of it I use it just enough to

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.459 
very much of it I use it just enough to
stop<00:05:15.719> the<00:05:15.870> scratching<00:05:16.349> and<00:05:17.270> a<00:05:18.379> little<00:05:19.379> bit

extra to get them to move a little bit

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.300 
extra to get them to move a little bit
more<00:05:21.000> freely<00:05:21.539> and<00:05:21.599> you<00:05:22.319> know<00:05:22.590> that's<00:05:22.830> not<00:05:23.039> so

more freely and you know that's not so

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.740 
more freely and you know that's not so
difficult<00:05:24.180> to<00:05:24.509> turn<00:05:24.719> them<00:05:25.550> so<00:05:26.550> uh<00:05:26.580> and<00:05:27.539> a
