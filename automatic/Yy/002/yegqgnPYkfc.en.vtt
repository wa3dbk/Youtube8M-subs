00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.230
 well there was the word of Mario 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.730
 majul program that went back to being 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.210
 talking about the drug issue that is 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.010
 so in vogue in the media in this case to 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.080
 from the declarations of anibal 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.030
 pachano who did first in carlos paz 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.730
 with simon and then in a note to the 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.340
 magazine soon I think it 's in the 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.130
 another side of the message coin 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:27.240
 while paris 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.369
 creative and tells us I did not lose about 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.929
 how many neurons 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.719
 pergolini I say I do not believe what I did 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.110
 it is also more politically correct to me 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.149
 it seems without but it is not correct if it is 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.070
 another version seems to me that it does not read or 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.290
 He knows how to manage the media and if he goes to the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.489
 other jul that his friend like he has 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.899
 time to think what you are going to tell me 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.899
 traction up 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.149

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.149

 day before beginning any trial the 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:19.319

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.510

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.720
 Then he had the problem of dressing 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.670
 I was in the other theater 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.800

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.150
 do not listen to a note you were 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.760
 listening that I campaigned against 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.260
 of the showmatch juries 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.330

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:45.080
 work on ideas from the south in the previous one 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:48.160

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.160
 a one-time campaign 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:52.139
 to all the world 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.150
 I want to tell you the girls that 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.430
 they went through showmatch is heritage of 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.720
 showmatch that people on what scale 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.729
 that is not so well known and that in a 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.160
 moment for example is not a love anymore 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.860
 I say that he has been working for 40 years 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:08.270
 what is here and become these 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:10.199
 extreme books like a pasha I do not think 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.789
 two years 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:14.699
 one should take license 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:16.830
 techno action for the license go back to 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:18.900
 to line up their ducklings and then later 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.060
 of the seen but I did it in ballast 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.319
 for two months I think around a 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.319
 wasp 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:32.900
 Dancing when dancing no but I'm giving 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.900

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.629
 with waldo a duo 

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:57.430
 I from experience would not go back 

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:59.229
 expose in a reality with no 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.409

 work the most important thing is the family 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.460

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.349
