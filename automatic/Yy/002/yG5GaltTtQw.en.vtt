remember<00:02:51.650> those<00:02:51.980> parts<00:02:52.220> that<00:02:52.310> need<00:02:52.430> to<00:02:52.489> be

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
remember those parts that need to be

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.759 
remember those parts that need to be
taken<00:02:52.730> off<00:02:53.000> there's<00:02:53.840> actually<00:02:53.900> four<00:02:54.350> parts

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
taken off there's actually four parts

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:55.870 
taken off there's actually four parts
I'll<00:02:54.920> show<00:02:55.070> you<00:02:55.130> two<00:02:55.280> of<00:02:55.310> them<00:02:55.489> in<00:02:55.580> a<00:02:55.610> minute

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
I'll show you two of them in a minute

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.199 
I'll show you two of them in a minute
but<00:02:56.510> these<00:02:56.690> two<00:02:56.930> at<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.200> back<00:02:57.910> which<00:02:58.910> fitted

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
but these two at the back which fitted

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.729 
but these two at the back which fitted
on<00:02:59.420> here<00:02:59.630> did<00:02:59.959> have<00:03:00.050> a<00:03:00.110> little<00:03:00.200> bit<00:03:00.440> cut<00:03:00.590> out

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
on here did have a little bit cut out

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.320 
on here did have a little bit cut out
here<00:03:00.980> so<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.519> front<00:03:01.670> wheel<00:03:01.850> could<00:03:02.030> move<00:03:02.180> in

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
here so the front wheel could move in

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.330 
here so the front wheel could move in
and<00:03:02.480> out<00:03:02.569> there's<00:03:03.500> a<00:03:03.560> full<00:03:03.769> one<00:03:03.950> for<00:03:03.980> use<00:03:04.190> as<00:03:04.310> a

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
and out there's a full one for use as a

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.610 
and out there's a full one for use as a
static<00:03:04.700> model<00:03:04.970> but<00:03:05.540> if<00:03:06.200> you're<00:03:06.319> going<00:03:06.440> to<00:03:06.530> run

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
static model but if you're going to run

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.490 
static model but if you're going to run
it<00:03:06.739> like<00:03:06.860> me<00:03:07.069> then<00:03:07.760> it's<00:03:08.120> advisable<00:03:09.019> to<00:03:09.230> take

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
it like me then it's advisable to take

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.140 
it like me then it's advisable to take
both<00:03:09.830> of<00:03:09.860> them<00:03:10.100> off<00:03:10.250> completely<00:03:10.370> not<00:03:10.850> very

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
both of them off completely not very

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.590 
both of them off completely not very
completely<00:03:11.569> open<00:03:12.010> is<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.400> little<00:03:14.000> bag<00:03:14.330> of

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
completely open is the little bag of

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.130 
completely open is the little bag of
detail<00:03:15.319> parts<00:03:15.680> there's<00:03:16.489> the<00:03:16.670> two<00:03:16.850> red

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
detail parts there's the two red

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.030 
detail parts there's the two red
balances<00:03:18.140> that<00:03:18.200> actually<00:03:18.500> went<00:03:18.620> over<00:03:18.920> the

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
balances that actually went over the

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.060 
balances that actually went over the
rear<00:03:19.610> boga<00:03:19.970> here<00:03:20.209> and<00:03:20.620> there<00:03:21.620> to<00:03:21.650> be<00:03:21.860> removed

rear boga here and there to be removed
as<00:03:22.310> well<00:03:22.340> it<00:03:22.670> is<00:03:22.790> running<00:03:23.030> on<00:03:23.060> less<00:03:23.209> than<00:03:23.360> a

as well it is running on less than a

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.960 
as well it is running on less than a
thousand<00:03:23.780> millimeters<00:03:24.640> not<00:03:25.640> too<00:03:25.790> difficult

thousand millimeters not too difficult

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.520 
thousand millimeters not too difficult
really<00:03:26.390> probably<00:03:26.750> be<00:03:26.930> difficult<00:03:27.290> to<00:03:27.350> get<00:03:27.410> them

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
really probably be difficult to get them

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.990 
really probably be difficult to get them
backing<00:03:27.709> this<00:03:27.920> is<00:03:28.070> a<00:03:28.100> bit<00:03:28.280> fiddly<00:03:28.579> and<00:03:28.730> a<00:03:28.880> bit

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
backing this is a bit fiddly and a bit

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.530 
backing this is a bit fiddly and a bit
tight<00:03:29.269> but<00:03:30.070> apart<00:03:31.070> from<00:03:31.100> that<00:03:31.540> it's<00:03:32.540> okay<00:03:33.130> now

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
tight but apart from that it's okay now

tight but apart from that it's okay now
model<00:03:35.540> itself<00:03:38.590> weeds<00:03:39.590> quite<00:03:39.799> a<00:03:39.829> bit<00:03:40.040> this

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
model itself weeds quite a bit this

very little plastic detailing actually
um<00:03:47.739> as<00:03:48.739> you<00:03:48.829> see<00:03:48.950> from<00:03:49.070> the<00:03:49.220> front<00:03:49.400> it<00:03:50.109> actually

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
um as you see from the front it actually

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:53.199 
um as you see from the front it actually
looks<00:03:51.290> slightly<00:03:51.470> like<00:03:51.620> a<00:03:51.739> Dalek<00:03:51.980> which<00:03:52.820> yeah

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
looks slightly like a Dalek which yeah

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:54.819 
looks slightly like a Dalek which yeah
typical<00:03:53.600> of<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.810> Germans<00:03:54.260> to<00:03:54.500> go<00:03:54.620> with<00:03:54.799> a

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
typical of the Germans to go with a

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.560 
typical of the Germans to go with a
steam<00:03:55.040> locomotive<00:03:55.160> it<00:03:56.060> looks<00:03:56.209> like<00:03:56.329> the<00:03:56.420> most

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
steam locomotive it looks like the most

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.810 
steam locomotive it looks like the most
evil<00:03:56.690> race<00:03:56.959> in<00:03:57.109> the<00:03:57.170> universe<00:03:57.609> now<00:03:58.609> nothing

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
evil race in the universe now nothing

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.449 
evil race in the universe now nothing
against<00:03:59.209> Germans<00:03:59.620> so<00:04:00.620> what<00:04:00.829> fetus<00:04:01.160> is<00:04:01.310> this

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
against Germans so what fetus is this

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.789 
against Germans so what fetus is this
have<00:04:01.670> here<00:04:02.030> two<00:04:02.750> working<00:04:03.079> headlights<00:04:03.200> which

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
have here two working headlights which

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:04.810 
have here two working headlights which
is<00:04:03.890> actually<00:04:04.010> quite<00:04:04.220> strange<00:04:04.670> because

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
is actually quite strange because

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.970 
is actually quite strange because
usually<00:04:05.120> it's<00:04:05.450> got<00:04:05.570> three<00:04:05.930> it's<00:04:06.500> got<00:04:06.680> two<00:04:06.859> at

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
usually it's got three it's got two at

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.440 
usually it's got three it's got two at
the<00:04:07.010> bottom<00:04:07.310> and<00:04:07.430> usually<00:04:07.940> it<00:04:08.000> has<00:04:08.090> one<00:04:08.269> at<00:04:08.390> the

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
the bottom and usually it has one at the

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.819 
the bottom and usually it has one at the
top<00:04:08.600> for<00:04:08.780> the<00:04:08.810> oncoming<00:04:09.079> trains<00:04:09.440> but<00:04:09.590> this<00:04:09.709> one

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
top for the oncoming trains but this one

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.099 
top for the oncoming trains but this one
doesn't<00:04:09.980> for<00:04:10.190> some<00:04:10.310> reason<00:04:10.640> an<00:04:10.760> idea<00:04:11.090> why<00:04:11.269> but

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
doesn't for some reason an idea why but

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:13.120 
doesn't for some reason an idea why but
force<00:04:12.320> of<00:04:12.410> the<00:04:12.470> front<00:04:12.680> they're<00:04:12.799> actually

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
force of the front they're actually

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.849 
force of the front they're actually
solid<00:04:13.579> these<00:04:13.760> buffers<00:04:14.440> yeah<00:04:15.440> but<00:04:15.620> we<00:04:15.680> do<00:04:15.769> have

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
solid these buffers yeah but we do have

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:17.860 
solid these buffers yeah but we do have
sprung<00:04:16.370> buffers<00:04:16.669> at<00:04:16.789> the<00:04:16.850> back<00:04:17.030> come<00:04:17.630> to<00:04:17.750> them

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
sprung buffers at the back come to them

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.740 
sprung buffers at the back come to them
in<00:04:17.959> a<00:04:18.019> minute<00:04:18.760> as<00:04:19.760> you<00:04:19.910> can<00:04:20.000> see<00:04:20.090> it's<00:04:20.209> a<00:04:20.239> 484

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
in a minute as you can see it's a 484

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.260 
in a minute as you can see it's a 484
steam<00:04:20.989> locomotive<00:04:21.729> as<00:04:22.729> far<00:04:22.940> as<00:04:22.970> no<00:04:23.090> it's<00:04:23.210> the

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
steam locomotive as far as no it's the

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.120 
steam locomotive as far as no it's the
only<00:04:23.599> ever<00:04:23.900> German<00:04:24.380> steam<00:04:24.590> locomotive<00:04:25.099> that

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
only ever German steam locomotive that

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.560 
only ever German steam locomotive that
was<00:04:25.250> a<00:04:25.340> 484<00:04:26.000> Boston

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
was a 484 Boston

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.710 
was a 484 Boston
as<00:04:26.720> a<00:04:26.750> northern<00:04:27.790> look<00:04:28.790> inside<00:04:29.000> the<00:04:29.120> cab<00:04:29.330> you

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
as a northern look inside the cab you

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.840 
as a northern look inside the cab you
can't<00:04:30.140> really<00:04:30.770> see<00:04:30.920> it<00:04:31.250> even<00:04:31.370> if<00:04:31.520> I<00:04:31.610> bring<00:04:31.730> it

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
can't really see it even if I bring it

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.480 
can't really see it even if I bring it
close<00:04:32.090> but<00:04:32.840> I<00:04:33.080> can<00:04:33.470> just<00:04:33.650> see<00:04:33.800> them<00:04:33.950> as<00:04:34.010> to<00:04:34.280> cab

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
close but I can just see them as to cab

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.860 
close but I can just see them as to cab
figures<00:04:34.820> in<00:04:34.940> there<00:04:35.120> so<00:04:35.360> it<00:04:35.450> does<00:04:35.570> a<00:04:35.600> bit<00:04:35.720> out<00:04:35.840> of

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
figures in there so it does a bit out of

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.470 
figures in there so it does a bit out of
focus<00:04:36.050> and<00:04:36.410> the<00:04:37.130> cab<00:04:37.280> details<00:04:37.670> pretty<00:04:38.300> sweet

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
focus and the cab details pretty sweet

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
focus and the cab details pretty sweet

3d<00:04:54.050> as<00:04:54.170> well<00:04:54.350> and<00:04:54.620> it<00:04:55.460> looks<00:04:55.580> like<00:04:55.670> this<00:04:55.880> is

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
3d as well and it looks like this is

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.550 
3d as well and it looks like this is
actually<00:04:56.180> a<00:04:56.210> sliding<00:04:56.720> cover<00:04:56.870> this<00:04:57.140> is<00:04:57.260> this<00:04:57.410> is

actually a sliding cover this is this is
solid<00:04:57.950> on<00:04:58.220> the<00:04:58.280> model<00:04:58.670> but<00:04:58.730> on<00:04:58.850> the<00:04:58.940> real<00:04:59.090> when

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
solid on the model but on the real when

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.840 
solid on the model but on the real when
it<00:04:59.330> looks<00:04:59.480> like<00:04:59.600> it's<00:04:59.720> slid<00:04:59.990> over<00:05:00.320> to<00:05:00.980> protect

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850

working head well taillights even the
other<00:05:17.060> actually<00:05:17.450> headlights<00:05:18.320> is<00:05:18.500> just<00:05:18.680> for

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
other actually headlights is just for

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.890 
other actually headlights is just for
running<00:05:18.950> in<00:05:19.160> reverse<00:05:19.600> ever<00:05:20.600> seen<00:05:20.750> as<00:05:20.840> this

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
running in reverse ever seen as this

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.900 
running in reverse ever seen as this
model<00:05:21.170> doesn't<00:05:21.320> have<00:05:21.500> a<00:05:21.530> front<00:05:21.770> coupler<00:05:22.130> it

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
model doesn't have a front coupler it

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.070 
model doesn't have a front coupler it
looks<00:05:23.120> like<00:05:23.150> it's<00:05:23.360> very<00:05:23.540> difficult<00:05:23.690> to<00:05:23.900> fit<00:05:24.050> a

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
looks like it's very difficult to fit a

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.380 
looks like it's very difficult to fit a
front<00:05:24.290> coupler<00:05:24.620> then<00:05:25.190> you<00:05:25.820> don't<00:05:26.000> really<00:05:26.150> use

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
front coupler then you don't really use

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.450 
front coupler then you don't really use
that<00:05:26.420> when<00:05:26.750> it's<00:05:26.870> running<00:05:26.930> light<00:05:27.200> loco<00:05:27.590> one

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
that when it's running light loco one

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.590
