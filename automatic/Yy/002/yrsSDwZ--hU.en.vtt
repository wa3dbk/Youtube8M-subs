00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.080 
know we'll figure it out
but<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:55.350> far<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.770> plan<00:01:55.979> doesn't<00:01:56.399> really<00:01:56.790> have

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
but so far the plan doesn't really have

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:07.430 
but so far the plan doesn't really have
any<00:01:57.270> end<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.719> it

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.740 

that's<00:02:08.440> our<00:02:09.509> 240<00:02:10.509> watt<00:02:10.690> sharp<00:02:11.410> solar<00:02:12.370> panel

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
that's our 240 watt sharp solar panel

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.320 
that's our 240 watt sharp solar panel
inside<00:02:13.750> we<00:02:14.349> have<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.580> 1000<00:02:15.580> watt<00:02:15.670> pure<00:02:16.060> sine

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
inside we have a 1000 watt pure sine

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
our 24 240 watt panel we basically just

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.910 
our 24 240 watt panel we basically just
never<00:02:31.720> really<00:02:32.050> have<00:02:32.200> to<00:02:32.319> worry<00:02:32.500> about<00:02:32.590> power

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
never really have to worry about power

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.460 
never really have to worry about power
it's<00:02:33.370> been<00:02:33.730> really<00:02:33.940> really<00:02:34.090> nice<00:02:34.330> we<00:02:34.630> just<00:02:34.840> run

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
it's been really really nice we just run

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.220 
it's been really really nice we just run

power tools we run a coffee maker charge
our<00:02:38.410> laptops<00:02:39.160> and<00:02:39.489> we<00:02:39.519> just<00:02:39.790> don't<00:02:39.940> worry

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150

our laptops and we just don't worry
about<00:02:40.239> it<00:02:40.420> so<00:02:41.200> Simon<00:02:41.739> will<00:02:41.769> be<00:02:41.980> working<00:02:42.250> for

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
about it so Simon will be working for

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.930 
about it so Simon will be working for
Airbnb<00:02:43.239> most<00:02:43.989> of<00:02:44.140> our<00:02:44.230> trip<00:02:44.549> and<00:02:45.549> we<00:02:45.700> can<00:02:45.730> do

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
Airbnb most of our trip and we can do

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.650 
Airbnb most of our trip and we can do
that<00:02:46.060> remotely<00:02:46.420> and<00:02:46.930> then<00:02:47.680> I'm<00:02:48.610> going<00:02:49.360> to<00:02:49.390> try

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
that remotely and then I'm going to try

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.860 
that remotely and then I'm going to try
to<00:02:50.430> continue<00:02:51.430> my<00:02:51.610> own<00:02:51.760> artistic<00:02:52.090> career<00:02:52.540> and

meet up with different artists along the

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.490 
meet up with different artists along the
road<00:02:54.430> hopefully<00:02:54.880> apply<00:02:55.390> for<00:02:55.690> some<00:02:55.810> grants<00:02:56.290> and

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
road hopefully apply for some grants and

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.770 
road hopefully apply for some grants and
I've<00:02:57.310> also<00:02:57.519> been<00:02:57.700> looking<00:02:57.849> at<00:02:58.209> writing<00:02:58.510> jobs

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
I've also been looking at writing jobs

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.039 
I've also been looking at writing jobs
online<00:02:58.989> small<00:02:59.890> writing<00:03:00.099> jobs<00:03:00.370> here<00:03:00.700> and<00:03:00.790> there

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
online small writing jobs here and there

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.860 
online small writing jobs here and there
making<00:03:02.049> money<00:03:02.200> on<00:03:02.349> the<00:03:02.440> road<00:03:02.620> is<00:03:02.799> definitely

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
making money on the road is definitely

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.449 
making money on the road is definitely
definitely<00:03:04.870> a<00:03:05.140> huge<00:03:05.380> plus<00:03:05.650> and<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:06.220> fact<00:03:06.400> that

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
definitely a huge plus and the fact that

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.210 
definitely a huge plus and the fact that
we're<00:03:06.609> able<00:03:06.730> to<00:03:06.910> do<00:03:07.060> that<00:03:07.209> is<00:03:07.329> really<00:03:07.510> huge<00:03:08.220> but

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
we're able to do that is really huge but

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.550 
we're able to do that is really huge but
we're<00:03:09.850> not<00:03:10.000> relying<00:03:10.510> on<00:03:10.750> it<00:03:10.930> either<00:03:11.079> because

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
we're not relying on it either because

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.259 
we're not relying on it either because
we've<00:03:11.739> been<00:03:11.920> saving<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:12.489> working<00:03:12.850> towards

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
we've been saving and working towards

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.300 
we've been saving and working towards
this<00:03:13.450> for<00:03:13.510> a<00:03:13.720> while<00:03:13.870> or<00:03:14.530> we're<00:03:14.890> setting

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
this for a while or we're setting

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.550 
this for a while or we're setting
ourselves<00:03:15.430> up<00:03:15.820> so<00:03:15.850> that<00:03:16.120> we<00:03:16.239> have<00:03:16.269> enough<00:03:16.840> to

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
ourselves up so that we have enough to

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.740 
ourselves up so that we have enough to
do<00:03:17.769> each<00:03:18.190> leg<00:03:18.519> of<00:03:18.670> our<00:03:18.760> trip<00:03:18.819> before<00:03:19.450> we<00:03:19.480> ever

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
do each leg of our trip before we ever

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.880 
do each leg of our trip before we ever
set<00:03:20.019> out<00:03:20.049> to<00:03:20.170> go<00:03:20.410> do<00:03:20.590> it

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
set out to go do it

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.490 
set out to go do it
so<00:03:21.340> if<00:03:21.700> why<00:03:21.970> everything<00:03:22.359> else<00:03:22.540> fails<00:03:22.810> we<00:03:23.319> can

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
so if why everything else fails we can

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.500 
so if why everything else fails we can
still<00:03:23.680> do<00:03:23.799> the<00:03:23.950> trip<00:03:24.160> I<00:03:24.489> guess<00:03:25.239> our<00:03:25.329> first

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
still do the trip I guess our first

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.020 
still do the trip I guess our first

inspiration for doing the van life was I
bought<00:03:28.390> Simon<00:03:28.750> a<00:03:28.810> book<00:03:29.019> from<00:03:29.709> a<00:03:29.799> store<00:03:30.100> I<00:03:30.190> was

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
bought Simon a book from a store I was

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.210 
bought Simon a book from a store I was
working<00:03:30.760> at<00:03:30.910> called<00:03:31.630> Maddy<00:03:31.870> on<00:03:32.079> things<00:03:32.350> and<00:03:32.799> it

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
working at called Maddy on things and it
