shots<00:03:38.980> in<00:03:39.980> the<00:03:40.280> leg<00:03:40.959> with<00:03:41.959> a<00:03:41.989> blood<00:03:42.350> thinner

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
shots in the leg with a blood thinner

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.720 
shots in the leg with a blood thinner
for<00:03:43.880> the<00:03:43.940> last<00:03:44.060> couple<00:03:44.299> days<00:03:44.920> and<00:03:45.920> today<00:03:46.459> I

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
for the last couple days and today I

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.750 
for the last couple days and today I
don't<00:03:47.510> know<00:03:47.720> what<00:03:47.900> he<00:03:48.049> did<00:03:48.320> but<00:03:49.160> it<00:03:49.310> hurts<00:03:49.519> so

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760

thanks and then earlier today I had some
yogurt<00:04:59.020> but<00:05:00.020> that's<00:05:00.850> kind<00:05:01.850> of<00:05:01.940> been<00:05:02.180> it<00:05:02.560> last

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
yogurt but that's kind of been it last

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.060 
yogurt but that's kind of been it last
night<00:05:03.860> I<00:05:04.160> was<00:05:05.030> able<00:05:05.180> to<00:05:05.330> have<00:05:05.600> a<00:05:05.900> little<00:05:06.650> bit<00:05:06.889> of

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
night I was able to have a little bit of

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.770 
night I was able to have a little bit of
chicken<00:05:08.110> but<00:05:09.110> I<00:05:09.910> didn't<00:05:10.910> want<00:05:11.090> very<00:05:11.360> much<00:05:11.479> of

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
chicken but I didn't want very much of

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:19.779 
chicken but I didn't want very much of
it<00:05:11.960> so<00:05:12.949> I<00:05:14.889> think<00:05:17.590> I'll<00:05:18.590> probably<00:05:18.830> manage<00:05:19.490> to

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789 
it so I think I'll probably manage to

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:25.680 
it so I think I'll probably manage to
lose<00:05:19.970> a<00:05:20.470> fair<00:05:21.470> amount<00:05:21.770> of<00:05:22.210> weight<00:05:23.560> from<00:05:24.560> this

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
lose a fair amount of weight from this

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.210 
lose a fair amount of weight from this
unfortunately<00:05:26.889> I'm<00:05:27.889> not<00:05:27.950> being<00:05:28.430> able<00:05:28.580> to<00:05:28.880> eat

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:06.870 
honestly say that if I would have known
how<00:07:01.070> much<00:07:01.780> this<00:07:02.780> actually<00:07:03.880> takes<00:07:04.880> out<00:07:05.090> of<00:07:05.300> you

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:06.880 
how much this actually takes out of you

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.770 
how much this actually takes out of you
and<00:07:07.880> how<00:07:08.060> hard<00:07:08.330> it<00:07:08.539> is<00:07:08.720> I<00:07:09.130> don't<00:07:10.130> think<00:07:10.400> I<00:07:10.780> would

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:11.780 
and how hard it is I don't think I would

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.930 
and how hard it is I don't think I would
have<00:07:11.870> had<00:07:12.400> this<00:07:13.400> surgery<00:07:14.380> at<00:07:15.380> least<00:07:15.789> not<00:07:16.789> the
