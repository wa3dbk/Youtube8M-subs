00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:05.299
 Two trucks from Antje Lenz have been designed for corporate fashion 

00:00:09.529 --> 00:00:12.529
 now alone 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:18.629
 and to be very helpful »has turned green 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.029
 Themes at the Phantoms stood here 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.029
 it is a testament the Postprint 11 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.289
 Herne now we are 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.760
 and that on the 8th 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.100
 he crouches and Hesse we have a few ways and that is allowed 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.270
 I am Schumacher 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.180
 departure at Zurek momentum 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.520
 and drink the hiogi de salt sticks 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.130
 because this stone is laid it can be had over this part here and then 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.320
 followed by the next triple stone iron 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.950
 the guide values ​​have to look there 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.000
 and he here 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.360
 to have for you 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.300
 and steers the city on one level the battery life and the other stood up 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.490
 the other level 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.130
 The one laughs mostly in Manzini's last algorithm 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.530
 yes we have the three stand Traunstein 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.500
 So the two decided here 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.180
 then we have yes 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.710
 anyway 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.940
 Bathing play compact fit 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.940
 he undercut 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.640
 and 10 Petersburg 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.220
 and thus the next milestone Douglas 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.510
 that is solved the system is 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.500
 and so turned 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.650
 is a veteran of this point 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.220
 Rooms the next astonishment 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.220
 with that gives the minister 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.080
 Percent of the orders have no time, that's just the way it is here 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.160
 it was close 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.990
 when we become now 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.349
 that is solved and succeeds 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.349
 if not everyone is not such a nice meal 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:17.049
 it stays there too 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.359
 Bolt percent 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:21.919
 no medium to respect new stable 

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:23.649
 a very slightly hurt 

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:25.889
 how to do 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:28.049
 thanks to the solution come shortly 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:29.539
 until then 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:32.209
 have to go to the Turks 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.269
 we present ourselves 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.269
 Cross done 

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:47.109
 Mr. Mansen Steinen to he must adhere to the situation and must to this position 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.159
 how do the two make 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:53.099
 and then Utd turns 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.760
 because Heinrich Hiep increase three and that is then just one of SAP 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.349
 how do mm to press the stairs 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.879
 now our first home game is over - that is 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.199
 we can take another 

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:12.429
 I always search to start CHIO in Aachen 

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:14.549
 yesterday stopped the arising 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.680
 "You can with these to Pauli Dr then they lost the short and Bernd Moss 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.889
 and the 7th 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:25.059
 With SQOOM I started trading again here the trees high carrier trade 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.629
 came to fruition 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.629
 to count 

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:36.779
 and back again 

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:41.189
 the school is we call ourselves the taxes 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:43.009
 he had to go 

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:45.579
 and that is us 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:46.899
 Hagen 

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:50.449
 here are the ones that the Romans arrest out of this other algorithm 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:52.539
 and percent 

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:55.539
 he must go up here as the Russians 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:59.129
 Michel hand in contact here 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.369
 with dead off 

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:04.579
 not clear for this time either 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:05.719
