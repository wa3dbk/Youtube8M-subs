00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.240
 to you about the split-play alias this 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.390
 classic board game on 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.099
 associations in which you will 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:21.910
 explain to other players the words not 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:25.570
 while calling them themselves long bright 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:28.060
 boxes folding box chips sand 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.179
 clock and a few piles of cards 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.080
 players are divided into teams of at least 2 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.860
 human 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:38.070
 each team gets its chip 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.809
 installing it on the starting field 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.780
 players decide whether they will play 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:47.079
 Russian or English language mixing 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.969
 right side of cards down each turn 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.230
 one of the team members will 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.469
 explains the words 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.809
 and the rest to guess them 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.390
 the hourglass rolls over and 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.340
 the explanatory opens the first card to him 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.399
 need to explain to my colleagues 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.280
 team words under that number on which 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.590
 worth team 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.929
 he explains the words associatively not 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.280
 calling him and not using 

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:16.450
 common words 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.890
 for example the wife of dads and moms and if the players 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.840
 guess the words 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.080
 this card is put off and 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.649
 guesser pulls the next as soon as 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.750
 time is over all of the card data 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:32.110
 counted and the team does so much 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.959
 same steps forward if the same team 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.929
 wrong and the other team notices 

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:40.599
 for this relies a minus penalty 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.920
 a point is also a player can, by decision 

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:45.369
 get a minus 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.470
 to skip a compound word if by 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.810
 the results of moving team trick 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.420
 stopped or crossed the cage with 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.179
 black number on the next turn she 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.940
 explains the glory to all and not just their 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:01.869
 it does not use hourglass 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:05.110
 and the team explains 5 cards and wins 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:09.190
 In the game, the team that will pass 1 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:12.099
 field full circle areas or say otherwise 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.870
 This is a simple association game without 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.790
 additional complications like 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.340
 drawing or pantomime 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.380
 and the presence in the game box of cards on 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.080
 two languages 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.700
 Immediately it may also be a good help in 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.700
