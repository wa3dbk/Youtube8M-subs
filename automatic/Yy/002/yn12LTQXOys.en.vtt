00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.000
 Good day friends his lighthouse 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.629
 squeezy and today we want 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.089
 really talk about such a hero as doom 

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:14.360
 Chic Hero Chic Lesnik Chic 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:18.289
 initiator and i need to consider creeps 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.869
 which can help you overall win 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.269
 first creep game as you see this 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.619
 the troll who I net and have 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:31.339
 resurrection as it were cool as if the grid to 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:34.070
 catch oh oh catches how much she seconds 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:36.800
 she catch on 1 7 5 seconds this is a lot of it 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.940
 really much resurrection how would 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.789
 cool we can easily farm yes but 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:49.629
 let's look at manacost 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:51.739
 manacost there 150 in the mesh and 50 in 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.989
 resurrection of these general skeletons 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.929
 calling the thing is it's too 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:01.609
 much is it really too much for home 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:03.410
 on the first shafts and in these there are more 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.780
 cool passivka that can be 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:09.310
 knit so this option we don't 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.760
 consider going further next clip 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.650
 second skill 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.900
 it turns out usa bear after 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.920
 how she changed and added speed 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.180
 attacks it became really very 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.950
 abundant can even help you 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.260
 when pushing 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.780
 but what will the deceleration do that is 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.030
 our thunder clap 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.150
 need a dagger well or need to run away through 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.580
 the second as I do not know how to do it 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.980
 but this option is only being considered 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.770
 for active push but because there is 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.790
 attack speed but accordingly so that 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.440
 was good let him collect vladimir and 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.300
 probably 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.710
 damn it knows nowhere is the topic 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.420
 will be 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.160
 You can start it, but this is also not the best 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.320
 option there are options much much 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:01.460
 better this option is considered only 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:05.020
 probably somewhere in the first 5-7 minutes 5 to 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.850
 7 minutes and there you can find out 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.729
 I think with this guy no questions 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.610
 will arise need dagger naturally need 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:17.360
 just fly and press the mill good 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:20.209
 pretty long lasting damage of course 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.630
 little but everything was cool before it was passive 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:26.990
 now it is not there is a shame but the camp is quite 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.660
 very usable for very gangs 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.720
 even good so we buy dagger take 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:36.700
 centaur and not for perry gangs you all 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.470
 lines we collect ourselves radiance a good topic 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.390
 another ability which i consider 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.660
 pretty nice increase it 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.850
 imagine the speed of movement and naturally 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.060
 allies by as much as twelve percent 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.850
 This is a lot because I think 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.620
 for example with aganim speed is very important 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.050
 movement because run and run 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.660
 and it is necessary to run side by side so without 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:03.110
 Questions can be used but should be 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:06.980
 Aganim and should be probably Shiva but from 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:10.910
 hands should we not weakly already beat here 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.280
 such a sofa is shorter understood this bunch 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.760
 with aganim run so close 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.470
 all well we got close to 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.070
 our beloved wolf 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:25.790
 most beloved just adored 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:29.600
 what little wolf have we creed and gives damage 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.850
 gives straight straight chic theme yes 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:36.170
 really gorgeous theme i'm not arguing 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:40.450
 but first you need to implement it 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:45.739
 need we gives pins need breastplate 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:47.690
 you need some slowdown and one more for us 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.480
 need a furion or we can in time to 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.180
 push because that particular clip will 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.570
 tuned more to this thing well if 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:01.940
 of course you can fight then take 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:03.440
 wolf I don't even know honestly in 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.870
 what case will he show himself better for 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.890
 Sola target of course purely for home for 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:12.410
 yourself to take this so-so idea for 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.780
 allies its still worth taking well and 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.280
 on him of course this is a free kreed but 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.299
 free creed powerful and 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.479
 oh paid creed can and in shape 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:26.729
 change this passive with something even more 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:29.159
 interesting so on the line on satyr satyr 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.340
 1 minute network will be very pleasant because 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:35.280
 what health legends plus four is 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.110
 very cool for push too 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.050
 not bad because the relief is health again 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.690
 4 well shockwave shock in Anna's exostomy 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:46.050
 pretty good damage which still 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.789
 and the UAE from us but quite such take 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.580
 first ten minutes but then of course 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:53.550
 worth me sat down on a wolf or a centaur 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:57.979
 This is not necessary either on a wolf or 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.979
 nasal and which we have not yet reached 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:05.050
 the next skill and longing for you banshee us 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:08.080
 gives a slowdown enter a minute probably 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.510
 40 plus is very good if you 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.480
 Of course, Janovic has already come to work because 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.850
 that just slowing down to slow down 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.300
 not take it it's worth it to 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.370
 catching up 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.800
 but assuming you have a big 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:24.900
 great damage here we put the conditions and 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.900
 please 1 more 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:32.930
 but also kind of recent and this is a scoop for 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.850
 what we need but need only 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.070
 the case if we collect the cuirass of his agnes 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.380
 and mecca because we will be giving away 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.700
 just heikki and splash just general 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.090
 unreal you can not imagine how now 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:47.090
 hands spread the wildest just auras 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.920
 we will give out 100 damage there plus 100 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.710
 of protection 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:55.550
 immortal team calling on demons and 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:57.920
 the like is generally a very cool topic 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.090
 If you are going to Bower very, very 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.330
 very very cool 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:04.400
 well i think tornan nobody uses it 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.940
 seriously well nobody wants 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.040
 stand just in touch some and watch 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.320
 on how you are beaten 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.420
 Well , in general, it was all there 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.360
 the bird is left but the bird for the house too 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.610
