00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
a physical keyboard first of all I'm

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.500 
a physical keyboard first of all I'm
going<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:25.070> I'm<00:00:26.070> going<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.519> overclock<00:00:26.970> my<00:00:27.300> cell

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
going to I'm going to overclock my cell

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.529 
going to I'm going to overclock my cell
phone<00:00:27.779> I'm<00:00:28.260> pretty<00:00:29.130> sure<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.910> safe

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
phone I'm pretty sure this is safe

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.139 
phone I'm pretty sure this is safe
I<00:00:30.570> mean<00:00:31.219> I'm<00:00:32.219> overclocking<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.880> from<00:00:33.059> the

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
I mean I'm overclocking it from the

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.500 
I mean I'm overclocking it from the
standard<00:00:34.010> 550<00:00:35.010> megahertz<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.790> 1<00:00:36.180> gigahertz

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
standard 550 megahertz to 1 gigahertz

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.860 
standard 550 megahertz to 1 gigahertz
and<00:00:37.070> it<00:00:38.070> gets<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.399> little<00:00:38.520> hot<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.420> seems<00:00:39.719> to

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
and it gets a little hot but it seems to

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.920 
and it gets a little hot but it seems to
run<00:00:40.020> pretty<00:00:40.379> well<00:00:40.469> actually<00:00:41.239> so<00:00:42.239> I'm<00:00:42.600> assuming

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
run pretty well actually so I'm assuming

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:51.410 
run pretty well actually so I'm assuming
that<00:00:43.789> it<00:00:44.789> will<00:00:45.090> not<00:00:46.160> fail<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.430> burn<00:00:50.420> anyway

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
that it will not fail and burn anyway

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.840 
that it will not fail and burn anyway
let's<00:00:51.719> load<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.140> emulator<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.980> called<00:00:53.370> PSX

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
this this is the game gripper for the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.250 
this this is the game gripper for the
motorola<00:01:11.520> milestone<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.900> just<00:01:13.140> a

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
motorola milestone and it's just a

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
motorola milestone and it's just a
plastic<00:01:13.770> piece<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:15.740> clip<00:01:16.740> on<00:01:16.920> top<00:01:17.130> of

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
plastic piece that you clip on top of

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.039 
plastic piece that you clip on top of
your<00:01:17.400> keyboard<00:01:17.610> like<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.689> actually

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
your keyboard like this and it actually

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.789 
your keyboard like this and it actually
works<00:01:19.259> really<00:01:19.409> well<00:01:19.909> but<00:01:20.909> uh<00:01:21.439> how<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.470> look<00:01:22.680> at

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
works really well but uh how I look at

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.700 
works really well but uh how I look at
this<00:01:22.890> game<00:01:26.479> see<00:01:27.479> if<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.720> can<00:01:27.900> actually<00:01:28.020> not<00:01:28.409> suck

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
this game see if I can actually not suck

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.620 
this game see if I can actually not suck
totally<00:01:29.189> alright<00:01:29.930> it<00:01:30.930> actually<00:01:31.259> runs<00:01:32.630> really

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
totally alright it actually runs really

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.789 
totally alright it actually runs really
well<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:33.960> think<00:01:34.640> for<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:36.259> whole<00:01:37.259> considering

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
well I think for a whole considering

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.319 
well I think for a whole considering
it's<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.070> PlayStation<00:01:38.610> emulator<00:01:39.000> on<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
it's a PlayStation emulator on the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.050 
it's a PlayStation emulator on the
stupid<00:01:40.020> cell<00:01:40.229> phone<00:01:40.439> or<00:01:41.009> not<00:01:41.400> stupid<00:01:41.759> it's<00:01:41.909> an

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
stupid cell phone or not stupid it's an

00:01:42.060 --> 00:02:00.539 
stupid cell phone or not stupid it's an
awesome<00:01:42.270> cell<00:01:42.659> phone

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.520 

also<00:02:01.549> you<00:02:01.610> can<00:02:01.880> use<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.360> there's<00:02:02.990> a<00:02:03.080> camera

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
also you can use the there's a camera

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.219 
also you can use the there's a camera
button<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:04.039> volume<00:02:04.450> you<00:02:05.450> can<00:02:05.630> use<00:02:05.750> those<00:02:05.990> as

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
button and volume you can use those as

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.199 
button and volume you can use those as
shoulder<00:02:06.560> buttons<00:02:06.890> for<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.520> emulator<00:02:07.729> if<00:02:08.119> you

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
shoulder buttons for the emulator if you

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:15.820 
shoulder buttons for the emulator if you
want<00:02:12.700> it<00:02:13.700> actually<00:02:14.000> works<00:02:14.180> pretty<00:02:14.330> well<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:15.620> I

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
want it actually works pretty well and I

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.589 
want it actually works pretty well and I
think<00:02:15.860> that<00:02:16.310> generally<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:17.180> framerate<00:02:17.420> is

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
think that generally the framerate is

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.809 
think that generally the framerate is
pretty<00:02:17.959> smooth<00:02:18.260> it<00:02:18.950> likes<00:02:19.160> a<00:02:19.310> bit<00:02:19.489> in<00:02:19.610> some

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
pretty smooth it likes a bit in some

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.380 
pretty smooth it likes a bit in some
places<00:02:20.090> but<00:02:21.670> most<00:02:22.670> of<00:02:22.819> the<00:02:22.940> time<00:02:23.150> it<00:02:23.360> actually

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
places but most of the time it actually

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.509 
places but most of the time it actually
runs<00:02:23.870> perfectly<00:02:25.810> there<00:02:26.810> might<00:02:27.049> be<00:02:27.519> slight

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
runs perfectly there might be slight

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.390 
runs perfectly there might be slight
input<00:02:29.390> lag<00:02:29.569> I<00:02:29.780> can't<00:02:30.049> really<00:02:30.230> tell<00:02:30.530> but<00:02:31.220> it's

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
input lag I can't really tell but it's

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.130 
input lag I can't really tell but it's
nothing<00:02:31.819> major<00:02:32.060> and<00:02:32.450> it's<00:02:32.569> definitely

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
nothing major and it's definitely

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:40.300 
nothing major and it's definitely
playable<00:02:37.959> yeah<00:02:38.959> I<00:02:38.989> mean<00:02:39.470> it's<00:02:39.920> nothing<00:02:40.099> that

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
playable yeah I mean it's nothing that

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.539 
playable yeah I mean it's nothing that
you<00:02:40.549> really<00:02:41.450> noticed<00:02:41.870> during<00:02:42.140> gameplay<00:02:42.549> so

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
you really noticed during gameplay so

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:49.839 
you really noticed during gameplay so
it's<00:02:44.090> just<00:02:44.239> a<00:02:44.480> good<00:02:45.849> that's<00:02:46.849> great<00:02:48.549> in<00:02:49.549> some

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
it's just a good that's great in some

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.300 
it's just a good that's great in some
cases<00:02:50.120> it<00:02:50.510> I<00:02:50.840> don't<00:02:51.470> know<00:02:51.560> anyway<00:02:52.280> I

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
cases it I don't know anyway I

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.099 
cases it I don't know anyway I
definitely<00:02:52.940> think<00:02:53.090> that<00:02:53.209> this<00:02:53.450> emulator<00:02:53.690> is

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.109 
definitely think that this emulator is

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.340 
definitely think that this emulator is
worth<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.709> it<00:02:55.370> costs<00:02:55.880> sakes<00:02:56.570> box<00:02:56.840> actually

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
worth the it costs sakes box actually

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.250 
worth the it costs sakes box actually
but<00:02:58.100> it<00:02:58.340> was<00:02:58.489> created<00:03:00.370> by<00:03:01.370> some<00:03:01.970> guy<00:03:02.180> called

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
but it was created by some guy called

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.360 
but it was created by some guy called
I<00:03:03.880> forgot<00:03:04.880> but<00:03:05.150> one<00:03:05.630> of<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.840> authors<00:03:06.260> was<00:03:06.680> I

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
I forgot but one of the authors was I
