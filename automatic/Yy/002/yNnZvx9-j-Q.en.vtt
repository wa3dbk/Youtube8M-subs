00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:21.960
 brides made in profile is desirable 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.489

 glue camp in favor 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.320
 the tolerance parameter must be set 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.110

 this value is increasing 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.430
 still criticized amid 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.300
 why make shift key 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.870
 and we lose the rest 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.380
 fragments he 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.520
 if there are areas in the silhouette 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.520
