00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 Tomato is a special mini review for 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:10.740
 VKontakte groups 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:15.870
 and the snow leopard here is a couple of tips wanted 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:19.109
 just to give to those who bought it in 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.180
 first after you bought it 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.670
 I advise you to tighten the chain if it 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.730
 weakened and own in the instructions all 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:31.949
 everything is written how to pull it up correctly 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:34.230
 then tighten the mounting presser gear 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.480
 this is the usual hexagons 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.520
 according to the same hexagon 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:45.210
 you can tweak the side mirrors because 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:49.230
 that they have a mess with a big 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:53.730
 speeds and accordingly change their 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.370
 location of what else is oil level 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:02.730
 naturally coolant level 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:05.250
 here as I advise you to go to 1 this here 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.810
 we have it 300 kilometers to 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.939
 actually again in the instructions all 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:14.869
 everything is written there in detail 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:19.979
 In general about everything but in principle you can 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:22.170
 ask more questions under this video by 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.880
 I'll post some more videos later 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:30.210
 overclocking I can't take one 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.180
 the camera is not goupro nothing yet here but 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.509
 plans to buy here and accordingly 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.759
 then I will overclock but it seems to me less 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.700
 10 seconds exactly one hundred develops 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.890
 vigorously enough for 250 cubes and 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:51.090
 he looks great he looks 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:54.200
 amazingly just here is the Jap ok 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.079
 that is, people are watching and really 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.049
 they don't even consider this snow leopard sticker 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:03.200
 which dark connect became unstuck here 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:06.020
 and fit ask what for motorcycle 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:10.970
 here holivary about japan and china i 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:13.730
 also not going to develop with you here 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.840
 everyone's opinion is the most important thing 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.030
 learn from it 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.080
 dramatically slow down that is, you accelerate 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:24.849
 and slow down sharply and so in critical 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:29.110
 situations understand how he behaves 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:33.860
 but finally let's turn it on 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:36.829
 motorcycle sound well true sound damn already 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:42.010
 a bunch of videos shot with this sound I drove 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:42.010
 by the way 371 kilometers on it 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.129
 until
