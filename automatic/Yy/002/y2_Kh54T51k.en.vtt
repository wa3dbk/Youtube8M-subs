 First of all it 's hard to find the cat's station square It's a situation where the station is not in the dark 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:31.449

 Looking back 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.880

 This is so cool This is the station square 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:03.180
 I 'm going to be useful from now on, so this is the direction of the arrows here 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.550
 It's a parking space for one day if you go there 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.010
 I can not say that 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.430
 here 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:14.950
 Here the way to the station This is the correct answer in front of the station 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:19.350
 So there there is suddenly this Hey automatic ticket gates to you the hands of the day nothing door ticket gate 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:24.480

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.950
 There is a nice waiting room for cats here 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.950
 In this waiting room 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.380
 Say this 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.610
 It This discovery button it because there is to say water I this discovery button 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.170
 I press this find button 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:47.180
 Then from here 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:50.730
 When you get off it came out really this softening body 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.840
 In the example conductor wonder if pay me I money 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.840
 This way at the station 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.710
 Station 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.710
 We also carry out a golden campaign like using more 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:28.670
 Yes much is this ne ne 2 people train is it down the train say that one went in 1 hour 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:31.840
 Diesel vehicles are'm not Do kidou car train 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.739
 Well this does not come for an hour 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:40.450
 This timetable of the timetable can be easy to understand 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:45.670
 Because anyway I 5 one for it because there are many of Tteyuu one which I all the time 1 hour to 1 hour 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:50.180
 Sometimes there is a time when there is no cat at all, but the train does not come at such time 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:55.519
 It's already very easy to understand. 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:57.980
 So , next to the find button, it's how you ride on the one-man train. 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:03.349
 O kneaded because difficult 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:06.840

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:16.300
 The coming came The up train that I should ride has done 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:20.080
 It's not a train or a train It's an up train 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:23.260
 There is only one place where this can be said 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:26.380
 This door won't get wet because it's difficult to find it quickly 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.860
 Where is oh oh so 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.860

 I was able to ride by I was able to ride without 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.329
 It is an echo 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.240
 Because this person is a one-man driver 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.150
 Kid's 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:31.990
