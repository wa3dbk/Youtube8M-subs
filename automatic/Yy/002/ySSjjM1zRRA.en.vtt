00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.910
 this is super you 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:12.780
 you can not see the current jumping 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.780
 there it is true let's see now 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:21.000
 the piston spark plug a number 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.080
 two 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.080
 we'll see 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:31.570
 as this one reminds nut is very very 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.910
 long let's see 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.300
 look at the central state normal use a 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.710
 little worn in has color 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.100
 cinnamon that is when it is 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.079
 good the fuel mixture remember 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.019
 that it must be cinnamon color if it is 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.970
 black is excess fuel if it is 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:53.350
 black but shiny as if it were 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:56.829
 paint oil consumption 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:01.710
 If it is white, lack of fuel or 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.710
 it is very low fuel mixture 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.190
 very new spark plugs let's see how it is 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.880
 the ceramic 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.370
 perfect not warm current remember 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.080
 that already in some courses we have given the 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.490
 shows how it looks when the 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.230
 current jumps dl from here of the connector 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.690
 towards the nut and you see some points 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:28.970
 blacks you see the black line as it provides 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.970
 let's check the spark plug number 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.420
 3 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.420
 of cylinder number 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.420
 you do not want to loosen you have to use another 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.759
 once a red 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.100
 our tool that's why I give you 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:53.170
 did this tool is to avoid 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:58.020
 barriers ropes also has a 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:01.020
 rope is impossible with this kind of 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.020
 tools
