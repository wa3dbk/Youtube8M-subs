now this little blowers about ten years
old<00:00:08.309> it's<00:00:08.429> got<00:00:08.580> it<00:00:08.670> to<00:00:08.760> come<00:00:08.910> say<00:00:09.150> eight

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
old it's got it to come say eight

horsepower<00:00:09.870> motor<00:00:10.139> on<00:00:10.380> it<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.710> it's<00:00:11.519> a

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
horsepower motor on it and it's a

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.879 
horsepower motor on it and it's a
24-inch<00:00:12.240> cut<00:00:12.660> now<00:00:13.200> it's<00:00:13.320> going<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.500> be<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.679> lot

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
24-inch cut now it's going to be a lot

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.799 
24-inch cut now it's going to be a lot
easier<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.429> do<00:00:14.549> this<00:00:14.730> job<00:00:14.969> if<00:00:15.179> your<00:00:15.360> blower<00:00:15.599> is

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
easier to do this job if your blower is

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.290 
easier to do this job if your blower is
standing<00:00:16.199> upright<00:00:16.440> like<00:00:16.680> this<00:00:17.060> what<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.180> want

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
standing upright like this what you want

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.240 
standing upright like this what you want
to<00:00:18.390> start<00:00:18.600> by<00:00:18.750> doing<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.410> loosening<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.010> four

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
to start by doing is loosening the four

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.070 
to start by doing is loosening the four
bolts<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:20.760> hold<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.060> cover<00:00:21.270> there's<00:00:21.840> one

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
bolts that hold the cover there's one

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.859 
bolts that hold the cover there's one
here<00:00:22.380> one<00:00:22.560> there<00:00:22.859> one<00:00:23.300> here<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.689> one<00:00:24.840> over

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
here one there one here and one over

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.109 
here one there one here and one over
here<00:00:25.340> remember<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.609> don't<00:00:26.760> have<00:00:26.939> to

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
here remember that you don't have to

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.509 
here remember that you don't have to
take<00:00:27.300> these<00:00:27.420> bolts<00:00:27.779> off<00:00:27.930> fully<00:00:28.410> just<00:00:29.070> loosen

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
take these bolts off fully just loosen

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.919 
take these bolts off fully just loosen
them<00:00:29.609> enough<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.150> cover<00:00:30.359> will<00:00:30.599> come<00:00:30.779> up

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
them enough and the cover will come up

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.220 
them enough and the cover will come up
so<00:00:31.710> these<00:00:31.920> bolts<00:00:32.250> are<00:00:32.340> all<00:00:32.399> 3/8<00:00:32.940> just<00:00:33.840> loosen

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
so these bolts are all 3/8 just loosen

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.360 
so these bolts are all 3/8 just loosen
the<00:00:34.320> moat<00:00:34.469> like<00:00:34.739> this<00:00:36.800> now<00:00:37.800> if<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.010> got<00:00:38.160> them

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
the moat like this now if you got them

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.069 
the moat like this now if you got them
loosened<00:00:38.579> out<00:00:38.879> like<00:00:39.090> this<00:00:39.300> that's<00:00:39.570> enough<00:00:39.870> on

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
loosened out like this that's enough on

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.549 
loosened out like this that's enough on
each<00:00:40.649> bolt<00:00:41.480> and<00:00:42.480> don't<00:00:42.780> forget<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.260> two<00:00:43.440> at

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
each bolt and don't forget the two at

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.010 
each bolt and don't forget the two at
the<00:00:43.649> bottom<00:00:44.270> now<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.329> can<00:00:45.570> just<00:00:45.750> pry<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
the bottom now you can just pry the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.180 
the bottom now you can just pry the
cover<00:00:46.350> out<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:47.219> here<00:00:51.379> now<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.440> can<00:00:52.680> see<00:00:52.920> inside

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
cover out of here now you can see inside

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.770 
cover out of here now you can see inside
here<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.149> part<00:00:54.360> we're<00:00:54.539> replacing

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
here this is the part we're replacing

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.770 
here this is the part we're replacing
the<00:00:55.440> friction<00:00:55.860> wheel<00:00:56.039> disk<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:57.449> can<00:00:57.600> see

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
the friction wheel disk and you can see

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.569 
the friction wheel disk and you can see
it's<00:00:57.899> pretty<00:00:58.050> flat<00:00:58.410> what's<00:00:58.859> happening<00:00:59.370> is

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
it's pretty flat what's happening is

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.000 
it's pretty flat what's happening is
when<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.000> put<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.390> drive<00:01:00.719> lever<00:01:00.960> down<00:01:01.230> it

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
when you put the drive lever down it

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.740 
when you put the drive lever down it
slips<00:01:02.370> down<00:01:02.609> here<00:01:02.879> I've<00:01:03.000> even<00:01:03.270> looked<00:01:03.449> at<00:01:03.600> it

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
slips down here I've even looked at it

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.080 
slips down here I've even looked at it
with<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> cover<00:01:04.170> off<00:01:04.460> tighten<00:01:05.460> up<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.670> cable

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
with the cover off tighten up the cable

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.090 
with the cover off tighten up the cable
and<00:01:06.299> there's<00:01:06.630> still<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.900> problem<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.920> what's

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
and there's still a problem so what's

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.340 
and there's still a problem so what's
going<00:01:08.310> on<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:08.880> slipping<00:01:09.720> off<00:01:09.960> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
going on is this is slipping off the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.100 
going on is this is slipping off the
disk<00:01:10.890> here<00:01:11.299> so<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.450> next<00:01:12.689> step<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:12.990> this

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
disk here so the next step in this

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.050 
disk here so the next step in this
procedure<00:01:13.500> would<00:01:13.710> be<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.920> remove<00:01:14.369> both<00:01:14.729> wheels

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
procedure would be to remove both wheels

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.420 
procedure would be to remove both wheels
this<00:01:15.869> side<00:01:16.110> here<00:01:16.320> just<00:01:16.560> grab<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.890> linchpin

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
this side here just grab the linchpin

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.530 
this side here just grab the linchpin
pull<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.390> up<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:19.430> then<00:01:20.430> take<00:01:20.909> your<00:01:21.060> right<00:01:21.150> and

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
pull it up and then take your right and

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.580 
pull it up and then take your right and
X<00:01:22.320> just<00:01:22.560> take<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.040> wheel<00:01:23.159> right<00:01:23.430> off<00:01:24.470> now<00:01:25.470> on

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
X just take the wheel right off now on

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.810 
X just take the wheel right off now on
the<00:01:25.710> other<00:01:25.770> side<00:01:26.159> they're<00:01:26.369> gonna<00:01:26.490> have<00:01:26.670> to

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
the other side they're gonna have to

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.640 
the other side they're gonna have to
remove<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.210> bolt<00:01:27.450> there's<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.840> bolt<00:01:28.140> here<00:01:28.380> not

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
remove the bolt there's a bolt here not

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.999 
remove the bolt there's a bolt here not
a<00:01:28.680> linchpin<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.490> at<00:01:30.240> 7:16<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.650> could<00:01:31.829> use<00:01:31.979> a

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
a linchpin and at 7:16 you could use a

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.160 
a linchpin and at 7:16 you could use a
ratchet<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:33.240> wrench<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.659> hold<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.930> bolt

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
ratchet and a wrench to hold the bolt

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.260 
ratchet and a wrench to hold the bolt
and<00:01:34.439> take<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.950> off<00:01:35.070> as<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:35.939> see<00:01:36.150> I'm

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
and take it off as you can see I'm

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.120 
and take it off as you can see I'm
already<00:01:36.509> taking<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.590> off

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
already taking it off

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.889 
already taking it off
so<00:01:38.520> I'll<00:01:38.579> just<00:01:38.820> unscrew<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:40.340> pull<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.490> out<00:01:41.899> and

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
so I'll just unscrew it pull it out and

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.160 
so I'll just unscrew it pull it out and
take<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.799> wheel<00:01:43.979> off<00:01:44.100> here<00:01:44.869> now<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.049> you've

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
take the wheel off here now that you've

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.870 
take the wheel off here now that you've
got<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.500> wheels<00:01:46.680> off<00:01:46.920> we're<00:01:47.340> gonna<00:01:47.490> move<00:01:47.670> to

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
got the wheels off we're gonna move to

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.679 
got the wheels off we're gonna move to
the<00:01:48.000> next<00:01:48.270> step

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
the next step

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.780 
the next step
and<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.380> will<00:01:49.500> be<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.799> remove<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.369> two<00:01:50.579> bolts

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
and that will be to remove the two bolts

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.420 
and that will be to remove the two bolts
on<00:01:51.090> this<00:01:51.420> side<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:52.049> also<00:01:52.770> with<00:01:52.890> two<00:01:52.920> identical

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
on this side and also with two identical

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.510 
on this side and also with two identical
bolts<00:01:53.909> on<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.479> opposite<00:01:54.899> side<00:01:55.229> here<00:01:55.259> now<00:01:55.680> what

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
bolts on the opposite side here now what

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.429 
bolts on the opposite side here now what
these<00:01:56.670> bolts<00:01:57.060> hold<00:01:57.299> are<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.750> bushings<00:01:58.200> or

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
these bolts hold are the bushings or

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.889 
these bolts hold are the bushings or
bearings<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.009> hold<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.689> friction<00:02:00.689> wheel

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
bearings that hold the friction wheel

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.429 
bearings that hold the friction wheel
shaft<00:02:01.500> here<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.310> once<00:02:02.729> these<00:02:03.000> are<00:02:03.329> off<00:02:03.509> we<00:02:04.200> can

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
shaft here so once these are off we can

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.440 
shaft here so once these are off we can
move<00:02:04.619> this<00:02:04.829> out<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.189> there<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.759> get<00:02:05.939> this<00:02:06.149> part

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
move this out of there to get this part

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:14.960 
move this out of there to get this part
out<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.810> get<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.110> friction<00:02:07.380> wheel<00:02:07.649> right<00:02:07.890> off

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.910 

fairly<00:02:15.970> easy<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.300> remove<00:02:16.660> it's<00:02:17.170> pretty<00:02:17.650> short

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
fairly easy to remove it's pretty short

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:27.240 
fairly easy to remove it's pretty short
as<00:02:18.160> you<00:02:18.310> saw

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.809 

[Applause]

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
[Applause]

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.789 
[Applause]
now<00:02:29.480> once<00:02:29.689> you've<00:02:29.810> got<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:30.049> bolts<00:02:30.290> off<00:02:30.439> move

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
now once you've got the bolts off move

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.440 
now once you've got the bolts off move
your<00:02:30.980> gear<00:02:31.159> shifter<00:02:31.640> and<00:02:31.849> one<00:02:32.030> of<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.299> higher

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
your gear shifter and one of the higher

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.330 
your gear shifter and one of the higher
gears<00:02:32.810> line<00:02:33.049> number<00:02:33.290> four<00:02:33.560> or<00:02:33.799> number<00:02:33.829> five

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
gears line number four or number five

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.220 
gears line number four or number five
but<00:02:35.090> that's<00:02:35.269> going<00:02:35.450> to<00:02:35.540> do<00:02:35.750> is<00:02:35.870> move<00:02:36.049> the

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
but that's going to do is move the

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.080 
but that's going to do is move the
friction<00:02:36.620> wheel<00:02:36.769> to<00:02:37.219> the<00:02:37.310> right<00:02:37.489> here<00:02:37.760> so<00:02:37.969> we

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
friction wheel to the right here so we

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.640 
friction wheel to the right here so we
have<00:02:38.209> more<00:02:38.359> room<00:02:38.420> inside<00:02:38.900> here<00:02:39.200> to<00:02:39.500> move

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
have more room inside here to move

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.580 
have more room inside here to move
around<00:02:39.799> now<00:02:40.420> grab<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.450> friction<00:02:42.019> wheel<00:02:42.200> shaft

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
around now grab the friction wheel shaft

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.030 
around now grab the friction wheel shaft
and<00:02:43.540> wear<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.719> chain<00:02:44.989> is<00:02:45.260> move<00:02:45.709> it<00:02:45.890> off<00:02:46.010> the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
and wear the chain is move it off the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.720 
and wear the chain is move it off the
sprocket<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.900> pull<00:02:48.859> the<00:02:49.010> whole<00:02:49.159> shaft<00:02:49.459> back

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
sprocket and pull the whole shaft back

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.750 
sprocket and pull the whole shaft back
like<00:02:49.939> this<00:02:50.319> now<00:02:51.319> during<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.739> process<00:02:52.280> maybe's

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
like this now during the process maybe's

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.640 
like this now during the process maybe's
may<00:02:52.939> fall<00:02:53.180> off<00:02:53.359> and<00:02:53.720> they<00:02:54.049> go<00:02:54.230> over<00:02:54.319> here<00:02:54.590> and

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
may fall off and they go over here and

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.379 
may fall off and they go over here and
I'll<00:02:54.980> show<00:02:55.220> you<00:02:55.280> how<00:02:55.549> to<00:02:55.609> put<00:02:55.849> that<00:02:56.000> back<00:02:56.209> on

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:56.389 
I'll show you how to put that back on

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:59.289 
I'll show you how to put that back on
when<00:02:57.230> we<00:02:57.409> replace<00:02:57.709> the<00:02:57.980> wheel<00:02:58.159> now<00:02:58.849> that<00:02:59.150> this

and you'll need to remove all three
volts<00:04:42.730> and<00:04:44.070> remember<00:04:45.070> that<00:04:45.520> the<00:04:45.730> disc<00:04:46.060> the

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
volts and remember that the disc the

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.379 
volts and remember that the disc the
inner<00:04:47.080> part<00:04:47.500> points<00:04:48.340> toward<00:04:48.639> this<00:04:48.820> mechanism

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
inner part points toward this mechanism

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:56.659 
inner part points toward this mechanism
here<00:04:50.910> no<00:04:51.910> the<00:04:52.090> whole<00:04:52.240> disk<00:04:52.480> is<00:04:52.660> gonna<00:04:52.870> come<00:04:53.139> off

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.250 

so<00:04:57.669> here's<00:04:57.970> the<00:04:58.150> old<00:04:58.300> disc<00:04:58.570> you<00:04:58.780> can<00:04:58.810> see<00:04:59.139> it's

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
so here's the old disc you can see it's

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.770 
so here's the old disc you can see it's
pretty<00:04:59.440> flat<00:04:59.860> now<00:05:00.730> if<00:05:00.850> I<00:05:00.940> compared<00:05:01.480> the<00:05:01.630> old

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
pretty flat now if I compared the old

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.600 
pretty flat now if I compared the old
disc<00:05:02.050> with<00:05:02.410> the<00:05:02.560> new<00:05:02.740> one<00:05:03.010> I'll<00:05:03.190> just<00:05:03.400> match<00:05:03.580> up

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
disc with the new one I'll just match up

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.879 
disc with the new one I'll just match up
the<00:05:03.970> holes<00:05:04.120> here<00:05:04.419> you<00:05:05.200> can<00:05:05.410> see<00:05:05.590> a<00:05:05.620> lot<00:05:05.770> of

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
the holes here you can see a lot of

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.690 
the holes here you can see a lot of
difference<00:05:06.310> in<00:05:06.520> the<00:05:06.850> height<00:05:07.030> of<00:05:07.060> the<00:05:07.210> disc<00:05:08.700> the

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
difference in the height of the disc the

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.409 
difference in the height of the disc the
rubber<00:05:09.970> is<00:05:10.120> a<00:05:10.210> lot<00:05:10.419> higher<00:05:10.660> on<00:05:10.840> the<00:05:11.080> new<00:05:11.230> one<00:05:12.419> so

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
rubber is a lot higher on the new one so

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:15.090 
rubber is a lot higher on the new one so
now<00:05:13.540> you've<00:05:13.720> got<00:05:13.750> you<00:05:14.020> don't<00:05:14.050> disc<00:05:14.410> off<00:05:14.620> you

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
back on remember that this side of the

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:24.210 
back on remember that this side of the
disc<00:05:19.000> goes<00:05:19.570> like<00:05:19.810> this<00:05:20.080> now<00:05:22.830> I'll<00:05:23.830> just<00:05:23.860> stick

the reason I'm putting the grease is to
lubricate<00:06:16.500> the<00:06:16.860> shaft<00:06:17.250> but<00:06:18.120> also<00:06:18.270> to<00:06:18.509> hold<00:06:18.840> the

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
lubricate the shaft but also to hold the

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:28.350 
lubricate the shaft but also to hold the
little<00:06:19.199> washer<00:06:19.770> in<00:06:19.860> place

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.850 

so<00:06:29.360> now<00:06:29.599> the<00:06:29.659> officer<00:06:30.139> is<00:06:30.229> going<00:06:30.379> to<00:06:30.499> sit<00:06:30.679> there

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
so now the officer is going to sit there

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.999 
so now the officer is going to sit there
and<00:06:30.979> not<00:06:31.129> fall<00:06:31.369> off<00:06:32.409> and<00:06:33.409> I'm<00:06:33.589> going<00:06:33.709> to<00:06:33.770> do<00:06:33.889> the

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:34.009 
and not fall off and I'm going to do the

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:35.769 
and not fall off and I'm going to do the
same<00:06:34.189> for<00:06:34.459> these<00:06:34.610> washers<00:06:35.179> it's<00:06:35.569> not<00:06:35.749> a

00:06:35.769 --> 00:06:35.779 
same for these washers it's not a

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:37.479 
same for these washers it's not a
guarantee<00:06:36.259> that<00:06:36.289> it<00:06:36.439> won't<00:06:36.619> fall<00:06:36.889> off<00:06:36.919> but<00:06:37.399> at

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:37.489 
guarantee that it won't fall off but at

00:06:37.489 --> 00:06:39.909 
guarantee that it won't fall off but at
least<00:06:37.669> it's<00:06:37.999> going<00:06:38.179> to<00:06:38.239> help<00:06:38.499> I've<00:06:39.499> got<00:06:39.709> some

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 
least it's going to help I've got some

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:41.469 
least it's going to help I've got some
grease<00:06:40.129> and<00:06:40.399> make<00:06:40.580> sure<00:06:40.789> that<00:06:40.969> grease<00:06:41.239> does

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:41.479 
grease and make sure that grease does

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:45.249 
grease and make sure that grease does
not<00:06:41.719> get<00:06:42.080> on<00:06:42.259> the<00:06:42.589> friction<00:06:42.860> wheel<00:06:43.929> just<00:06:44.929> a<00:06:45.050> tad

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:45.259 
not get on the friction wheel just a tad

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:48.459 
not get on the friction wheel just a tad
you<00:06:45.439> don't<00:06:45.589> need<00:06:45.709> much<00:06:45.919> grease<00:06:46.219> there
