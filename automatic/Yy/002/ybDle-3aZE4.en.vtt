00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:03.704
 Hi, my name is Darek Kraśnicki 

00:00:03.704 --> 00:00:09.009
 and traditionally welcome on my website www.badania-na-prawo-jazdy-wroclaw.com. 

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:18.603
 And here, at the request of Mr. Marcin, I will discuss the issue of sight defects in candidates for bus drivers, that is, cat. D, 

00:00:18.603 --> 00:00:26.745
 but who have already done right on trucks, that is, they already have a right on category C. 

00:00:27.245 --> 00:00:34.504
 And I will read the letter not to distort too much: "Hello, doctor, I have a question like that. 

00:00:34.871 --> 00:00:41.477
 Well, I have a vision defect, it occurred at the age of about 16 years, now I have 21. 

00:00:42.178 --> 00:00:48.802
 Examinations on cat. B passed with an indefinite result, C also, and now cat. D. 

00:00:49.103 --> 00:00:58.345
 The doctor carefully hung the chart for eye examination and from about 5-6 meters away, he ordered to read the letters shown. 

00:00:58.345 --> 00:01:09.908
 He started from the second row from the bottom and there were no objections on the right eye, but on the left I saw only the fourth row from the bottom. 

00:01:10.375 --> 00:01:17.015
 The doctor said the difference is in the norm, but I do not know why I'm worried about it. 

00:01:17.015 --> 00:01:22.839
 And now the fundamental question: will I undergo a study on a professional driver with such a defect? 

00:01:23.973 --> 00:01:28.644
 Whether or not I will have to use lenses, I do not like glasses. 

00:01:29.345 --> 00:01:39.073
 I am currently taking Biolutein pills, but honestly either they do not help, or I do not take them too much - about 1 month, 

00:01:39.073 --> 00:01:43.240
 1 piece a day, according to the instructions on the packaging. 

00:01:44.478 --> 00:01:50.470
 Are my fears justified or maybe I worry too much? " 

00:01:55.907 --> 00:02:05.600
 Well, Mr Marcin ... I can only say that I would not be particularly worried about your place, although I understand your fears. 

00:02:06.336 --> 00:02:20.940
 However, in terms of formal matters: if you read this eye with the fourth row from the bottom, this means an eye acuity of 0.8 

00:02:20.935 --> 00:02:31.310
 and this means that it is permissible to drive vehicles without glasses or contact lenses. 

00:02:32.713 --> 00:02:45.010
 I can conclude that if you have already obtained category C, the exact same test norm for trucks is 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.510
 which you have met this standard before. 

00:02:48.902 --> 00:02:58.910
 So, assuming that the sight of you generally does not worsen, I do not see any reason to worry too much, 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:05.680
 nevertheless, despite everything, I would examine myself thoroughly with an ophthalmologist. 

00:03:07.602 --> 00:03:17.880
 Rather, you will not have a problem while driving in good visibility, i.e. sunshine, we're going nicely, we are not tired. 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:27.010
 The sun is still in the back - it does not blinding, but it is slightly worse during the light bulb or in the dark, at night. 

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:32.140
 And sometimes, some cars are blind from time to time. 

00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:38.030
 Add to that fatigue and the visual acuity can just get worse. 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:44.310
 Then glasses or contact lenses can be helpful. 

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:51.780
 However, in spite of everything, I would addiction to the ophthalmologist's decision. 

00:03:52.249 --> 00:04:00.680
 You must also take into account that the sight with age may deteriorate, but rather - I see for myself that it is certainly getting worse. 

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:12.670
 Research for a professional driver is every 5 years and your eyes unfortunately are your job tool that you need to look after. 

00:04:13.806 --> 00:04:23.500
 You take this Biolutein, although it's just for visual acuity, correction of vision defects has no effect. 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:30.840
 Possibly, it may affect some twilight vision, sensitivity to glare, vision in the dark, while 

00:04:31.408 --> 00:04:35.440
 it certainly will not correct the disorder itself. 

00:04:37.114 --> 00:04:41.540
 There is still a matter of psychological or psychotechnical research. 

00:04:42.003 --> 00:04:50.010
 A slight difference in the sharpness of each eye, can be a problem when testing on a stereometer, i.e. settings 

00:04:50.011 --> 00:04:52.780
 these three sticks. 

00:04:53.915 --> 00:05:06.880
 Of course, I do not know if you have passed it or not, but it would be worth checking out during psychological tests, 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:09.450
 psychotechnical on the stereometer. 

00:05:09.615 --> 00:05:22.850
 I assume that you will soon be doing some preliminary qualification, and here, too, these psychological tests will be mandatory. 

00:05:23.347 --> 00:05:31.870
 I am also saying, do not worry, go to an ophthalmologist, dispel your doubts, Biolutein certainly will not hurt here, albeit 

00:05:32.307 --> 00:05:38.580
 when it comes to eye defect, it will not help, but has a different beneficial effect on the eyesight. 

00:05:39.647 --> 00:05:43.770
 Did you take a short while after a month? 

00:05:45.204 --> 00:05:54.910
 On this end, I cordially invite everyone to the comments at www.badania-na-prawo-jazdy-wroclaw.com 

00:05:55.681 --> 00:06:07.540
 Well, the comments of older drivers who have already traveled a bit, have such a limit eye defect are welcome. 

00:06:08.312 --> 00:06:12.800
 Your Darek Kraśnicki from Wroclaw said, I would like to invite you to comment on YouTube again 

00:06:13.168 --> 00:06:16.270
 or on the blog www.badania-na-prawo-jazdy-wroclaw.com. 

00:06:16.505 --> 00:06:20.040
 Your Darek Kraśnicki from Wroclaw Piast spoke. 

00:06:22.544 --> 00:06:29.200
 Unfortunately, by which terrible professional drivers, truck drivers go.
