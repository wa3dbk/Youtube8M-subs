00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.880
 hi to youtube imagine espn age here 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:25.090
 again 10 and then 5 tips another like 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:29.070
 basic so we 're all going to start 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.070
 first with marker 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.500
 a marker is very good to take away the 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:41.040
 silence 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:42.960
 is that is that the marker can score 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.129
 all 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.129
 does not have a marker 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:56.190
 x2 is just metro 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:01:00.140
 good if we want an acceptance and so 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.140
 we give the party a chance 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.110
 good there 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.410
 well let's give it to have time to 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.410
 fly 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:21.250
 we give you see times 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:25.530
 we give it up for it and it's not 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.530
 and there are the times 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.350
 the other is that the timer 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:38.680
 always this guy this guy has been done 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:42.330
 well later to see if we can 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:45.330
 set the time I'm going to put 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.330
 anyone 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.299
 I'll put 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.299
 I'm going to put 3 minutes 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.150
 when we buy some birds 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.630
 it's going to sound something like that 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.630
 and we can beat them 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:14.810
 and always always on the scoreboard 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.960
 when someone is writing some 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:24.410
 note you can write something here 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.410
 You can cover matías 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:34.090
