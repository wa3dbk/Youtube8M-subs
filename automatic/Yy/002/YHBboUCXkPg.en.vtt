incubating quail you know originally
incubate<00:00:10.170> well<00:00:10.410> is<00:00:10.710> because<00:00:12.679> typically<00:00:13.679> they

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
incubate well is because typically they

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.950 
incubate well is because typically they
are<00:00:14.070> not<00:00:14.280> broody<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.030> they<00:00:15.269> make<00:00:15.480> terrible

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960

seen I've never found on this birdie so

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:27.679 
seen I've never found on this birdie so
we<00:00:20.580> have<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.910> incubate<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.480> eggs<00:00:22.010> so<00:00:23.010> let's<00:00:26.689> go

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
we have to incubate the eggs so let's go

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.270 
we have to incubate the eggs so let's go
inside<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.140> check<00:00:28.289> out<00:00:28.470> my<00:00:28.590> setup

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:32.280 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.010 

all<00:00:33.280> right<00:00:33.430> so<00:00:33.730> here<00:00:33.910> we<00:00:33.940> are<00:00:34.090> checking<00:00:34.810> out

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
all right so here we are checking out

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:42.560 
all right so here we are checking out
the<00:00:35.290> burger<00:00:36.840> in<00:00:37.840> the<00:00:38.170> incubator<00:00:39.540> so

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.150 

what<00:00:43.200> do<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.320> got<00:00:43.590> here<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.829> got<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.579> incubator

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
what do I got here I got the incubator

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.880 
what do I got here I got the incubator
I've<00:00:47.160> got<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:49.100> monitor<00:00:50.330> with

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
I've got a monitor with

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.930 
I've got a monitor with
the<00:00:53.460> humidity<00:00:53.970> gauge<00:00:54.150> on<00:00:54.450> it<00:00:54.600> it's<00:00:55.110> got<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.940> two

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
the humidity gauge on it it's got to two

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.510 
the humidity gauge on it it's got to two
probes<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.540> that's<00:00:58.170> why<00:00:58.410> it's<00:00:58.620> reading<00:00:59.370> two

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
probes so that's why it's reading two

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.670 
probes so that's why it's reading two
different<00:00:59.850> temperatures<00:01:00.240> but<00:01:00.510> that's<00:01:01.500> a

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
different temperatures but that's a

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.800 
different temperatures but that's a
little<00:01:01.830> low<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.010> try<00:01:02.310> to<00:01:02.370> keep<00:01:02.580> mine<00:01:02.700> at<00:01:02.810> 99.5

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:03.810 
little low I try to keep mine at 99.5

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.800 
little low I try to keep mine at 99.5
which<00:01:04.110> means<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.730> want<00:01:05.730> it<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.940> vary<00:01:06.150> between<00:01:06.330> 99

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
which means I want it to vary between 99

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.480 
which means I want it to vary between 99
and<00:01:06.960> 100<00:01:07.500> if<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.830> varies<00:01:09.620> I've<00:01:10.620> got<00:01:11.010> an<00:01:11.190> egg

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
and 100 if it varies I've got an egg

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.200 
and 100 if it varies I've got an egg

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
just punched a couple zits start from

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.520 
just punched a couple zits start from
incubator<00:02:12.000> shot<00:02:12.269> just<00:02:12.450> used<00:02:13.170> one<00:02:13.380> of<00:02:13.470> the

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
incubator shot just used one of the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
incubator shot just used one of the
holes<00:02:13.709> that<00:02:13.830> was<00:02:13.950> already<00:02:14.190> in<00:02:14.280> there<00:02:14.519> and

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
holes that was already in there and

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.479 
holes that was already in there and
punched<00:02:14.940> another<00:02:15.030> hole<00:02:15.500> that<00:02:16.500> lined<00:02:17.010> up<00:02:17.280> with

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
punched another hole that lined up with

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.729 
punched another hole that lined up with
the<00:02:17.730> corners<00:02:18.630> of<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.810> fan<00:02:18.989> we're<00:02:19.230> attached<00:02:19.560> to

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
the corners of the fan we're attached to

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.550 
the corners of the fan we're attached to
the<00:02:19.830> computer<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:21.540> put<00:02:22.019> it<00:02:22.110> in<00:02:22.200> there<00:02:22.350> and<00:02:22.500> I

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
the computer and put it in there and I

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.059 
the computer and put it in there and I
think<00:02:22.830> you<00:02:22.920> can<00:02:23.160> use<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.400> laptop<00:02:23.670> fan<00:02:24.150> but

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
think you can use a laptop fan but

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.280 
think you can use a laptop fan but
desktops<00:02:26.069> are<00:02:26.250> like<00:02:26.370> free<00:02:26.760> after<00:02:27.600> they're<00:02:28.260> a

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
desktops are like free after they're a

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.380 
desktops are like free after they're a
couple<00:02:28.500> of<00:02:28.650> years<00:02:28.739> old<00:02:29.010> so<00:02:29.310> that's<00:02:29.940> what<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.239> did

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
couple of years old so that's what I did

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.330 
couple of years old so that's what I did
I<00:02:30.480> just<00:02:30.510> got<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.870> free<00:02:31.080> desktop<00:02:31.590> then<00:02:32.130> I<00:02:32.250> had

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
I just got a free desktop then I had

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.030 
I just got a free desktop then I had
found<00:02:32.550> somebody<00:02:33.510> was<00:02:33.780> getting<00:02:33.840> ready<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.230> cut

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
found somebody was getting ready to cut

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.780 
found somebody was getting ready to cut
the<00:02:35.160> fan<00:02:35.340> out<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.580> just<00:02:35.819> cut<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.180> wires<00:02:36.390> and

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
the fan out and just cut the wires and

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:45.170 
the fan out and just cut the wires and
splice<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:40.579> the<00:02:41.579> wires<00:02:41.820> from<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:43.940> cell<00:02:44.940> phone

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180

because<00:02:49.079> that's<00:02:49.320> what<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:50.310> fan<00:02:50.640> was<00:02:50.850> running

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
because that's what the fan was running

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.509 
because that's what the fan was running
off<00:02:51.299> of<00:02:51.329> on<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.750> computer<00:02:52.700> okay<00:02:53.700> so<00:02:53.959> yeah<00:02:55.519> 99.5

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
off of on the computer okay so yeah 99.5

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.490 
off of on the computer okay so yeah 99.5
degrees<00:02:56.910> is<00:02:57.150> what<00:02:57.329> we're<00:02:57.480> running<00:02:57.780> for<00:02:58.049> or

looking for and we want a minimum of 30%

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.830 
looking for and we want a minimum of 30%
humidity<00:03:03.079> when<00:03:04.079> we<00:03:04.320> are<00:03:04.730> incubating<00:03:05.730> then<00:03:06.720> you

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
humidity when we are incubating then you

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.690 
humidity when we are incubating then you
want<00:03:07.019> to<00:03:07.109> boost<00:03:07.320> it<00:03:07.590> up<00:03:07.799> to<00:03:08.010> about<00:03:08.220> 50%

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
want to boost it up to about 50%

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.099 
want to boost it up to about 50%

humidity when they're hatching and if
anybody<00:03:13.950> ever<00:03:14.250> tells<00:03:14.640> you<00:03:15.079> that<00:03:16.579> you<00:03:17.579> have<00:03:17.790> to

have a or that your coil are gonna hatch

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.470 
have a or that your coil are gonna hatch
within<00:03:21.810> 24<00:03:22.290> hours<00:03:22.320> of<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.769> showw<00:03:23.329> tell<00:03:24.329> them

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
within 24 hours of the showw tell them

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.390 
within 24 hours of the showw tell them
they're<00:03:24.660> lying<00:03:24.900> cuz<00:03:25.260> look<00:03:25.410> at<00:03:25.530> that<00:03:25.650> see<00:03:26.280> that

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
they're lying cuz look at that see that

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.789 
they're lying cuz look at that see that
coil<00:03:26.670> right<00:03:26.820> there<00:03:27.030> that<00:03:27.959> one<00:03:28.079> is<00:03:28.109> half<00:03:28.470> the

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
coil right there that one is half the

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.920 
coil right there that one is half the
size<00:03:29.040> of<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.370> other<00:03:29.549> ones<00:03:29.760> I<00:03:30.090> know<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.780> red

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
size of the other ones I know the red

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.490 
size of the other ones I know the red
light<00:03:31.109> probably<00:03:31.500> throws<00:03:31.769> you<00:03:31.950> off<00:03:32.390> but<00:03:33.500> it

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
light probably throws you off but it

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.500 
light probably throws you off but it
turns<00:03:34.680> out<00:03:34.829> that's<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.130> only<00:03:35.370> light<00:03:35.519> okay

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
turns out that's the only light okay

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.110 
turns out that's the only light okay
well<00:03:36.870> he's<00:03:37.079> tiny<00:03:37.380> basically<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:38.670> I've<00:03:38.910> got<00:03:39.090> a

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
well he's tiny basically and I've got a

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.569 
well he's tiny basically and I've got a
lot<00:03:39.390> of<00:03:39.420> this<00:03:40.320> size<00:03:40.560> coil<00:03:40.890> because<00:03:41.190> I'm<00:03:41.310> coil

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
lot of this size coil because I'm coil

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.110 
lot of this size coil because I'm coil
hatched<00:03:41.880> for<00:03:42.810> three<00:03:43.230> days

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
hatched for three days

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.309 
hatched for three days
and<00:03:44.959> I<00:03:44.989> just<00:03:45.170> sit<00:03:45.349> there<00:03:45.560> with<00:03:46.510> you<00:03:47.510> know<00:03:47.629> seven

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
and I just sit there with you know seven

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.170 
and I just sit there with you know seven
quail<00:03:48.530> forever<00:03:49.010> and<00:03:49.220> thought<00:03:49.400> maybe<00:03:49.970> that's

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
quail forever and thought maybe that's

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.970 
quail forever and thought maybe that's
always<00:03:50.540> gonna<00:03:50.659> get<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:51.200> kid<00:03:51.409> back

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
always gonna get the kid back

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.680 
always gonna get the kid back
so<00:03:52.730> anyways<00:03:53.450> that's<00:03:53.840> a<00:03:54.549> the<00:03:55.549> basics<00:03:56.000> of<00:03:56.120> it<00:03:56.269> 18

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
so anyways that's a the basics of it 18

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.509 
so anyways that's a the basics of it 18
days<00:03:56.900> to<00:03:56.930> hatch<00:03:58.209> I<00:03:59.209> think<00:03:59.659> that<00:03:59.810> Turner<00:04:00.080> out<00:04:01.069> at

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
days to hatch I think that Turner out at

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.910 
days to hatch I think that Turner out at
16<00:04:02.030> days<00:04:02.239> if<00:04:02.959> you<00:04:03.110> don't<00:04:03.290> have<00:04:03.409> an<00:04:03.500> egg<00:04:03.650> turn

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
16 days if you don't have an egg turn

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.309 
16 days if you don't have an egg turn
you<00:04:04.879> want<00:04:04.970> to<00:04:05.120> turn<00:04:05.440> your<00:04:06.440> quail<00:04:07.810> every<00:04:08.810> eight

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
you want to turn your quail every eight

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:10.990 
you want to turn your quail every eight
hours<00:04:09.799> of<00:04:09.829> your<00:04:10.129> quail<00:04:10.340> eggs<00:04:10.579> every<00:04:10.849> eight

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
hours of your quail eggs every eight

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.629 
hours of your quail eggs every eight
hours<00:04:11.120> and<00:04:11.540> so<00:04:13.209> that's<00:04:14.209> a<00:04:15.100> very<00:04:16.100> important

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
hours and so that's a very important

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:17.080 
hours and so that's a very important
step

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
step

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.210 
step
my<00:04:17.810> Turner<00:04:18.079> got<00:04:18.320> unplugged<00:04:18.769> a<00:04:18.889> few<00:04:19.070> days

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
my Turner got unplugged a few days

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.949 
my Turner got unplugged a few days
before<00:04:19.400> the<00:04:19.669> hatch<00:04:19.850> and<00:04:20.120> I<00:04:20.209> only<00:04:20.359> got<00:04:20.539> a<00:04:20.600> 50%

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
before the hatch and I only got a 50%

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.290 
before the hatch and I only got a 50%
hatch<00:04:21.550> so<00:04:22.550> that's<00:04:22.789> kind<00:04:23.060> of<00:04:23.090> frustrating

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
hatch so that's kind of frustrating

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.140 
hatch so that's kind of frustrating
because<00:04:23.690> we<00:04:23.900> had<00:04:23.990> bought<00:04:24.169> those<00:04:24.380> eggs<00:04:25.150> for

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
because we had bought those eggs for

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.010 
because we had bought those eggs for
these<00:04:26.300> quail<00:04:26.870> so<00:04:28.330> let's<00:04:29.330> see<00:04:29.479> what<00:04:29.720> else<00:04:29.870> do

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
these quail so let's see what else do

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.850 
these quail so let's see what else do
you<00:04:30.080> need<00:04:30.289> to<00:04:30.470> know<00:04:31.120> when<00:04:32.530> when<00:04:33.530> they<00:04:33.650> hatch

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
you need to know when when they hatch

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.770 
you need to know when when they hatch
leave<00:04:34.340> them<00:04:34.550> in<00:04:34.639> there<00:04:34.820> for<00:04:35.000> a<00:04:35.060> few<00:04:35.120> hours

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
leave them in there for a few hours

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.170 
leave them in there for a few hours
a<00:04:35.810> couple<00:04:36.710> hours<00:04:36.800> fry<00:04:37.190> to<00:04:38.060> let<00:04:38.510> them<00:04:39.970> dry<00:04:40.970> off

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
a couple hours fry to let them dry off

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.510 
a couple hours fry to let them dry off
and<00:04:41.419> they<00:04:42.080> tend<00:04:42.380> to<00:04:42.530> pick<00:04:42.710> on<00:04:42.919> each<00:04:42.949> other<00:04:43.220> less

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
and they tend to pick on each other less

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.510 
and they tend to pick on each other less
when<00:04:44.240> you<00:04:44.900> put<00:04:45.139> dry<00:04:45.410> coil<00:04:45.740> with<00:04:45.889> dry<00:04:46.100> quail<00:04:46.370> in

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
when you put dry coil with dry quail in
