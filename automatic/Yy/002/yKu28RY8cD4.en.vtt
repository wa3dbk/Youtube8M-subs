00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:11.610
 this mouth juniors in mendoza with 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.860
 a team renewed by names for 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.160
 the absences with godoy cross fans 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.279
 and neutral fans an idea-force not 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.189
 there is a way to hide the failure but not 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.390
 want the failure of this semester of 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.390
 mouth is a failure 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:38.309
 we already said it changed between his sister 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.040
 he joined the fall against still no cup 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.079
 Argentina is exactly that an annual goal a 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.149
 semiannual goal a goal will be with 9 as 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.530
 says Alejandro Fabbri who did the 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.820
 corinthians between we have to have 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.649
 nostalgia for that goal today the most 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.690
 similar to a dance that has been seen 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.690
 this from godoy cross to mouth 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.910
 oriol played for 17 points was the player 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.259
 of the semester folio I think that with the 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.489
 match with the month that was one of the 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:08.509
 three victories of championship mouths 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.509
 It was the great figure 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.920
 by here minute 31 reach the goal of mouth 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.440
 and before several interceptions of Orion the 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.870
 head of ricoleme and the bounce on 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.550
 the gabias three things that is amazing 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.890
 think that this mouth has gotten that 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.590
 It stretches in emigrate since I have use 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.460
 of reason soccer players want 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.460
 come to mouth 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.400
 they have simply succeeded in 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.600
 players want to go looking for 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.130
 improve they feel that a cycle is 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.240
 finished that can not progress can not 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.280
 give more than they gave this too 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.800
 speaks of the failure of the one who had to 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.510
 order is supposed the costumes came to 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.670
 they told me when all this started 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:59.530
 the talk here the hand another criminal in 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.540
 against me a note our pear tree 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.170
 chiqui pérez in this human is solid 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.180
 and this is one of the absolutes that has 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.880
 this regulation is the head of the referee 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.340
 which determines the intention or not this 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.510
 kid who made the goal is one for me 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.400
 best players that has shown this 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.230
 star championship castelar 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.810
 game 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.549
 football and the truth is that it is a 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.739
 wink also for the crazy palermo and what 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.720
 what have you done with him talking about resources 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.819
 Palermo loves castro speaking 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.280
 good he put it he put it to castro de 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.659
 tickets last night said give me a name 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.680
 also godoy surname cross that you 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.780
 like you that you think you have 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.640
 mark of what Castro told me good and 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.500
 he made them play Castro castelán and in 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.510
 some ramirez moment but ramirez this one 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.430
 I never finished rounding it up 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.480
 he said he plays well he is missing the goal 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.010
 and is that I do not make a goal will not be 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.530
 pleased the goal the banks held it 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.560
 bank here the expulsion for leandro 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.379
 walls that had replaced riquelme 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:58.640
 while before having a counter carlos 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.640
 and one more expelled 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:06.490
 the penalty was at minute 45 or 50 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.080
 and the expelled was at just 48 minutes and 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.620
 it played a minute more I do not know why 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.810
 reason 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:17.760
 I was considering that way 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.200
 part of the 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.040
 the things that we have since 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:27.740
 we started this year 15 penal and 15 or 16 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.600
 12 penalties when kutxa 2 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.160
 but we are used but not 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.680
 matter let's say we're already thinking 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.540
 on July 2 that we will return to 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.060
 work to prepare the best 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.060
 possible to change everything right in 56 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:47.030
 president is the number will be almost 10 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.710
 players but the two alone that 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.400
 Solve the issue are all your 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:55.210
 positions what they are doing 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.210
 good is fine but now 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.549
 in the mouth first they come to 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:04.159
 look for them to buy them and then we'll see 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:05.780
 when we have to go look we have 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.099
 that the main times what happens 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.810
 that you have to fill in all and we 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.530
 they know very well with a lot of history 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.530
