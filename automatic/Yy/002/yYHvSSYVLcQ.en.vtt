threes at the end of the third and into
the<00:02:10.030> fourth<00:02:10.300> maybe<00:02:10.570> you<00:02:10.899> know<00:02:11.020> one<00:02:11.380> or<00:02:11.500> two

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.470 
the fourth maybe you know one or two
three<00:02:11.950> so<00:02:12.280> those<00:02:13.060> were<00:02:13.270> big<00:02:13.420> baskets<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:15.480> you

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
three so those were big baskets and you

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.020 
three so those were big baskets and you
know<00:02:16.600> we<00:02:17.530> may<00:02:17.770> be<00:02:17.830> missed<00:02:18.160> a<00:02:18.310> few<00:02:18.490> I<00:02:18.550> think<00:02:18.730> we

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
know we may be missed a few I think we

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.670 
know we may be missed a few I think we
missed<00:02:19.150> a<00:02:19.300> few<00:02:19.450> free<00:02:19.720> throws<00:02:20.020> and<00:02:20.320> then<00:02:20.410> we<00:02:20.530> had

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
missed a few free throws and then we had

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.650 
missed a few free throws and then we had
to<00:02:20.800> start<00:02:21.040> Pressman<00:02:21.910> trapped<00:02:22.209> a<00:02:22.330> little<00:02:22.540> bit

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
to start Pressman trapped a little bit

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.240 
to start Pressman trapped a little bit
and<00:02:23.020> probably<00:02:23.320> the<00:02:23.440> difference<00:02:23.739> was<00:02:23.890> they<00:02:24.070> did

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
and probably the difference was they did

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.710 
and probably the difference was they did
a<00:02:24.280> great<00:02:24.550> job<00:02:24.580> of<00:02:24.820> handling<00:02:25.239> that<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:25.630> they

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
a great job of handling that and they

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.210 
a great job of handling that and they
finished<00:02:26.080> with<00:02:26.200> baskets<00:02:26.650> at<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:26.860> other<00:02:26.980> end

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
finished with baskets at the other end

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.160 
finished with baskets at the other end
