00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.560
 welcome to our today 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.540
 Press conference with both trainers and 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.640
 may say in advance that it is also in 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.530
 this gives your winners a winner 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.970
 signal iduna tip kick game with the 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.910
 autographs with the trainer 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:45.660
 kiska von spohr won live heartily 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.610
 congratulations you mike büskens I may order 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.550
 your commentary on the game that is yes 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.950
 nice of them unfortunately does not belong 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.950
 the winners 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.659
 I have to say if you are here 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.940
 wants to exist as a starter than 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:01.800
 inexperienced team then you need 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.890
 a perfect day 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.770
 There you really have to be in all 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.930
 areas at the limit and also above the 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.520
 limit move and that unfortunately has me 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.930
 not because not in all areas 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.870
 Today I think quite well 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.390
 played football but also 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.880
 make our chances but have it 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.450
 the opponent with his individual 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.670
 class allowed against again and again 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.130
 Shoot us easy goals and then 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.560
 Of course it is very difficult here 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.850
 almost team of course in advance 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.280
 already said in the last two 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.190
 years of national football 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.320
 and now also internationally 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.120
 a very good role then plays like 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.580
 said it is very difficult 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.870
 that's an early 1 0 it comes then 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.210
 again over a well-played one 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:00.060
 then attack christopher in the 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.710
 follow 1 one eleven meters you out 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.840
 In my view, I only have it once 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.810
 seen but can give 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.239
 definitely yes but there is cuba faith 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.400
 I with my back to the gate 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.590
 and then at that time just too restless 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.569
 I have to wait for behavior 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.300
 if he turns I can see 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.830
 still be there and say the bvb 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.959
 again given to the hand 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.659
 then you can get back into the game 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.519
 have a very good chance of thinking 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:29.519
 I'm in the middle of the sixteen where he forgives 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:32.140
 and also and by sercan den 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.370
 Post shot against the inside post 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.740
 and with that feeling you have to 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.620
 at least halfway then go 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.360
 new new gather you can easily back 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.870
 but then we cash in possession 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:47.080
 of 31 where we throw after if one 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.240
 and thereby losses and the bvb 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.060
 is then great with a contact 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.660
 raus but but that is up 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.080
 keep that level so that 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.850
 mercilessly punished and that's why 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.380
 we think I have reasonable football 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.420
 played in the first half but in 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.790
 the decisive moments we would 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.930
 were punished mercilessly and then is 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.110
 It's very hard in the second half 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.330
 against this team there is one more 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.810
 to create a change 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.790
 thanks the bvb sorry for the conclusion 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:22.090
 much success in the coming what is 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.310
 the wednesday in amsterdam and very nice 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.320
 for German football if 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.590
 we continue in the three teams 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.150
 champions league and therefore 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.340
 Many many thanks jürgen as your falls 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:40.450
 Conclusion from first thank you very much 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:42.370
 especially I am serious now 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.420
 a bit natural with one with the 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.400
 past but we see it when it is 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.560
 just as we like to be with everyone 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.110
 three teams show how goes into the 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.910
 The zones want to move in . Wife 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.459
 the update briefly fall into the question 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.760
 very briefly ok again past 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:00.459
 that's true but that's just it 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.829
 in the ruhr area you represent you represent 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.780
 she black and yellow club colors me 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:07.120
 from my past wants the 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.620
 Blue and white never deny it anyway 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:16.150
 you can treat each other respectfully 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:17.530
 René great way so Jamaica relatively much 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.880
 is already said what in this game 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.259
 So based is that 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.600
 Only then was the spectacular half-time 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:27.729
 from both teams we have like 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.080
 I think I played football really well 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.910
 however, have it again and again 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:37.509
 both had losses ball so 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:39.400
 At least the gate looks but stieber 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:41.169
 arises from the ball loss of us where 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.550
 we once did not lack slide right 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.110
 actually only two three meters me 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.520
 believe are and try the ball 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.320
 to play forward is deflected or 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.090
 whoever först him to photo 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.639
 then put him no penalty room like that 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.930
 the compensation arises then come back 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:54.970
 To be able to do that leg and rhede gate too 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.530
 make sure this is helpful if one 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:00.340
 You have to be able to get compensation 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.840
 say the lord of the shot also post 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.270
 again a quick grab for 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.800
 Ball loss from us but it went with us 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.960
 actually half-time clear and you saw 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.910
 the guys also said really dangerous 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.349
 if we give you the balls , the opponent 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.330
 the feet play warm up one 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:15.220
 certain moment too restless opponent has 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.539
 very disciplined defended that 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.449
 I did not do it so deeply 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:20.650
 disciplined and when we are restless 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:22.479
 The balls were just in the 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.639
 feet played thank you then comes the pace 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:28.539
 that they also have in their ranks 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:29.620
 just to wear and what to wear 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.789
 we see the balls in front well 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.580
 fixed 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:35.590
 Stieber and very good in the back 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.349
 So that was not no run 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:41.500
 so easy to defend that 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:43.930
 second half 76 percent ball possession 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.000
 I think when it first cancel most 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.229
 balanced second thing clearly 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.639
 the team has it easy 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:51.270
 actual step forward 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:55.960
 to make the whole thing look ripe 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:58.199
 is important if it is a bit too 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:01.000
 until nothing was allowed 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:02.860
 fill in ballbesitz from the one or 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.599
 other opportunities to create who 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.669
 not bad either, but it is also for 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:08.500
 not in these intense weeks today 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:09.370
 only been an order but nothing 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.780
 to allow more 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.610
 the first order of his team is good 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.960
 I believe the spectators have made 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:17.970
 This afternoon too 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.800
 can enjoy in the stadium times one 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:22.039
 great atmosphere has got incredible 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.530
 Many people have brought shows as well 

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:27.479
 how much all this bundesliga is 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.340
 enjoy and also in this federal army 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:30.360
 wanting to stay 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.880
 and then there is not to say I can 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.740
 mike situation 110 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.930
 a thousand times with mainz in such 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.400
 situation and a bit 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.750
 what last champions league so good 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.340
 played and got nothing at the end 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.229
 but whoever stays is rewarded 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.789
 I can say that is correct 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:47.340
 quality brings the place and 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:52.590
 good luck for that 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:54.270
 future and the many thanks if it 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.009
 then ask both coaches then gives 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:07:00.180
 I beg you to sign then we are 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:07:04.830
 quickly with the microphone if you please 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:06.060
 Your questions ask to Mr. to all 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.590
 let sobiech should be today 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.849
 try in home defense like 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.849
 they were satisfied with his performance 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.650
 of course no simple sulfur leave 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:18.680
 the first game from the beginning with us 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:22.349
 and then against his old one 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.880
 old club of which is borrowed and 

00:07:22.349 --> 00:07:27.270
 of course the game started from his 

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:29.370
 view also suboptimal with the with the 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:31.110
 collision of values of eric but 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:33.080
 All in all , that was neat 

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:35.240
 made 

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.830
 further questions 

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.330
 that does not seem to be the case then 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.979
 We thank you for the interest 

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.930
 Wish our guests a guide 

00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:44.460
