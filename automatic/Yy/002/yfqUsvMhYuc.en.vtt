percentage of possession doesn't look
that<00:03:34.680> much<00:03:34.829> but<00:03:35.010> I<00:03:35.070> don't<00:03:35.220> usually<00:03:35.340> have<00:03:35.609> a

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
that much but I don't usually have a

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.190 
that much but I don't usually have a
whole<00:03:35.880> lot<00:03:35.970> of<00:03:36.060> possession<00:03:36.480> anyway<00:03:36.959> and
