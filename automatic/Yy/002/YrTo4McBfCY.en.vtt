 free art hair genes transforming grandiose works the other day Milan was 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.620
 with the idea of ​​drying clothes but sabellic, a certain point happened 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.619
 the wind started blowing atias text 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.500
 getting stronger 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.010
 and then nothing if we let go of one had great attacks 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.640
 guys points be careful 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.409
 what he is up to but above all 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:44.900
 where in the eyes you use text to look at 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.920
 family mile 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.930
 leocorn holder 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.630
 assist mato the clothes pegs just the end of his picture we see some of the 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.760
 puts 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.290
 he used me to make us is often talent 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.290
 f1 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.950
 now I want to show you something that has never been seen on TV before 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.640
 toilet paper 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.560
 in the dark 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.560
 yes I know it actually shows that then an idea comes to mind 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.530
 because we don't try to open a door and let in some salami 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.530
 simply with this white ooops 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.850
 to draw a May salamence door a dark room 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.170
 we simply draw candy bullets with chalk 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.580
 you will notice the upper side the lower side of the door are slightly 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.409
 inclined here they are 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:14.349
 + the inclination is accentuated plus the door will be open 

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:18.919
 and when the door is open the light begins to spread in the room and the 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:21.979
 light as we know it propagates in a straight line 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:25.690
 then let's cast the plaster by creating beams of light 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.549
 Italian kiss in all directions here so perpendicularly to the door 

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:35.219
 now we have eliminated the room a little and we begin to see it 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:39.659
 some of the objects this is an ingenious adobe air hometown technique in 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.659
 just draw a bird from which entry the light and then trust you 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.719
 the contours of the tiny points where the light strikes 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:49.719
 you want to see how my room looks now 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.469
 blog concluded at the door 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:58.159
 papapapapapapapapapa house 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.099
 you reluctantly 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.829
 and this desire of roma elena petrizzi anatolia 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:11.339
 compatible 

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:12.929
 colamariani stands 

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:15.739
 new model army anna tatangelo 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.440
 yeah woman then lime to color in which to run for aquarium 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:27.529
 ciao sono sara live streaming - varese - armani and its parts the first 

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:32.409
 here are the pastels with the second series in live you still want me 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:34.669
 well 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:36.989
 emanuele charleston sauce 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.989
 you guys really have been 

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:44.259
 very good I have seen so many original works, especially many new ones 

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:47.259
 ideas to try 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:52.139
 I too, however, an idea to offer you the print qualityindex breasts you can do 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.659
 really get great by attacking because you can make it with i 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:00.179
 disparate materials, for example with tool carriers or from the east 

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:02.070
 black heart of bread 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.999
 or even simply so cont 

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:06.319
 and then you need only ip tutor 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:07.619
 turner 

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:10.619
 and then it would be able to print 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.620
 think of it, I applied it on the card it works a lot 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.620
 to the attack because we can give them the shape we want 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.930
 well - let's dip in the salami 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:30.210
 and then we print 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.210
 candy papers 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:40.159
 and then we know again 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:44.259
 and if you see that even the various waste all scattered on the floor perfect for this 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:45.220
 type of printing 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.189
 because we can't cut whatever shape we need 

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:49.789
 where we eat in color 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:53.889
 and then we try to press the bottom so that we can then print well 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:58.439
 with this facebook method in a beautiful gray finish 

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:04.430
 also calls a total landing 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.669
 the extra day lorenzo a marvel and also on this site I am in cut 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.669
 toilet paper 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:17.159
 but you have already managed to guess what will come out in the end 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:20.159
 I bet not 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.400
 this is a truly extraordinary technique 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.540
 but you want to know which are the best tools to be able to print 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.340
 this is the reality you don't believe in and then before doing the job I am 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.699
 to make me put on an apron to protect the ready-made clothes 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:42.279
 an incredible feeling and then with a lot of sleeves you can do lots of them 

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:46.080
 other things looked at for example with these slaps I realized the most 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.080
 salami of this incredible peacock 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.030
 and instead you think the toilet paper of this fish I made only with the 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.330
 fingertips only with fingertips 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:56.740
 try it too 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.439
 boys unfortunately for today the art attacks are over 

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:03.089
 we'll see you in the next episode of aosta hearts aspect
