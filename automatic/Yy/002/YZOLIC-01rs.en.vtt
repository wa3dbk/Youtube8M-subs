00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
the lid yeah just just enough for you to

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.990 
the lid yeah just just enough for you to
take<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.079> off<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.470> your<00:01:41.130> hand<00:01:41.400> does<00:01:41.610> does

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
take it off so that your hand does does

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.679 
take it off so that your hand does does
not<00:01:42.030> touch<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.869> hot<00:01:43.200> water<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.479> just<00:01:45.479> let<00:01:45.570> it

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
not touch the hot water and just let it

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.310 
not touch the hot water and just let it
sit<00:01:46.079> there<00:01:46.110> for<00:01:46.350> around<00:01:47.100> five<00:01:47.930> five<00:01:48.930> minutes

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
sit there for around five five minutes

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.850 
sit there for around five five minutes
or<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.740> or<00:01:50.070> even<00:01:51.060> shorter<00:01:51.479> because<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:52.439> heat

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
or so or even shorter because the heat

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.539 
or so or even shorter because the heat
will<00:01:53.460> eventually<00:01:54.450> melt<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.320> hardened<00:01:55.890> nail

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
will eventually melt the hardened nail

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.030 
will eventually melt the hardened nail
polish<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.270> think<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.200> very<00:01:58.530> good<00:01:58.799> way

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
polish I think this is a very good way

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.240 
polish I think this is a very good way
because<00:01:59.369> you<00:02:00.240> do<00:02:00.420> not<00:02:00.540> have<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.960> add<00:02:01.290> any<00:02:01.950> other

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
because you do not have to add any other

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.880 
because you do not have to add any other
things<00:02:03.469> like

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.620 

just<00:02:08.179> hot<00:02:09.179> water<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:09.750> enough<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:11.510> when<00:02:12.510> you

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
just hot water is enough and when you

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.830 
just hot water is enough and when you
take<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:12.990> up<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:14.430> should<00:02:14.490> be<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.750> good<00:02:16.470> ass<00:02:16.590> meal

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
take it up it should be a good ass meal

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.290 
take it up it should be a good ass meal
yes<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:19.320> is<00:02:19.560> very<00:02:21.410> smooth<00:02:22.410> like<00:02:22.440> now<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:24.090> nail

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
yes it is very smooth like now the nail

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
yes it is very smooth like now the nail
polish<00:02:24.660> is<00:02:24.780> very<00:02:25.080> smooth<00:02:25.490> so<00:02:26.780> this<00:02:27.780> method<00:02:28.170> can

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
polish is very smooth so this method can

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.120 
polish is very smooth so this method can
also<00:02:28.410> be<00:02:28.800> used<00:02:29.220> if<00:02:29.580> you<00:02:29.640> find<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.480> your<00:02:31.130> nail

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.479 
sure that you use a cup any cup model
but<00:02:44.910> usually<00:02:45.300> I<00:02:45.330> use<00:02:45.420> a<00:02:45.660> paper<00:02:45.930> cup<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.560> don't

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
but usually I use a paper cup and don't

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.110 
but usually I use a paper cup and don't
use<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:48.090> cup<00:02:48.840> that<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:49.320> are<00:02:49.500> going<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:50.120> drink

with<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:51.540> because<00:02:52.520> nail<00:02:53.520> polish<00:02:53.940> is<00:02:54.150> made<00:02:54.630> up

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
with it because nail polish is made up
