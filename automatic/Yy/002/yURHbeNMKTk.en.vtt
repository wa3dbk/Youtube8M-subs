00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160
 good people, my phaser 2013 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:13.019
 2014 model 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:16.100
 I ordered the tank to ask for a 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.890
 greater protection for the tank 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:23.689
 I ordered it in the style of carbon fiber 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.689
 on the fuel cap 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:33.600
 I put the rearview mirror and manet 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:39.350
 experience're the rearview only with 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:41.850
 the blue one to him has the blue mirror too 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.840
 as unsuccessful in showing names in 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.320
 special here in the rearview mirror 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:52.980
 You're giving it to show. 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:56.430
 but the good is of the species 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:01.160
 the handle also of the species 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.629
 The government will focus, not wanting to. 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.760
 to focus on I think I'm giving it to you 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.920
 see 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:12.390
 It's the kind of thing it's the cool handle I think. 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.470
 that will get better 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:23.689
 hence the name without dispensing're 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.689
 it has six types of regulation there 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:35.720
 black slider only with blue bridge 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:38.119
 stay very flashy thing very 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.329
 overloaded, right? 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:49.710
 there you will see 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:52.560
 It's the handle, it's a little shorter and 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.950
 is a little more square in relation to 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.909
 original 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.290
 I liked 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.240
 It's a great night, the rearview mirror. 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.799
 you will not have equal visibility 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.580
 to the original but will have a visibility 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.580
 very cool too 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.920
 I liked 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.190

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.970

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:26.160
 It 's a nice thing to catch your eye. 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:29.910

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:34.560

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.150

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.080

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:01.670

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:05.400
 He's silver gray, I do not know. 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:10.140

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:15.620
 all all black has nothing chrome 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.620

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.519
 tasty 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.989
 there it seemed more aggressive with the 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.989
 mirrors and lower 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.920

 cup of human jati bengal to paint with 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:05.880
 black paint so thermostatic 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:09.959
