00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.909
 permaculture because of the greater attention of the cousin so that our 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:05.319
 life as a whole 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:06.640
 support for 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.640
 every planet that we can all live in a way that does not degrade our 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.000
 I'm going to try to bring some examples to clear opponents. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.759
 to ask what the needs are 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:19.730
 basically of any and all service 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.560
 let's take every human being 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.859
 in the plot 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.070
 have energy 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.339
 and optimize 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:29.579
 use of the area 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.489
 these are basic needs 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.200
 the way of life that we have today the way geni as hegemonic 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.270
 perdomo after monaco there are some ways of life 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.850
 you beaches that are differentiated 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.739
 but the way of life of our globalized society today 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.760
 it by itself the shocking 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.760
 the constructions of ours they use 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.430
 many resources that have exhausted many resources that were already of the 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.810
 example cement and faith are great seasons 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.360
 in the mineral so that we can have to see the marina that is the cement 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.739
 ah 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:05.920
 ours 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.090
 our food production today 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.690
 responsible for the loss of biodiversity, so they ask for 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.030
 monocultures because they count on nation to solve them by the use of poison 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.120
 push that 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.380
 instead of residing can absolve from the earth 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.350
 the original animals press 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.049
 the water that we use the gnv to dispense it is mistreated but it does not have 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:32.940
 caution 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:33.909
 with water 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:34.990
 the people 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.210
 is aware that 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.050
 Not even in Brazil. 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.940
 Although the buttocks are large the process requires change but at the same time 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.829
 time we have to accept these people have no concept 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.310
 problem, not even for example. 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.799
 technical france 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.049
 is the water that the box started in this they have a way of celebrating the 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.300
 water that the government 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.109
 to return to the top just because there really is an option 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:07.060
 but also this marriage exactly 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.849
 this piece received athlete's pass are forms 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:10.849
 and that we can 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.079
 walk 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:16.169
 for changes what obama proposed procon is what are so in fact the 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:21.099
 changes as then used so that we do not no gradient does not know 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.930
 how to construct so that anacom are be ecological 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.180
 more energy than the fourth element. 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.070
 commit more 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.450
 is a matter is obvious - the basis with the country has such a blackout 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.939
 so experts in the basic question 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:38.889
 I participate in this peace event, we already have an impact on Christmas, so we 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:39.749
 found in a 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:43.719
 billiard bill as well as the firm suspension we have that he speaks me 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:48.229
 I need to eat I need to live I need to use nor general to be used 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:51.449
 only that I am faithful as a society I only know how to do this 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:52.909
 shockingly 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:56.760
 then hasten method of how to do it otherwise in fact here it is 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.899
 as if it were a fan of the cacao 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:00.519
 the net change 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.160
 for you to live another way I still ask you something here 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.580
 always recurring I always think once a while ago I have 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.590
 what to do 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:10.640
 in my building 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.640
 the selective collection of garbage that when we think about going we interviewed 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:18.950
 causing great impact that the environment 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.889
 we always think and anyone can understand 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:23.180
 even in your house 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.299
 on the rubbish issue 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.890
 when all this we proved it 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.400
 then I wonder if I, for example, decided to make a collection 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.679
 selective waste 

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:33.469
 in my house 

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:37.469
 and then suddenly I can expand caracoleta program buildings 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:41.699
 but I know if for example the government should know if the case is not because we are 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:42.520
 in Brasilia 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.609
 and you do not have 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:48.279
 this is if the selective collection and forwarded major is important that I 

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:52.569
 I'm still doing my homework or how it's going to make no difference. 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.989
 point of view is about the future I think it is 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.069
 You do the same as you forgot and young people mix it up later. 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.329
 because even itataia debate process they can process 

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:08.039
 what goes to the law will compel the selective collection then if the march 

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:11.609
 separate what you after your fight this is an aspect another aspect is that 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:15.479
 when you start taking that attitude is the first 

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:18.900
 consensus is that you go in the regional problem part time that 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.210
 you see how much garbage you produce is the first step prosequi ltda 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.919
 threat contained in them 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.300
 because in our conception it is a little beyond the mental conception the 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.439
 problem is not just the trash itself 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:33.029
 the problem of garbage is one of the biggest problems, especially in the centers 

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:35.729
 urban nÃ© nana in the areas the bando 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:37.879
 only that is not the problem itself 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:39.590
 the problem is all 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.620
 the chain of unsustainability that is behind the list that normally 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.940
 is associated with industrialized products then for example 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.990
 when we have a soda 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.639
 in a note to tam pac 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:50.750
 returning to normal 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.309
 one pt 

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:54.030
 that step to exist 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.030
 he started there in oil extraction 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:04:59.379
 we go through a chain
