00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.720
 day and persuasion 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:23.730
 some means of protection handcuffs 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.899
 special belts that are used 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.020
 other companies 

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:30.180
 we do not have it because it is prohibited by law 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.239
 we have black lists in the west 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.719

 associated with the report of some

 damage a person can for five years 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.719
 lose the ability to fly Afghans 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.190
 while he can fly any other 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.109
 centuries can fly 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.989
 today one of the leaders of european 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:01:00.329
 the airline proposed to create a common 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.339
 world blacklist is not there yet 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.110
 I think this world is cooked will come a 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.360
 if you have a list do you have 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.100
 whether statistics meet twice 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.600
 the same rowdy of mine from fresh 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.560
 such two thousand passengers 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.350
 we take for ourselves increased measures 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.210
 attention when passengers are already 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.689
 brought trouble we have on 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.399
 board 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.640
 it may be in the crew will appear 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.770
 man among built neat 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.600
 Stuart girls who can somehow 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.119
 respond to it so then explain 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.829
 Now that everyone understood the riot on board 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.840
 the aircraft is generally 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.100
 rather a russian problem or is it 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.380
 serious global problem 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.600
 civil aviation this problem is common 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.479
 This is a global TV company problem. 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.490
 suffer from inadequate passengers where 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.030
 the most cruel laws in which country 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.859
 Yes, I think in the United States from the fact that I 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.560
 had to read there very much 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:54.570
 strain strain systems act of terror there 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.850
 very tough laws and thereâ€™s not 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.759
 stand on ceremony here this situation with violent 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.159
 passengers how many cases occur in 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.280
 month and former aboard and we have 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.590
 last year we did not allow on board 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.350
 what kind of humanity can a person be 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.150
 order there are 800 people in general but still 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.680
 somewhere may be about 150 very 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.620
 excited and you think that after all 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.290
 the black 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.330
 ski high fines and maybe even 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.370
 prison sentences are the most 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.959
 effective tools in solving 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.879
 this problem will fly to us 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.830
 safety is top priority 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:29.860
 what are they worth these passenger can 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.510
 smash the porthole and the plane will enter 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.989
 depressurization zones all passengers 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.489
 died 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.230
 blacklists is the airline 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.810
 state your attitude towards 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.290
 the passenger who rowdy behaved 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.290
 inadequate
