00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.860
 mogers e dear friends today we are with 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:12.520
 again we are on my map 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.619
 lost 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.199
 from the right you already see ours today 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:19.539
 guest who run very hard on me 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.400
 for what i did to him i turned him into 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.019
 decorative creeper which is very 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.880
 may be useful to you at home 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.829
 the fact is that the creeper is the most 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.810
 serious probably the worst 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.730
 animal in minecraft because 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.070
 exploding he carries your card a 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.650
 means and your structure or mechanisms but 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.020
 our current system will help us 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.060
 so to say tame make safe 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.890
 and keep practically at home 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.900
 well now let's consider it in 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.330
 details of the mechanics of this work 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.130
 art is just enough this creeper 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.840
 which sits in the boiler above which 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.580
 a glass block is installed and the fact is 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.190
 the creeper can only hide in that 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.870
 if he looks at you directly in 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.150
 in this case, he looks at us through 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.370
 glass block so even if i come back 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.320
 to survival mode how close I am to him 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.239
 I'll go he will not notice me thanks 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.159
 a block that stands on and on his head 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.020
 but they die he only because of in 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.670
 the mechanics of the glass block itself as you 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.039
 remember if we ourselves are inside 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.929
 glass blocks we will not die either 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:17.289
 so the creeper is the same so he 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:19.090
 humbly sits does not see us and waits for her 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.130
 a fate that is unlikely to come 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.840
 i think every one of you can say mo 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.939
 jade is of course so smart you 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.039
 sprinkled the creeper inside the boiler and now 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.929
 in bragging and how do we get this 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.090
 the system itself in survival how its there 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:33.069
 cram actually i'm decent 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.840
 broke his head over this but the decision 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:36.819
 it turned out quite simple I was building 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.520
 big gears but could do 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:41.560
 here so we put the web above the boiler and 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.770
 it appears the creeper or we him there 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.359
 we find now everything is quite simple in 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.340
 first we need of course to return to 

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:50.679
 survival and wait until this creeper 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.630
 his web will climb into this cauldron 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.639
 will slow down at this point and it will become 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.409
 so cute that slowing down will 

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:58.959
 fall down one fine moment he 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.060
 just fall into this boiler and can't 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:03.310
 get out of it because jump 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.409
 in the web he can't he now 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.329
 immobilized and even survival we can to 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.800
 come close to him and nothing to us for 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.780
 it will not be because the web 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.790
 currently playing the role of glass 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.620
 well, and now such a purely aesthetic 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.680
 part of the mechanism we need to do everything 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.689
 beautiful that is, replace this one lesson 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.790
 and block the web on something pretty 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:22.920
 for example a blue glass block I think it 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.230
 it was good enough to roll here 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.540
 Here is a design piston under it 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.879
 block here the glass here we put the lever and on 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.950
 the moment of activation of this lever block 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.049
 the glass will move will break the web then 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.209
 will fall out and the clipper will be inside 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.250
 glass then you can destroy everything 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.680
 superfluous designs and we get our 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.870
 originally a creeper who turned out to be 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.180
 trapped well and now a couple is enough 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.950
 fun aesthetic remarks first 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.609
 The clipper is still hostile 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.859
 mobs 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:51.599
 and that he did not know was performed at the time of 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.400
 of our absence we can him 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.220
 rename using not mtg 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.030
 add him a name and he definitely never 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.579
 will not disappear 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.250
 we call this property minecraft mechanics 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:04.200
 his flesh and very merry slow 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.000
 pm after we renamed 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.950
 tag we put it like this 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.290
 way on our creeper and now have 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.569
 he has a name so he will not disappear but 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.150
 and 2 is quite interesting and unfortunately 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.799
 not very aesthetically pleasing i fix things worth 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.049
 boiler so it is a little higher 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.940
 the sex itself and since it is enough 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.129
 tall part of his head if 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.810
 take a closer look bulging over our blogs 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.549
 which is on top but the whole joke 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.470
 is that while here 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.030
 is the head creeper and set 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.250
 no block here 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.989
 try unless you can of course with 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.180
 the same way around and around 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.159
 place the piston here and so 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.109
 way to push yourself another block 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:42.810
 get a kind of capsule with 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:44.549
 creeper in my opinion not bad but further 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.500
 in principle, you can already exhale as 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.930
 want the main thing not to overdo the hour I tell you 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.459
 show you another interesting room idea 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.009
 with a creeper that could be done 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.810
 with this mechanism , the main thing here 

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:56.970
 do not overdo it here these blocks 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.129
 who are around they exist 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.590
 so that the creeper does not run away because 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:03.599
 like if we replace here the boiler unit 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.609
 will disappear its main feature of the boiler 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.500
 there are walls that do not allow to get out 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:09.540
 creepers if we replace it with any 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.849
 The usual block then these stenochek not 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.560
 there will be a creeper just push well well 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.299
 now we can put any blocks already 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.159
 practically and replace them like this 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.229
 the way we get is fasten from in 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:21.120
 such a cage and get out of here already 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.370
 cannot and explode in any way if 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.110
 we'll get the main joke of course in 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.060
 that is what needs to be done with practically 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.760
 with any mobs but probably gast 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.320
 Enderman Ender dragon can get 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.180
 enough 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.100
 interesting decorative capsule which 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.740
 will decorate your house like this 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.720
 I hope I gave you an interesting idea. 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.880
 and now you will use at 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.820
 your buildings and with you was on j 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.040
 thank you all for watching all bye and with 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.320
 these guys need to start already fun 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.010
 then we do this and charge in 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.340
 him an arrow 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:57.440
 great hit there is a second third 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:05:00.820
 fourth now he is on low hp and can 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.820
 attack already in live
