00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
the friction clamp you pretty much get

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.229 
the friction clamp you pretty much get
an<00:00:45.770> indefinite<00:00:46.770> amount<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.579> adjustability

an indefinite amount of adjustability

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.240 
an indefinite amount of adjustability
you<00:00:48.629> can<00:00:48.809> adjust<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.289> any<00:00:49.379> angle<00:00:49.950> any

direction you want scotty takes a

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.350 
direction you want scotty takes a
slightly<00:00:53.399> different<00:00:53.640> approach<00:00:54.230> they<00:00:55.230> use<00:00:55.530> a

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
slightly different approach they use a

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.560 
slightly different approach they use a
socket<00:00:57.360> mount<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:58.489> has<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> stem<00:00:59.940> and<00:00:59.969> locking

stem<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.680> locking<00:01:02.100> stem<00:01:02.340> requires<00:01:02.820> you

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
stem and that locking stem requires you

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.080 
stem and that locking stem requires you
to<00:01:03.210> line<00:01:03.420> up<00:01:03.660> your<00:01:04.159> rod<00:01:05.159> holder<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.580> certain<00:01:05.970> way

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
to line up your rod holder a certain way

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.060 
to line up your rod holder a certain way
into<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.720> base<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.229> order<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.619> get<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.830> positive

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
into the base in order to get a positive

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.190 
into the base in order to get a positive
lock<00:01:08.580> but<00:01:08.820> once<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.210> positively<00:01:09.659> locked<00:01:09.990> in

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
lock but once it's positively locked in

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.590 
lock but once it's positively locked in
there<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.890> rob<00:01:11.100> holder<00:01:11.430> can't<00:01:11.670> come<00:01:11.880> out<00:01:12.060> and

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
there that rob holder can't come out and

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.179 
there that rob holder can't come out and
you<00:01:12.900> can<00:01:13.080> adjust<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:14.299> direction<00:01:15.299> both

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
you can adjust the direction both

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.670 
you can adjust the direction both
horizontally<00:01:17.189> as<00:01:17.580> well<00:01:17.750> as<00:01:18.750> vertically<00:01:19.290> and

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
horizontally as well as vertically and

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.340 
horizontally as well as vertically and
on<00:01:19.979> both<00:01:20.250> accounts<00:01:20.549> they<00:01:20.939> use<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.210> what<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.170> would

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
on both accounts they use a what I would

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.350 
on both accounts they use a what I would
call<00:01:22.500> gears<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.340> sort<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.670> lock<00:01:23.939> them<00:01:24.180> into

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
call gears that sort of lock them into

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
call gears that sort of lock them into
place<00:01:24.479> as<00:01:24.990> you're<00:01:25.950> as<00:01:26.369> you're<00:01:26.520> adjusting<00:01:26.909> that

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
place as you're as you're adjusting that

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.620 
place as you're as you're adjusting that
rail<00:01:28.380> blaze'<00:01:28.939> takes<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.090> different<00:01:30.390> approach

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
rail blaze' takes a different approach

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.649 
rail blaze' takes a different approach
similar<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.770> Scotty's<00:01:32.250> they<00:01:33.000> use<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.210> stem<00:01:33.630> and

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
similar to Scotty's they use a stem and

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.569 
similar to Scotty's they use a stem and
socket<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.770> can<00:01:34.799> see<00:01:35.040> there's<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.280> star

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
socket you can see there's a star

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.060 
socket you can see there's a star
pattern<00:01:35.820> on<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.210> bottom<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:37.770> mount

itself can be left unlocked as it is
right<00:01:41.520> now<00:01:41.700> which<00:01:41.909> means<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.270> can<00:01:42.479> pull<00:01:42.689> my<00:01:43.530> rod

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
right now which means I can pull my rod

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
there it is now positively locked in

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.530 
there it is now positively locked in
there<00:01:50.310> it's<00:01:50.430> locked<00:01:51.090> in<00:01:51.329> position<00:01:51.979> but<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.159> the

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
there it's locked in position but on the

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
and on the vertical control they use it

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.160 
and on the vertical control they use it
your<00:01:59.460> mechanism<00:01:59.969> very<00:02:00.090> similar<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.600> Scotty<00:02:00.869> so

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
your mechanism very similar to Scotty so

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.469 
your mechanism very similar to Scotty so
you<00:02:01.320> can<00:02:01.500> control<00:02:01.890> what<00:02:02.579> direction<00:02:03.119> your<00:02:03.270> rod

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
you can control what direction your rod

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.670 
you can control what direction your rod
holder<00:02:03.810> is<00:02:03.899> mounted
