it's<00:02:51.359> quite<00:02:51.569> cool<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.019> useful<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:53.040> this<00:02:53.190> is<00:02:53.250> a

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
it's quite cool and useful so this is a

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.509 
it's quite cool and useful so this is a
small<00:02:53.549> one<00:02:53.760> so<00:02:53.970> let's<00:02:54.269> see<00:02:54.540> this<00:02:54.690> one<00:02:55.400> now<00:02:56.400> my

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
small one so let's see this one now my

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.099 
small one so let's see this one now my
connection<00:02:56.880> is<00:02:56.940> not<00:02:57.060> that<00:02:57.329> fast<00:02:57.630> so<00:02:57.810> it<00:02:57.900> would

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
connection is not that fast so it would

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:01.400 
connection is not that fast so it would
take<00:02:58.349> some<00:02:58.620> time<00:02:58.829> to<00:02:58.980> load<00:02:59.130> up<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.549> video<00:03:00.410> but

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
take some time to load up the video but

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.259 
take some time to load up the video but
as<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:01.680> loads<00:03:01.829> up<00:03:02.160> you<00:03:02.340> see<00:03:02.669> that<00:03:02.880> there's<00:03:03.090> no

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
as it loads up you see that there's no

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.449 
as it loads up you see that there's no
starter<00:03:03.599> or<00:03:03.750> leg<00:03:04.019> like<00:03:04.380> in<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.590> previous<00:03:04.739> ICS

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
improvement as some people would not

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.200 
improvement as some people would not
install<00:04:27.590> cm9<00:04:28.190> just<00:04:28.490> because<00:04:28.760> it<00:04:28.910> doesn't

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
install cm9 just because it doesn't

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.510 
install cm9 just because it doesn't
support<00:04:29.510> video<00:04:29.870> playback<00:04:30.130> so<00:04:31.130> now<00:04:31.250> you<00:04:31.310> can

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520
