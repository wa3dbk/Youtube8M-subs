gluten-free<00:02:27.900> flour<00:02:28.410> looks<00:02:28.680> like<00:02:28.860> in<00:02:29.010> case<00:02:29.220> you

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
gluten-free flour looks like in case you

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.460 
gluten-free flour looks like in case you

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.560 

and<00:02:33.560> then<00:02:34.310> this<00:02:34.520> is<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.730> other<00:02:34.940> stuff<00:02:35.270> which<00:02:35.420> I

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
and then this is the other stuff which I

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.120 
and then this is the other stuff which I
don't<00:02:35.840> know<00:02:35.960> how<00:02:36.140> to<00:02:36.230> pronounce<00:02:36.440> so<00:02:36.950> I'm<00:02:37.040> not

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
don't know how to pronounce so I'm not

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.589

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.790 

so<00:02:42.599> we<00:02:42.720> just<00:02:42.840> want<00:02:43.020> to<00:02:43.140> whisk<00:02:43.319> all<00:02:43.620> this

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
so we just want to whisk all this

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.470 
so we just want to whisk all this
together<00:02:43.980> so<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.520> all<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.819> ingredients<00:02:44.970> are

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
together so that all the ingredients are

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.020

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
incorporated and there are spread evenly

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:55.520 
incorporated and there are spread evenly
throughout<00:02:53.330> next<00:02:54.330> we're<00:02:54.630> going<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:55.050> take<00:02:55.230> our

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.770 

and<00:03:25.340> we<00:03:25.520> can<00:03:25.670> slowly<00:03:25.970> add<00:03:26.210> in<00:03:26.240> the<00:03:26.600> dry

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
and we can slowly add in the dry

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:48.820 
and we can slowly add in the dry
ingredients

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.920 

so<00:03:49.580> I<00:03:49.610> couldn't<00:03:49.850> find<00:03:50.090> gluten-free<00:03:50.330> graham

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
a plastic bag and it doesn't really

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.540 
a plastic bag and it doesn't really
matter<00:03:59.660> how<00:04:00.020> many<00:04:00.200> of<00:04:00.350> easy<00:04:00.740> use<00:04:01.070> it<00:04:01.340> kind<00:04:01.520> of

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.680 

I<00:04:08.560> thought<00:04:09.310> there<00:04:09.520> is<00:04:09.670> so<00:04:09.880> cute<00:04:10.210> this<00:04:10.360> one's<00:04:10.600> a

I thought there is so cute this one's a
little<00:04:10.780> pig<00:04:11.730> so<00:04:12.730> I'm<00:04:12.820> just<00:04:13.000> taking<00:04:13.270> a<00:04:13.330> rolling

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
little pig so I'm just taking a rolling

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.540 
little pig so I'm just taking a rolling
pin<00:04:13.810> and<00:04:13.870> just<00:04:14.140> mashing<00:04:14.740> all<00:04:15.010> these<00:04:15.160> up<00:04:15.340> and

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
pin and just mashing all these up and

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.910 
pin and just mashing all these up and
you<00:04:15.970> can<00:04:16.120> also<00:04:16.269> use<00:04:16.450> a<00:04:16.630> food<00:04:16.959> processor<00:04:17.019> if<00:04:17.769> you

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
you can also use a food processor if you

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.370 
you can also use a food processor if you
don't<00:04:18.100> want<00:04:18.250> to<00:04:18.310> do<00:04:18.400> this<00:04:18.519> by<00:04:18.700> hand

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:42.650 

you

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.720 

so<00:04:43.620> now<00:04:43.680> i'm<00:04:43.800> just<00:04:43.860> going<00:04:44.130> to<00:04:44.160> put<00:04:44.220> these<00:04:44.430> into

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
so now i'm just going to put these into

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.940 
so now i'm just going to put these into
the<00:04:44.940> goal<00:04:45.180> and<00:04:45.480> i<00:04:45.840> have<00:04:45.990> some<00:04:46.230> melted<00:04:46.530> butter<00:04:46.560> i

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
the goal and i have some melted butter i

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.280 
the goal and i have some melted butter i
have<00:04:47.160> like<00:04:47.280> about<00:04:47.580> a<00:04:47.610> tablespoon<00:04:48.300> but<00:04:49.170> it

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
have like about a tablespoon but it

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.160 
have like about a tablespoon but it
really<00:04:49.440> depends<00:04:49.800> on<00:04:49.950> how<00:04:50.010> many<00:04:51.170> graham

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
really depends on how many graham

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.200 
really depends on how many graham
cracker<00:04:52.470> crumbs<00:04:52.890> that<00:04:53.100> you<00:04:53.250> have<00:04:53.460> and<00:04:54.000> you

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
cracker crumbs that you have and you

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.850 
cracker crumbs that you have and you
just<00:04:54.390> want<00:04:54.570> enough<00:04:54.900> butter<00:04:55.230> just<00:04:55.560> so<00:04:55.710> that<00:04:55.830> i

mixture and putting it into a plastic

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.990 
mixture and putting it into a plastic
bag<00:05:30.470> that<00:05:30.950> way<00:05:31.070> it's<00:05:31.250> a<00:05:31.310> little<00:05:31.490> bit<00:05:31.610> easier<00:05:31.910> to

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
bag that way it's a little bit easier to

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.800

put<00:05:32.330> into<00:05:32.480> our<00:05:32.630> jars

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.379 

so<00:05:38.650> you<00:05:38.740> can<00:05:38.860> just<00:05:39.010> cut<00:05:39.190> the<00:05:39.280> end<00:05:39.460> off<00:05:39.639> and<00:05:40.030> kind

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 
so you can just cut the end off and kind

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:55.159 
so you can just cut the end off and kind
of<00:05:40.450> just<00:05:40.630> pipe<00:05:40.960> it<00:05:41.110> in<00:05:41.260> to<00:05:41.590> the<00:05:41.710> jars

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.169 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:57.709 

and<00:05:55.499> I'm<00:05:56.039> also<00:05:56.219> putting<00:05:56.580> a<00:05:56.849> Hershey<00:05:57.090> bar<00:05:57.270> on

00:05:57.709 --> 00:05:57.719 
and I'm also putting a Hershey bar on

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:00.110

each<00:05:58.139> of<00:05:58.560> the<00:05:58.650> cupcakes<00:05:59.069> and<00:05:59.610> those<00:05:59.939> are

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
each of the cupcakes and those are

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.360 
each of the cupcakes and those are
gluten-free<00:06:00.539> tale<00:06:00.960> so<00:06:01.889> I'm<00:06:01.979> just<00:06:02.159> putting

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
gluten-free tale so I'm just putting

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.119 
gluten-free tale so I'm just putting
these<00:06:02.669> cupcakes<00:06:03.330> into<00:06:03.840> a<00:06:04.139> water<00:06:04.590> bath<00:06:04.860> and

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:05.129 
these cupcakes into a water bath and

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:08.379 
these cupcakes into a water bath and
this<00:06:05.219> has<00:06:05.370> about<00:06:05.520> an<00:06:05.669> inch<00:06:05.789> of<00:06:05.939> water<00:06:05.969> in<00:06:06.360> it

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:08.389 
this has about an inch of water in it

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:10.700 
this has about an inch of water in it
so<00:06:09.389> now<00:06:09.540> we<00:06:09.600> can<00:06:09.780> take<00:06:09.960> our<00:06:10.050> marshmallow<00:06:10.530> fluff
