00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.660
 and so hello everyone today i'm reviewing 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.300
 your device 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:12.080
 mouse had a series with someone assholes two points 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.080
 mouse 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.430
 what are we so good 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.350
 I have already unpacked this wire or 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.039
 I was just too lazy to disconnect from 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.960
 about because it was not necessary far from 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:50.260
 general muscular and good then her 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:52.530
 get here this see the percentage of 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.530
 paint 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:12.659
 what comes with the mouse 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.659
 waiting for instructions on how to guide and 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.500
 here the legs are these legs here 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.750
 bundled but I chose a safe place 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.210
 not to lose them 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.210
 hair well, in general, the mouse is very cool 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.620
 let's perhaps start with 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.120
 sledges generally hull foundation basis 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.080
 shells is gloss 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:59.880
 Well, some say that the type of gloss 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.020
 when in heavy play the hand sweats and everything 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.420
 and he slipped out 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.670
 how can you introduce you mouse 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.940
 Slip and play likely base 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.160
 on whether you like the tower at all possible so 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:14.130
 for my use that degree 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:19.890
 use half a year and in such cases 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:22.440
 never had a general body at all 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.350
 in the middle glossy over the counter stealth 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:30.500
 services and on the sides of a plastic black 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:35.360
 such a mouse has four buttons that is 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:38.940
 left right setting now and scroll 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:43.890
 here is such a lush no what 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:46.440
 no frills and not generally like everything 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:53.459
 in general, this is just under my arm 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:55.770
 to introduce in general here so a cable from 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.870
 The mouse goes 2 meters that is, you will be 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:02.280
 just pull on the computer if you 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:05.910
 You play with the mouse table here at the most 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:10.280
 3200 mice you do not have them completely 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.280
 enough to play 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.780
 and I don't need to release mice anymore 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.320
 8200 dipiai there 6005 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.720
 we a little a lot do not need 3000 children like 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:32.620
 it's just not clear why such mice 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:35.630
 In general, they release here further 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.540
 the program response, press the key 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.760
 rest one millisecond i.e. called 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.500
 its right there that is not on some 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.140
 someone kept the mouse and a little bit necessary 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.770
 wait for a shot from so this 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:51.470
 the mouse is very cool in general form 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:54.230
 so streamlined such radici ska and 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:58.960
 so to say this because I have water 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:02.870
 big yes and on me here just that is 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:07.490
 here is someone here I do not know here are such here 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:10.280
 I have them here and I just do not know 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.990
 Well, in general, it should be 7 cool I 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.440
 at first was not used to thinking she 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.989
 I understood the attention of colleagues as well as to keep and 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:24.050
 I have become much better controlled and 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:28.390
 click on it and so on well in general 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.390
 I don't know what to say about her anymore 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:35.330
 you need to try yourself generally 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.270
 singled out saw me release a long time 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.060
 floated it all on in this mouse 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:43.900
 but I really like it here such here 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.900
 clicks out 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:52.759
 Here it seems to 3 million clicks 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:59.300
 world like a guarantee it will be me 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:05:03.020
 Enough, of course, try la 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.300
 go say so to you each everyone 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:11.120
 its own grip is mine that may not suit 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:11.780
 everyone here and she approached me in general also 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.000
 there is 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.729
 color set that is, there is 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.190
 yellow like i have kind of black 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:25.639
 blue and red that's what i have 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:28.699
 A special version of the special chop he ate from 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:31.099
 how much does it cost but I bought it for 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:36.889
 two seven hundred ninety nine is obtained 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:40.039
 2800 in Yekaterinburg was also here 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:41.900
 steelseries kinzu in one on it 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:45.590
 players complained that it was impossible 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:50.330
 disable acceleration by all nation this 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:53.719
 very dull thing for a player here but 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:56.270
 the floor of the tower is all set up that is you 

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:58.520
 you can also download the program 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.210
 steelseries engine not finish everything 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.880
 four 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.650
 which you have here under your 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:06.529
 any settings there under your 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:09.830
 function for example you can click us 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:14.419
 Crow you will start the browser as well, 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:19.550
 Here and perhaps on this all try and 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:23.210
 experiment choose and to you 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:25.460
 the mouse is the main thing that the mouse was sitting comfortably but 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:28.069
 never buy a tower and to 7 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.810
 but if at all the options are over 

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:34.139
 then buy fornication 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:40.919
 here it is not so expensive here in 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:43.620
 within 1000 rubles she's good 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:46.229
 overall that's all if you enjoyed it
