 good hello friends of friends and friends of 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.670
 youtube in this new video I'm going to 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.790
 teach how to get around the terminal 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:13.590
 samsung galaxy mini to be able to have more 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.270
 privileges in the next terminal 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.770
 Well now the first thing we have to 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.240
 do is download us files and 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.279
 I will leave you in the description of the video 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:26.760
 which are the pd 1 sip and the galaxy mini 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.040
 this and this these two in a rush serves 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.830
 to eliminate what we recommend them 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.570
 and the good pd before recreating before 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.320
 do this process first look at the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.110
 or video twice and make sure it 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.820
 what are you doing and then you can 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.060
 perform the good process 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.190
 before starting to surround him if he wants 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.260
 to finish the warranty friend has been 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.930
 finished yet but I have done it to be able 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.489

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.850

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:00.580
 downloaded files we will pay 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.970
 our good mobile phone does not 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.970
 I'll pay 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.040
 we give it to him like that 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.040
 but we are going to disappear 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.190
 but all because of poor video quality 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.990
 I do not know then to start the cover 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.750

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.409

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.200
