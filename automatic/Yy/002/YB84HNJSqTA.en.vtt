00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.180
 very good guys was minecraft drone 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.490
 to bring a new chrome in kraft 1.7 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.870
 point 10 called strings ponders comfort 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.330
 what if I'm not going to leave when I install it 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:23.000
 and he's very cool because he creates rivers 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.980
 with realistic current besides that has 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.040
 tributaries in a super super way 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.480
 realistic and as you can see what else 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.510
 cool we have like small waterfalls 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.820
 as the level of the 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.129
 mountains and so on so all this 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.050
 is super super handsome the truth is that 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.850
 it's pretty cool also according to what 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.100
 language because the rivers are different and 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.050
 It also creates a spectacular 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.550
 bestial according to which sites now 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.769
 I will also teach some languages 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.870
 different and they also work in the 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:53.570
 neider on the other hand we have a part 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.580
 bad or not so good and we have 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.680
 first that create a new world for 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.839
 to be able to use this mode is valid if not 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.269
 we can load the worlds that we already have 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:04.190
 because it tells us that you can not play 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.900
 with this mod but it is a new world 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.549
 with him and on the other hand we have to 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.960
 also install an app and neither 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.700
 it's so bad because most of the assets 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.890
 also if we have a mode that is 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.350
 fairly 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.729
 well I'm not big I do not want to change 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.010
 some things some mechanics of 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.200
 minecraft we need an app and for what 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.060
 make it run then it's totally 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.440
 normal but good negative point because 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.260
 we need two files to be able 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.550
 run a single monkey and good what has 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.310
 also good apart all this that you 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.479
 he said is that it works with different 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.190
 large bikes that also generate 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.020
 terrain such as the bio meter 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.570
 plenty the test kraft firm the 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.119
 alternative rain generator the realistic and 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.220
 workhen the editor the misplacement you see xl 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.740
 et cetera etcetera etcetera and well then 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.450
 if we carry it around the world with these many 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.070
 but at the same time we also have 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.350
 This installed mode will be generated 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.340
 likewise these rivers with current like 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.930
 You see that it has led to the 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.270
 boat that have generated over there up 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.729
 this part where a mess has been created 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.170
 normal of minecraft that good the world 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.570
 has to do with this but it goes on 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.280
 strip for that is here and well then it 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.369
 has stopped usually stand on this 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.530
 type of rivers or in seas then it is 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.120
 very very handsome comes a turn because 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.820
 I want to point out some other type of river 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.800
 so you can see how great it is and 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.550
 right away I return good children then here 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.900
 we are in another sitting 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.190
 we are in savanna is very very handsome 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.840
 now you will see a part a part of 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.220
 mountain that we have out there that is 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.530
 great right next to a tributary 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.990
 and the truth is that the landscape is 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.990
 beautiful and especially now that good 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.250
 country is automatically on the river not the 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.320
 truth that you will see that it is nonsense 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.790
 Well, it's worth breaking the brand is that 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.560
 is pulling accelerate to go a little more 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.160
 quick so you can see it faster but 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.020
 there are times when it hit me it is normal to me 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.660
 danger but good as you see here 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.700
 there's not much depth either and there's 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.130
 Sometimes you can hit yourself, like you see 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.900
 small cataracts very very handsome as ya 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.970
 say it are many raps that 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.890
 we have around here and this is where we 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.200
 will take but I want to find a biome 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.910
 but find a biome that good sent 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.770
 more I want to find the forest group that 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.080
 January was because of this there are many 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.150
 superchulo rivers look at them already pulp in 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.460
 so much swimming against the current you can not 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.780
 against the power of nature we are going to 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.780
 see where all this ends up chopped what 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.490
 things more authentically cool uncle and 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.710
 Well, I'm going to look for the super forest 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.540
 that you're going to hallucinate when we see the river 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.010
 I want to teach because I 've seen a picture 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.830
 it's just that they're on the doorstep 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.750
 official but 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.550
 so if I find it virgin what 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.500
 you're going to hallucinate with all this look 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.290
 guys what cool thing what else 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.990
 gorgeous good is totally random that 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.730
 something like that is generated but hey with this from 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.010
 river seems like they generate land 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.720
 much more realistic is not very cool 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.550
 I will treat this part because I believe 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.739
 in this part it is not amÃ©rico the boat was going 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.660
 to go by boat to the end because the 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.220
 final yes I know that there is supersport is 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.140
 it's not enough to stop just where 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.430
 I would like it because I have seen that there 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.620
 a photo that is very cool that the 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.680
 you will see surely also on the cover 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.959
 of the way it's a possibility 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.720
 between a thousand that you touch a river of that 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.640
 way but hey it would be cool if 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.910
 it will be ok but good that 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.500
 likewise see this this biome has been 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.840
 this river within this language that is 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.580
 very handsome as you are watching it passes by 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.190
 in front of a mountain as you see we have 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.680
 a lot of mini waterfalls and upon arrival 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.650
 well we have the super forest is very 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.200
 very handsome look what cool that is already 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.780
 great is super fun the ditto in 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.460
 boat because ' the boat did not break 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.259
 rated well 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.430
 let's go on it let's beat each other 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:37.470
 boat and notice what coolest thing is that 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.750
 He is very handsome and good as well as 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.220
 you see here they come together in several tributaries 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.810
 this from mountains 7 cut us 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.000
 explains two of those mountains and this 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.139
 way is that they are very cool but not 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.819
 I know if I know what it is and general 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.430
 minecraft usually this own 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:51.960
 way that would be missed because generating 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.729
 these rivers so cool and good 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.740
 we just got here it's pretty much 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.930
 handsome we are now look at the neder 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.460
 because he entered into it also happens is 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.440
 that kind of thing but with lava rivers 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.610
 I'm going to show you the good I'm still in 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.320
 the leader sought to power top like 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.840
 you see I have the f3 also pressed and everything 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.090
 and it shows bad news not 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.889
 they found not a single river of those who 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.930
 I'm talking, I found this 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.580
 there are many like this that instead of going 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.310
 the lava to a site expands to 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.860
 everywhere and do these things but the 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:23.190
 rivers god of itself or not this thing not thing 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.139
 well no but nothing like what 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.479
 we can see in the nobel word at least not 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.699
 as I have seen in the photo that should 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:31.620
 be not then well I said it over here 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:33.360
 If you find one, I would appreciate it 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.680
 that you send me a picture to twitter for 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.910
 that I saw it because I would love it 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.010
 see it if you can do 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.750
 better yet so yes I have 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.410
 liked to press like and favorites the 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.410
 next video 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.670
 see you later
