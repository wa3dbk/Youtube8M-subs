hey<00:00:01.079> buddy<00:00:01.560> my<00:00:01.740> name<00:00:01.860> is<00:00:01.949> Uma<00:00:02.070> today<00:00:02.610> we're

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
hey buddy my name is Uma today we're

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.309 
hey buddy my name is Uma today we're
showing<00:00:03.060> you<00:00:03.179> how<00:00:03.270> to<00:00:03.419> build<00:00:03.689> an<00:00:03.899> iron<00:00:04.170> ingot

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
showing you how to build an iron ingot

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.700 
showing you how to build an iron ingot
as<00:00:04.799> a<00:00:04.980> pic<00:00:05.279> slot<00:00:05.490> in<00:00:05.700> Minecraft<00:00:06.210> and<00:00:06.500> I'm<00:00:07.500> going

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
as a pic slot in Minecraft and I'm going

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.049 
as a pic slot in Minecraft and I'm going
from<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.099> assumption<00:00:08.519> that<00:00:08.550> you're<00:00:08.790> going<00:00:08.940> to

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
from the assumption that you're going to

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.879 
from the assumption that you're going to
build<00:00:09.210> it<00:00:09.360> in<00:00:09.450> survival<00:00:09.900> so<00:00:10.200> if<00:00:10.500> you're<00:00:10.769> not

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
build it in survival so if you're not

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.890 
build it in survival so if you're not
going<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.490> creating<00:00:11.820> creative<00:00:12.330> then<00:00:12.599> just

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
going to creating creative then just

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.930 
going to creating creative then just
pause<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.769> screen<00:00:14.009> now<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:14.190> look<00:00:14.700> at<00:00:14.790> this

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
pause the screen now and look at this

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.670 
pause the screen now and look at this
and<00:00:15.179> then<00:00:15.360> it<00:00:15.509> would<00:00:15.630> be<00:00:15.780> much<00:00:16.170> easier<00:00:16.230> to

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
and then it would be much easier to

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.099 
and then it would be much easier to
create<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.730> way<00:00:17.910> but<00:00:18.270> if<00:00:18.750> you're<00:00:18.900> going<00:00:18.990> to

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
create that way but if you're going to

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.050 
create that way but if you're going to
build<00:00:19.289> in<00:00:19.439> survival<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:20.039> easy<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.730> build<00:00:20.850> it

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
build in survival it easy to build it

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.029 
build in survival it easy to build it
lay<00:00:21.270> off<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.480> layer<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:22.260> that's<00:00:22.710> what<00:00:22.859> I'm<00:00:22.920> going

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
lay off a layer so that's what I'm going

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.490 
lay off a layer so that's what I'm going
to<00:00:23.160> do<00:00:23.310> it's<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.150> bit<00:00:24.330> intensive<00:00:24.990> up<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.320> iron

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
to do it's a bit intensive up to iron

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.830 
to do it's a bit intensive up to iron
block<00:00:25.890> so<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.460> might<00:00:26.670> consider<00:00:27.180> the
