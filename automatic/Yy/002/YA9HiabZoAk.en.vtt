from<00:03:03.239> last<00:03:03.450> season<00:03:03.900> I<00:03:04.049> think<00:03:04.440> United<00:03:04.739> will

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
from last season I think United will

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.069 
from last season I think United will
comfortably<00:03:05.160> go<00:03:05.400> up<00:03:05.459> there<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:05.959> put<00:03:06.959> in<00:03:07.019> a

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
comfortably go up there and put in a

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.539 
comfortably go up there and put in a
good<00:03:07.230> performance<00:03:07.290> it's<00:03:07.920> an<00:03:08.010> interesting<00:03:08.250> one

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
good performance it's an interesting one

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.670 
good performance it's an interesting one
though<00:03:08.700> we<00:03:09.090> haven't<00:03:09.360> we<00:03:09.959> lost<00:03:10.379> our<00:03:10.530> last

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.369 
though we haven't we lost our last
preseason<00:03:11.160> game<00:03:11.519> there<00:03:11.870> and<00:03:12.870> it's<00:03:13.049> not<00:03:13.200> been<00:03:13.349> a

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
preseason game there and it's not been a

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.479
