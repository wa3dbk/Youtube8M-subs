00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.500
 microsoft lays out its kinect sensor 

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:07.060
 every xbox man at sony does it at the 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.820
 playstation 4 a bit different 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.280
 the playstation camera which is optional 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.140
 You have to buy separately 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.580
 Now of course the question is worth it 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.209
 that or not I have it myself 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.150
 watched 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.830
 for 60 euros you get these cards 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.380
 Surprisingly, the playstation 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.940
 camera almost everywhere currently sold out 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.369
 So it has to be something 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:30.550
 so you get in this canton the 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.840
 camera which surprise is more 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.249
 actually not in there so there is 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.949
 no bracket or so you have to 

00:00:33.249 --> 00:00:37.629
 if you look at his tv 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.249
 you have to install the so 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.319
 a bracket optional to buy what 

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:43.749
 the camera is a bit too bad 

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:45.819
 itself is however quite small &amp; 

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:47.079
 coll blends in unobtrusively 

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:49.059
 Living one you can either 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.639
 over the television place under the 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.159
 TV is basically supposed to be 

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:56.260
 similar segment died on such a thing 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:57.940
 small dice is the dice is like that 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.519
 a kind of stabilizer so that you can 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.139
 thing to turn up and down 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.140
 a total of two cameras are installed 

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:07.509
 not full hd but only 1280 x 800 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.640
 pixel resolution that's natural 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:10.960
 worse than kinect and 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.969
 Accordingly, the quality is synonymous 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.869
 not so good and four microphones 

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:17.710
 are installed 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.359
 for speech recognition but what can 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.950
 the thing is now one 

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:22.270
 Usage for the playstation 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.340
 Camera is automatic 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.200
 Face recognition for this one must have a 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.479
 undergo a small procedure in which the 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.479
 first knows your own face 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.920
 then you have to head in one 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:36.609
 turn further step and turn 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.350
 nod 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:40.479
 As a result, the camera recognizes different 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.850
 head positions so you do not always 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.319
 frontal in the camera has to look 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.850
 everything is set to work 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.850
 Facial recognition perfectly 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.320
 When logging in, the camera checks that 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.200
 face and within a few 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.909
 seconds you are in the start screen 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.920
 important, however, in addition to the visage 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.420
 must also light up the controller 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.009
 be kept in the camera image 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.860
 otherwise the recognition works 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.840
 not also can the 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.489
 Playstation 4 with the help of the camera too 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.019
 control by voice input 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.700
 however, it is not worth it right away 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.680
 to chat on it because the option 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.420
 must first in the settings menu of the 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.790
 ps4 will be activated 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.799
 After that, the system responds to the word 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.750
 playstation and shows one each 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.140
 small window with possible options 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.269
 on 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.790
 combined commands also recognize the ps4 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.830
 So for example playstation screenshot 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.670
 create or playstation home 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.560
 screen 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.030
 most commands will work fine 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.069
 Recognized when clearly spoken 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.360
 however, it will come and go 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.370
 again before that one command 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.870
 the camera has to repeat 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.190
 but not necessary at all 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.959
 to enter voice commands 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.360
 to also submit to the ps4 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.099
 included headset one 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.900
 gesture control as with the xbox when 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.170
 there is not yet this should 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.040
 but be replenished in the future 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.450
 besides face recognition and 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.880
 Voice control can be done with the 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.650
 Playstation camera also plays 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.920
 Sessions movie when you talk about 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.540
 the service is twitter traveling the 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.730
 problem with the whole story is 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.470
 that the camera only to a position 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.760
 can really judge that means so 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.290
 if you move while playing 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.790
 upset or whatever that one 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.310
 then like to slip out of the picture 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.049
 that is a small disadvantage video chats 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.079
 in itself, there is not yet on 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.670
 the playstation 4 on the xbox one becomes 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.200
 the skype supports there but that 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.239
 meanwhile to microsoft 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.250
 I would not necessarily heard of it 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.069
 go out that skype in the future too 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.690
 on the playstation 4 can use and 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.389
 how it looks now with supported 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.430
 play out at least currently 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:45.680
 pretty new for now 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.569
 mainly the free play glory 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.549
 from the camera use that on everyone 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.410
 ps4 is already preinstalled 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.660
 this is a collection 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.340
 small augmented reality demus die 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.130
 at least hint at what 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.320
 in the future with the system 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.850
 Luckily in one of the demos I can 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.460
 here for example with a kind of robot 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.840
 ball called a as well as play the part 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.090
 appears on the screen and me 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:20.890
 it can be for example at its sensors and 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:22.990
 it wants to tickle it tickled magna 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.540
 as well as not and if it too 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.770
 many beats conceded it goes through and 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.770
 now a head 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.880
 No 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.470
 in another demo I can do any one 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.360
 lots of little robots with one 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.220
 wiping off the ps four controller 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.470
 fire which then merrily on the 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.390
 There are a lot of different things on the ground 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.830
 I can interact with them 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.930
 you for example with punches or 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.100
 push or kick me to them 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.100
 put on the floor 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.350
 and if I'm up to much 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.340
 Just push back in the button 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.340
 suck controller 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.419
 There is also a pretty funny one 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.919
 Air hockey game for up to two players 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:17.020
 and over the playstation store 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.940
 available demos like this uwe 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.280
 Flying, for example, stupidly 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.710
 But all these games make only five 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.150
 up to ten minutes of fun before getting it right 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.280
 get bored 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.500
 after that you want a real one 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.270
 play with camera use but leave 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.050
 yet to come 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.050
 what a shame 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:42.479
 you need now the playstation camera 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:45.810
 yes or no at the moment is the answer 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:47.129
 clearly no because for 60 euros there are 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.960
 simply not the added value 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:50.460
 around the thing now up to date 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.319
 to get home clear the thing is small 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.430
 it is inconspicuous takes up little space 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:55.409
 Facial recognition works 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:59.610
 voice control works the 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:06:01.800
 quality is okay but so deep 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.539
 integrated system like the xbox one 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.159
 is the playstation camera unfortunately 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:06.659
 currently not missing 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:08.039
 clarifying players is a very nice 

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:09.750
 but it will be after a few 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:11.849
 minutes really boring 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.710
 Maybe there will be really in the future 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:15.569
 video chats or games like eye of 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.669
 judgment on the playstation 3 where the 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:19.590
 Camera really also innovative for new 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:21.180
 game concepts is used there you have to 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.639
 However, wait to see if that in the future 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.229
 really brought to the playstation 4 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:27.630
 At the moment you can playstation 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:29.750
 camera calmly standing in the shelf 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.750
 to let
