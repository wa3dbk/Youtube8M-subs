00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
acrylic paint for a couple reasons

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.150 

acrylic<00:04:20.640> paints<00:04:20.910> quite<00:04:21.239> thick<00:04:21.750> and<00:04:21.989> it<00:04:22.980> acts

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
acrylic paints quite thick and it acts

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.860 
acrylic paints quite thick and it acts
as<00:04:23.550> a<00:04:23.610> kind<00:04:24.180> of<00:04:24.330> filler<00:04:24.690> in<00:04:25.560> the<00:04:26.160> MDF<00:04:26.850> itself<00:04:27.570> so

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
as a kind of filler in the MDF itself so

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.280 
as a kind of filler in the MDF itself so
one<00:04:28.110> when<00:04:28.500> I<00:04:28.590> come<00:04:28.830> to<00:04:29.270> lightly<00:04:30.270> sand<00:04:30.660> in<00:04:30.900> the

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
one when I come to lightly sand in the

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.440 
one when I come to lightly sand in the
primer<00:04:31.530> down<00:04:31.860> it<00:04:32.040> gives<00:04:32.130> it<00:04:32.340> a<00:04:32.370> nice<00:04:32.730> beautiful

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
primer down it gives it a nice beautiful

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.980 
primer down it gives it a nice beautiful
smooth<00:04:33.870> texture<00:04:34.820> so<00:04:35.820> yeah<00:04:36.000> this<00:04:36.180> one<00:04:36.780> of<00:04:36.900> the

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
smooth texture so yeah this one of the

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.650 
smooth texture so yeah this one of the
reasons<00:04:37.320> I<00:04:37.740> use<00:04:38.610> the<00:04:38.940> critic<00:04:39.270> and<00:04:39.420> the<00:04:39.540> other
