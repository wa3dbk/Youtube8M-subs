00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.539
 good 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.870
 hello everyone greets you home queen and 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.480
 family see you again I'm here with 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.090
 I hope everyone is very well 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.340
 and thank you very much for seeing us and good here 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.619
 I bring you another video of a purchase that 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.140
 I made it online but before 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.270
 show them what I buy 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.730
 tell you that before you start 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.280
 compose the truth I did not call the 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.800
 attention being painting my nails 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.590
 every time and much less be doing 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.500
 design one because the truth is that 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.720
 I always bought enamels that are good 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.600
 cheap on the dollar or in the family 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.820
 dollar you see that there are these enamels 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.000
 that are a dollar and good I bought from 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.909
 those and then the truth does not take long 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.250
 nails and good one that did not have much 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.739
 patience to be painting me the no 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.420
 it was so much patience but what 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.580
 I did not like that when I already 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.150
 he painted after a while they were with the 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.040
 edges unpainted by washing fret 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.170
 per share and chores and good then 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.510
 that's what I do not like to go to 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.060
 walk the unpolished and then 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.220
 I prefer to walk without paint 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.950
 now how I use the coupons I have obtained 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.680
 many enamels that have come out for free 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.869
 and some of them I paid but well 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.600
 little bit, sometimes I just paid the 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.060
 rates then I want to give it all use 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.039
 those glazes that I have obtained and the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.890
 true to see so many glazes has 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:40.590
 excited a lot and then now as 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.079
 that makes me want to paint my nails and 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.179
 to make designs thing that the truth is not 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.299
 I imagined doing it and well then 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.940
 this one has to use the things that we are 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.789
 accumulating then the truth has no case 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.310
 that we are accumulating and not using them 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.530
 but you have to use it for that reason 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.450
 we are buying it, so I 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.939
 I invite you to use your things your 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.310

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.799
 of the coupon eo to really use it 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.640
 so that it does not spoil 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:14.190
 but that they give him use and good then in 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.860
