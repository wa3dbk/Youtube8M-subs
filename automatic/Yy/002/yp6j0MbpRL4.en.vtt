okey-dokey<00:00:09.450> so<00:00:10.580> basically<00:00:11.580> putting<00:00:12.030> the

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
okey-dokey so basically putting the

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.120 
okey-dokey so basically putting the
finishing<00:00:12.570> touches<00:00:13.200> on<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.709> table<00:00:14.669> and<00:00:16.130> this

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
finishing touches on the table and this

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.390 
finishing touches on the table and this
part<00:00:17.669> here<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:17.939> was<00:00:18.210> actually<00:00:18.390> using<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.400> top

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
part here I was actually using the top

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.630 
part here I was actually using the top
of<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.759> table<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.390> get<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.920> legs<00:00:22.920> finished<00:00:23.430> up

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
of the table to get the legs finished up

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.679 
of the table to get the legs finished up
there<00:00:24.769> grew<00:00:25.769> us<00:00:26.070> welding<00:00:26.880> up<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.119> feet<00:00:27.330> -<00:00:27.539> the

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
there grew us welding up the feet - the

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.820 
there grew us welding up the feet - the
legs<00:00:28.410> themselves<00:00:28.679> and<00:00:30.529> basically<00:00:31.529> just

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
legs themselves and basically just

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.320 
legs themselves and basically just
tacking<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.400> up<00:00:32.580> and<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.480> tried<00:00:33.900> to<00:00:34.250> do<00:00:35.250> inch<00:00:36.150> at

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.330 
tacking it up and I tried to do inch at

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.509 
tacking it up and I tried to do inch at
a<00:00:36.420> time<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:37.019> then<00:00:37.170> turn<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.800> around<00:00:37.890> go<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.400> the

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:38.519 
a time and then turn it around go to the

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:40.520 
a time and then turn it around go to the
furthest<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.210> keep<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.809> try<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.170> keep<00:00:40.409> the

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
furthest and keep the try to keep the

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.000 
furthest and keep the try to keep the
heat<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.159> minimum<00:00:42.290> keep<00:00:43.290> any<00:00:43.500> warpage

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
heat it to a minimum keep any warpage

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.539 
heat it to a minimum keep any warpage
down<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.640> such<00:00:45.260> but<00:00:46.260> yeah<00:00:46.500> everything<00:00:46.979> went

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:47.549 
down and such but yeah everything went

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:50.410 
down and such but yeah everything went
together<00:00:47.790> pretty<00:00:48.510> pretty<00:00:49.260> well<00:00:49.559> everything's

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
together pretty pretty well everything's

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.509 
together pretty pretty well everything's
pretty<00:00:51.420> straight<00:00:51.900> or<00:00:52.589> you<00:00:52.949> know<00:00:53.070> least

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
pretty straight or you know least

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:54.920 
pretty straight or you know least
straight<00:00:53.790> enough<00:00:54.089> for<00:00:54.330> what<00:00:54.510> I'm<00:00:54.600> going<00:00:54.720> to<00:00:54.780> be

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
straight enough for what I'm going to be

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.910 
straight enough for what I'm going to be
doing<00:00:55.110> it's<00:00:55.589> not<00:00:55.970> 100%<00:00:57.049> perfect<00:00:58.049> but<00:00:58.530> I'm<00:00:58.739> not

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
doing it's not 100% perfect but I'm not

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.179 
doing it's not 100% perfect but I'm not
going<00:00:59.159> to<00:00:59.220> be<00:00:59.900> machining<00:01:00.900> any<00:01:01.049> parts<00:01:01.530> or<00:01:01.739> you

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:02.189 
going to be machining any parts or you

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:05.329 
going to be machining any parts or you
know<00:01:03.350> doing<00:01:04.350> anything<00:01:04.530> like<00:01:04.979> that

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
know doing anything like that

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.950 
know doing anything like that
but<00:01:05.939> um<00:01:06.409> anyway<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.799> it's<00:01:08.729> very<00:01:09.540> it's

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
but um anyway that it's very it's

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.660 
but um anyway that it's very it's
heavier<00:01:10.560> than<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.799> thought<00:01:10.829> it<00:01:11.189> would<00:01:11.280> be<00:01:11.460> which

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
heavier than I thought it would be which

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.520 
heavier than I thought it would be which
nothing<00:01:12.359> really<00:01:12.479> wrong<00:01:12.899> with<00:01:13.109> that<00:01:13.320> per<00:01:13.500> se

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
nothing really wrong with that per se

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.190 
nothing really wrong with that per se
it's<00:01:13.920> just<00:01:14.130> hard<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.399> move<00:01:15.270> around<00:01:15.329> the<00:01:15.960> last

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
it's just hard to move around the last

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.410 
it's just hard to move around the last
bit<00:01:16.619> where<00:01:16.859> I<00:01:16.920> was<00:01:17.130> welding<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.909> legs<00:01:18.149> on<00:01:18.390> it

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
bit where I was welding the legs on it

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.239 
bit where I was welding the legs on it
was<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.659> little<00:01:18.840> tough<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:21.020> basically

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:22.249 
was a little tough to basically

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:25.219 
was a little tough to basically
negotiated<00:01:23.249> into<00:01:23.399> place<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:24.030> get<00:01:24.179> a<00:01:24.229> good

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
negotiated into place to get a good

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.169 
negotiated into place to get a good
angle<00:01:25.469> at<00:01:25.799> welding<00:01:26.249> everything<00:01:26.789> and<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.469> didn't

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:29.179 
angle at welding everything and I didn't

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:32.300 
angle at welding everything and I didn't
get<00:01:30.179> every<00:01:30.630> little<00:01:30.810> detail<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.530> tried<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.009> you

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
get every little detail I tried to you

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.999 
get every little detail I tried to you
know<00:01:32.429> edit<00:01:32.670> out<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.969> lot<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.479> didn't<00:01:34.009> really

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
know edit out a lot and didn't really

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.550 
know edit out a lot and didn't really
videotape<00:01:35.759> every<00:01:36.119> single<00:01:36.689> last<00:01:36.869> little<00:01:37.229> bit

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
videotape every single last little bit

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.890 
videotape every single last little bit
but<00:01:38.119> I've<00:01:39.119> got<00:01:39.329> quite<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.749> bit<00:01:40.020> here

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
but I've got quite a bit here

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.090 
but I've got quite a bit here
yeah<00:01:42.900> that's<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.650> that's<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.190> welds<00:01:44.700> they're

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
yeah that's the that's the welds they're

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.220 
yeah that's the that's the welds they're
perfect<00:01:47.100> but<00:01:47.340> decent<00:01:47.720> it's<00:01:48.720> one<00:01:48.870> thing<00:01:49.050> with

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.230 
perfect but decent it's one thing with

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.780 
perfect but decent it's one thing with
you<00:01:49.500> know<00:01:49.620> the<00:01:49.770> main<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.520> know<00:01:50.610> another

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
you know the main you know another

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.480 
you know the main you know another
reason<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.240> did<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.630> was<00:01:51.690> to<00:01:52.020> practice<00:01:52.490> TIG

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
reason I did this was to practice TIG

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.600 
reason I did this was to practice TIG
welding<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.600> know<00:01:54.720> I've<00:01:54.840> actually<00:01:55.610> been

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
welding you know I've actually been

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.720 
welding you know I've actually been
doing<00:01:56.910> it<00:01:57.210> off<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.570> on<00:01:57.660> for<00:01:58.080> I<00:01:58.260> don't<00:01:58.560> know<00:01:59.340> ten

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
doing it off and on for I don't know ten

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.390 
doing it off and on for I don't know ten
years<00:02:00.540> twelve<00:02:00.900> years<00:02:01.020> at<00:02:01.440> least<00:02:01.470> but<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.310> know

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
years twelve years at least but you know

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.340 
years twelve years at least but you know
pretty<00:02:02.610> inconsistent<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.990> know<00:02:04.080> it's<00:02:04.230> just

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
pretty inconsistent you know it's just

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.530 
pretty inconsistent you know it's just
more<00:02:04.650> of<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.800> hobby<00:02:05.040> type<00:02:05.460> thing<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:05.970> I've

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
more of a hobby type thing and I've

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.810 
more of a hobby type thing and I've
noticed<00:02:06.720> when<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.050> do<00:02:07.230> it<00:02:07.410> several<00:02:08.250> days<00:02:08.490> in<00:02:08.729> a

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
noticed when you do it several days in a

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.510 
noticed when you do it several days in a
row<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:10.050> definitely<00:02:10.619> skill<00:02:11.220> really

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
row you you definitely skill really

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.710 
row you you definitely skill really
improved<00:02:12.330> in<00:02:12.600> just<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.870> few<00:02:13.050> days<00:02:13.260> so<00:02:14.720> sometimes

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
improved in just a few days so sometimes

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.780 
improved in just a few days so sometimes
I<00:02:15.840> wonder<00:02:16.080> what<00:02:16.200> it'd<00:02:16.320> be<00:02:16.380> like<00:02:16.500> if<00:02:16.710> that<00:02:17.190> this

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
I wonder what it'd be like if that this

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.250 
I wonder what it'd be like if that this
is<00:02:17.940> what<00:02:18.090> I<00:02:18.120> actually<00:02:18.330> did<00:02:18.720> for<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.050> living

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
is what I actually did for a living

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.970 
is what I actually did for a living
fabricate<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.130> weld<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.490> such<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.980> anyways

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
fabricate and weld and such and anyways

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.820 
fabricate and weld and such and anyways
the<00:02:23.400> welds<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:24.450> went<00:02:24.959> along<00:02:25.050> progressively
