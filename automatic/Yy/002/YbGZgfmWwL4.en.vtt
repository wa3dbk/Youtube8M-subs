00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.750 
white but because they're slow drying
and<00:02:15.280> I<00:02:15.430> my<00:02:16.239> experiences<00:02:16.870> i<00:02:17.080> think<00:02:17.440> these

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
and I my experiences i think these

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.490 
and I my experiences i think these
water-soluble<00:02:18.760> oils<00:02:19.390> are<00:02:19.540> particularly<00:02:20.170> slow

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
water-soluble oils are particularly slow

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.440 
water-soluble oils are particularly slow
drying<00:02:20.769> now<00:02:21.130> maybe<00:02:21.519> i'm<00:02:21.730> wrong<00:02:21.760> there<00:02:22.209> but

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
drying now maybe i'm wrong there but

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.350 
drying now maybe i'm wrong there but
that's<00:02:22.600> that's<00:02:23.290> my<00:02:23.590> impression<00:02:24.190> so<00:02:24.430> i<00:02:24.670> also

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
that's that's my impression so i also

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.740 
that's that's my impression so i also
use<00:02:25.810> i<00:02:26.200> take<00:02:26.680> along<00:02:26.890> a<00:02:26.920> bottle<00:02:27.519> of<00:02:27.670> this<00:02:27.910> fast

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
because this fast drying medium has also

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.949 
because this fast drying medium has also
been<00:02:56.530> modified<00:02:57.070> so<00:02:57.370> that<00:02:57.400> it<00:02:58.390> likes<00:02:58.810> water

it's<00:02:59.680> hydrophilic<00:03:00.430> not<00:03:00.850> hydrophobic<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:01.900> so

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
it's hydrophilic not hydrophobic and so

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.560 
it's hydrophilic not hydrophobic and so
the<00:03:02.380> whole<00:03:02.500> thing<00:03:02.680> cleans<00:03:02.950> up<00:03:03.130> with<00:03:03.310> water<00:03:03.570> now

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
the whole thing cleans up with water now

you can cut these paints you can thin

you can cut these paints you can thin
them<00:03:08.250> like<00:03:09.250> if<00:03:09.459> you<00:03:09.579> wanted<00:03:09.880> to<00:03:10.000> put<00:03:10.209> on<00:03:10.329> a

very<00:03:18.609> cautiously<00:03:19.329> and<00:03:19.870> don't<00:03:20.470> then<00:03:20.709> it<00:03:20.859> very

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
very cautiously and don't then it very

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.380 
very cautiously and don't then it very
much<00:03:21.400> personally<00:03:22.269> I'd<00:03:22.390> everything<00:03:22.720> a<00:03:22.930> more

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
much personally I'd everything a more

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.530 
much personally I'd everything a more
about<00:03:23.510> ten<00:03:23.810> percent<00:03:24.400> if<00:03:25.400> you<00:03:25.550> thin<00:03:25.790> it<00:03:25.910> too

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
about ten percent if you thin it too

about ten percent if you thin it too
much<00:03:26.750> just<00:03:27.080> this<00:03:27.709> is<00:03:27.920> with<00:03:28.550> even<00:03:29.150> regular<00:03:29.540> oils

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
much just this is with even regular oils

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.559 
much just this is with even regular oils
if<00:03:30.680> you<00:03:30.890> thin<00:03:31.160> regular<00:03:31.610> oil<00:03:31.640> too<00:03:32.030> much<00:03:32.300> with

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
if you thin regular oil too much with

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.990 
if you thin regular oil too much with

properly<00:03:38.050> so<00:03:39.050> anyway<00:03:39.470> you<00:03:39.950> do<00:03:40.160> have<00:03:40.370> an

properly so anyway you do have an

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.760 
properly so anyway you do have an
accelerator<00:03:41.600> you<00:03:41.810> do<00:03:41.959> have<00:03:42.140> a<00:03:42.170> fast<00:03:42.500> drying

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
accelerator you do have a fast drying

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.920 
accelerator you do have a fast drying
medium<00:03:43.310> and<00:03:43.790> with<00:03:44.030> that<00:03:44.060> I<00:03:44.510> never<00:03:44.690> have<00:03:44.900> any

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
trouble my sketches on the boards are

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.560 
trouble my sketches on the boards are
dry<00:03:48.380> to<00:03:48.440> the<00:03:48.620> touch<00:03:48.770> within<00:03:49.340> a<00:03:49.400> day<00:03:49.670> and<00:03:50.000> they
