hamburger I've clean hands drop it in
your<00:00:50.670> tube<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.600> then<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.780> get<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.020> little

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
your tube and then you get this little

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.400 
your tube and then you get this little
plunger<00:00:52.710> thing<00:00:53.000> and<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.090> just<00:00:54.230> push<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.260> down

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
plunger thing and you just push it down

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.959 
plunger thing and you just push it down
there<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.100> then<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.280> grab<00:00:56.550> some<00:00:56.789> more<00:00:58.910> and<00:00:59.910> I

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
there and then you grab some more and I

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.430 
there and then you grab some more and I
guess<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.270> could<00:01:00.449> have<00:01:00.539> set<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:00.840> video<00:01:01.170> up<00:01:01.289> so

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
guess I could have set this video up so

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.650 
guess I could have set this video up so
it<00:01:01.559> would<00:01:01.649> be<00:01:01.770> shorter<00:01:02.190> if<00:01:02.520> I'd<00:01:02.699> have<00:01:03.300> filled

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
it would be shorter if I'd have filled

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:27.690 
it would be shorter if I'd have filled
this

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.190 

and<00:01:28.700> it<00:01:28.850> is<00:01:29.090> been<00:01:29.359> really<00:01:29.479> is<00:01:29.750> just<00:01:29.780> like<00:01:29.990> a

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
and it is been really is just like a

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.260 
and it is been really is just like a
heavy-duty<00:01:30.469> greased<00:01:30.890> panel<00:01:31.280> this<00:01:31.789> just<00:01:32.060> goes

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
heavy-duty greased panel this just goes

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:43.690 
heavy-duty greased panel this just goes
on<00:01:32.420> here<00:01:32.689> like<00:01:32.869> that<00:01:42.100> I've<00:01:43.100> done<00:01:43.340> two<00:01:43.549> whole

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.319

over there and just look at it real
quick<00:02:07.340> so<00:02:08.229> it<00:02:09.229> looks<00:02:09.440> like<00:02:10.220> a<00:02:10.250> next<00:02:10.549> caliber

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
quick so it looks like a next caliber

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.630 
quick so it looks like a next caliber
dehydrator<00:02:12.230> but<00:02:12.470> it's<00:02:12.769> the<00:02:12.950> Cabela's<00:02:13.250> man

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.970 
just like a grease gun and get it there
we<00:02:31.910> go<00:02:32.920> and<00:02:33.920> you<00:02:34.040> just<00:02:34.220> pull<00:02:34.519> it<00:02:35.500> until<00:02:36.500> you<00:02:36.829> get

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
we go and you just pull it until you get

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.009 
we go and you just pull it until you get
some<00:02:37.250> on<00:02:37.370> there<00:02:37.579> it<00:02:37.670> gets<00:02:37.790> a<00:02:38.000> little<00:02:38.150> pulley<00:02:38.750> on

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
some on there it gets a little pulley on

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:45.580 
some on there it gets a little pulley on
the<00:02:39.139> screen

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.120 

that<00:02:46.590> break<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.400> off<00:02:47.690> coming<00:02:48.690> up<00:02:48.930> here<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.740> I

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
that break it off coming up here and I

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.559 
that break it off coming up here and I
tell<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.490> this<00:02:50.610> is<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.819> lot<00:02:51.060> quicker<00:02:51.420> than

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
tell you this is a lot quicker than

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.980 
tell you this is a lot quicker than
slicing<00:02:52.440> jerky<00:02:52.950> I've<00:02:53.940> had<00:02:54.240> jerky<00:02:54.660> like<00:02:54.780> this

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
slicing jerky I've had jerky like this

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.860 
slicing jerky I've had jerky like this
before<00:02:55.200> I've<00:02:55.530> never<00:02:55.560> made<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.130> before<00:02:58.040> but<00:02:59.870> it

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
before I've never made it before but it

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.480 
before I've never made it before but it
is<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:01.050> lot<00:03:01.260> faster<00:03:01.740> than<00:03:01.860> slicing<00:03:02.160> and

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
is a lot faster than slicing and

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.550 
is a lot faster than slicing and
marinating<00:03:02.970> jerky<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.570> I<00:03:03.870> think<00:03:04.080> it<00:03:04.230> tastes

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
marinating jerky and I think it tastes

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.020 
marinating jerky and I think it tastes
pretty<00:03:04.740> good<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.340> important<00:03:05.730> thing<00:03:05.880> is

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
pretty good and the important thing is

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.240 
pretty good and the important thing is
it<00:03:06.180> preserves<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:06.690> meat<00:03:06.959> so<00:03:07.620> that<00:03:07.800> we<00:03:07.890> can<00:03:08.070> use

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
it preserves the meat so that we can use

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.830 
it preserves the meat so that we can use
it<00:03:08.400> on<00:03:08.520> our<00:03:08.550> community<00:03:09.150> where<00:03:09.300> we<00:03:09.330> don't<00:03:09.570> have

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
it on our community where we don't have

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.309 
it on our community where we don't have
refrigeration<00:03:10.500> right<00:03:10.890> now

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
refrigeration right now

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.270 
refrigeration right now
refrigeration<00:03:13.319> other<00:03:13.590> than<00:03:13.709> that<00:03:13.890> with<00:03:14.100> the

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
refrigeration other than that with the

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.100 
refrigeration other than that with the
most<00:03:14.670> high<00:03:14.970> provides<00:03:15.420> in<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:15.660> form<00:03:15.930> of<00:03:16.020> the

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
most high provides in the form of the

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.560 
most high provides in the form of the
weather<00:03:16.320> and<00:03:18.020> so<00:03:19.020> we<00:03:19.709> have<00:03:19.830> coolers<00:03:20.280> that<00:03:20.570> we

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
weather and so we have coolers that we

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.360 
weather and so we have coolers that we
use<00:03:21.810> but<00:03:22.170> this<00:03:22.709> we're<00:03:22.950> just<00:03:23.130> going<00:03:23.310> to

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
use but this we're just going to

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.810 
use but this we're just going to
dehydrate<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.540> put<00:03:25.260> into<00:03:25.620> ziplock<00:03:26.340> bags<00:03:26.610> or

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
dehydrate and put into ziplock bags or

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.930 
dehydrate and put into ziplock bags or
canning<00:03:27.180> jars<00:03:27.420> or<00:03:27.600> something<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:28.170> just<00:03:28.940> to

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
canning jars or something and just to

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.729 
canning jars or something and just to
keep<00:03:30.090> it<00:03:30.239> away<00:03:30.330> from<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.570> mice<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:31.440> store

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
keep it away from the mice and store

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.210 
keep it away from the mice and store
cupboards<00:03:32.750> but<00:03:33.750> anyway<00:03:34.170> this<00:03:34.739> is<00:03:34.800> what<00:03:34.950> I'm

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
cupboards but anyway this is what I'm

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.410 
cupboards but anyway this is what I'm
doing<00:03:35.430> that's<00:03:36.390> about<00:03:36.810> how<00:03:37.050> it<00:03:37.200> works<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:38.420> I

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
doing that's about how it works and I

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.750 
doing that's about how it works and I
might<00:03:40.200> shoot<00:03:40.380> another<00:03:40.650> quick<00:03:40.950> video<00:03:41.310> and<00:03:41.370> tell

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
might shoot another quick video and tell

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.860 
might shoot another quick video and tell
you<00:03:41.850> how<00:03:41.970> it<00:03:42.120> tastes<00:03:42.510> later<00:03:42.720> or<00:03:43.500> better<00:03:43.739> yet

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
you how it tastes later or better yet

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.199 
you how it tastes later or better yet
I'll<00:03:45.870> let<00:03:46.110> my<00:03:46.650> brother<00:03:46.920> Zach<00:03:47.310> tell<00:03:47.820> you<00:03:47.940> how<00:03:48.090> it

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
I'll let my brother Zach tell you how it

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.970 
I'll let my brother Zach tell you how it
tastes<00:03:48.480> because<00:03:48.720> he's<00:03:48.870> very<00:03:49.110> exuberant<00:03:49.380> about

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
tastes because he's very exuberant about

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.989 
tastes because he's very exuberant about
food<00:03:50.280> all<00:03:50.850> right<00:03:50.910> I'll<00:03:51.600> see<00:03:51.780> you<00:03:51.870> out<00:03:51.959> there
