knocking Bojack away this fights got a

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.640 
knocking Bojack away this fights got a
little<00:03:06.900> different<00:03:07.170> than<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:07.320> thought<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.530> would

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
little different than I thought I would

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.350 
little different than I thought I would
I<00:03:07.830> would<00:03:08.010> assume<00:03:08.220> with<00:03:08.430> how<00:03:08.520> slow<00:03:08.730> Burley<00:03:09.210> is

rojack<00:03:09.870> actually<00:03:10.260> would<00:03:10.380> had<00:03:10.500> an<00:03:10.620> upper<00:03:10.860> hand

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
rojack actually would had an upper hand

rojack actually would had an upper hand
here<00:03:11.100> but<00:03:11.340> I<00:03:11.370> guess<00:03:11.520> bojack's<00:03:11.970> not<00:03:12.120> the

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
here but I guess bojack's not the

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.580 
here but I guess bojack's not the
fastest<00:03:12.570> man<00:03:12.690> in<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.870> world<00:03:12.930> himself<00:03:13.140> rolling
