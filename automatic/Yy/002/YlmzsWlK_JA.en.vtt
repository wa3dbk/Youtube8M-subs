I<00:01:07.759> have<00:01:08.759> us<00:01:09.139> wrote<00:01:10.139> a<00:01:10.499> small<00:01:11.009> program<00:01:11.369> in<00:01:11.729> a

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
I have us wrote a small program in a

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.819 
I have us wrote a small program in a
turbo<00:01:12.689> C<00:01:12.899> it's<00:01:13.829> a<00:01:14.039> very<00:01:14.340> simple<00:01:14.639> just<00:01:15.829> using

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:16.829 
turbo C it's a very simple just using

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:20.510 
turbo C it's a very simple just using
the<00:01:16.979> parallel<00:01:17.399> port<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:18.439> to<00:01:19.439> supply<00:01:19.889> current

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the parallel port to to supply current

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:36.610 
the parallel port to to supply current
to<00:01:20.849> each<00:01:21.299> coil<00:01:21.810> individually

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.510 

many<00:01:36.890> steps<00:01:37.340> it<00:01:37.790> should<00:01:38.390> make<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:39.380> what<00:01:40.340> is

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
many steps it should make and what is

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.990 
many steps it should make and what is
the<00:01:40.730> delay<00:01:41.060> between<00:01:41.750> each<00:01:42.140> step<00:01:42.560> and<00:01:43.000> also

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
the delay between each step and also

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.620 
the delay between each step and also
which<00:01:44.330> direction<00:01:44.840> it<00:01:45.260> should<00:01:45.320> rotate

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
which direction it should rotate

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.710 
which direction it should rotate
clockwise<00:01:47.630> or<00:01:48.200> anti-clockwise<00:01:49.000> like<00:01:50.000> like

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
clockwise or anti-clockwise like like

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.950 
clockwise or anti-clockwise like like
now<00:01:50.930> it's<00:01:51.170> it<00:01:51.590> will<00:01:51.800> rotate<00:01:52.040> anti-clockwise

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
now it's it will rotate anti-clockwise

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.230 
now it's it will rotate anti-clockwise
it<00:01:53.960> will<00:01:54.200> wait<00:01:54.470> it<00:01:54.770> will<00:01:54.980> make<00:01:55.250> one<00:01:55.670> rotation

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
it will wait it will make one rotation

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.710 
it will wait it will make one rotation
one<00:01:56.540> complete<00:01:56.960> rotation<00:01:57.520> so<00:01:58.520> it<00:01:59.000> took<00:01:59.540> about

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
one complete rotation so it took about

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.400 
one complete rotation so it took about
10<00:02:00.260> seconds<00:02:00.740> to<00:02:00.890> do<00:02:01.040> this<00:02:01.250> because<00:02:01.520> with<00:02:02.410> 200

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
10 seconds to do this because with 200

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.180 
10 seconds to do this because with 200
steps<00:02:03.740> in<00:02:04.270> with<00:02:05.270> 50<00:02:05.750> milliseconds<00:02:06.530> for<00:02:06.920> each

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
steps in with 50 milliseconds for each

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:22.119 
steps in with 50 milliseconds for each
step

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.289 

I<00:02:22.159> will<00:02:22.579> hold<00:02:22.909> change<00:02:23.299> the<00:02:24.459> direction<00:02:25.459> of<00:02:25.999> the

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
I will hold change the direction of the

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.250 
I will hold change the direction of the
rotation<00:02:26.590> now<00:02:27.590> it's<00:02:27.769> a<00:02:27.920> clockwise<00:02:28.459> and<00:02:29.260> of

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
rotation now it's a clockwise and of

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.860 
rotation now it's a clockwise and of
course<00:02:31.010> it's<00:02:31.189> the<00:02:31.310> same<00:02:31.519> 50<00:02:32.030> milliseconds<00:02:32.480> so

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
course it's the same 50 milliseconds so

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.039 
course it's the same 50 milliseconds so
it<00:02:33.439> will<00:02:33.680> take<00:02:33.920> ten<00:02:34.849> seconds<00:02:35.329> again<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:37.459> I<00:02:38.329> can

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
it will take ten seconds again and I can

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.379 
it will take ten seconds again and I can
reduce<00:02:39.439> this<00:02:39.739> this<00:02:40.310> time<00:02:40.609> to<00:02:40.849> five

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:41.389 
reduce this this time to five

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:44.020 
reduce this this time to five
milliseconds<00:02:42.170> you<00:02:42.920> see<00:02:43.129> now<00:02:43.280> it<00:02:43.430> takes<00:02:43.700> only

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
milliseconds you see now it takes only

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.970 
milliseconds you see now it takes only
about<00:02:44.150> one<00:02:44.540> second<00:02:45.019> to<00:02:45.200> make<00:02:45.349> a<00:02:45.409> complete

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
about one second to make a complete

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:53.229 
about one second to make a complete
rotation<00:02:46.189> and<00:02:48.040> I<00:02:50.560> can<00:02:51.560> say<00:02:51.799> to<00:02:51.859> to<00:02:52.730> make<00:02:52.879> only

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
rotation and I can say to to make only

00:02:53.239 --> 00:03:10.059 
rotation and I can say to to make only
half<00:02:53.749> of<00:02:54.019> the<00:02:54.349> rotation<00:02:54.859> so<00:02:55.099> 100<00:02:55.669> steps<00:03:08.500> now<00:03:09.500> it

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
half of the rotation so 100 steps now it

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.970 
half of the rotation so 100 steps now it
will<00:03:10.280> make<00:03:10.519> two<00:03:11.299> complete<00:03:11.780> rotation<00:03:12.409> so<00:03:12.680> four

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
will make two complete rotation so four

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.379 
will make two complete rotation so four
hundred<00:03:13.340> steps<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.980> fastest<00:03:16.489> it<00:03:16.760> can<00:03:17.120> go

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
hundred steps the fastest it can go

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.599 
hundred steps the fastest it can go
without<00:03:17.750> losing<00:03:18.379> any<00:03:18.560> steps<00:03:18.980> it's<00:03:19.219> about

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
without losing any steps it's about

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.899 
without losing any steps it's about
three<00:03:19.969> milliseconds<00:03:20.829> as<00:03:21.829> you<00:03:22.040> can<00:03:22.219> see<00:03:22.489> it

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:22.909 
three milliseconds as you can see it

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:25.759 
three milliseconds as you can see it
works<00:03:23.150> fine

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.449 

and<00:03:26.769> I<00:03:27.420> can<00:03:28.420> try<00:03:28.840> with<00:03:29.079> two<00:03:29.379> milliseconds<00:03:30.159> but

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
and I can try with two milliseconds but

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:46.450 
and I can try with two milliseconds but
it<00:03:31.180> will<00:03:31.389> lose<00:03:31.629> some<00:03:31.930> steps

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.940 

you

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.270 

I<00:03:51.980> found<00:03:52.460> the<00:03:52.580> board<00:03:52.850> that<00:03:53.060> I<00:03:53.210> was<00:03:53.420> you

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.270 
I found the board that I was you
made<00:03:54.490> a<00:03:54.520> close-up<00:03:55.240> video<00:03:55.450> of<00:03:55.810> this<00:03:56.020> board<00:03:56.350> it's

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
made a close-up video of this board it's

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.110 
made a close-up video of this board it's
just<00:03:57.720> like<00:03:58.720> I<00:03:58.870> said<00:03:59.080> fourth<00:03:59.470> opto-isolator<00:04:00.340> to

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
just like I said fourth opto-isolator to

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.860 
just like I said fourth opto-isolator to
protect<00:04:01.569> the<00:04:02.250> computer<00:04:03.250> because<00:04:03.870> computer

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
protect the computer because computer

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.650 
protect the computer because computer
parallel<00:04:05.319> port<00:04:05.650> is<00:04:05.830> probably<00:04:06.520> not<00:04:06.730> not

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
parallel port is probably not not

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.510 
parallel port is probably not not
isolated<00:04:08.350> I'm<00:04:08.530> not<00:04:08.740> sure<00:04:09.010> and<00:04:09.600> I<00:04:10.600> used<00:04:11.170> for<00:04:11.590> for

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
isolated I'm not sure and I used for for

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.800 
isolated I'm not sure and I used for for
transistor<00:04:13.209> to<00:04:13.480> drive<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:14.080> the<00:04:15.389> coils<00:04:16.389> for

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
transistor to drive the the coils for

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.060 
transistor to drive the the coils for
the<00:04:16.930> motor<00:04:17.139> and<00:04:17.970> also<00:04:18.970> I<00:04:19.480> used<00:04:19.870> for<00:04:20.320> diets<00:04:20.769> to

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
the motor and also I used for diets to

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.640 
the motor and also I used for diets to
protect<00:04:21.519> from<00:04:21.940> reverse<00:04:22.570> currents<00:04:23.290> and<00:04:25.380> yeah<00:04:26.380> I

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
protect from reverse currents and yeah I

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.890 
protect from reverse currents and yeah I
don't<00:04:27.070> think<00:04:27.250> I<00:04:27.370> can<00:04:27.430> say<00:04:27.880> much<00:04:28.360> more<00:04:28.390> about

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
don't think I can say much more about

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.440 
don't think I can say much more about
this<00:04:29.110> you'll<00:04:30.040> probably<00:04:30.340> want<00:04:30.730> to<00:04:30.790> use<00:04:30.910> a<00:04:31.120> real

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
this you'll probably want to use a real

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.370 
this you'll probably want to use a real
driver<00:04:31.870> if<00:04:32.169> you<00:04:32.320> want<00:04:32.500> to<00:04:33.390> to<00:04:34.390> use<00:04:34.570> a<00:04:34.600> stepper

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
driver if you want to to use a stepper

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.150 
driver if you want to to use a stepper
motor<00:04:35.770> and<00:04:36.040> not<00:04:36.520> something<00:04:36.940> like<00:04:37.090> this<00:04:37.560> but<00:04:38.560> I

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
motor and not something like this but I

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.850 
motor and not something like this but I
just<00:04:39.970> wanted<00:04:40.330> to<00:04:41.250> to<00:04:42.250> see<00:04:42.490> how<00:04:42.790> the<00:04:43.860> stepper

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
just wanted to to see how the stepper

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.570 
just wanted to to see how the stepper
motor<00:04:45.040> it's<00:04:45.700> working<00:04:46.270> and<00:04:46.540> I<00:04:46.950> just<00:04:47.950> dip<00:04:48.400> this

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
motor it's working and I just dip this

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.940 
motor it's working and I just dip this
board<00:04:48.940> so<00:04:51.210> it<00:04:52.210> will<00:04:52.450> probably<00:04:52.810> not<00:04:53.200> be<00:04:53.260> useful

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
board so it will probably not be useful

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.360 
board so it will probably not be useful
for<00:04:54.160> you

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.360 

if<00:04:57.600> you<00:04:58.600> have<00:04:58.780> any<00:04:58.990> questions<00:04:59.560> please<00:04:59.860> leave<00:05:00.310> a

if you have any questions please leave a

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.680 
if you have any questions please leave a
comment<00:05:00.730> and<00:05:01.120> I<00:05:01.510> will<00:05:01.600> try<00:05:02.080> to<00:05:02.110> answer
