00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
the specs of the cam first this is one

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.600 
the specs of the cam first this is one
of<00:01:16.680> comp<00:01:17.130> cams<00:01:17.400> racing<00:01:18.090> cams<00:01:19.460> let's<00:01:20.460> see<00:01:20.670> here

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
of comp cams racing cams let's see here

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.880 
of comp cams racing cams let's see here
so<00:01:25.460> intake<00:01:26.460> it's<00:01:26.729> 2<00:01:26.880> 32<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.600> exhaust<00:01:27.930> its<00:01:28.200> 234

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
so intake it's 2 32 and exhaust its 234

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.590 
so intake it's 2 32 and exhaust its 234
I<00:01:29.100> think<00:01:29.460> stock<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:29.939> like<00:01:31.790> 210<00:01:32.790> something<00:01:33.390> I

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
I think stock is like 210 something I

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.490 
I think stock is like 210 something I
don't<00:01:34.079> know<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.439> then<00:01:34.890> at<00:01:35.340> 112<00:01:35.970> LSA<00:01:36.479> with<00:01:36.780> 595

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
don't know and then at 112 LSA with 595

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.130 
don't know and then at 112 LSA with 595
lift<00:01:37.799> on<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.009> intake<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.430> 598<00:01:39.360> on<00:01:39.540> the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
lift on the intake and 598 on the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.620 
lift on the intake and 598 on the
exhaust<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:41.100> this<00:01:41.340> thing<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.880> going<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.479> make

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
exhaust so this thing is going to make

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.359 
exhaust so this thing is going to make
big<00:01:42.990> big<00:01:43.439> big<00:01:43.799> power<00:01:44.130> up<00:01:44.399> top<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:46.100> it's<00:01:47.100> got<00:01:47.340> a
