characters so important if you think
about<00:00:32.279> how<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.669> create<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.149> character<00:00:33.480> there

about how to create a character there
are<00:00:34.260> three<00:00:34.469> main<00:00:34.680> ways<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.129> can<00:00:35.340> do<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.670> first

00:00:36.349 --> 00:00:36.359 
are three main ways you can do it first

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:38.630 
are three main ways you can do it first
of<00:00:36.539> all<00:00:36.659> you<00:00:36.719> can<00:00:37.050> borrow<00:00:37.260> from<00:00:37.499> life<00:00:37.769> you<00:00:38.460> can

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
of all you can borrow from life you can

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.849 
of all you can borrow from life you can
think<00:00:38.789> about<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.269> people<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.929> know<00:00:40.170> you

00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:40.859 
think about the people that you know you

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:42.529 
think about the people that you know you
don't<00:00:40.980> want<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.339> write<00:00:41.519> about<00:00:41.729> that<00:00:42.059> person

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:42.539 
don't want to write about that person

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:44.360 
don't want to write about that person
exactly<00:00:43.229> as<00:00:43.350> they<00:00:43.559> are<00:00:43.589> because<00:00:43.949> then<00:00:44.219> it's

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
exactly as they are because then it's

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.279 
exactly as they are because then it's
not<00:00:44.550> really<00:00:44.789> creating<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.390> character<00:00:45.600> if

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
not really creating a character if

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.869 
not really creating a character if
you're<00:00:46.499> writing<00:00:46.739> about<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.190> real<00:00:47.519> person

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
you're writing about a real person

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.090 
you're writing about a real person
you'll<00:00:48.510> need<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.870> think<00:00:49.079> about<00:00:49.260> ways<00:00:49.769> that<00:00:49.829> you

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
you'll need to think about ways that you

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.829 
you'll need to think about ways that you
can<00:00:50.399> portray<00:00:50.789> them<00:00:51.089> that<00:00:51.269> will<00:00:51.420> communicate

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:51.839 
can portray them that will communicate

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:54.649 
can portray them that will communicate
them<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.319> others<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:52.979> that<00:00:53.399> other<00:00:53.760> people<00:00:53.850> will

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:54.659 
them to others so that other people will

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:57.110 
them to others so that other people will
see<00:00:54.929> them<00:00:55.109> as<00:00:55.319> complex<00:00:55.799> individuals<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.850> not

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
see them as complex individuals and not

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.509 
see them as complex individuals and not
just<00:00:57.389> symbols<00:00:58.199> another<00:00:59.010> way<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.429> can

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
just symbols another way that you can

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:01.639 
just symbols another way that you can
create<00:00:59.819> characters<00:01:00.479> is<00:01:00.690> purely<00:01:01.079> out<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.319> your

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
create characters is purely out of your

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.399 
create characters is purely out of your
imagination<00:01:02.149> if<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.329> think<00:01:03.569> about<00:01:03.659> multiple

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
imagination if you think about multiple

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.860 
imagination if you think about multiple
personalities<00:01:05.220> then<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.390> realize<00:01:06.840> that

personalities then you realize that

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.029 
personalities then you realize that

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:47.999 
you'll find the whole character changes

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:50.480 
you'll find the whole character changes
it's<00:01:48.539> also<00:01:48.780> important<00:01:49.469> to<00:01:49.649> think<00:01:49.799> about<00:01:49.950> how

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
it's also important to think about how

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.700 
it's also important to think about how
your<00:01:50.700> character<00:01:50.939> develops<00:01:51.719> through<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.229> story

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
your character develops through a story

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.160 
your character develops through a story
the<00:01:53.310> whole<00:01:53.460> point<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.969> a<00:01:54.119> story<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.719> that<00:01:55.020> your

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
the whole point of a story is that your

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.319 
the whole point of a story is that your
main<00:01:55.469> character<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.310> going<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.759> change<00:01:57.030> in

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
main character is going to change in

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.200 
main character is going to change in
some<00:01:57.600> way<00:01:57.780> if<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.619> character<00:01:59.159> ends<00:01:59.789> up<00:01:59.939> being

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
some way if the character ends up being

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.330 
some way if the character ends up being
exactly<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.869> same<00:02:01.079> person<00:02:01.380> they<00:02:01.710> were<00:02:01.770> at<00:02:02.189> the

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
exactly the same person they were at the

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.249 
exactly the same person they were at the
end<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.789> story<00:02:03.119> as<00:02:03.329> they<00:02:03.840> were<00:02:03.899> at<00:02:04.140> the

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
end of the story as they were at the

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.109 
end of the story as they were at the
beginning<00:02:04.409> it's<00:02:04.979> not<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.249> very<00:02:05.520> interesting

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
beginning it's not a very interesting

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.870 
beginning it's not a very interesting
story<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:07.289> somebody<00:02:07.740> might<00:02:07.979> go<00:02:08.220> from<00:02:08.520> being<00:02:08.700> a

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
story so somebody might go from being a

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.100 
story so somebody might go from being a
coward<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.509> hero

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
coward to a hero

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.410 
coward to a hero
they<00:02:10.680> might<00:02:10.920> realize<00:02:11.640> something<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.300> is

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
they might realize something that is

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.960 
they might realize something that is
going<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.810> change<00:02:12.870> their<00:02:13.410> life<00:02:13.620> forever<00:02:14.310> they

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
going to change their life forever they

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.360 
going to change their life forever they
might<00:02:15.210> make<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.480> decision<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.740> is<00:02:16.860> completely

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
might make a decision that is completely

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.250 
might make a decision that is completely
wrong<00:02:17.640> for<00:02:17.700> them<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.240> then<00:02:18.540> have<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.900> suffer

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
wrong for them and then have to suffer

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.870 
wrong for them and then have to suffer
the<00:02:19.350> consequences<00:02:20.130> and<00:02:20.340> that<00:02:20.550> will<00:02:20.730> also

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
the consequences and that will also

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.240 
the consequences and that will also
change<00:02:21.360> them<00:02:21.720> it's<00:02:22.350> really<00:02:22.710> important<00:02:23.190> to

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
change them it's really important to

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.040 
change them it's really important to
think<00:02:23.370> about<00:02:23.670> this<00:02:24.000> process<00:02:24.540> of<00:02:24.720> change

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
think about this process of change

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.990 
think about this process of change
because<00:02:25.710> that's<00:02:25.950> what<00:02:26.160> makes<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.550> character

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
because that's what makes a character

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.880 
because that's what makes a character
real<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.540> that's<00:02:28.080> how<00:02:28.350> you<00:02:28.410> create<00:02:28.710> a

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
real and that's how you create a

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.220 
real and that's how you create a
character
