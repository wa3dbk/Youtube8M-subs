got<00:00:20.800> into<00:00:20.950> video<00:00:21.250> actually<00:00:21.730> came<00:00:21.940> from<00:00:21.970> a

got into video actually came from a
music<00:00:22.660> and<00:00:22.840> audio<00:00:23.110> background<00:00:23.380> so<00:00:24.010> I've

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.100 
music and audio background so I've

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.620 
music and audio background so I've
always<00:00:24.369> had<00:00:24.490> a<00:00:24.550> soft<00:00:24.789> spot<00:00:24.940> not<00:00:25.180> only<00:00:25.360> for<00:00:25.539> new

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
always had a soft spot not only for new

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.359 
always had a soft spot not only for new
gear<00:00:25.960> but<00:00:26.199> for<00:00:26.380> audio<00:00:26.680> as<00:00:26.830> well<00:00:26.860> which<00:00:27.160> is<00:00:27.280> why

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:27.369 
gear but for audio as well which is why

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:28.770 
gear but for audio as well which is why
I'm<00:00:27.490> constantly<00:00:27.880> trying<00:00:28.180> to<00:00:28.270> improve<00:00:28.600> not

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:28.780 
I'm constantly trying to improve not

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.810 
I'm constantly trying to improve not
only<00:00:28.990> video<00:00:29.260> quality<00:00:29.560> but<00:00:29.920> get<00:00:30.369> the<00:00:30.520> best

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
only video quality but get the best

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.729 
only video quality but get the best
possible<00:00:31.119> audio<00:00:31.690> quality<00:00:31.900> I<00:00:32.079> can<00:00:32.140> for<00:00:32.649> these

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
possible audio quality I can for these

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.470 
possible audio quality I can for these
videos<00:00:33.129> so<00:00:33.430> what<00:00:33.699> you're<00:00:33.820> looking<00:00:33.940> at<00:00:34.149> is<00:00:34.300> the

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
videos so what you're looking at is the

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.450 
videos so what you're looking at is the
Apollo<00:00:34.780> twin<00:00:35.109> by<00:00:35.320> Universal<00:00:35.829> audio<00:00:36.040> and<00:00:36.310> not

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
Apollo twin by Universal audio and not

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.950 
Apollo twin by Universal audio and not
only<00:00:36.700> do<00:00:36.820> they<00:00:36.910> make<00:00:36.940> arguably<00:00:37.510> the<00:00:37.660> best

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
only do they make arguably the best

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.780 
only do they make arguably the best
hardware<00:00:38.410> emulation<00:00:38.560> plugins<00:00:39.250> on<00:00:39.340> the<00:00:39.430> planet

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
hardware emulation plugins on the planet

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.580 
hardware emulation plugins on the planet
they<00:00:40.120> do<00:00:40.239> a<00:00:40.270> killer<00:00:40.570> job<00:00:40.870> of<00:00:41.050> bridging<00:00:41.320> the<00:00:41.380> gap

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
they do a killer job of bridging the gap

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.770 
they do a killer job of bridging the gap
between<00:00:41.620> technology<00:00:42.579> and<00:00:42.760> music<00:00:43.030> so<00:00:43.690> the

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
between technology and music so the

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.090 
between technology and music so the
Apollo<00:00:44.020> twin<00:00:44.230> is<00:00:44.320> essentially<00:00:44.680> the<00:00:44.800> little

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
Apollo twin is essentially the little

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.710 
Apollo twin is essentially the little
brother<00:00:45.370> of<00:00:45.610> the<00:00:45.760> original<00:00:46.149> Apollo<00:00:46.360> and

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
brother of the original Apollo and

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.810 
brother of the original Apollo and
Apollo<00:00:46.960> 16<00:00:47.170> obviously<00:00:48.160> it's<00:00:48.280> smaller<00:00:48.550> more

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
Apollo 16 obviously it's smaller more

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.370 
Apollo 16 obviously it's smaller more

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
that there are monitor and line outputs

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.350 
that there are monitor and line outputs
the<00:01:35.409> power<00:01:35.650> input<00:01:36.070> and<00:01:36.220> a<00:01:36.400> single<00:01:36.850> thunderbolt

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
the power input and a single thunderbolt

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.600 
the power input and a single thunderbolt
connection<00:01:37.450> so<00:01:37.840> no<00:01:37.960> USB<00:01:38.229> or<00:01:38.530> firewire<00:01:38.580> but<00:01:39.580> I

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
connection so no USB or firewire but I

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.219 
connection so no USB or firewire but I
would<00:01:39.820> assume<00:01:39.939> that<00:01:40.150> you<00:01:40.390> can<00:01:40.420> probably<00:01:40.750> use<00:01:41.200> a

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
would assume that you can probably use a

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.320 
would assume that you can probably use a
firewire<00:01:41.890> 2<00:01:42.070> Thunderbolt<00:01:42.490> converter<00:01:42.759> and<00:01:42.970> I

firewire 2 Thunderbolt converter and I

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.670 
firewire 2 Thunderbolt converter and I
will<00:01:43.509> look<00:01:43.630> into<00:01:43.810> that<00:01:43.930> for<00:01:44.259> my<00:01:44.380> full<00:01:44.650> review

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
will look into that for my full review

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.950 
will look into that for my full review
of<00:01:45.159> the<00:01:45.280> unit<00:01:45.610> now<00:01:46.060> right<00:01:46.270> there<00:01:46.450> above<00:01:46.780> the

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
of the unit now right there above the

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.569 
of the unit now right there above the
power<00:01:47.140> switch<00:01:47.350> there's<00:01:47.650> also<00:01:47.860> an<00:01:48.070> optical<00:01:48.220> in

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
power switch there's also an optical in

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.130 
power switch there's also an optical in
so<00:01:48.729> you<00:01:48.820> can<00:01:48.939> actually<00:01:49.119> add<00:01:49.479> up<00:01:49.509> to<00:01:49.900> 8

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
so you can actually add up to 8

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.840 
so you can actually add up to 8
additional<00:01:50.829> inputs<00:01:51.220> through<00:01:51.460> an<00:01:51.549> 8<00:01:51.700> @

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
additional inputs through an 8 @

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.370 
additional inputs through an 8 @
connection<00:01:52.299> now<00:01:52.750> additionally<00:01:52.990> there's<00:01:53.350> a

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
connection now additionally there's a

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.140 
connection now additionally there's a
few<00:01:53.530> things<00:01:53.740> that<00:01:53.829> separate<00:01:54.340> this<00:01:54.579> from<00:01:54.939> other

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
few things that separate this from other

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.850 
few things that separate this from other
interfaces<00:01:55.689> one<00:01:55.810> of<00:01:55.930> them<00:01:56.049> being<00:01:56.229> built<00:01:56.619> in

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
interfaces one of them being built in

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.800 
interfaces one of them being built in
processing<00:01:57.549> so<00:01:57.700> this<00:01:57.820> comes<00:01:58.060> in<00:01:58.210> a<00:01:58.299> solo<00:01:58.659> or

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
processing so this comes in a solo or

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.539 
processing so this comes in a solo or
dual<00:01:59.140> configuration<00:01:59.920> and<00:02:00.040> just<00:02:00.189> think<00:02:00.369> of<00:02:00.460> it

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
dual configuration and just think of it

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.190 
dual configuration and just think of it
the<00:02:00.700> same<00:02:00.729> way<00:02:01.000> you<00:02:01.030> think<00:02:01.180> of<00:02:01.509> computer<00:02:01.930> cores

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
the same way you think of computer cores

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.539 
the same way you think of computer cores
or<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.500> cores<00:02:02.710> on<00:02:02.860> a<00:02:02.920> phone<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.340> more<00:02:03.490> you

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
or the cores on a phone the more you

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.190 
or the cores on a phone the more you
have<00:02:03.729> more<00:02:03.759> power<00:02:04.240> you<00:02:04.390> have<00:02:04.540> and<00:02:04.780> it's<00:02:05.110> gonna

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
have more power you have and it's gonna

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.539 
have more power you have and it's gonna
actually<00:02:05.350> take<00:02:05.649> the<00:02:05.829> load<00:02:06.040> off<00:02:06.250> of<00:02:06.460> your

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
actually take the load off of your

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:07.859 
actually take the load off of your
computer<00:02:06.670> so<00:02:07.360> even<00:02:07.570> if<00:02:07.630> you're<00:02:07.750> using

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
computer so even if you're using

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.210 
computer so even if you're using
something<00:02:08.140> like<00:02:08.259> a<00:02:08.349> MacBook<00:02:08.769> Air<00:02:08.890> you're<00:02:09.129> not

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
something like a MacBook Air you're not

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.710 
something like a MacBook Air you're not
gonna<00:02:09.340> have<00:02:09.459> to<00:02:09.549> stress<00:02:09.819> about<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.269> computer

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
gonna have to stress about the computer

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.239 
gonna have to stress about the computer
maxing<00:02:11.110> out<00:02:11.200> and<00:02:11.499> being<00:02:11.680> taxed<00:02:12.099> by<00:02:12.159> the

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:12.249 
maxing out and being taxed by the

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:13.860 
maxing out and being taxed by the
plugins<00:02:12.760> because<00:02:13.120> this<00:02:13.419> is<00:02:13.510> going<00:02:13.629> to<00:02:13.689> take

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
plugins because this is going to take

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.080 
plugins because this is going to take
the<00:02:14.049> load<00:02:14.230> off<00:02:14.469> your<00:02:14.499> computers<00:02:15.099> hands<00:02:15.519> on<00:02:15.669> top

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
the load off your computers hands on top

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.130 
the load off your computers hands on top
of<00:02:16.239> that<00:02:16.359> like<00:02:16.569> I<00:02:16.689> mentioned

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
of that like I mentioned

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.750 
of that like I mentioned
make<00:02:17.230> arguably<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:17.920> best<00:02:18.250> hardware

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
make arguably the best hardware

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.640 
make arguably the best hardware
emulation<00:02:18.940> plugins<00:02:19.690> in<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:20.050> world<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.590> the

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
emulation plugins in the world and the

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.410 
emulation plugins in the world and the
cool<00:02:20.830> thing<00:02:20.860> is<00:02:21.130> with<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.520> power<00:02:21.790> built<00:02:22.120> into

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
cool thing is with the power built into

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.000 
cool thing is with the power built into
this<00:02:22.510> unit<00:02:22.840> you<00:02:22.930> can<00:02:23.050> actually<00:02:23.170> use<00:02:23.530> those<00:02:23.800> to

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
this unit you can actually use those to

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.949 
this unit you can actually use those to
track<00:02:24.280> or<00:02:24.550> monitor<00:02:24.819> your<00:02:25.120> recordings<00:02:25.600> in<00:02:25.720> real

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
track or monitor your recordings in real

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.750 
track or monitor your recordings in real
time<00:02:26.260> not<00:02:26.830> after<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.370> fact<00:02:27.520> or

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
time not after the fact or

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.520 
time not after the fact or
post-processing<00:02:28.569> so<00:02:29.020> if<00:02:29.080> you're<00:02:29.200> tracking<00:02:29.350> a

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
post-processing so if you're tracking a

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.690 
post-processing so if you're tracking a
guitar<00:02:29.800> for<00:02:29.950> example<00:02:30.340> you<00:02:30.430> could<00:02:30.520> plug

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
guitar for example you could plug

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.699 
guitar for example you could plug
directly<00:02:30.880> into<00:02:31.209> an<00:02:31.569> API<00:02:31.870> strip<00:02:32.290> you<00:02:32.410> can<00:02:32.440> throw

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
directly into an API strip you can throw

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:33.750 
directly into an API strip you can throw
in<00:02:32.830> some<00:02:32.860> of<00:02:33.069> their<00:02:33.190> softube

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
in some of their softube

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.190 
in some of their softube
app<00:02:33.880> modeling<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.690> cool<00:02:34.870> thing<00:02:35.050> is<00:02:35.080> you

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
app modeling and the cool thing is you

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.990 
app modeling and the cool thing is you
have<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.440> option<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:35.860> record<00:02:36.400> exactly<00:02:36.550> what

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
have the option to record exactly what

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.670 
have the option to record exactly what
you<00:02:37.090> hear<00:02:37.360> into<00:02:37.660> a<00:02:37.690> wet<00:02:37.959> signal<00:02:38.380> like<00:02:38.560> you

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
you hear into a wet signal like you

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.680 
you hear into a wet signal like you
would<00:02:38.890> with<00:02:39.040> older<00:02:39.370> analog<00:02:39.640> gear<00:02:39.970> or<00:02:40.390> you<00:02:40.570> can

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
would with older analog gear or you can

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.240 
would with older analog gear or you can
kind<00:02:40.810> of<00:02:40.930> preview<00:02:41.170> it<00:02:41.440> and<00:02:41.560> still<00:02:41.740> record<00:02:42.100> a

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
kind of preview it and still record a

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.310 
kind of preview it and still record a
dry<00:02:42.550> signal<00:02:42.850> and<00:02:43.180> then<00:02:43.540> tweak<00:02:43.810> it<00:02:43.959> after<00:02:44.230> the

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
dry signal and then tweak it after the

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.990 
dry signal and then tweak it after the
fact<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.830> from<00:02:45.070> there<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.370> plugins<00:02:45.730> keep

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
fact and from there the plugins keep

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.550 
fact and from there the plugins keep
going<00:02:46.390> there's<00:02:46.540> tons<00:02:46.750> of<00:02:46.810> compressors<00:02:47.319> from

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
going there's tons of compressors from

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.190 
going there's tons of compressors from

Fairchild you have SSL Studer pultec the
list<00:02:50.380> goes<00:02:50.530> on<00:02:50.709> and<00:02:50.890> what's<00:02:51.010> cool<00:02:51.220> with<00:02:51.250> these

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
is they actually introduced unison

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.470 
is they actually introduced unison
preamp<00:02:54.010> technology<00:02:54.610> and<00:02:54.850> what<00:02:55.030> that<00:02:55.150> means<00:02:55.330> in

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
preamp technology and what that means in

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.729 
preamp technology and what that means in
simple<00:02:55.750> terms<00:02:55.930> is<00:02:56.080> the<00:02:56.110> plug-in<00:02:56.440> actually

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
simple terms is the plug-in actually

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.650 
simple terms is the plug-in actually
adjust<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.430> preamp<00:02:57.820> circuit<00:02:58.180> itself<00:02:58.420> so

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
adjust the preamp circuit itself so

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.060 
adjust the preamp circuit itself so
based<00:02:58.870> off<00:02:59.050> what<00:02:59.410> plug-in<00:02:59.769> you're<00:02:59.890> using
