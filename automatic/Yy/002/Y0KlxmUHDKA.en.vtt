Sowell<00:00:18.390> garmin-sharp<00:00:18.720> are<00:00:19.020> really<00:00:19.199> trying<00:00:19.380> to

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
Sowell garmin-sharp are really trying to

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.109 
Sowell garmin-sharp are really trying to
optimize<00:00:19.949> all<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.279> technology<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:20.970> we<00:00:21.090> use

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
optimize all the technology that we use

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.029 
optimize all the technology that we use
in<00:00:21.420> any<00:00:21.539> given<00:00:21.840> stage<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.439> cervelas

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
in any given stage and that cervelas

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.980 
in any given stage and that cervelas
done<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> really<00:00:23.580> nice<00:00:23.760> job<00:00:23.820> with<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.330> s5<00:00:24.689> and

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
done a really nice job with the s5 and

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.210 
done a really nice job with the s5 and
making<00:00:25.529> sure<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:25.800> it's<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.010> most

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
making sure that it's the most

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.300 
making sure that it's the most
aerodynamic<00:00:26.519> road<00:00:27.150> bike<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.420> we<00:00:27.689> can<00:00:27.840> use

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
aerodynamic road bike that we can use

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.529 
aerodynamic road bike that we can use
the<00:00:29.310> bicycle<00:00:29.460> I'm<00:00:29.820> working<00:00:30.090> on<00:00:30.179> right<00:00:30.240> now

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
the bicycle I'm working on right now

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.840 
the bicycle I'm working on right now
would<00:00:30.720> be<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.189> hundredth<00:00:32.189> Edition<00:00:32.579> Tour<00:00:32.759> de

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
would be the hundredth Edition Tour de

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.180 
would be the hundredth Edition Tour de
France<00:00:33.090> S<00:00:33.329> 5<00:00:33.570> from<00:00:33.989> Cervelo<00:00:34.410> it's<00:00:34.890> really<00:00:35.130> a

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
France S 5 from Cervelo it's really a

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.900 
France S 5 from Cervelo it's really a
nice<00:00:35.340> bike<00:00:35.989> super<00:00:36.989> aerodynamic<00:00:37.640> so<00:00:38.640> this

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
nice bike super aerodynamic so this

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.510 
nice bike super aerodynamic so this
frame<00:00:39.180> as<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.450> can<00:00:39.600> see<00:00:39.809> has<00:00:40.020> different

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
frame as you can see has different

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.560 
frame as you can see has different
aerodynamic<00:00:41.520> shapes<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.270> make<00:00:42.420> it

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
aerodynamic shapes to it that make it

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.990 
aerodynamic shapes to it that make it
different<00:00:43.170> than<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.890> our<00:00:44.040> series<00:00:44.430> bike<00:00:44.730> and

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
different than the our series bike and

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.990 
different than the our series bike and
make<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.329> better<00:00:45.809> for<00:00:46.070> flat<00:00:47.070> stages<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.760> when

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
make it better for flat stages and when

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.670 
make it better for flat stages and when
the<00:00:48.120> riders<00:00:48.420> are<00:00:48.629> riding<00:00:48.809> on<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.140> front<00:00:49.410> and

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
the riders are riding on the front and

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.549 
the riders are riding on the front and
going<00:00:50.280> really<00:00:50.550> fast<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:51.270> think<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.379> most

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
going really fast I think the most

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.080 
going really fast I think the most
special<00:00:52.710> points<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.610> bike<00:00:53.850> obviously

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
special points of this bike obviously

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.020 
special points of this bike obviously
would<00:00:54.719> be<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.890> aerodynamic<00:00:56.489> advantage<00:00:56.910> I

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
would be the the aerodynamic advantage I

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.330 
would be the the aerodynamic advantage I
mean<00:00:57.180> that's<00:00:57.360> what<00:00:58.199> Cervelo<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.739> going<00:00:59.039> after

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
mean that's what Cervelo is going after

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.369 
mean that's what Cervelo is going after
when<00:00:59.489> they<00:00:59.609> design<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.090> bike<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.539> try<00:01:01.170> and

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
when they design this bike to try and

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.160 
when they design this bike to try and
make<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.070> advantageous<00:01:02.850> in<00:01:03.690> terms<00:01:03.989> of

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
make it advantageous in terms of

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.670 
make it advantageous in terms of
aerodynamics<00:01:04.860> where<00:01:05.610> with<00:01:06.570> certain<00:01:07.439> wheels

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
aerodynamics where with certain wheels

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.950 
aerodynamics where with certain wheels
and<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.220> bike<00:01:08.520> we<00:01:08.790> really<00:01:09.060> can<00:01:09.299> do<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> little

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
and this bike we really can do a little

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.480 
and this bike we really can do a little
better<00:01:10.170> just<00:01:10.470> because<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.920> bike<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.340> know

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
better just because of the bike you know

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.109 
better just because of the bike you know
I'm<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.780> s5<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.770> use<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.369> throughout<00:01:15.000> the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
I'm on the s5 I use that throughout the

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.890 
I'm on the s5 I use that throughout the

new wheels it's yes and it's pretty cool
bike<00:01:21.869> it's<00:01:22.830> one<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.280> bikes<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.729> actually

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
bike it's one of the bikes that actually

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.960 
bike it's one of the bikes that actually
other<00:01:24.299> pros<00:01:24.659> come<00:01:24.869> up<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.110> comment<00:01:25.409> on<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:25.970> the

other pros come up and comment on so the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.819 
other pros come up and comment on so the
look<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.360> starters<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.780> mean<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.110> one<00:01:28.740> of

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
look the starters I mean it's one of

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.100

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.560 
stage I want the Tour de France last
year's<00:01:41.350> on<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:41.590> s5<00:01:41.920> and<00:01:42.190> me<00:01:42.310> the<00:01:43.090> first<00:01:43.360> half

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
year's on the s5 and me the first half

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.150 
year's on the s5 and me the first half
was<00:01:43.720> in<00:01:43.810> the<00:01:43.870> mountains<00:01:44.260> over<00:01:44.530> category<00:01:44.950> 1

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
was in the mountains over category 1

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.940 
was in the mountains over category 1
mountains<00:01:45.610> and<00:01:45.970> then<00:01:46.120> it<00:01:46.240> was<00:01:46.390> flat<00:01:47.380> for<00:01:47.560> 100k

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
mountains and then it was flat for 100k

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.250 
mountains and then it was flat for 100k
so<00:01:48.130> you<00:01:48.400> know<00:01:48.550> and<00:01:48.880> I<00:01:49.000> was<00:01:49.090> first<00:01:49.810> over

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
so you know and I was first over

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.170 
so you know and I was first over
basically<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:50.830> mountains<00:01:51.220> on<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.370> Ness<00:01:51.580> 5<00:01:51.820> so

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
basically the mountains on the Ness 5 so

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.790 
basically the mountains on the Ness 5 so
goes<00:01:52.360> to<00:01:52.510> show<00:01:52.690> it<00:01:52.810> can<00:01:52.840> do<00:01:52.990> anything<00:01:53.230> we

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
goes to show it can do anything we

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.020 
goes to show it can do anything we
always<00:01:54.190> need<00:01:54.370> to<00:01:54.400> make<00:01:54.520> sure<00:01:54.790> that<00:01:54.910> the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
always need to make sure that the

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.600 
always need to make sure that the
athletes<00:01:55.450> feel<00:01:55.720> like<00:01:55.930> they<00:01:56.140> have<00:01:56.380> the<00:01:57.220> highest

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
athletes feel like they have the highest

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.660 
athletes feel like they have the highest
level<00:01:57.850> equipment<00:01:58.300> in<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.960> highest<00:01:59.670> advantage

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
level equipment in the highest advantage
