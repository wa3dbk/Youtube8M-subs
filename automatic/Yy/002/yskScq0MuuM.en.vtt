of<00:00:00.680> the<00:00:01.760> photograph<00:00:02.760> energy<00:00:03.149> or<00:00:03.240> 12<00:00:03.540> right

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
of the photograph energy or 12 right

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.080 
of the photograph energy or 12 right
there<00:00:05.960> and<00:00:06.960> then<00:00:07.500> we<00:00:07.620> also<00:00:07.799> have<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.849> ground

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
there and then we also have the ground

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.419 
there and then we also have the ground
here<00:00:09.450> 16

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
here 16

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.549 
here 16
right<00:00:12.059> there<00:00:12.420> so<00:00:12.660> this<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:12.839> one<00:00:13.170> antenna

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
right there so this is one antenna

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.150 
right there so this is one antenna
placement

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
placement

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.880 
placement
the<00:00:15.640> other<00:00:15.790> placement<00:00:16.240> is<00:00:16.300> coming<00:00:16.600> down

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.980 

and<00:00:19.250> so<00:00:20.120> which<00:00:20.300> one<00:00:20.480> of<00:00:20.510> you<00:00:20.660> flying<00:00:20.870> with

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
and so which one of you flying with

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.760 
and so which one of you flying with
Chuck<00:00:21.320> the<00:00:21.890> gr<00:00:22.190> 60<00:00:22.550> and<00:00:23.270> the<00:00:24.140> one<00:00:24.380> on<00:00:24.530> the<00:00:24.620> leg

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
Chuck the gr 60 and the one on the leg

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.970 
Chuck the gr 60 and the one on the leg
is<00:00:24.920> the<00:00:24.980> 24<00:00:25.460> that's<00:00:26.030> at<00:00:26.330> gr<00:00:26.600> 12<00:00:26.900> Jarek<00:00:27.530> 12<00:00:27.770> which

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
is the 24 that's at gr 12 Jarek 12 which

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:37.930 
is the 24 that's at gr 12 Jarek 12 which
is<00:00:28.100> bound<00:00:28.340> to<00:00:28.550> the<00:00:28.730> MX<00:00:33.490> so<00:00:34.490> on<00:00:34.640> this<00:00:34.850> this<00:00:35.840> is<00:00:36.940> be

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
is bound to the MX so on this this is be

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.200 
is bound to the MX so on this this is be
my<00:00:38.090> overall<00:00:38.380> transmitter<00:00:39.380> strength<00:00:42.070> so<00:00:43.210> and

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
my overall transmitter strength so and

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.500 
my overall transmitter strength so and
also<00:00:44.420> we'll<00:00:45.309> pull<00:00:46.309> up<00:00:46.370> some<00:00:46.640> telemetry<00:00:46.940> as<00:00:47.300> far

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
also we'll pull up some telemetry as far

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:56.530 
also we'll pull up some telemetry as far
as<00:00:47.600> distance<00:00:47.930> goes<00:00:52.120> yes<00:00:53.710> just<00:00:54.710> answer<00:00:55.100> it

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
as distance goes yes just answer it

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:38.380 
as distance goes yes just answer it
plus<00:00:57.110> we<00:00:57.320> have<00:00:57.530> a<00:00:57.920> 1.3<00:00:58.850> low<00:00:59.149> mate<00:00:59.420> in<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:00.230> mix

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.110 

okay<00:01:38.690> right<00:01:38.930> now<00:01:39.080> we're<00:01:39.260> at<00:01:39.350> 75<00:01:40.010> meters<00:01:40.220> 35

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
okay right now we're at 75 meters 35

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:47.599 
okay right now we're at 75 meters 35
meters

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:47.609 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:51.059 

so<00:01:48.609> now<00:01:48.819> yes<00:01:49.600> and<00:01:49.749> I'm<00:01:49.869> about<00:01:50.079> 300<00:01:50.649> meters<00:01:50.740> out

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:51.069 
so now yes and I'm about 300 meters out

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:54.160 
so now yes and I'm about 300 meters out
and<00:01:51.249> I<00:01:51.280> can

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.880 

I<00:01:55.170> mean<00:01:56.130> it's<00:01:56.250> pretty<00:01:56.400> much<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.700> second

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.750 

and<00:02:01.250> as<00:02:01.400> far<00:02:01.610> as<00:02:01.760> your<00:02:01.880> series<00:02:02.180> right<00:02:03.760> we're

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
and as far as your series right we're

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.450 
and as far as your series right we're
the<00:02:04.820> 5%<00:02:05.360> about<00:02:05.630> 45%<00:02:06.140> I'll<00:02:06.950> spin<00:02:07.280> it<00:02:07.370> around

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
the 5% about 45% I'll spin it around

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:19.550 
the 5% about 45% I'll spin it around
maybe<00:02:07.910> something

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.720 

okay<00:02:20.560> so<00:02:20.620> I<00:02:20.799> pretty<00:02:20.980> much<00:02:21.069> know<00:02:21.400> where<00:02:21.519> I'm<00:02:21.610> at

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
okay so I pretty much know where I'm at

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.559 
okay so I pretty much know where I'm at
right<00:02:21.909> there<00:02:22.120> so<00:02:22.299> I'm<00:02:22.359> gonna<00:02:22.450> come<00:02:22.689> on<00:02:22.840> in

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
right there so I'm gonna come on in

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:39.990 
right there so I'm gonna come on in
turn<00:02:24.140> off<00:02:24.349> the<00:02:24.560> MX<00:02:25.540> 1206

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.820 

so<00:02:41.000> now<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.209> gr<00:02:41.599> 12<00:02:41.900> is<00:02:42.050> off<00:02:42.230> on<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.590> copter

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
so now the gr 12 is off on the copter

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.250 
so now the gr 12 is off on the copter
and<00:02:43.040> we'll<00:02:43.400> just<00:02:43.610> turn<00:02:43.879> off<00:02:46.959> those<00:02:47.959> of<00:02:48.110> you

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
and we'll just turn off those of you

00:02:48.260 --> 00:03:11.620 
and we'll just turn off those of you
serious

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:20.220 

receiver<00:03:12.260> strength<00:03:13.480> 85%

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:49.540 

strike<00:03:21.190> eight

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.740 

okay<00:03:50.550> so<00:03:50.610> that's<00:03:50.850> pretty<00:03:51.030> much<00:03:51.300> where<00:03:51.720> we

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
okay so that's pretty much where we

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.290 
okay so that's pretty much where we
ended<00:03:52.290> up<00:03:52.380> on<00:03:52.560> that<00:03:52.590> last<00:03:52.980> flight<00:03:53.340> so<00:03:54.060> we're

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
ended up on that last flight so we're

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:01.420 
ended up on that last flight so we're
three<00:03:54.540> millimeters

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.849 

I'm<00:04:01.609> just<00:04:01.790> gonna<00:04:01.909> do<00:04:02.000> a<00:04:02.030> spin<00:04:02.269> around<00:04:02.420> again

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
I'm just gonna do a spin around again

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:06.369 
I'm just gonna do a spin around again
strike<00:04:03.859> so<00:04:04.930> yeah

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
strike so yeah

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:15.140 
strike so yeah
the<00:04:07.379> time<00:04:07.590> I<00:04:07.980> am<00:04:08.970> x12<00:04:10.129> I<00:04:12.349> would<00:04:13.349> say<00:04:13.909> this<00:04:14.909> is

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
the time I am x12 I would say this is

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.909 
the time I am x12 I would say this is
pretty<00:04:15.450> much<00:04:15.569> borderline<00:04:16.229> as<00:04:16.530> far<00:04:16.769> as

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
pretty much borderline as far as

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:24.510 
pretty much borderline as far as
distance<00:04:17.400> away<00:04:17.989> which<00:04:18.989> is

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.920 

I<00:04:24.550> mean<00:04:24.880> right<00:04:25.060> now<00:04:25.120> I<00:04:25.300> can<00:04:25.599> tell<00:04:25.630> my

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
I mean right now I can tell my

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.080 
I mean right now I can tell my
orientation<00:04:26.410> is<00:04:26.710> that

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.690 

it's<00:04:31.570> not<00:04:31.690> that<00:04:31.870> PDR<00:04:32.500> are<00:04:32.950> you<00:04:33.160> saying<00:04:33.430> you

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
it's not that PDR are you saying you

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:40.950 
it's not that PDR are you saying you
tell<00:04:33.880> orientation<00:04:34.389> through<00:04:35.490> yeah<00:04:39.780> plus<00:04:40.780> I'm

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
tell orientation through yeah plus I'm

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.810 
tell orientation through yeah plus I'm
kind<00:04:40.990> of<00:04:41.230> cheating<00:04:41.440> with<00:04:41.710> fgts<00:04:42.190> I<00:04:42.430> know<00:04:42.490> where

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
kind of cheating with fgts I know where

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:56.950 
kind of cheating with fgts I know where
I'm<00:04:42.880> looking<00:04:43.210> at<00:04:43.389> so

would<00:05:10.670> you<00:05:10.790> feel<00:05:10.940> comfortable<00:05:11.030> flying<00:05:11.600> any

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
would you feel comfortable flying any

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.679 
would you feel comfortable flying any
further<00:05:11.960> than<00:05:12.170> that

00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:16.689 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:20.539
