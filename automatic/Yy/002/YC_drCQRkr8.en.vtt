00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:07.460
 Hi, I'm mario Balotelli, I'm not 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:09.259
 I'm 16 years old, my 177 and in the 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.800
 night I am known as Maria Reynoso 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:16.510
 how do you describe yourself 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:18.840
 simple charismatic funny sensible 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.840
 enthusiastic 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.910
 complete there is that evil because it does like 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.220
 a year and a half won the contest of 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.289
 quinceaÃ±eras where it was already in that environment 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.910
 where he started to like that of the 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.579
 walkways of photo shoots 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.550
 this love is 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.370
 how do you have a top model in 5 years? 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.510
 and a professional model traveling around 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:49.399
 the world being known by all 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.399
 means and of course I hope 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.989
 what change in you this primary model 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.600
 to date everything completely 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:02.059
 physically inwardly and I think that I 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.239
 it made me feel better about myself because 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.550
 before it does not feel like super 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.800
 Little girl with other people and good 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.800
 thanks wait I am what I am now 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.060
 my first catwalk I was robbed 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.200
 bata where we had we did not have to 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.560
 lose it because if they were not going to remove us 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.100
 of our money and well I saved it 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.880
 in my bag and someone very clever because the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.430
 I take and as well as about two years 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.170
 I was in an agency where I 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.810
 swindled has been horrible because I 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.540
 they made me feel pretty sometimes 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.780
 you are beautiful you walk beautiful knowing 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.320
 that this era was not coming and they make me 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.330
 see the reality of what it is that here is 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.850
 professionalism and they say no to me 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.850
 you walk nothing happens then this is 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.820
 all wrong and I say good to me tell me 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.550
 that we're going to know the perfect 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.920
 but it's just people who tried to take out 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.990
 money I do not know what they say I was 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.610
 right in that agency that's why I think that 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.400
 It was an excellent design for quintero 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.870
 what you like most about the agency 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.360
 simply the models the environment that 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.420
 there's here because it's not like everything is 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.090
 how do you spend to one I lived as envy as 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.640
 that people with rancor that tried to 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.550
 damage you but on the contrary I think here 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:34.390
 we support many things between going all 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:37.090
 we support and I think it is something caesar 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.970
 will teach us super good and fat in the 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.310
 prison very much 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.280
 what would you say to the girls what lyrics of 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.319
 bag come to science 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.360
 those who dare not be afraid 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.300
 that, on the contrary, I think it's going to 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.160
 help a lot 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.820
 and makes them feel better about you 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.920
 same as it happened to me I think I think 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.140
 that is a very beautiful experience all 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.860
 I've lived here since they get 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.860
 Do not be afraid
