00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
kraken so I would be looking to possibly

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.259 
kraken so I would be looking to possibly
see<00:02:21.500> that<00:02:21.680> as<00:02:21.829> well<00:02:22.069> here<00:02:22.790> in<00:02:22.909> the<00:02:22.969> next<00:02:23.120> couple

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.720 
see that as well here in the next couple
weeks<00:02:23.719> I'm<00:02:24.560> not<00:02:24.709> sure<00:02:24.769> what<00:02:25.099> other<00:02:25.219> green

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
the near future so I would be expecting
