00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hi guys and welcome back then how 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.450
 see from this number a lot 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.670
 hallucinogen above 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.580
 I must thank you all from the first 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:16.170
 last for my 15 thousand subscribers is 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.360
 a truly exceptional goal 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.650
 and nothing doesn't seem true I started the 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.470
 20 October 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.130
 do you want some of you know me? 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.090
 from the beginning, however, there are also those who are me 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.860
 he knows little about 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.940
 in short this is a pretty channel 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:37.050
 recently i started on push advice 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.820
 inspired by uk equity and others 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.850
 friends I met along the way 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.800
 it was very nice by the way 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.720
 greatly appreciated the early days 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.879
 of my activity on youtube 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.110
 I learned among other things to appreciate 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.780
 this game in particular that 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.049
 minecraft I remind you that I am to ask 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.809
 at 75 and this is my hardcore map that 

00:00:55.049 --> 00:01:00.299
 also my longest running series 78 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.710
 episodes is now closed in short, some of 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:04.890
 you ask me to resume but not 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.290
 I think I'll do it, let's see why 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.130
 there are so many new things at stake 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.420
 there is to decide whether to play his ftb from 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.290
 decide to do our package 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.600
 tony stark the most experienced of us are 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.060
 reluctant 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.439
 have a certain distrust towards that 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.060
 he had a package for our business 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:28.130
 so there will be a small internal schism 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.920
 in the tom's network a normal thing 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.869
 like all combine because of course 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.540
 yes we leave we travel we build ourselves 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.899
 all together solid foundations 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.299
 then everyone wanders their legs in short 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:46.520
 so then here we are to celebrate 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:49.460
 a nice 15,000 all together and I need 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.280
 to thank a little in person 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.000
 first of all it is fundamental to thank 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.399
 first of all my family because I have 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.080
 always thanked all the boys 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.940
 youtube colleagues thank you for my 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.159
 written but without family or everything 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.140
 this would not be possible without i 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.750
 my parents their continued support 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.910
 also I am a vecchiarelli of a certain 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.160
 age but I am always there and it is one 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.930
 lucky to have them guys I recommend if 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.010
 those who do not lose them as a child 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.799
 and who is lucky enough to have mum on 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.019
 Dad both hugs tell them who 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:26.480
 he loves every time he capitalizes 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.500
 pointing aside pride and nonsense 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.170
 varies 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.450

 games because in the end we are 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.520
 in two at home and someone is needed 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.620
 an agreement is needed with new ones 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.960
