00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.539
 all right 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.460
 hello and welcome today I present a 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.700
 new trick here in ascension and good 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.529
 As you can see the zombies are there 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.220
 because you sneak like under the 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.210
 stairs and good and that's how the trick is 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.550
 quite 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.160
 it's good but I prefer the other trick 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.110
 well I'll show us how it's done 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.720
 place is in the corner that and the zombie 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.149
 you just have to ride on top of it you see 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.590
 put your head inside the stairs and 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.809
 the zombies are left there by the side 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.730
 you can walk forward 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.860
 if you walk forward the zombies will 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.780
 they go to the staircase if you're 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.149
 back they stay as behind as you have 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.720
 okay now I'm going to teach it from 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.940
 the view of the character so you see the 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.159
 get in like this and you can walk forward if 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.990
 you want 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.399
 you can walk a little bit towards 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.130
 in front what is forward a 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.079
 bit 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.670
 and if you are moving forward as I have 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:20.329
 said you stay there the stairs 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.329
 up and down 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.430
 good and now I'm going to show you another tube 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:31.009
 old very similar that I do not have it 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:33.619
 uploaded and I'm going to teach you towards 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.630
 corner inside the map what you need 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.909
 is to take the corner and the zombie is 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.860
 Mount up and is now as you see is 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.570
 inside the domino the stage 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.350
 Well now I'm going to show you where 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.350
 the zombies are left 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.820
 that is not too bad the trick 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:59.050
 You see , you stay there so quietly 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:02.310
 and now it is now I am going to teach you from 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:06.850
 the perspective from which he is inside 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:10.330
 I'm going to kill myself to be seen 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.600
 he is in there he sits and he is 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.740
 stay there 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.740
 and good is not bad 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.129
 ah 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.630
 Once dead, you see how is there 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.380
 inside 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.380
 he had gotten 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.760
 and well, it can come out in a different way than 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.280
 now I will show you that leaves you half 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.770
 stuck that does not leave you like that but also 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.050
 account now I will teach you from my 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.380
 perspective you see how they stay there 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.180
 zombies 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.330
 that's where the queer rebaixa is at 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.280
 your camera side from where you see it and 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.430
 Well now I'm going to teach it from my 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.840
 perspective I take the zombie I'm going to 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.810
 the very important corner that is a 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.580
 Quick zombie, you see me 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.730

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.410
