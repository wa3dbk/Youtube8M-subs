 cream has to be cool when 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.680

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.730
 three hours or until it is well hard 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.860

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.260
 freezer you will feel that it is hard 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.629
 it's not completely hard like rock 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.220
