there's<00:05:24.470> a<00:05:24.530> perimeter<00:05:26.800> the<00:05:27.800> way<00:05:27.919> to<00:05:27.979> set<00:05:28.250> up<00:05:28.340> a

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
there's a perimeter the way to set up a

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.810 
there's a perimeter the way to set up a
perimeter<00:05:29.800> if<00:05:30.800> you<00:05:30.949> would<00:05:31.099> choose<00:05:31.250> circle<00:05:31.729> or

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
perimeter if you would choose circle or

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.589 
perimeter if you would choose circle or
rectangle<00:05:31.849> on<00:05:32.750> the<00:05:32.870> top<00:05:33.080> right<00:05:33.680> you<00:05:33.830> circle<00:05:34.370> I

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
rectangle on the top right you circle I

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:38.379 
rectangle on the top right you circle I
would<00:05:35.599> just<00:05:35.750> drag<00:05:36.650> it<00:05:36.919> and<00:05:37.550> I<00:05:37.789> can<00:05:37.970> make<00:05:38.000> it<00:05:38.120> as

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:38.389 
would just drag it and I can make it as

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:42.070 
would just drag it and I can make it as
wide<00:05:38.960> as<00:05:39.020> I<00:05:39.349> want<00:05:39.560> so<00:05:40.360> anytime<00:05:41.360> the<00:05:41.750> vehicle

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
wide as I want so anytime the vehicle

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.480 
wide as I want so anytime the vehicle
when<00:05:42.199> there's<00:05:42.380> that<00:05:42.590> perimeter<00:05:43.039> I<00:05:43.070> would<00:05:43.370> be

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
when there's that perimeter I would be

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.129 
when there's that perimeter I would be
notified

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:47.139 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:49.770 

you<00:05:47.740> could<00:05:47.889> also<00:05:48.009> go<00:05:48.340> into<00:05:48.669> a<00:05:48.699> satellite<00:05:49.240> view

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
you could also go into a satellite view

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.929 
you could also go into a satellite view
you<00:05:50.740> would<00:05:50.860> just<00:05:50.979> click<00:05:51.159> satellite<00:05:51.789> on<00:05:51.909> the

00:05:51.929 --> 00:05:51.939 
you would just click satellite on the

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:56.999 
you would just click satellite on the
top<00:05:54.719> so<00:05:55.719> now<00:05:55.870> I<00:05:55.900> can<00:05:56.110> get<00:05:56.199> a<00:05:56.259> satellite<00:05:56.770> view<00:05:56.800> of

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:57.009 
top so now I can get a satellite view of

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:02.370 
top so now I can get a satellite view of
everything

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.290 

if<00:06:02.800> i<00:06:02.920> wanted<00:06:03.130> to<00:06:03.220> zoom<00:06:03.250> in<00:06:03.640> i<00:06:03.790> could<00:06:03.850> just<00:06:04.090> use

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
if i wanted to zoom in i could just use

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.440 
if i wanted to zoom in i could just use
the<00:06:04.480> arrows<00:06:05.080> on<00:06:05.200> the<00:06:05.320> top<00:06:05.940> and<00:06:06.940> say<00:06:07.180> i<00:06:07.210> want<00:06:07.420> to

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.450 
the arrows on the top and say i want to

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.600 
the arrows on the top and say i want to
get<00:06:07.540> a<00:06:07.600> street<00:06:08.170> view<00:06:08.350> i<00:06:08.680> would<00:06:08.890> just<00:06:09.010> drag<00:06:09.370> this

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
get a street view i would just drag this

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.420 
get a street view i would just drag this
little<00:06:09.820> man<00:06:10.150> over<00:06:10.420> here<00:06:10.660> onto<00:06:10.840> the<00:06:11.080> street<00:06:11.710> and

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.130 

now<00:06:15.430> I<00:06:15.460> can<00:06:15.700> get<00:06:15.850> a<00:06:15.880> street<00:06:16.420> view<00:06:16.600> of<00:06:16.870> this

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140 
now I can get a street view of this

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:24.570 
now I can get a street view of this
location

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580
