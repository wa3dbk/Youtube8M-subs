 Look, I want to show you today. 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.210
 an anti-fall treatment is very good 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.000
 At least for me it works a lot. 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.500
 life here not only here in Sao Paulo but 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.710
 I think that everywhere nowadays the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.040
 stress too great though it may already 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.640
 There can be no many causes for 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.399
 hair 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:40.110
 i it is that the same feeding becomes weak 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.930

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.969

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.219
 popular 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:49.920

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.590
 treat both with homemade recipe with 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.420

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:38.520
 there it is the natural extract of jaborandi 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:40.619
 tonic where it falls and which also 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.220
 aid in the healthy growth of 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.220
 hair 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.280
 I think my life light messes up a 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.340
 little 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.770

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.520
 through massage during the 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.290
 presentation of the product on other wires 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.120
 avoiding the fall and helping in the 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.910
 healthy hair growth 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.410
 As I use your child I go 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:33.060
 hatchet so the hiop directly in 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:35.840

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.840
 massaging 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:45.550
 I apply it on my head like this on my whole body. 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.280
 the scalp all 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.290
 How many times to use ilan says that I have 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.010
 A lot of people are sure a lot of people are going 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.930
 I want to know how many times I use a 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.190
 once a week talent 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:03.220
 and if I go and even if my hair does not 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.610
 is falling or any of this 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:11.110
 I like to use it to keep the leather 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:13.530
 hairy hair on my strong bulls 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.530
 huh 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.610
 I quickly applied my head to a 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.290
 once a week lasts a long time 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.690
 there ready after applied 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.630
 I'm going to massage if this massage 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.480
 that at least with the 23 minutes and 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:36.190
 left him acting on his hair for 30 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:38.470
 sometimes up to 40 minutes I do 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.980
 here and I'm going to do other things that 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:46.360
 I have to do it then wash it 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.820
 sweeps is normal cab twice with shampoo and 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.990
 then you end up like you 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:55.000
 want 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:57.670
 only in my case I 'm going to use it because 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.650
 tips where of course it is more dry 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.540
 but my account of squid and how raissa 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.810
 natural is more valuable 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:09.310
 so I'll wash with shampoo later 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:11.770
 oily hair of Alatur and I always 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.690
 I will wash the hair and makes a treatment 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:18.880
 back using this moisturizing mask 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:22.630
 and unique for dry hair because it is 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.810
 a shampoo for greasy pineapple hair is 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:29.550
 Oily oily and I'll be kidding. 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:32.650
 after washing twice with lead 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.240
 only where are you today I will let you act 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.270
 or dead until 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.310
 For more failures not to run I like 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.690
 so the hydration also 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.770
 more potent 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.990
 then and after that my self should be 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.479
 of course one more of you there your 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.620

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:54.520

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:58.240
 so this is it the video went well 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:02.710
 it was just for one more tip 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:05.830
 For those who have hair loss , but it's 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:09.009
 It's important to remember when I 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:13.180
 I spoke several reasons for a fall 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:15.610
 hair if you only used it when 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:21.099
 the hair is here I'm weak 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:23.710
 you use it and for a month it already illuminates 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:27.610
 that excessive fall who fall is normal 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:30.039
 up to 100 thousand per day spent it already is 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.650
 a fall that has to lend a little more 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:34.210
 attention that is a disorder there if not 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.250
 To stop this fall, we are very 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:40.090
 important that walter the dermatologist 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:42.159
 and only he will be able to say what is 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.539
 happening in her body to the Portuguese sometimes 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:45.159
 You need to do some tests 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:48.219
 blood for this is lack of vitamin in the 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:49.870
 body and is sure but it was then the
