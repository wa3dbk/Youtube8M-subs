00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
worry about trying to make look at the

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.999 
worry about trying to make look at the
six<00:02:06.450> goals<00:02:06.780> because<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.320> objective<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.860> to

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
six goals because the objective is to

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.160 
six goals because the objective is to
win<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.399> game<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:09.750> win<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.899> game<00:02:09.989> you

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
win the game and to win the game you

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.580 
win the game and to win the game you
need

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
need

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.970 
need
so<00:02:11.190> that's<00:02:11.640> basically<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:12.510> MIDI<00:02:13.410> so<00:02:13.620> guys<00:02:13.769> we

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
so that's basically a MIDI so guys we

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.460 
so that's basically a MIDI so guys we
did<00:02:14.099> actually<00:02:14.220> go<00:02:14.550> like<00:02:15.000> pretty<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.599> decent<00:02:16.290> and

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
did actually go like pretty a decent and

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.880 
did actually go like pretty a decent and
I<00:02:17.340> think<00:02:18.030> we<00:02:18.120> went<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:18.959> three<00:02:19.410> nail<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.800> then

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
I think we went of three nail and then

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.160 
I think we went of three nail and then
they<00:02:20.040> scored<00:02:20.340> they<00:02:21.000> score<00:02:21.300> one<00:02:21.540> here<00:02:21.870> which<00:02:22.019> is

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
they scored they score one here which is

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.619 
they scored they score one here which is
kind<00:02:22.349> of<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.940> it<00:02:23.940> just<00:02:24.090> kind<00:02:24.239> of<00:02:24.269> gets<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.510> bit

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
kind of and it just kind of gets a bit

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:25.729 
kind of and it just kind of gets a bit
lucky<00:02:24.870> cuz<00:02:25.050> keep<00:02:25.230> her<00:02:25.319> hands<00:02:25.470> up<00:02:25.530> on<00:02:25.650> the

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
lucky cuz keep her hands up on the

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.289 
lucky cuz keep her hands up on the
ground<00:02:25.950> because<00:02:26.250> it's<00:02:26.430> all<00:02:26.519> over<00:02:26.730> place<00:02:26.819> it's
