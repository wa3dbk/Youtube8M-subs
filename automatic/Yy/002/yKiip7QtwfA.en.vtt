00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.980
 Hello everyone, I'm John in the videos of 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.750
 today we will talk about what to do when a 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.450
 orchid in particular a phalenopsis 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.309
 fades there are different points of view 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.320
 on the cutting of the stem there is that 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.599
 prefers not to cut anything and 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.520
 leave the plant to decide what to do 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.080
 saying that nature no one will complain that 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.359
 no one starts cutting the stars 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.100
 flowery and those who prefer instead like me 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.949
 cut the stem as soon as it fades 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.810
 when an idea is healthy and vigorous it is not there 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.000
 a right or wrong thing to do is 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.009
 just a matter of taste one thing 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.020
 important to know is that surely 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.180
 a hostel must be cut when it is 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.250
 completely dry also because it is one 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.290
 stem completely dry does not produce 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.820
 then nothing made ally then there is 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.710
 even those who simply clean the 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.899
 matches that of the hostel as you go 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.270
 they dry personally I don't love so much 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.850
 the secondary branches because they really are 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.440
 few times I've seen beautiful 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.480
 flowers in secondary branches 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.149
 not that it is impossible, however, normally i 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.649
 flowers are a little bit smaller and 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.539
 then generally flowering in his 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.050
 complex never has a beautiful 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.899
 appearance 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.270
 today let's see how to cut the stem in 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.369
 next video but I'll show you what it can 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.770
 get out of the nudes and I'll show you 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.960
 then of the secondary branches and of the chi who 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.180
 however, I would like to cut it before cutting 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.100
 let you see a little what this node is 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.299
 what are these nudes then we have here 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.850
 the nudes 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.180
 here is the first node then we have the 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.390
 the second node is the third and is right by 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.850
 nudes that bring new stems ok than in 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.189
 many online articles recommend 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.740
 cut the stem over the second the 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.420
 third node, however, I don't really understand 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.340
 the reason why they suggest one 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.070
 something like that because so 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.040
 doing you lose the chance to have 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.170
 that those hostels in all other nodes 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.899
 that have the same potential as 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.920
 in fact the first three here we go up the 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.750
 first secondary hostel now in bloom 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.990
 a second secondary stem that is 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.229
 annoyed and I cut a third stem 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.790
 secondary and then up here continued 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.430
 flowering and let's say I cut 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.560
 right on the concave where before there was the 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.810
 flower is as simple as you can 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.170
 see distinguish where before there was a 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.870
 flower woman 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.440
 and needless to say that from where there were i 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.630
 flowers grow nothing if you don't want to 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.400
 cut to the base I recommend you 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.310
 cut under the first flower that 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.860
 flowered about an inch above 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.900
 the first useful way as I told you is 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.130
 a matter of taste if we talk about 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.870
 healthy orchids 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.239
 different is the case if instead we are 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.040
 talking about a suffering orchid in 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.050
 that case it would be better to cut it 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.630
 stem to allow the plant to 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.760
 focus on producing new ones 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.050
 roots and leaves but of this ne 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.090
 we'll talk in another video 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.430
 then as I told you I prefer 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.970
 cut the stem at the base and what 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.299
 we need is possibly a pair of scissors 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.250
 sterilized 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.620
 I sterilize it with alcohol and then there 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.690
 passed the flame above I would like to say though 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.299
 that these scissors that I have are not 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.790
 really ideal but small scissors 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:06.730
 from pruning I had broken and I broke it 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.590
 loyalty and garden shears are all 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.080
 too big and run the risk of 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.120
 ruin the plant in more I recommend 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.040
 once the cut is made 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.019
 put a bit of cinnamon on it 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.630
 simple cinnamon powder that yes 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.970
 finds great in supermarkets because 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.640
 cinnamon dad as much as it can 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.260
 its effect may be questionable 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.910
 antifungal is certainly useful to do 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.609
 dry the cut quickly 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:34.410
 let's proceed then, please be there 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:34.410
 be careful not to ruin the plant 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:44.230
 here then we can put a thread of 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.910
 cinnamon as I told you it is for 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.400
 let the cut dry quickly 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.079
 so be careful not to drop it 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.560
 in the roots 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:56.410
 I always try to be careful 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.480
 then you can clean the cotton buds 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.950
 Excess cinnamon I hope this 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.780
 video you enjoyed 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.250
 don't forget to comment on 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.350
 subscribe to the channel to stay 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.239
 updated and raise your thumb if 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.490
 you liked this video see you at 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.190
 next one 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.620
 many advise you of beautiful vases 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.360
 in glass like this here are the vases of 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.640
 glass like these are the real enemies 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.209
 of orchids not being equipped with 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.020
 all of which are similar to the bark 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.930
 allows good circulation 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:28.790
 air but the same time as 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.790
 we have said holds a lot of rain
