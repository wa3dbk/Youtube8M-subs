another quick update first thing as far
as<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:08.880> silver<00:00:09.300> price<00:00:09.660> as<00:00:10.550> long<00:00:11.550> as<00:00:11.670> it's

as the silver price as long as it's
relatively<00:00:12.420> not<00:00:12.929> doing<00:00:13.259> so<00:00:13.469> much<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:14.040> we're

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
relatively not doing so much and we're

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.790 
relatively not doing so much and we're
in<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.400> month<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:14.700> August<00:00:15.379> there<00:00:16.379> will<00:00:16.560> be<00:00:16.770> a

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
in the month of August there will be a

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.490 
in the month of August there will be a
little<00:00:17.250> less<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.670> an<00:00:17.940> eye<00:00:18.029> add<00:00:18.480> gold<00:00:18.930> right<00:00:19.320> now

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
little less of an eye add gold right now

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.429 
little less of an eye add gold right now
is<00:00:20.119> most<00:00:21.119> definitely<00:00:21.359> at<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.869> forefront

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
is most definitely at the forefront

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.560 
is most definitely at the forefront
right<00:00:22.890> now<00:00:23.189> now<00:00:23.939> what's<00:00:24.090> interesting<00:00:24.180> about

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
right now now what's interesting about

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.769 
right now now what's interesting about
this<00:00:24.840> trend<00:00:25.170> line<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:26.240> it<00:00:27.240> takes<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.510> while<00:00:27.720> for

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
this trend line is it takes a while for

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.839 
this trend line is it takes a while for
markets<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.470> heal<00:00:28.710> after<00:00:28.890> major<00:00:29.160> volatility

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
markets to heal after major volatility

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.269 
markets to heal after major volatility
which<00:00:30.000> occurred<00:00:30.660> in<00:00:30.810> here<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.320> that's

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
which occurred in here and that's

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.040 
which occurred in here and that's
exactly<00:00:32.520> what<00:00:32.880> happened<00:00:33.270> after<00:00:33.570> this<00:00:33.690> little

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
exactly what happened after this little

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.780 
exactly what happened after this little
period<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.270> managed<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.420> find<00:00:36.780> its<00:00:37.079> trend<00:00:37.440> and

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
period and managed to find its trend and

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.479 
period and managed to find its trend and
this<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:39.059> course<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.960> trend<00:00:40.170> line<00:00:40.489> by

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
this of course is the trend line by

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.030 
this of course is the trend line by
drawing<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:42.059> parallel<00:00:42.300> line<00:00:42.770> one<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.920> has<00:00:44.010> the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
drawing a parallel line one that has the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.290 
drawing a parallel line one that has the
exact<00:00:44.520> same<00:00:44.670> rate<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.660> ascent<00:00:46.879> which<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.120> not

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
exact same rate of ascent which is not

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.840 
exact same rate of ascent which is not
working<00:00:48.629> right<00:00:48.660> now<00:00:48.870> but<00:00:49.530> will<00:00:49.649> get<00:00:49.800> her<00:00:52.850> try

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
working right now but will get her try

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.490 
working right now but will get her try
it<00:00:53.910> again<00:00:56.390> close<00:00:57.390> enough<00:00:57.690> actually<00:00:58.379> that's

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
it again close enough actually that's

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.180 
it again close enough actually that's
really<00:00:58.710> good<00:00:59.539> you<00:01:00.539> can<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.170> put<00:01:01.770> one<00:01:01.920> trend

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
really good you can just a put one trend

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.149 
really good you can just a put one trend
line<00:01:02.370> here<00:01:03.170> that<00:01:04.170> connects<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:05.100> key<00:01:05.880> points

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
line here that connects the key points

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.219 
line here that connects the key points
so<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.189> think<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:09.330> would<00:01:09.479> be<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.869> mainland

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
so I think that would be the mainland

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.340 
so I think that would be the mainland
but<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.590> same<00:01:10.799> point<00:01:11.100> it's<00:01:11.250> mainly<00:01:11.580> been

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
but the same point it's mainly been

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.670 
but the same point it's mainly been
amongst<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.530> one<00:01:14.299> there<00:01:15.299> for<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.930> break<00:01:16.470> above

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
amongst this one there for a break above

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.249 
amongst this one there for a break above
this<00:01:16.890> trend<00:01:17.580> line<00:01:17.790> while<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.509> distance<00:01:19.080> from

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
this trend line while the distance from

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.950 
this trend line while the distance from
here<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.470> here<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.280> same<00:01:20.549> room<00:01:21.090> would<00:01:21.450> be<00:01:21.479> what

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
here to here the same room would be what

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.149 
here to here the same room would be what
I<00:01:21.990> would<00:01:22.080> be<00:01:22.229> looking<00:01:22.380> for<00:01:22.770> I'm<00:01:22.860> not<00:01:22.979> going<00:01:23.100> to

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
I would be looking for I'm not going to

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.170 
I would be looking for I'm not going to
draw<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:23.610> but<00:01:23.909> on<00:01:24.180> any<00:01:24.900> break<00:01:25.229> out<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.740> is

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
draw it in but on any break out that is

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.249 
draw it in but on any break out that is
something<00:01:27.180> I'd<00:01:27.330> be<00:01:27.420> looking<00:01:27.570> for<00:01:27.930> now<00:01:28.049> as<00:01:28.140> far

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
something I'd be looking for now as far

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.429 
something I'd be looking for now as far
as<00:01:28.320> these<00:01:28.500> Fibonacci<00:01:29.040> numbers<00:01:29.340> are<00:01:29.520> concerned

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
as these Fibonacci numbers are concerned

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:32.300 
as these Fibonacci numbers are concerned
they<00:01:31.439> represent<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.890> two<00:01:32.040> hundred<00:01:32.250> fifty

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
they represent the two hundred fifty

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.990 
they represent the two hundred fifty
dollar<00:01:32.640> low<00:01:32.939> from<00:01:33.360> well<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.799> last<00:01:34.979> many<00:01:35.729> many

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
dollar low from well the last many many

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.109 
dollar low from well the last many many
years<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:37.100> currently<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.520> one<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.820> set<00:01:39.000> up

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
years and currently this one is set up

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.210 
years and currently this one is set up
at<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:40.909> somewhat<00:01:41.909> relevant<00:01:42.780> number<00:01:43.350> because<00:01:44.100> it

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
at a somewhat relevant number because it

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.120 
at a somewhat relevant number because it
was<00:01:44.369> key<00:01:44.670> support<00:01:45.259> that<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.500> at<00:01:47.570> 530-6<00:01:49.130> the

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
was key support that is at 530-6 the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.160 
was key support that is at 530-6 the
same<00:01:50.280> 55<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:50.970> at<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.090> major<00:01:51.329> level<00:01:51.780> because

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
same 55 is at a major level because

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.420 
same 55 is at a major level because
that's<00:01:52.729> this<00:01:53.729> key<00:01:53.970> level<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.360> here<00:01:55.430> now

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
that's this key level in here now

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.569 
that's this key level in here now
generally<00:01:56.670> when<00:01:56.969> we<00:01:57.890> see<00:01:58.890> markets<00:01:59.219> go<00:01:59.340> higher

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
generally when we see markets go higher

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.399 
generally when we see markets go higher
these<00:01:59.850> levels

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
these levels

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.219 
these levels
just<00:02:02.100> set<00:02:02.280> seemed<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.820> match<00:02:02.999> with<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.359> the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
just set seemed to match with the the

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.929 
just set seemed to match with the the
big<00:02:04.439> big<00:02:04.649> levels<00:02:05.039> therefore<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.670> biggest

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
big big levels therefore the biggest

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.609 
big big levels therefore the biggest
level<00:02:06.210> here<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.359> 700<00:02:07.020> as<00:02:07.610> well<00:02:08.610> as<00:02:08.729> this<00:02:08.849> range

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
level here is 700 as well as this range

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.600 
level here is 700 as well as this range
so<00:02:10.619> for<00:02:10.830> this<00:02:10.920> number<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.730> move<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.150> 700<00:02:13.610> well

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
so for this number to move to 700 well

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.920 
so for this number to move to 700 well
that<00:02:14.790> would<00:02:14.910> mean<00:02:15.769> 3600<00:02:16.769> gold<00:02:17.599> for<00:02:18.599> this<00:02:18.720> line

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
that would mean 3600 gold for this line

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.119 
that would mean 3600 gold for this line
to<00:02:19.080> move<00:02:19.230> here<00:02:19.590> well<00:02:20.510> that<00:02:21.510> would<00:02:21.660> be<00:02:22.129> 10,000

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
to move here well that would be 10,000

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:27.740 
to move here well that would be 10,000
gold<00:02:24.560> now<00:02:25.560> that's<00:02:26.120> unrealistic<00:02:27.120> some<00:02:27.569> might

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
gold now that's unrealistic some might

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.360 
gold now that's unrealistic some might
say<00:02:27.989> and<00:02:28.170> some<00:02:28.560> would<00:02:28.709> say<00:02:28.890> it's<00:02:29.040> realistic

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
say and some would say it's realistic

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.190 
say and some would say it's realistic
now<00:02:29.640> if<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:29.819> does<00:02:30.000> go<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.209> 10,000<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.080> this

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
now if it does go to 10,000 and this

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.910 
now if it does go to 10,000 and this
number<00:02:31.440> goes<00:02:32.120> here<00:02:33.120> or<00:02:33.690> this<00:02:34.019> line<00:02:34.349> it<00:02:34.620> will<00:02:34.769> go

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
number goes here or this line it will go

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.710 
number goes here or this line it will go
up<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:36.150> level<00:02:36.329> of<00:02:37.190> 2453<00:02:38.329> so<00:02:39.329> if<00:02:39.450> anything

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
up to the level of 2453 so if anything

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.650 
up to the level of 2453 so if anything
around<00:02:40.379> the<00:02:40.530> 2,400<00:02:41.250> 2,500<00:02:41.340> mark<00:02:42.090> does<00:02:42.299> become

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
around the 2,400 2,500 mark does become

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.020 
around the 2,400 2,500 mark does become
significant<00:02:43.110> resistance<00:02:43.640> yeah<00:02:44.640> I'd<00:02:44.819> actually

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
significant resistance yeah I'd actually

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.630 
significant resistance yeah I'd actually
be<00:02:45.510> thinking<00:02:45.900> long<00:02:46.079> term<00:02:46.110> that<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:47.400> would<00:02:47.519> be

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
be thinking long term that that would be

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.250 
be thinking long term that that would be
an<00:02:47.730> area<00:02:48.090> we<00:02:48.269> would<00:02:48.450> be<00:02:48.569> going<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.989> but<00:02:49.140> that's

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
an area we would be going to but that's

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.680 
an area we would be going to but that's
not<00:02:49.379> the<00:02:49.470> only<00:02:49.530> Fibonacci<00:02:50.190> we<00:02:50.310> can<00:02:50.489> use<00:02:50.670> we<00:02:51.540> can

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
not the only Fibonacci we can use we can

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.880 
not the only Fibonacci we can use we can
now<00:02:51.810> use<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.019> Fibonacci<00:02:52.560> from<00:02:52.739> this

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
now use the Fibonacci from this

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.500 
now use the Fibonacci from this
significant<00:02:53.400> low<00:02:53.519> in<00:02:53.670> here<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.239> that's<00:02:54.359> what

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
significant low in here and that's what

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.069 
significant low in here and that's what
we'll<00:02:54.629> do<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.879> right<00:02:56.879> now<00:02:57.060> it's<00:02:57.420> set<00:02:57.629> up<00:02:57.690> that

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
we'll do and right now it's set up that

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.839 
we'll do and right now it's set up that
the<00:02:58.230> first<00:02:58.470> Fibonacci<00:02:59.010> levels<00:02:59.040> at<00:02:59.489> that<00:02:59.640> big

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
the first Fibonacci levels at that big

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.869 
the first Fibonacci levels at that big
1,000<00:03:00.540> barrier<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.129> this<00:03:02.129> mark<00:03:02.430> is<00:03:02.519> in<00:03:02.579> here

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
1,000 barrier and this mark is in here

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.140 
1,000 barrier and this mark is in here
and<00:03:03.060> above<00:03:03.420> fear<00:03:03.660> there<00:03:03.810> is<00:03:03.840> no<00:03:04.170> main<00:03:04.500> real

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
and above fear there is no main real

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.300 
and above fear there is no main real
significant<00:03:06.150> level<00:03:06.480> because<00:03:07.190> there<00:03:08.190> really

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
significant level because there really

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.610 
significant level because there really
hasn't<00:03:08.639> been<00:03:08.849> that<00:03:09.000> much<00:03:09.450> as<00:03:09.810> far<00:03:10.500> as

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
hasn't been that much as far as

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.650 
hasn't been that much as far as
correction<00:03:11.130> it's<00:03:11.280> always<00:03:11.549> been<00:03:11.790> one<00:03:12.480> to

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
correction it's always been one to

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.339 
correction it's always been one to
candle<00:03:13.200> bar<00:03:13.410> Corrections<00:03:15.019> but<00:03:16.019> what<00:03:16.200> this

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
candle bar Corrections but what this

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.670 
candle bar Corrections but what this
tells<00:03:16.620> me<00:03:16.769> is<00:03:16.919> if<00:03:17.220> it<00:03:17.340> really<00:03:17.519> gets<00:03:17.700> going<00:03:18.680> at

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
tells me is if it really gets going at

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.370 
tells me is if it really gets going at
least<00:03:20.239> this<00:03:21.239> is<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.780> area<00:03:21.959> I<00:03:22.169> would<00:03:22.230> expect

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
least this is the area I would expect

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.180 
least this is the area I would expect
this<00:03:22.950> level<00:03:23.609> to<00:03:23.790> go<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:24.200> as<00:03:25.200> an<00:03:25.560> area<00:03:25.829> where<00:03:26.010> it

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
this level to go to as an area where it

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.089 
this level to go to as an area where it
may<00:03:26.370> slow<00:03:26.579> down<00:03:26.700> but<00:03:27.060> there's<00:03:27.269> really<00:03:28.099> not

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
may slow down but there's really not

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.210 
may slow down but there's really not
much<00:03:29.310> saying<00:03:29.730> that<00:03:30.620> but<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.739> market<00:03:31.950> really

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
much saying that but the market really

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.159 
much saying that but the market really
has<00:03:32.489> to<00:03:32.700> slow<00:03:32.940> down<00:03:33.120> at<00:03:33.359> this<00:03:33.480> point<00:03:33.810> when<00:03:34.049> I'm

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
has to slow down at this point when I'm

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:36.620 
has to slow down at this point when I'm
looking<00:03:34.530> at<00:03:35.310> that<00:03:35.579> type<00:03:35.880> of<00:03:35.910> perspective

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
looking at that type of perspective

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.050 
looking at that type of perspective
right<00:03:36.810> now<00:03:37.019> and<00:03:37.579> because<00:03:38.579> of<00:03:38.669> the<00:03:38.760> break<00:03:38.940> of

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
right now and because of the break of

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.569 
right now and because of the break of
the<00:03:39.090> resistance<00:03:39.569> line<00:03:39.980> you<00:03:40.980> do<00:03:41.160> have<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:41.400> watch

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
the resistance line you do have to watch

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.900 
the resistance line you do have to watch
out<00:03:41.790> for<00:03:41.819> higher<00:03:42.120> volatility<00:03:42.690> and<00:03:43.790> thank<00:03:44.790> you

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
out for higher volatility and thank you

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.870 
out for higher volatility and thank you
for<00:03:45.060> watching<00:03:45.090> take<00:03:45.540> care<00:03:46.430> and<00:03:47.430> one<00:03:47.700> final

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
for watching take care and one final

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.370 
for watching take care and one final
point<00:03:48.269> to<00:03:48.480> go<00:03:48.599> over<00:03:48.810> i<00:03:48.840> was<00:03:48.989> watching<00:03:49.290> the

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
point to go over i was watching the

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.900 
point to go over i was watching the
video<00:03:49.620> again<00:03:49.859> and<00:03:50.099> when<00:03:50.370> i<00:03:50.400> was<00:03:50.489> talking<00:03:50.849> about

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
video again and when i was talking about

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.150 
video again and when i was talking about
gold<00:03:51.239> going<00:03:51.450> to<00:03:51.569> 10,000<00:03:52.319> because<00:03:52.620> this<00:03:52.829> number

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
gold going to 10,000 because this number

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.629 
gold going to 10,000 because this number
goes<00:03:53.190> here<00:03:53.790> actually<00:03:54.780> it's<00:03:55.019> gold<00:03:55.620> going<00:03:56.069> here

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
goes here actually it's gold going here

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:59.690 
goes here actually it's gold going here
the<00:03:56.790> thousand<00:03:57.269> that<00:03:57.389> is<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:58.010> therefore<00:03:59.010> gold

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
the thousand that is and therefore gold

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.640 
the thousand that is and therefore gold
at<00:03:59.849> 10,000<00:04:00.629> yeah<00:04:00.870> that<00:04:01.109> would<00:04:01.260> be<00:04:01.410> where<00:04:01.590> i

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
at 10,000 yeah that would be where i

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.849 
at 10,000 yeah that would be where i
would<00:04:01.769> expect<00:04:02.419> odd<00:04:03.419> that<00:04:03.750> that<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:04.379> happen<00:04:04.530> but

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
would expect odd that that to happen but

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.369 
would expect odd that that to happen but
if<00:04:05.280> this<00:04:05.609> line<00:04:05.879> does<00:04:06.329> happen<00:04:06.599> to<00:04:06.840> go<00:04:06.989> here

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
if this line does happen to go here

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:11.060 
if this line does happen to go here
we're<00:04:07.650> not<00:04:07.980> talking<00:04:08.519> 10,000<00:04:09.389> no<00:04:09.690> rather<00:04:10.139> it

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
we're not talking 10,000 no rather it

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.340 
we're not talking 10,000 no rather it
would<00:04:11.280> be<00:04:11.400> around<00:04:11.669> six<00:04:12.650> seven<00:04:13.650> thousand

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
would be around six seven thousand

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.440 
would be around six seven thousand
it's<00:04:14.980> very<00:04:15.190> difficult<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:15.790> same<00:04:15.970> people<00:04:16.150> ask

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
it's very difficult the same people ask

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.550 
it's very difficult the same people ask
me<00:04:16.510> all<00:04:16.600> the<00:04:16.750> time<00:04:16.780> what<00:04:17.140> they<00:04:17.230> think<00:04:17.470> the

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
me all the time what they think the

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.830 
me all the time what they think the
nominal<00:04:17.920> high<00:04:18.070> is<00:04:18.130> going<00:04:18.430> to<00:04:18.550> be<00:04:18.730> in<00:04:18.910> the

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
nominal high is going to be in the
