00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.160
 what's gouine on guys wake up decision 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.390
 no way now I know but a hole 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.740
 in English because that's good 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.290
 American voice so I'm a little fed up 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.000
 to speak French so now I 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.950
 do everything in English so it's 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.039
 so gone yes to easter orist a 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.210
 class this is the solo piano show you with 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.859
 class in houston evoked china agreement 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.320
 good so guys of the classes set up 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.119
 many people asked me for my 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.099
 classes and then good here's after a 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.849
 week of play I think I have the right 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.470
 classes h 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.690
 this is not definitive classes 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.489
 we will say but I play with three 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.750
 different classes and I think they 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.450
 are pretty cool so I'll go to them 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.070
 show right away then the first 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.710
 the one I play the most 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.390
 often really the games begin 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.670
 to play that's the one we're going to say so 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.870
 fight knife first ok so that 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.620
 it's the classic thing 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.239
 then the gun the rw 1 at the beginning i with 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.640
 the atlas but I was told do a cartel 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.809
 told me it was better to lift the r 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.239
 1 he had a little more lunch 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.680
 important even though in the end I did not know 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.629
 really the impression at the level of 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.159
 stats but yes good apparently here 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.600
 everyone says that lunch is over 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.330
 important on that one so I you 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.990
 advise this gun to have the 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.360
 tactical knife underneath it must be done 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.880
 it seems to me that we have to say in 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.250
 these quads ya cat not 10 h 10 quines 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.439
 without aiming it must be said that they are 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.420
 targeted and I swear it's 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:26.340
 unbearable to do but but hey 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.799
 it's also not death when 3 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.110
 game we can do it so so at the 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.350
 jutice gun then assets including weights 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.900
 feather overhead that actually allows you 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.369
 to increase the duration of exo skills 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.579
 and stunned the enemies as their fall 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.810
 above after a powered jump that I 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.520
 discovered today one that could 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.680
 kill an enemy by jumping on it 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.329
 so here is featherweight and overload 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.189
 like that my exo lasts longer 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.450
 we both hands is 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.369
 obviously it's a bit boring because 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.560
 it is unlocked limo 43 so bah you 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.890
 are going to need to go to the top 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.480
 prestige almost to unlock it at 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.830
 all three stealthy impulse that's a 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.510
 an asset that I really keep all the 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.770
 time so you do not appear on the 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.570
 mini map when you use the 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.550
 movements of your exo and saw that ben 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.310
 I'm constantly moving with this thing 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.870
 this is really an asset that I 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.350
 keep it all the time just all the time 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.520
 and then robustness 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.330
 it's quite particular there is no 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.650
 a lot of leicester who was playing 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.420
 robustness but I noticed with 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.610
 Spain drones I'm going to go back is 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.870
 a lot better when I have toughness than 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.370
 when I'm not, that's when 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.750
 an enemy is shooting at me so here you are 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.930
 leap - when hit 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.550
 it's like the previous code and I 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.890
 I find that face to face shot 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.990
 sometimes it's sum me we 're not running speed run 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.000
 to leave six kilometers above the guy 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.340
 who will leave on him most of the 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.690
 time so I find it pretty cool in 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.580
 exodus skills so I put exo 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.380
 overclocking so here's to speed up 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.970
 my idea was scared we are light we are 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.500
 ninjas the purpose of this year more 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.450
 end as soon as possible 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.670
 so here I am here and well 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.900
 obviously spain drunk and then 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.190
 in series of points I mix with the drones 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.840
 that I'm improving because yes actually 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.850
 you can improve your words 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.290
 different strict scores so you 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.970
 zap on y is so there you you 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.590
 can improve it so me what I 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.640
 put those speeds so that he has they 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.200
 go faster so accelerates 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.330
 updating positions on the 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.300
 mini case then i'm going to detect 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.459
 threats which is a kind of oracle 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.950
 Swedish tired and the oracle of call of 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.420
 duty ghost and supports that allows you 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.040
 so you keep the accumulated points 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.870
 for this bonus he makes you kill so 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.090
 that's just in support 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.130
 that is, you can die and you 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.270
 will finally crack how do you say 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.280
 will still build your thing for 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.420
 to have the drone so here it is I 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.739
 find it cool to have it in support 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.630
 so I really put it all the time 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.860
 the time these three so that's it 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.620
 my basic class basically I play 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.230
 really all the time with that one 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.800
 after in second there is only one thing that 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.780
 exchange 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.280
 there is only one thing that changes is that 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.680
 I put the bulletproof vest 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.780
 instead of overload so here is my 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.950
 exo takes a little less time but 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.680
 I have the ball ideas I'm using 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.600
 really like that when I play in 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.640
 advantage or momentum if you have the 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.770
 day English because so that's the 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.480
 hafid mode 1 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.090
 if you do not know it's really the 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.320
 hafid word on this game by the way 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.910
 fear that it will be considered as 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.040
 demolition soon because spain 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.440
 are ready is threatened broke but for 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.840
 the moment is a little the mode 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.480
 hafid and that's right there is a number 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.489
 grenades in pictures is enough 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.920
 unbearable where I ended up putting the 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.060
 bulletproof vest and it's a little bit more 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.350
 playable we will say that there are lobbies 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.120
 or it's just unplayable so I feel the 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.600
 bullet proof vest other than that nothing 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.850
 exchange 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.920
 and third class so basically in 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.440
 third class at the asset level on 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.260
 will say that nothing changes 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.820
 except that I do not have I do not have 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.390
 double asset ie I do not have the 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.730
 overload 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.620
 already because I have no place and 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.970
 also because I have no exo 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.210
 skills that is to say that I removed 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.070
 the exo overclocking to put a 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.320
 stand that must be put the joker 3 which 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.750
 explodes hours that allows you to have 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.830
 an exo launcher in addition so in fact this 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.020
 that I put these I'm going to put a stone 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.310
 and after I'm going to have my two spade 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.350
 finally reborn the rest is still 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.790
 same at the asset level and that's it I 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.250
 put ashton after it's true that in the 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.590
 game the stone is not very is not 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.470
 very useful alone in less I find that 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.030
 sar almost to nothing even the enemies are 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.580
 not this theme very long they had 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.590
 his father really let go no more times 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.820
 here I use them at the beginning and I 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.950
 did realize that he was very 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.210
 rarely alone so I do not use 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.890
 often but I think it can be 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.420
 a good class to let him lead 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.890
 for example if you are doing a baccalaureate or 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.060
 something like that but it's true 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.020
 I do not use too much I come back like 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.420
 show you some sequences 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.370
 precisely with this class and with 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.750
 those will show both where they 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.070
 are unprepared there is just an asset 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.300
 which changes I would have liked you 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.410
 shows sequences but hey you tell me 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.000
 know one who has followed me since 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.310
 for a long time it's even more the brothel 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.230
 in my pc i shoot with 20 giga of 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.750
 free while my hard drive does 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:45.210
 still interesting so specify 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.470
 yeah I think I have sequences to 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.240
 show you according to each 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.890
 class ie with the exo on 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.140
 40 know what I'm going to do the most 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.740
 often I mean I'm good 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.020
 match the rocks without the activated 1 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.340
 normal and I'm going to do intimate even 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.690
 two if I'm lucky having there's 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.849
 way to make two and the latifying age 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.770
 right now to try to go spawn 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:05.660
 that he really knows if you activate it at 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.759
 good time it can really give you 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.830
 clips you allow yourself to do 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:11.479
 cool things so that's it 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.310
 especially that I rarely active 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:15.680
 like that alone it happens to me sometimes 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.669
 a reflex but the best to do I 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.130
 think guys it's really about doing 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:20.660
 first kill or that they are there 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.130
 stuck guys and activate the thing 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.630
 to try right away as soon as on 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.569
 the spawn and to have the ball the third 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:29.180
 is where the fourth so so here is in 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:30.139
 big I think it will be everything and if not 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.849
 what I wanted to tell you is that 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:35.030
 this week I'm going to post you at 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:37.490
 cleat of videos ie full of 2 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.930
 condense enneifer prestige 1 rather than 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.970
 condensed own eyes for prestige 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.020
 yes but at the end of the week it will be that 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.009
 condensed because there as we 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.099
 could see it I stopped 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:47.240
 level 50 of the second prestige because 

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:48.650
 I had a little desire to play alarm 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.509
 I had not tested the weapons of 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.310
 for two prime prestige because 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:54.169
 I write that the knife I have everything rises 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.000
 with a knife we never signed touching 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:57.770
 saiper nor a single army it's true that 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.360
 to do the killcam op it was a little 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.860
 complicated had not often 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.810
 advance so here I was taking tears 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.360
 why not we are a little bit more 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.949
 and so here I am in the end I stayed 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.210
 level 50 I play alarm but I 

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:09.830
 will continue the nay high prestige when 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.940
 I will have decided to pass the prestige 3 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.039
 for example 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.110

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:18.320
