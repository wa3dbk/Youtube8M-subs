hi<00:00:00.480> this<00:00:00.539> is<00:00:00.719> Derek<00:00:01.110> with<00:00:01.199> mobile<00:00:01.560> nations<00:00:01.920> we

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
hi this is Derek with mobile nations we

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.059 
hi this is Derek with mobile nations we
are<00:00:02.159> at<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:02.580> Corning<00:00:03.000> booth<00:00:03.179> at<00:00:03.389> CES<00:00:03.629> 2013<00:00:04.350> I

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
are at the Corning booth at CES 2013 I

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.330 
are at the Corning booth at CES 2013 I
am<00:00:05.580> here<00:00:05.879> at<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.150> gorilla<00:00:07.109> glass<00:00:07.350> display<00:00:08.069> and

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
am here at the gorilla glass display and

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.450 
am here at the gorilla glass display and
I'm<00:00:08.580> talking<00:00:08.940> to<00:00:09.240> Jim<00:00:09.780> neck<00:00:10.010> with<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.099> Corning

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
I'm talking to Jim neck with the Corning

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.039 
I'm talking to Jim neck with the Corning
and<00:00:11.519> he's<00:00:11.670> going<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:11.910> show<00:00:12.059> us<00:00:12.240> everything

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
and he's going to show us everything

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.900 
and he's going to show us everything
cool<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:13.769> fancy<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.160> knew<00:00:14.340> about<00:00:14.460> Gorilla

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
cool and fancy and knew about Gorilla

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.290 
cool and fancy and knew about Gorilla
Glass<00:00:15.089> 3<00:00:15.440> okay<00:00:16.440> so<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.490> advantage<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:18.000> Gorilla

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
Glass 3 okay so the advantage of Gorilla

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.689 
Glass 3 okay so the advantage of Gorilla
Glass<00:00:18.630> 3<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:19.199> that<00:00:19.410> we've<00:00:19.560> been<00:00:19.740> implemented

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
Glass 3 is that we've been implemented

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.599 
Glass 3 is that we've been implemented
native<00:00:21.539> damage<00:00:22.170> or<00:00:22.320> resistance<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:23.160> means

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
native damage or resistance I means

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.570 
native damage or resistance I means
we've<00:00:23.820> changed<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.660> molecular<00:00:25.580> atomic

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
we've changed the molecular atomic

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.060 
we've changed the molecular atomic
structure<00:00:27.300> we've<00:00:27.660> changed<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.619> way<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:28.949> the

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
structure we've changed the way that the

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.070 
structure we've changed the way that the
binding<00:00:29.490> occurs<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.480> means<00:00:30.779> that

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
binding occurs and that means that

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.990 
binding occurs and that means that
there's<00:00:31.289> less<00:00:31.529> damage<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.309> occurs<00:00:32.640> we've

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
there's less damage that occurs we've

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.459 
there's less damage that occurs we've
eliminated<00:00:33.270> what's<00:00:33.899> called<00:00:34.140> lateral

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
eliminated what's called lateral

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.250 
eliminated what's called lateral
cracking<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.910> means<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.420> get<00:00:36.600> less

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
cracking that means that you get less

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.049 
cracking that means that you get less
splintering<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.190> glass<00:00:38.460> as<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.730> part<00:00:39.000> of

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
splintering of the glass as a part of

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.780 
splintering of the glass as a part of
this<00:00:39.210> okay<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:40.079> if<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.290> look<00:00:40.320> here<00:00:40.770> we've<00:00:41.489> got

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
this okay so if you look here we've got

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.290 
this okay so if you look here we've got
three<00:00:42.570> different<00:00:42.750> forces<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.980> we've<00:00:44.160> used<00:00:44.399> we

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
three different forces and we've used we

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.799 
three different forces and we've used we
use<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> diamond<00:00:45.899> stylus<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:47.219> drag<00:00:47.550> across<00:00:47.809> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
use a diamond stylus to drag across the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.889 
use a diamond stylus to drag across the
glass<00:00:49.079> at<00:00:49.350> certain<00:00:49.770> points<00:00:50.539> there<00:00:51.539> are<00:00:51.660> two

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
glass at certain points there are two

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.100 
glass at certain points there are two
competitive<00:00:52.500> glasses<00:00:53.070> Gorilla<00:00:54.059> Glass<00:00:54.300> 2<00:00:54.570> and

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
competitive glasses Gorilla Glass 2 and

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.880 
competitive glasses Gorilla Glass 2 and
then<00:00:55.379> Gorilla<00:00:55.649> Glass

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
then Gorilla Glass

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.860 
then Gorilla Glass
what<00:00:57.400> you'll<00:00:57.580> notice<00:00:57.850> is<00:00:58.360> that<00:00:58.420> on<00:00:58.720> the

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
what you'll notice is that on the

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.770 
what you'll notice is that on the
gorilla<00:00:59.080> glass<00:00:59.230> on<00:00:59.680> the<00:00:59.980> competitive<00:01:00.780> samples

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
gorilla glass on the competitive samples

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.310 
gorilla glass on the competitive samples
both<00:01:02.410> of<00:01:02.620> them<00:01:02.770> have<00:01:02.980> obvious<00:01:03.870> scratches<00:01:04.870> at

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
both of them have obvious scratches at

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.460 
both of them have obvious scratches at
the<00:01:05.590> lowest<00:01:05.980> level<00:01:06.400> rule<00:01:07.060> of<00:01:07.210> glass<00:01:07.450> to<00:01:07.840> does

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
the lowest level rule of glass to does

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.010 
the lowest level rule of glass to does
and<00:01:09.220> obviously<00:01:09.790> Gorilla<00:01:10.090> Glass<00:01:10.360> 3<00:01:10.420> person

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
and obviously Gorilla Glass 3 person

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.680 
and obviously Gorilla Glass 3 person
either<00:01:11.400> however<00:01:12.400> when<00:01:12.790> we<00:01:12.910> go<00:01:13.060> to<00:01:13.120> the<00:01:13.390> next

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
either however when we go to the next

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:14.460 
either however when we go to the next
level

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
level

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.680 
level
7<00:01:16.440> again<00:01:17.440> the<00:01:17.770> two<00:01:18.010> competitive<00:01:18.880> glasses<00:01:19.479> have

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
7 again the two competitive glasses have

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.190 
7 again the two competitive glasses have
scratches<00:01:20.050> the<00:01:20.979> Gorilla<00:01:21.760> Glass<00:01:22.000> 2<00:01:22.060> starts<00:01:23.050> to

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
scratches the Gorilla Glass 2 starts to

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.860 
scratches the Gorilla Glass 2 starts to
show<00:01:23.380> a<00:01:23.410> scratch<00:01:23.830> as<00:01:24.070> well<00:01:24.310> however<00:01:25.090> we<00:01:25.750> don't

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
show a scratch as well however we don't

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.380 
show a scratch as well however we don't
see<00:01:26.200> it<00:01:26.350> in<00:01:26.620> the<00:01:26.860> Gorilla<00:01:27.130> Glass<00:01:27.400> 3<00:01:27.460> that's<00:01:28.150> at

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
see it in the Gorilla Glass 3 that's at

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.920 
see it in the Gorilla Glass 3 that's at
70<00:01:28.780> and<00:01:29.170> that's<00:01:29.650> at<00:01:29.830> 7<00:01:30.160> degrees<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:31.479> the<00:01:31.720> same

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
70 and that's at 7 degrees and the same

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.180 
70 and that's at 7 degrees and the same
thing<00:01:32.170> that<00:01:32.350> occurs<00:01:32.710> at<00:01:33.430> 11<00:01:34.390> you<00:01:34.720> start<00:01:35.110> to<00:01:35.259> see

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
thing that occurs at 11 you start to see

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.730 
thing that occurs at 11 you start to see
some<00:01:36.220> level<00:01:36.820> of<00:01:36.880> scratch<00:01:37.180> control<00:01:37.750> and<00:01:38.380> then

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
some level of scratch control and then

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.380 
some level of scratch control and then
again<00:01:39.070> this<00:01:39.310> is<00:01:39.490> because<00:01:39.670> of<00:01:39.970> the<00:01:40.060> way<00:01:40.180> we've

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
again this is because of the way we've

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.359 
again this is because of the way we've
changed<00:01:40.660> the<00:01:40.869> atomic<00:01:41.380> structure<00:01:41.920> of<00:01:42.100> the

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
changed the atomic structure of the

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.710 
changed the atomic structure of the
glass<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:44.490> minimizes<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.790> damage<00:01:46.210> that

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
glass it minimizes the damage that

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.040 
glass it minimizes the damage that
occurs<00:01:47.110> to<00:01:47.140> the<00:01:47.560> glass<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:49.149> it<00:01:49.630> makes<00:01:49.810> those

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
occurs to the glass and it makes those

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.999 
occurs to the glass and it makes those
damages<00:01:50.830> the<00:01:51.070> scratches<00:01:51.640> less<00:01:52.000> visible<00:01:52.660> and

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
damages the scratches less visible and

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.670 
damages the scratches less visible and
finally<00:01:54.009> when<00:01:54.729> you<00:01:54.910> drop<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.509> device<00:01:55.990> after

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
finally when you drop the device after

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.469 
finally when you drop the device after
you've<00:01:56.800> got<00:01:56.979> a<00:01:57.009> scratch<00:01:57.460> it's<00:01:57.910> less<00:01:58.149> prone<00:01:58.450> to

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
you've got a scratch it's less prone to

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:59.820 
you've got a scratch it's less prone to
fracture<00:01:58.960> as<00:01:59.290> well

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
fracture as well

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.670 
fracture as well
now<00:02:00.700> what<00:02:00.909> Lisa<00:02:01.330> is<00:02:01.540> going<00:02:01.960> to<00:02:02.080> do<00:02:02.260> is<00:02:02.500> she's

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
now what Lisa is going to do is she's

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.370 
now what Lisa is going to do is she's
going<00:02:02.710> to<00:02:02.950> go<00:02:03.070> through<00:02:03.310> a<00:02:03.340> demonstration<00:02:04.380> and

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
going to go through a demonstration and

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.380 
going to go through a demonstration and
Lisa<00:02:05.620> why<00:02:05.890> don't<00:02:06.370> you<00:02:06.580> talk<00:02:06.760> to<00:02:09.269> classes<00:02:10.269> that

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390

we're at a 10 degree incline and you can

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.630 
we're at a 10 degree incline and you can
see<00:02:47.510> most<00:02:48.020> the<00:02:48.230> furniture<00:02:48.620> has<00:02:48.800> radiated<00:02:49.430> from

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
the glass survived that it did okay but

we<00:03:13.200> don't<00:03:13.230> stop<00:03:13.439> it<00:03:13.560> okay<00:03:15.019> we're<00:03:16.019> gonna<00:03:16.170> raise

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
we don't stop it okay we're gonna raise

it up you're going to raise the incline
three<00:03:19.079> times<00:03:19.319> just<00:03:19.500> therefore<00:03:20.400> you're

three times just therefore you're

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.220 
three times just therefore you're

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
much of an impact that's we're actually

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.360 
much of an impact that's we're actually
going<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.519> be<00:03:47.639> hitting<00:03:47.849> plus<00:03:48.180> all<00:03:49.019> right<00:03:49.370> so

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
going to be hitting plus all right so
