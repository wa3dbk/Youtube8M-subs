large<00:01:00.230> curved<00:01:00.949> claws<00:01:01.430> this<00:01:02.030> is<00:01:02.210> really

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
large curved claws this is really

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.270 
large curved claws this is really
important<00:01:03.050> now<00:01:03.140> remember<00:01:03.559> these<00:01:03.710> animals<00:01:04.160> can

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
important now remember these animals can

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.510 
important now remember these animals can
weigh<00:01:04.489> over<00:01:04.520> 35<00:01:05.510> pounds<00:01:06.110> that's<00:01:06.260> huge<00:01:06.650> so<00:01:07.280> just

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
weigh over 35 pounds that's huge so just

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.980 
weigh over 35 pounds that's huge so just
imagine<00:01:07.790> what<00:01:08.119> it<00:01:08.240> takes<00:01:08.479> to<00:01:08.630> get<00:01:08.810> themselves

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
imagine what it takes to get themselves

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.980 
imagine what it takes to get themselves
up<00:01:09.380> a<00:01:09.500> tree<00:01:09.710> like<00:01:09.920> this<00:01:10.130> so<00:01:10.940> those<00:01:11.180> spikes<00:01:11.570> dig

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
up a tree like this so those spikes dig

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.460 
up a tree like this so those spikes dig
right<00:01:12.229> in<00:01:12.500> and<00:01:13.040> give<00:01:13.250> them<00:01:13.430> an<00:01:13.580> excellent<00:01:14.090> hole

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
right in and give them an excellent hole

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.080 
right in and give them an excellent hole
this<00:01:15.470> way<00:01:15.680> they<00:01:15.860> can<00:01:16.040> actually<00:01:16.220> latch<00:01:16.790> right

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
this way they can actually latch right

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.060 
this way they can actually latch right
on<00:01:17.300> to<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:17.570> tree<00:01:17.840> just<00:01:18.110> like<00:01:18.259> he's<00:01:18.410> doing<00:01:18.560> here

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
on to the tree just like he's doing here

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.670 
on to the tree just like he's doing here
and<00:01:19.160> then<00:01:19.640> shimmy<00:01:20.119> right<00:01:20.149> up<00:01:20.530> so<00:01:21.530> this

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
and then shimmy right up so this

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.499 
and then shimmy right up so this
technique<00:01:22.160> not<00:01:22.460> only<00:01:22.729> helps<00:01:23.000> them<00:01:23.149> if<00:01:23.330> there's

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
technique not only helps them if there's

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:24.940 
technique not only helps them if there's
a<00:01:23.600> problem<00:01:23.869> on<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:24.259> ground<00:01:24.530> where<00:01:24.740> they<00:01:24.830> can

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
a problem on the ground where they can

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.040 
a problem on the ground where they can
get<00:01:25.070> up<00:01:25.220> into<00:01:25.430> the<00:01:25.580> tree<00:01:25.880> but<00:01:26.450> it<00:01:26.540> also<00:01:26.660> gives

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
get up into the tree but it also gives

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.200 
get up into the tree but it also gives
me<00:01:27.110> access<00:01:27.290> to<00:01:27.649> all<00:01:27.830> this<00:01:28.040> other<00:01:28.250> food<00:01:28.580> so<00:01:28.970> even

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
me access to all this other food so even

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.520 
me access to all this other food so even
the<00:01:29.300> middle<00:01:29.539> of<00:01:29.660> winter<00:01:29.840> when<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:30.259> snow<00:01:30.500> is

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
the middle of winter when the snow is

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.889 
the middle of winter when the snow is
real<00:01:30.800> deep<00:01:31.039> they<00:01:31.550> just<00:01:31.820> climb<00:01:32.119> on<00:01:32.149> up<00:01:32.360> and<00:01:32.750> get

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
real deep they just climb on up and get

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:34.359 
real deep they just climb on up and get
to<00:01:33.020> their<00:01:33.170> food<00:01:33.350> with<00:01:33.590> no<00:01:33.619> problem<00:01:34.130> whatsoever

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
to their food with no problem whatsoever

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.520 
to their food with no problem whatsoever
and<00:01:34.880> one<00:01:35.570> thing's<00:01:35.810> for<00:01:35.930> sure

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
and one thing's for sure

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.770 
and one thing's for sure
porcupines<00:01:37.160> like<00:01:37.430> to<00:01:37.580> eat<00:01:37.789> I<00:01:38.060> can<00:01:38.509> kind<00:01:38.720> of

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
porcupines like to eat I can kind of

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.370 
porcupines like to eat I can kind of
relate<00:01:39.020> to<00:01:39.080> that

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
relate to that

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.380 
relate to that
they're<00:01:40.250> certainly<00:01:40.520> adorable<00:01:41.270> little

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
they're certainly adorable little

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.850 
they're certainly adorable little
critters<00:01:41.840> but<00:01:42.050> you<00:01:42.200> wouldn't<00:01:42.500> want<00:01:42.530> to<00:01:42.679> give<00:01:42.830> a

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
critters but you wouldn't want to give a

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.130 
critters but you wouldn't want to give a
hug<00:01:43.100> to<00:01:43.250> a<00:01:43.280> porcupine<00:01:43.670> you<00:01:44.390> can<00:01:44.539> place<00:01:44.780> that<00:01:44.810> in

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
hug to a porcupine you can place that in

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.350 
hug to a porcupine you can place that in
the<00:01:45.229> bad<00:01:45.560> idea<00:01:46.039> category<00:01:46.759> if<00:01:46.910> you<00:01:47.060> know<00:01:47.179> what<00:01:47.300> I

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
the bad idea category if you know what I

00:01:47.360 --> 00:02:09.359 
the bad idea category if you know what I
mean

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.740 

most<00:02:10.369> of<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:10.670> year<00:02:10.849> porcupines<00:02:11.480> are<00:02:11.599> very

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
most of the year porcupines are very

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.920 
most of the year porcupines are very
hard<00:02:11.989> to<00:02:12.050> spot<00:02:13.150> usually<00:02:14.150> there's<00:02:14.420> leaves<00:02:14.630> on

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
hard to spot usually there's leaves on

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.990 
hard to spot usually there's leaves on
the<00:02:15.050> trees<00:02:15.349> and<00:02:15.650> this<00:02:16.069> brush<00:02:16.340> on<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.730> ground

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
the trees and this brush on the ground

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.180 
the trees and this brush on the ground
so<00:02:17.930> even<00:02:18.230> though<00:02:18.349> they're<00:02:18.530> large<00:02:18.800> they're

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
so even though they're large they're

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.490 
so even though they're large they're
often<00:02:19.790> unnoticed<00:02:22.720> they<00:02:23.720> don't<00:02:23.930> get<00:02:24.080> a<00:02:24.110> lot<00:02:24.200> of

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
often unnoticed they don't get a lot of

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.380 
often unnoticed they don't get a lot of
energy<00:02:24.890> from<00:02:25.099> the<00:02:25.280> types<00:02:25.550> of<00:02:25.760> food<00:02:26.030> that<00:02:26.239> they

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
energy from the types of food that they

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.479 
energy from the types of food that they
eat<00:02:26.599> so<00:02:26.900> they<00:02:27.019> eat<00:02:27.110> a<00:02:27.140> lot<00:02:27.260> of<00:02:27.650> it<00:02:27.800> that's<00:02:28.220> the

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
eat so they eat a lot of it that's the

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.670 
eat so they eat a lot of it that's the
exact<00:02:28.910> same<00:02:29.120> excuse<00:02:29.660> that<00:02:29.840> I<00:02:29.959> use<00:02:30.230> on<00:02:30.440> many

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
exact same excuse that I use on many

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.520 
exact same excuse that I use on many
occasions<00:02:31.450> now<00:02:32.450> they<00:02:32.690> don't<00:02:32.870> have<00:02:33.110> a<00:02:33.140> lot<00:02:33.380> of

occasions now they don't have a lot of

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.520 
occasions now they don't have a lot of

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
small tiny branches but the truth is

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.469 
small tiny branches but the truth is
they<00:04:28.160> can<00:04:28.190> do<00:04:28.430> exactly<00:04:28.910> that

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
actually take cute little power naps

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.879 
actually take cute little power naps
like<00:04:33.889> this<00:04:34.130> when<00:04:34.310> they<00:04:34.430> need<00:04:34.610> to<00:04:34.840> our

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
like this when they need to our

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
so what does a well-rested porcupine

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.869 
so what does a well-rested porcupine
look<00:04:50.289> for<00:04:50.559> well<00:04:51.339> breakfast<00:04:52.059> of<00:04:52.239> course<00:04:53.759> it<00:04:54.759> was

look for well breakfast of course it was

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:56.309 
look for well breakfast of course it was
really<00:04:55.300> interesting<00:04:55.809> seeing<00:04:56.080> this

00:04:58.229 --> 00:04:58.239 
particular porcupine up in this pine

00:04:58.239 --> 00:05:00.540 
particular porcupine up in this pine
tree<00:04:58.349> the<00:04:59.349> quills<00:04:59.679> of<00:04:59.919> the<00:04:59.979> porcupine

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
tree the quills of the porcupine

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.549 
tree the quills of the porcupine
actually<00:05:01.119> looked<00:05:01.330> just<00:05:01.629> like<00:05:01.719> the<00:05:01.989> needles<00:05:02.349> on

00:05:02.549 --> 00:05:02.559 
actually looked just like the needles on

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:04.350 
actually looked just like the needles on
the<00:05:02.679> visor<00:05:02.860> I<00:05:03.069> wondered<00:05:03.550> if<00:05:03.669> maybe<00:05:03.939> he<00:05:04.209> knew

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
the visor I wondered if maybe he knew

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.739 
the visor I wondered if maybe he knew
that<00:05:05.189> once<00:05:06.189> he<00:05:06.339> finishes<00:05:06.669> his<00:05:06.849> meal<00:05:06.909> he

00:05:07.739 --> 00:05:07.749 
that once he finishes his meal he

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:10.019 
that once he finishes his meal he
decided<00:05:08.110> to<00:05:08.289> head<00:05:08.469> down<00:05:08.679> the<00:05:08.860> tree<00:05:09.099> now<00:05:09.699> look

00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:10.029 
decided to head down the tree now look

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:12.809 
decided to head down the tree now look
at<00:05:10.209> this<00:05:10.419> watch<00:05:11.050> his<00:05:11.349> tail<00:05:11.679> being<00:05:12.219> used<00:05:12.459> almost

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:12.819 
at this watch his tail being used almost

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:15.839 
at this watch his tail being used almost
like<00:05:13.029> another<00:05:13.389> hand<00:05:14.159> he<00:05:15.159> can't<00:05:15.429> see<00:05:15.639> what's

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
like another hand he can't see what's

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:17.790 
like another hand he can't see what's
going<00:05:16.179> on<00:05:16.300> directly<00:05:16.779> underneath<00:05:17.139> them<00:05:17.469> but<00:05:17.709> he

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
going on directly underneath them but he

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.559 
going on directly underneath them but he
can<00:05:17.979> feel<00:05:18.279> his<00:05:18.489> way<00:05:18.639> and<00:05:18.789> he<00:05:18.879> does<00:05:19.089> exactly

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:19.569 
can feel his way and he does exactly

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:24.959 
can feel his way and he does exactly
that<00:05:19.839> with<00:05:20.319> his<00:05:20.469> two<00:05:23.369> most<00:05:24.369> of<00:05:24.610> the<00:05:24.789> real

00:05:29.609 --> 00:05:29.619 
their lower back and tail itself so he

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:31.529 
their lower back and tail itself so he
does<00:05:29.829> have<00:05:30.039> the<00:05:30.189> ability<00:05:30.279> to<00:05:30.610> swatch<00:05:31.029> away<00:05:31.360> but

and add to the spectrum of biodiversity

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.309 
and add to the spectrum of biodiversity
we<00:05:57.339> can<00:05:57.519> find
