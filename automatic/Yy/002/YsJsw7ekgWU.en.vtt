really like I've had to enter them in
the<00:02:17.400> end<00:02:17.519> because<00:02:17.670> Ethan's<00:02:18.120> been<00:02:18.300> doing<00:02:18.599> the

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
the end because Ethan's been doing the

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.589 
the end because Ethan's been doing the
scripting<00:02:19.440> challenges<00:02:19.920> yeah<00:02:20.190> but<00:02:20.670> like<00:02:20.819> I've

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
scripting challenges yeah but like I've

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.350 
scripting challenges yeah but like I've
trying<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:21.989> be<00:02:22.220> make<00:02:23.220> them<00:02:23.370> simplistic<00:02:23.970> but

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
trying to be make them simplistic but

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.120 
trying to be make them simplistic but
also<00:02:24.510> look<00:02:24.780> quite<00:02:24.959> nice<00:02:25.110> but<00:02:25.590> how<00:02:25.830> do<00:02:25.890> they

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
also look quite nice but how do they

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.850 
also look quite nice but how do they
choose<00:02:26.370> winners<00:02:26.640> I<00:02:27.110> think<00:02:28.110> I'm<00:02:28.500> not<00:02:28.739> actually

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
choose winners I think I'm not actually

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.250 
choose winners I think I'm not actually
sure<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:29.400> think<00:02:29.819> you<00:02:29.880> do<00:02:30.060> get<00:02:30.269> extra<00:02:30.720> credit<00:02:31.080> for

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
sure I think you do get extra credit for

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.350 
sure I think you do get extra credit for
being<00:02:31.650> first<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.700> first<00:02:32.940> person<00:02:33.269> the

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
being first the first person the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.360 
being first the first person the
competition<00:02:33.900> isn't<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.530> difficult<00:02:35.010> at<00:02:35.310> the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
competition isn't that difficult at the

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.710 
competition isn't that difficult at the

if<00:03:09.720> it<00:03:09.780> looks<00:03:09.989> easy<00:03:10.139> outside<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.829> building<00:03:11.220> is

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
if it looks easy outside the building is

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.800 
if it looks easy outside the building is
quite<00:03:11.639> easy<00:03:11.670> because<00:03:12.090> you're<00:03:12.359> quite<00:03:12.600> a<00:03:12.660> good

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
quite easy because you're quite a good

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.240 
quite easy because you're quite a good
builder<00:03:13.079> and<00:03:13.200> I'm<00:03:13.260> a<00:03:13.290> sort<00:03:13.889> of<00:03:13.920> mediocre
