00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.510
 Anti 5 video flavors remembered with 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.639
 the description you have the link to a 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.039
 page cheap and reliable coins with the 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.289
 Master discount code for 5% of 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.000
 discount and now we go with the video the 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.250
 very hard to all back here we are 1 and 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.960
 this time we are in a new cheto 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.519
 silvers in which good is previous 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.740
 episodes I asked that I said six 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.810
 silver players of a league to 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.859
 make this decision successes silver and a 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.350
 league that caught my attention 

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:37.179
 is the mexican league the bancomer with what 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.670
 hung prey actually we have today 

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:41.199
 not in previous episodes on the team 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.729
 that we have reached 200 and peak the jce 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.639
 with which in that episode he asked us 

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:47.859
 that we come again to the 200 light 

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:49.929
 I think it is very feasible with which 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.120
 give to I can know that series that if you 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:53.979
 quite like it so come on let's go with 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.229
 the port of Chávez that Mr. Orozco 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:57.819
 you are already a doorman that there is more 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:59.589
 He was quite surprised, well, well, 

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:00.130
 you see there are few the cheapest is by 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:02.110
 the currency 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.500
 the one goalkeeper that I thought I did not 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.330
 I would like both 83 and one is 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.540
 I think the key for a goalkeeper is that 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.490
 be more or less high from 190 up 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.200
 not so good pension for truth we 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.630
 has been quite surprised since it is a 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.910
 silver porter very very very correct 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.620
 that's good, maybe it's not going high 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.660
 very good but I think it matters 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.190
 reflexes regarding issues of departures and 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.500
 such we go where good because others like 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.770
 It has 62 speeds because it can get very 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.960
 fast in its outputs it is placed quite 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.900
 teeth of positively 85 is already 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.259
 that for the contras is deadly 77 of 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.880
 jump 67 stretched 66 76 reflections 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.250
 I believe that the reflections of what more 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.150
 it shows in this game in this goalie not 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.250
 lose what you 've done to me a few 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.190
 good stops as soon as stretched not me 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.740
 it seems that I have only that 67 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.759
 I'd better put 70 71 and I see that 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.470
 It's a port that I like a lot 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.860
 has studies for the acrobatic with 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.260
 which is d 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.850
 I do not know then but that's what it says when it reaches 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.490
 front suddenly stretches the leg not 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.960
 in the shot this goalkeeper is final 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.970
 and well, a goalkeeper who has 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.620
 liked so much I would recommend the truth 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.060
 programs that have been cheap so what 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.560
 you can try and if you do not like it so 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.740
 you can sell because this is sold 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.050
 goalkeeper we do not go with the defense guys 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.990
 that the jorge represents the defense is a 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.000
 central and Mr. leitón jiménez la 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.980
 truth is that this is central I do not know if 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.530
 I had a special letter or and that's why I 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.500
 draws attention not not know the cheapest 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.950
 is by 650 here is one percent the 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.510
 50 and the rest do not then 650 would you consult 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.220
 of the other player because I recommend 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.780
 that you try it not as good as 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.520
 besides being Colombian you can 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.270
 put there in a Colombian team 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.400
 but also in a game of things 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.260
 650 coins because we are not so cool not 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.489
 when you sign it to me it's a game that 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
 I like it a lot since it has that 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.570
 high performance in defense and normal in 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.950
 attack that that for me is one thing 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.320
 incredible but to have a central in 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.720
 incredible time and that the three that more 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.110
 I like they have high attack 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.750
 but apart it has 72 of 64 rhythm 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.750
 defined and 76 of physical exterior 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.970
 having 65 on average seems pretty 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.370
 good that physique is very noticeable and 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.200
 that defense to see to me it seems to me that it 's 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.420
 the defense 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.980
 Well, this one because of the mowing of 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.140
 quite well the entries with the 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.460
 circle with the see xbox is also done 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.740
 pretty good because it's a good 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.110
 central that having so much physical when 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.640
 they're going to make the entrance come in with everything 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.560
 and it takes everything ahead and if not the 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.270
 Baron takes the team and for the play 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.980
 not with which in a more used hockey it is 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.270
 so rich I would recommend at least that 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.459
 try it myself since it is also not 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.650
 too expensive we go to four portals 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.690
 those two pictures are not going to have clips anymore 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.730
 that's good , it made me pretty 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.070
 complicated unless one goal got 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.980
 and then he could not get anything out since 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.320
 for example to be central and to be mc 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.740
 like that are jose juan vázquez el gallo 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:55.320
 well he does not have much much more 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:58.080
 is to recover values ​​and point with which 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:01.540
 no no I do not know very well how to get that x 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.700
 in that aspect so gentlemen 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.219
 it's cheaper than what's seen there 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.930
 five thousand with which it would only cost 5000 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:10.930
 the first thing that stands out is better is 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.400
 86 of rhythm but also the others 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.140
 that has the right that I can 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.819
 do in it considered important that 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.100
 are the ones that the physicist has 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.019
 pretty balanced the 273 defense 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.130
 and 35 from physical to mast and cited the 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.080
 dribbling term with which the 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.759
 channels and one more but I did not stay 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.410
 with high performance in defense in the 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:28.570
 bad attack is one thing that I find 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.300
 incredible since it arrives thanks to that already 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.509
 you can compensate with the other month m 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.530
 I was able to put one more offensive 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:38.020
 whereby it is because I like 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.539
 pretty kids, yes, well, well, what 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.449
 better the only thing that the only thing that I do not 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:45.460
 like is to play that has measures about 64 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.720
 that the best thing is the fucking pressure in a 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.460
 game that I like a lot and that I do not 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.990
 has gone badly wrong, not with what it has 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.120
 Why would I recommend that 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.130
 least I've tried it 6 but until edition 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.180
 Mexican but not the Mexican league 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.370
 truth is that I think it's the best 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.930
 that there is nothing more than nothing 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.240
 that rhythm and you do that this is too much 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.200
 important the rhythm by exists for the 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.020
 rhythm of rhythm is left over 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.430
 we are in the present the representative of 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.170
 the front that is in itself that is a 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.380
 forward center that is the lord 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:14.930
 villalba the truth is that seeing the 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.430
 paint on this player because I stop 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.830
 try this Juarez to a team within 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.450
 of the league in question and 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.040
 Well, I had planned to make another 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.430
 player not obviously in this league in 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.169
 four when attackers is the lord 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.770
 lady brook what is 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:33.289
 is the silver forward of this league 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.360
 par excellence but since you know it 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:37.039
 pretty you guys I would like to try 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.120
 other players do not and well, sir 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:39.860
 villalba caught my attention 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.449
 more than anything by the rhythm of saying that 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.249
 I was struck by the pace of 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:46.550
 appliances but it's wrong by 1500 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:48.680
 here and good then when I saw it what 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.060
 first thing that I noticed is in the rhythm and in 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.560
 the stars you have has five 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.629
 would be bad leg without the right 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.430
 which will not be bad and has 4 cooled 

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:57.650
 that I think that is more or less 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.599
 fundamental not now under the hand that 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.520
 you have to measure the 59 with which the 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:03.889
 physical will have quite loose in this 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:07.039
 case 48 but if not different than for 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:10.699
 have 69 average have 91 of pace 68 of 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:12.529
 shot is 35 ears of 69 pass 5 of 34 of 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:14.900
 watermarks is not perfectly wrong 

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:16.759
 not because I think the shot does not have 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.159
 so bad one to install two goals you 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:20.930
 hit pretty well on the second goal with 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:23.089
 the post the control is also a thing 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.279
 will stand out in use of that control since 

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:26.930
 Well, the silvers and which are 

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:28.490
 generate and I love that they have a great 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.740
 ball point I think this is a 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.909
 game that makes it pretty good and good 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.880
 well maybe how bad it has it is that 

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:35.430
 it has well 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.530
 orbán attack for a better forward 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:40.110
 you tour that not that young little but not if 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:46.310
 they impart it very good and one would recommend 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:46.310
 profiteers so I've done it 

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:57.270
