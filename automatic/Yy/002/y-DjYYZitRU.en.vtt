00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
point in that either well it's a little

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.779 
point in that either well it's a little
bit<00:00:52.489> different<00:00:52.819> seem<00:00:53.449> Diablo<00:00:53.960> 2<00:00:54.399> leveling<00:00:55.399> was

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
bit different seem Diablo 2 leveling was

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.700 
bit different seem Diablo 2 leveling was
much<00:00:56.210> more<00:00:56.479> of<00:00:56.600> an<00:00:56.690> accomplishment<00:00:57.229> than<00:00:57.620> it

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
much more of an accomplishment than it

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.369 
much more of an accomplishment than it
is<00:00:57.829> in<00:00:58.010> Diablo<00:00:58.550> 3<00:00:58.850> not<00:00:59.539> only<00:00:59.780> that<00:00:59.989> there<00:01:00.350> was

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
is in Diablo 3 not only that there was

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.729 
is in Diablo 3 not only that there was
the<00:01:00.620> PP<00:01:01.129> aspect<00:01:01.579> of<00:01:01.729> it<00:01:01.850> so<00:01:01.999> getting<00:01:02.929> items<00:01:03.139> was

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
the PP aspect of it so getting items was

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.040 
the PP aspect of it so getting items was
a<00:01:03.769> means<00:01:04.159> to<00:01:04.670> another<00:01:04.940> end<00:01:05.210> getting<00:01:05.840> items

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
a means to another end getting items

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.469 
a means to another end getting items
made<00:01:06.500> you<00:01:06.620> PvP<00:01:07.159> better<00:01:07.340> and<00:01:07.640> made<00:01:07.790> you<00:01:07.969> level

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
made you PvP better and made you level

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.959 
made you PvP better and made you level
faster<00:01:08.990> and<00:01:09.170> so<00:01:09.920> on<00:01:10.070> or<00:01:10.250> it<00:01:10.340> made<00:01:10.490> you<00:01:10.670> be<00:01:10.850> able

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:10.969 
faster and so on or it made you be able

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:12.730 
faster and so on or it made you be able
to<00:01:11.060> do<00:01:11.270> content<00:01:11.540> to<00:01:11.750> get<00:01:11.899> better<00:01:12.110> items<00:01:12.469> to

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
to do content to get better items to

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.510 
to do content to get better items to
level<00:01:13.070> faster<00:01:13.460> or<00:01:13.610> to<00:01:13.850> PvP<00:01:14.180> better<00:01:14.509> so<00:01:15.520> getting

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
level faster or to PvP better so getting

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.609 
level faster or to PvP better so getting
items<00:01:16.700> was<00:01:17.030> never<00:01:17.299> the<00:01:17.570> ultimate<00:01:18.140> point<00:01:18.350> it

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
items was never the ultimate point it

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.660 
items was never the ultimate point it
was<00:01:18.829> the<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:21.170> highway<00:01:21.619> to<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:22.130> ultimate

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
was the the highway to the ultimate

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.380 
was the the highway to the ultimate
point<00:01:22.850> in<00:01:23.719> Diablo<00:01:24.200> 3<00:01:24.469> getting<00:01:25.070> items<00:01:26.950> it's<00:01:27.950> not

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
point in Diablo 3 getting items it's not

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.840 
point in Diablo 3 getting items it's not
it's<00:01:29.390> not<00:01:29.570> really<00:01:29.780> like<00:01:29.960> that<00:01:30.670> getting<00:01:31.670> items

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
it's not really like that getting items

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.130 
it's not really like that getting items
can<00:01:32.119> really<00:01:32.359> help<00:01:32.450> you<00:01:32.570> progress<00:01:32.750> through<00:01:32.930> the

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
can really help you progress through the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.130 
can really help you progress through the
game<00:01:33.200> but<00:01:34.100> once<00:01:34.280> you've<00:01:34.399> already<00:01:34.670> done<00:01:34.939> that

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
game but once you've already done that

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.469 
game but once you've already done that
there's<00:01:36.140> really<00:01:36.350> no<00:01:36.590> need<00:01:36.740> for<00:01:37.009> them<00:01:37.219> so<00:01:37.880> you

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
there's really no need for them so you

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.440 
there's really no need for them so you
know<00:01:38.600> to<00:01:39.259> create<00:01:39.680> more<00:01:39.920> more<00:01:40.729> content<00:01:41.210> out<00:01:41.329> of

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
Diablo or playing hardcore it's kind of

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.719 
Diablo or playing hardcore it's kind of
like<00:01:43.520> a<00:01:43.549> soft<00:01:43.909> ladder<00:01:44.329> reset<00:01:45.189> the<00:01:46.189> point<00:01:46.579> I'm

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
like a soft ladder reset the point I'm

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.539 
like a soft ladder reset the point I'm
trying<00:01:46.759> to<00:01:47.030> make<00:01:47.119> is<00:01:47.479> right<00:01:48.380> now<00:01:48.560> on<00:01:48.710> Diablo<00:01:48.979> 3

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
there's really not much to do the only

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.349 
there's really not much to do the only
part<00:01:53.119> of<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:53.329> game<00:01:53.539> that<00:01:54.320> is<00:01:55.280> content<00:01:55.939> is<00:01:56.149> like

when you have items dropping in earlier
acts

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
acts

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.980 
acts
the<00:04:25.400> difficulty<00:04:25.970> is<00:04:26.090> severely

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
the difficulty is severely

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.320 
the difficulty is severely
but<00:04:27.590> it's<00:04:27.740> not<00:04:27.919> only<00:04:28.039> that<00:04:28.160> you<00:04:28.370> see<00:04:28.699> there's<00:04:29.270> a

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
but it's not only that you see there's a

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.059 
but it's not only that you see there's a
lot<00:04:29.509> of<00:04:29.660> people<00:04:29.870> out<00:04:30.020> there<00:04:30.050> because<00:04:30.949> I've

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:31.069 
lot of people out there because I've

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:32.469 
lot of people out there because I've
already<00:04:31.220> beaten<00:04:31.580> the<00:04:31.669> game<00:04:31.699> because<00:04:32.270> they're

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
already beaten the game because they're

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.689 
already beaten the game because they're
in<00:04:32.660> my<00:04:32.810> situation<00:04:33.410> who<00:04:33.800> instead<00:04:34.160> of<00:04:34.220> moving<00:04:34.460> to

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
in my situation who instead of moving to

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.080 
in my situation who instead of moving to
hardcore<00:04:35.210> all<00:04:35.990> they've<00:04:36.349> done<00:04:36.380> is<00:04:36.889> farm<00:04:37.849> items

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
hardcore all they've done is farm items

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.749 
hardcore all they've done is farm items
farm<00:04:38.840> items<00:04:39.169> for<00:04:39.380> more<00:04:39.560> gold<00:04:39.830> or<00:04:40.250> maybe<00:04:40.400> saving

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:40.759 
farm items for more gold or maybe saving

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:42.219 
farm items for more gold or maybe saving
them<00:04:40.940> up<00:04:41.060> for<00:04:41.180> the<00:04:41.270> real<00:04:41.479> money<00:04:41.690> auction<00:04:41.870> house

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
them up for the real money auction house

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:46.510 
them up for the real money auction house
so<00:04:42.889> because<00:04:43.460> there's<00:04:43.900> much<00:04:44.900> more<00:04:45.520> extremely

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
so because there's much more extremely

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.749 
so because there's much more extremely
high<00:04:46.819> grade<00:04:47.180> items<00:04:47.599> being<00:04:48.139> being<00:04:48.770> a<00:04:49.039> you<00:04:49.639> know

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 
high grade items being being a you know

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.409 
high grade items being being a you know
brought<00:04:50.120> into<00:04:50.389> the<00:04:50.509> economy<00:04:52.000> the<00:04:53.000> game<00:04:53.240> is

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
brought into the economy the game is

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.550 
brought into the economy the game is
naturally<00:04:54.289> getting<00:04:55.220> easier<00:04:55.610> so<00:04:56.449> I<00:04:56.750> don't

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
naturally getting easier so I don't

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.379 
naturally getting easier so I don't
really<00:04:57.680> understand<00:04:58.630> why<00:04:59.630> they<00:04:59.960> feel<00:05:00.289> that<00:05:00.650> now

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
really understand why they feel that now

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:04.779 
really understand why they feel that now
once<00:05:02.389> there<00:05:02.630> is<00:05:02.750> like<00:05:02.960> a<00:05:03.199> large<00:05:04.009> portion<00:05:04.550> of

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789 
once there is like a large portion of

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:06.820 
once there is like a large portion of
the<00:05:04.940> Diablo<00:05:05.330> 3<00:05:05.479> population<00:05:06.020> farming<00:05:06.560> the<00:05:06.620> game

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
the Diablo 3 population farming the game

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.550 
the Diablo 3 population farming the game
for<00:05:07.190> items<00:05:07.580> why<00:05:08.240> now<00:05:08.569> they<00:05:09.020> would<00:05:09.199> nerf<00:05:09.409> it

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
for items why now they would nerf it

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.700 
for items why now they would nerf it
because<00:05:09.860> now<00:05:10.069> the<00:05:10.130> game<00:05:10.520> is<00:05:10.819> essentially

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
because now the game is essentially

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.640 
because now the game is essentially
nerfing<00:05:12.710> itself<00:05:13.419> so<00:05:14.419> why<00:05:14.659> make<00:05:14.930> it<00:05:15.110> easier<00:05:15.409> why

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
nerfing itself so why make it easier why

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:16.600 
nerfing itself so why make it easier why
make<00:05:15.830> it<00:05:15.979> even<00:05:16.220> easier

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
make it even easier

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:22.300 
make it even easier
um<00:05:17.330> I<00:05:18.039> mean<00:05:19.039> I<00:05:19.310> guess<00:05:19.729> I<00:05:20.330> guess<00:05:21.199> maybe<00:05:21.470> for<00:05:21.770> PvP

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
um I mean I guess I guess maybe for PvP

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.399 
um I mean I guess I guess maybe for PvP
but<00:05:22.970> I<00:05:23.030> haven't<00:05:23.270> seen<00:05:23.539> any<00:05:23.780> announcement<00:05:24.349> of

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
that will they do ladder resets probably

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.649 
that will they do ladder resets probably
not<00:05:27.139> I<00:05:27.490> don't<00:05:28.490> know<00:05:28.639> man<00:05:28.909> I<00:05:29.150> don't<00:05:29.389> know<00:05:29.479> what
