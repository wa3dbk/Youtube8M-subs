00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
angle though and he could play it too

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.559 
angle though and he could play it too
linear<00:03:41.310> but<00:03:41.670> he's<00:03:41.790> being<00:03:42.000> quite<00:03:42.269> tightly

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
linear but he's being quite tightly

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.990 
linear but he's being quite tightly
marked<00:03:43.019> so<00:03:43.500> what<00:03:43.709> does<00:03:43.859> he<00:03:43.950> do<00:03:44.220> but<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:44.819> best

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
marked so what does he do but the best

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.490 
marked so what does he do but the best
thing<00:03:45.209> about<00:03:45.239> this<00:03:45.450> combination<00:03:46.049> play<00:03:46.260> it's

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
thing about this combination play it's

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.080 
thing about this combination play it's
not<00:03:46.769> all<00:03:46.920> don't<00:03:47.130> anymore<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.670> it's<00:03:47.880> not

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
not all don't anymore and it's not

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.940 
not all don't anymore and it's not
although<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:48.510> Messi<00:03:48.810> it's<00:03:49.019> a<00:03:49.170> combination<00:03:49.590> of

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
although the Messi it's a combination of

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.009 
although the Messi it's a combination of
both<00:03:50.220> that's<00:03:50.819> what<00:03:51.030> makes<00:03:51.209> it<00:03:51.329> work<00:03:51.600> because

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
both that's what makes it work because

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.870 
both that's what makes it work because
Neymar<00:03:52.470> is<00:03:52.500> in<00:03:52.650> this<00:03:52.769> area<00:03:52.950> now<00:03:53.190> if<00:03:53.400> mess<00:03:53.760> he

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
Neymar is in this area now if mess he

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.280 
Neymar is in this area now if mess he
doesn't<00:03:54.120> make<00:03:54.209> that<00:03:54.359> run<00:03:54.540> if<00:03:54.690> he<00:03:54.720> hasn't<00:03:55.139> got

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
doesn't make that run if he hasn't got

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.140 
doesn't make that run if he hasn't got
the<00:03:55.500> energy<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:56.069> get<00:03:56.549> up<00:03:56.609> in<00:03:56.849> that<00:03:56.970> position

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
the energy to get up in that position

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.390 
the energy to get up in that position
this<00:03:57.540> doesn't<00:03:57.900> work<00:03:58.079> but<00:03:58.530> because<00:03:58.709> Messi<00:03:59.190> has

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
this doesn't work but because Messi has

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.039 
this doesn't work but because Messi has
got<00:03:59.609> the<00:03:59.700> desire<00:04:00.000> to<00:04:00.030> get<00:04:00.359> in<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.569> box<00:04:00.750> and<00:04:00.930> get

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
got the desire to get in the box and get
