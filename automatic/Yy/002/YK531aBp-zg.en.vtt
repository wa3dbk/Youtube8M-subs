00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.920 
basis and obviously everyone knows that
that<00:01:38.540> lasts<00:01:38.930> like<00:01:39.049> 10<00:01:40.040> years<00:01:40.250> anyway<00:01:40.579> and

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
that lasts like 10 years anyway and

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.330 
that lasts like 10 years anyway and

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
that's so this just like basically

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.399 
that's so this just like basically
prolongs<00:01:43.820> it<00:01:44.030> and<00:01:44.210> makes<00:01:44.720> like<00:01:44.960> that<00:01:45.200> often

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
prolongs it and makes like that often

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.230 
prolongs it and makes like that often
power<00:01:45.560> even<00:01:45.829> longer<00:01:46.130> so<00:01:46.520> were<00:01:47.030> you<00:01:47.090> really

but it definitely brought him just came

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.220 
but it definitely brought him just came
up<00:02:25.290> when<00:02:25.409> you<00:02:25.500> put<00:02:25.650> your<00:02:25.680> foundation<00:02:26.400> on<00:02:26.519> and

mattifies as well and it makes
everything<00:02:30.180> Matt<00:02:30.629> and<00:02:30.870> like<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.230> oil<00:02:31.409> is

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
everything Matt and like the oil is

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.309 
everything Matt and like the oil is
amazing<00:02:32.129> with<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:32.400> I<00:02:32.519> use<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:33.090> mac<00:02:33.390> orbital

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
amazing with it I use the mac orbital

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.780 
amazing with it I use the mac orbital
motion<00:02:34.650> with<00:02:34.829> this<00:02:35.040> so<00:02:35.250> obviously<00:02:35.519> the<00:02:35.640> oil

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
motion with this so obviously the oil

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.940 
motion with this so obviously the oil
makes<00:02:36.060> it<00:02:36.180> even<00:02:36.239> better<00:02:36.359> and<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.799> two

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
makes it even better and so the two

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.720 
makes it even better and so the two
together<00:02:38.099> we<00:02:38.340> just<00:02:38.519> thought<00:02:38.609> I<00:02:38.640> made<00:02:38.849> them<00:02:40.730> and

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
together we just thought I made them and

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.809 
together we just thought I made them and
protects<00:02:42.659> very<00:02:42.989> know<00:02:43.170> that<00:02:43.349> means<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.889> but<00:02:44.609> I

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
protects very know that means and but I

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.699 
protects very know that means and but I
think<00:02:45.209> it<00:02:45.299> basically<00:02:45.659> don't<00:02:45.930> protect<00:02:46.379> it

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
think it basically don't protect it

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.229 
think it basically don't protect it
gives<00:02:46.920> up<00:02:47.069> a<00:02:47.129> nice<00:02:47.280> day<00:02:47.459> in<00:02:47.639> between<00:02:47.790> your

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
gives up a nice day in between your

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.110 
gives up a nice day in between your
foundation<00:02:49.019> and<00:02:49.109> your<00:02:49.260> skin<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.790> so<00:02:50.790> compares

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
foundation and your skin and so compares

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.879 
foundation and your skin and so compares
a<00:02:51.239> higher<00:02:51.480> end<00:02:51.720> of<00:02:51.959> it<00:02:52.169> is<00:02:52.290> way<00:02:52.560> better<00:02:52.739> than

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:52.889 
a higher end of it is way better than

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:55.550 
a higher end of it is way better than
anyone<00:02:53.310> I've<00:02:53.639> ever<00:02:53.819> ever<00:02:54.060> tried<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.810> boy<00:02:55.530> that
