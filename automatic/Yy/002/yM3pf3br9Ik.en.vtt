hey guys this is my super compact house
version<00:00:03.780> 2.0<00:00:04.529> a<00:00:05.190> couple<00:00:05.609> days<00:00:05.730> ago<00:00:05.850> I<00:00:06.089> put<00:00:06.330> out

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
version 2.0 a couple days ago I put out

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.780 
version 2.0 a couple days ago I put out
those<00:00:06.810> from<00:00:06.990> one<00:00:07.170> point<00:00:07.379> oh<00:00:07.560> this<00:00:08.309> is<00:00:08.550> the

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
those from one point oh this is the

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.080 
those from one point oh this is the
sequel<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:10.080> I<00:00:10.950> think<00:00:10.980> possibly<00:00:11.910> the

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
sequel to that and I think possibly the

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.690 
sequel to that and I think possibly the
final<00:00:12.420> version<00:00:13.009> I've<00:00:14.009> made<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.190> couple<00:00:14.400> changes

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
final version I've made a couple changes

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.820 
final version I've made a couple changes
to<00:00:15.030> it<00:00:15.150> as<00:00:15.870> you<00:00:15.960> can<00:00:16.049> see<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.350> wood<00:00:16.650> on<00:00:16.740> the

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
to it as you can see the wood on the

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.990 
to it as you can see the wood on the
outside<00:00:17.160> looks<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.430> bit<00:00:17.490> different<00:00:17.550> we<00:00:17.970> have

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
outside looks a bit different we have

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.490 
outside looks a bit different we have
Jim<00:00:18.630> Lee<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.430> some<00:00:20.430> change<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.060> roof<00:00:21.500> it's

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500

Jim Lee and some change to the roof it's
still<00:00:22.800> compact<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:23.939> has<00:00:24.119> more<00:00:24.359> features

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.269 
still compact and it has more features
than<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.050> last<00:00:25.320> version<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:25.949> it's<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.160> lot<00:00:26.220> more

maps and the compasses on the wall you
see<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.420> compass<00:00:42.719> changes<00:00:43.170> as<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.800> move<00:00:44.070> also

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
see the compass changes as I move also

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.139 
see the compass changes as I move also
we<00:00:45.390> have<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.750> clock<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.469> map<00:00:47.149> brewing

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
we have the clock and the map brewing

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.450 
we have the clock and the map brewing
stand<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.600> still<00:00:48.840> there<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.460> repair

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
stand is still there and the repair

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.130 
stand is still there and the repair
tables<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.910> same<00:00:51.120> patient<00:00:51.480> Chapman<00:00:51.809> table

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
tables in the same patient Chapman table

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.310 
tables in the same patient Chapman table
but<00:00:52.739> now<00:00:52.890> we<00:00:52.949> have<00:00:53.280> an<00:00:53.550> infinity<00:00:54.059> water<00:00:54.989> source

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
but now we have an infinity water source

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.389 
but now we have an infinity water source
down<00:00:55.530> there<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:55.860> if<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:55.980> want<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.129> fill<00:00:56.250> your

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
down there so if you want to fill your

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.639 
down there so if you want to fill your
bucket<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:56.820> now<00:00:57.120> you'll<00:00:57.329> never<00:00:57.480> run<00:00:57.629> out<00:00:57.809> last

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
bucket so now you'll never run out last

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.670 
bucket so now you'll never run out last
time<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:59.160> had<00:00:59.340> a<00:01:00.289> cauldron<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.440> wasn't

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
time I just had a cauldron that wasn't

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.520 
time I just had a cauldron that wasn't
infinity<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:02.789> it's<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.359> lot<00:01:03.480> better<00:01:03.600> now<00:01:04.470> we

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
infinity so it's a lot better now we

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.190 
infinity so it's a lot better now we
have<00:01:04.830> our<00:01:05.100> jukebox<00:01:05.369> inside<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.270> house<00:01:06.420> with<00:01:06.900> a

single chest and the chest down here we

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.170 
single chest and the chest down here we
can<00:01:10.799> still<00:01:11.070> open<00:01:11.250> up<00:01:11.430> if<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.820> want<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.030> get<00:01:12.119> in

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
can open up the ender chest and that's

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.300 
can open up the ender chest and that's
about<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.610> for<00:01:17.729> down<00:01:18.119> there<00:01:18.830> now<00:01:19.830> we<00:01:19.890> have<00:01:20.280> our

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
about it for down there now we have our

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.690 
about it for down there now we have our
alternate<00:01:21.060> farm<00:01:21.530> on<00:01:22.530> here<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.159> can<00:01:23.340> grow<00:01:23.520> any

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
alternate farm on here you can grow any

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.080 
alternate farm on here you can grow any
crop<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.090> one<00:01:24.270> as<00:01:25.259> long<00:01:25.439> as<00:01:25.470> its<00:01:25.820> seeds<00:01:26.820> or

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
crop you one as long as its seeds or

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.910 
crop you one as long as its seeds or
sugar<00:01:27.509> cane<00:01:27.689> because<00:01:27.930> everything<00:01:28.829> else

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
sugar cane because everything else

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.840 
sugar cane because everything else
requires<00:01:29.280> more<00:01:29.520> room<00:01:29.759> but<00:01:30.540> if<00:01:30.659> we<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.619> think<00:01:32.549> you

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
requires more room but if we I think you

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.340 
requires more room but if we I think you
can<00:01:33.000> go<00:01:33.090> crap<00:01:33.329> carrots<00:01:33.720> actually<00:01:34.020> I'm<00:01:34.079> growing

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
can go crap carrots actually I'm growing

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.620 
can go crap carrots actually I'm growing
the<00:01:34.439> carrots<00:01:34.740> before<00:01:35.040> but<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:35.790> one<00:01:36.060> grows<00:01:36.450> up

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
the carrots before but this one grows up

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.370 
the carrots before but this one grows up
to<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.780> chimley<00:01:36.990> break<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.100> here<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:39.380> put

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
to the chimley break this here and put

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.690 
to the chimley break this here and put
seeds<00:01:40.590> there<00:01:40.799> they<00:01:41.040> will<00:01:41.159> grow<00:01:41.280> because<00:01:41.610> we

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
seeds there they will grow because we

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.580 
seeds there they will grow because we
have<00:01:41.850> water<00:01:42.329> there<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.869> don't<00:01:43.439> know<00:01:43.500> how

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
have water there I don't know how

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.020 
have water there I don't know how
carrots<00:01:43.920> work<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.189> haven't<00:01:44.430> grown<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.729> before

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
carrots work I haven't grown a before

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.399 
carrots work I haven't grown a before
but<00:01:45.210> if<00:01:45.299> they<00:01:45.420> do<00:01:45.479> grow<00:01:45.780> on<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.869> single<00:01:46.229> block

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
but if they do grow on a single block

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.530
