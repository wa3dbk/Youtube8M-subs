00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:15.289
 several months before its commercialization we offer them 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.570
 caradisiac was able to preview the Mercedes class r 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.679
 which is immediately obvious when you look at it, you can 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:25.009
 to notice is its imposing stature 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.329
 with more than 5 meters in length and that's one meter ninety-two of 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:29.030
 width 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.030
 class r is one of the biggest vehicles on the market 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.159
 even though this size does not only have advantages 

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:41.229
 I was there at least the merit of offering you a more welcoming space 

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:43.100
 for you and your family 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.440
 in this field Mercedes chose a totally different bias 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.480
 other manufacturers since class r can carry six people 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.370
 spread over three rows of seats 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.160
 the interior space is simply impressive and the sensation 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.500
 choking that can sometimes be felt in some minivan 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.500
 surprisingly absent whether it is second or third 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.980
 for our test we could try classes r 350 and 500 which marks 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.740
 the entry of the range in gasoline with 272 horses for the first and 306 for 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.600
 the second as much tell you that the star brand does not do in the 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.850
 half measure to move the two tons of the beast 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.280
 in the face of such characteristics one even comes to wonder whether the 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.500
 English sense pair by the engine that is best suited for the class r 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.810
 but rest assured 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.040
 we seduce you Mercedes has also planned a diesel engine 3 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.450
 liters of yield 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.320
 in terms of handling the class r will look very 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.230
 Securing partly thanks to its permanent all-wheel drive 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.230
 associated with the remain 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.080
 even if the makers of the mark are announced an approximate price of 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.380
 55000 euros 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.979
 the price of the r class is the big unknown of our test and for the most 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.399
 impatient of you know that its marketing one is European will be 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.210
 scheduled for February 2006 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.130
 but rest assured you can order it as soon as September 2005 is that 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.229
 we enjoyed in his mercedes broke 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.609
 it's livability and comfort very good 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:12.710
 its level of equipment very complete 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.909
 and his very versatile behavior 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.609
 on the other hand we appreciated his truck measurements and his modularity 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:20.810
 a bit constraining and its excessive weight
