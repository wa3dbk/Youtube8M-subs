00:00:04.203 --> 00:00:06.572
- Before the actual date
of the business starting,

00:00:06.572 --> 00:00:10.510
there was a lot that built up
to get to that point.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.112
I guess the long story short
is that

00:00:13.112 --> 00:00:14.781
we were living this lifestyle

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:16.816
where we were super serious
about skiing,

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:21.421
in terms of, like, stylistic
and performance basis,

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:23.356
but also combining it
with a culture

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:26.792
that kind of sends you
around the world

00:00:26.792 --> 00:00:30.563
chasing storms
and really good mountains.

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:33.299
It was kind of
in the early 2000s, we--

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:35.534
you know, I was basically
spending dual seasons

00:00:35.534 --> 00:00:39.138
in South America and then either
in North America or Europe,

00:00:39.138 --> 00:00:41.273
and my friends and I
noticed that

00:00:41.273 --> 00:00:43.776
just amongst the current
manufacturers

00:00:43.776 --> 00:00:46.980
there wasn't a brand really
that sort of hit

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.516
the equipment that we really
wanted to be riding on,

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:51.918
and secondly,
from a cultural standpoint,

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:53.586
really reflected the lifestyle

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:56.822
of kind of this sort of,
like, vagabond,

00:00:56.822 --> 00:01:00.226
you know, powder-chasing
yet really performance-driven,

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:01.961
kind of skier.

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:03.696
And it's certainly--

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:06.365
yeah, it's, like, all-consuming
lifestyle for sure, you know.

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:08.867
It just becomes your--
you know, what you live around,

00:01:08.867 --> 00:01:12.671
and so the genesis for DPS
was really built up

00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:15.507
in, like, trying to build
a brand that--

00:01:15.507 --> 00:01:19.812
and a company that
identified culturally with--

00:01:19.812 --> 00:01:22.415
you know, with just
an all-encompassing

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:24.817
kind of cultivation
of the art of skiing,

00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:27.253
and then mated that
with equipment

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:29.488
that was worthy
of that same passion.

00:01:29.488 --> 00:01:31.024
It's an inanimate object

00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:32.759
that has a spiritual connection
to you,

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.693
and so it's something that,
you know,

00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:36.562
we presume that
we would ourselves

00:01:36.562 --> 00:01:39.865
and that our customer would too,
it's just--it would--

00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:41.501
you know, just invest in.

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:44.337
I actually started
making skis in 2003,

00:01:44.337 --> 00:01:46.839
and learned a lot
of lessons there.

00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:48.907
We had a manufacturing partner
that couldn't--

00:01:48.907 --> 00:01:52.211
you know, the technology
on the carbon side wasn't--

00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:53.713
wasn't quite mature,

00:01:53.713 --> 00:01:57.083
so that company ended up folding
in delivery issues,

00:01:57.083 --> 00:01:59.685
and DPS started in 2005.

00:01:59.685 --> 00:02:02.188
So through the two years
of our initial failure,

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:03.656
I learned, I'd say,

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:05.658
quite a bit about
the business side of things.

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:08.027
In terms of starting
on a second go,

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:10.029
you obviously learn from the--

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:12.298
you know, it's cliche,
but you learn from mistakes,

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:14.400
and then you realize
that there's real merit

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.570
in kind of the things
that were working,

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.940
and that you have enough faith
in them that you say, you know,

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.877
"If I can just right the wrongs,
we really have something--

00:02:24.877 --> 00:02:26.579
have something good here."

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.147
And then it sort of just--

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:30.283
from there it's been a really
evolving process,

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:31.850
you know, on the business side.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.754
It's--I guess my MBA
is this company, you know.

00:02:34.754 --> 00:02:37.823
One of my favorite parts
of the job is just, you know,

00:02:37.823 --> 00:02:41.327
being able to go through
that brain puzzle

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:43.996
of tinkering with
new ideas

00:02:43.996 --> 00:02:46.999
and sort of expanding the mind

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:50.270
to realize new, you know,

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.071
possibilities
on the physical plane

00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:56.176
that ultimately, like, make you
happy when you're skiing.
