00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 Welcome a class help 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.180
 I'm supposed to be back with one 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.460
 graphics card review for you today 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.389
 let's look at the gainward geforce gtx 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.759
 89 fenton card to this nvidia gpu from 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.740
 boardpartner gainward currently costs 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.350
 to the 540 euro 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.180
 which is not bad for a gtx 980 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.250
 I am really grateful to Stefan 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.890
 mÃ¼ller for giving me another one 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.689
 graphics card to test from many 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.279
 Thanks a lot, I know then 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.050
 support very much appreciated 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.239
 By the way, money for sending back the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.219
 he also did a lot of work on that card 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.320
 very nice of him the last time in the 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.329
 previous depot test report has me 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.489
 Stefan also made a nice work of art 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.379
 stainless steel to put that himself 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.140
 This time he puts me three 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.579
 pieces to you just have to show times 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.219
 Take a look at this 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.250
 this precision is simply beautiful 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:01:00.149
 stefan you are very talented many 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:02.010
 thanks good now but back to 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.989
 test report in the box of all 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.729
 standard stuff as always the 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.510
 graphics card itself the fast 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:12.000
 installation instructions the drivers cd 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:15.270
 here we have a dual pci six 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.720
 pools to 8 pole data and a dvi too 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.030
 vga adapter which gainward gtx 89 has 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.850
 four gigabytes of gb gddr5 video storage and 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.270
 obviously makes nvidias great 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.250
 gm 204 g per use what the taktraten 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.180
 The chip rate is 1 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.780
 1203 megahertz The bus clock to 1304 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.320
 megahertz and the store act on 1800 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.040
 megahertz 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.840
 the ttp with 165 watts can not really 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.970
 more than high 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.250
 of course the eu is based on the 28th 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.180
 nanometer manufacturing that's natural 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.100
 no news 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.280
 the gentex 89 has a memory 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.890
 interface of 256 bit and it will be the 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.200
 new dax 12 api supports the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.180
 hopefully soon in the near future in 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.829
 play comes to play we look 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.189
 but now the map a little closer 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.840
 on 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.119
 First of all , I have to say the same 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.560
 visually it is not my thing I like 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.509
 my by no means looks bad 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.459
 or something like that but not exactly for me 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.540
 What I would be looking for above all else 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.489
 if you are 540 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.420
 for a graphics card out there are bothersome 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.099
 me a very weak one 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.299
 plastic cover on his beast of 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.430
 to see graphics card 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.260
 The cover not only looks cheap 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.299
 Feels to be honest 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.769
 also cheap but apart from that 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.760
 the rest of the card seems good 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.560
 to be processed 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.299
 Let me explain how it works 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.150
 cooler here we can see works 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.620
 There are no fans above the air 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.370
 directly on the aluminum heat sink 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.799
 blow 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.530
 instead, the fans are almost like 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.450
 in a sandwich between inside we 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.549
 Here are three of them all 80 of them 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.220
 Millimeter of air is passing through the slats 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.480
 sucked in and at the same time air is on 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.099
 blown the gpu 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.739
 The heat sink is with five heatpipes 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.870
 connected to the bottom of the gpu 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.939
 the airs are removable and that is 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.560
 in my opinion a good system 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:01.540
 you just have to loosen the thumbscrews 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.639
 and just pull out the air 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.739
 this is a tool loose and clean 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:08.109
 design cables and the like do not have to 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.970
 be put out as it were like hot 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.129
 swap hard disks because housings just stop 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.870
 hot swap fan for the video card in 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.150
 In this case, although you think about it 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.220
 This gtx 580 might be more passive too 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.690
 cool I would advise against it 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.030
 in my opinion, you need here 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.370
 no passive cooling solution because the air 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.620
 not everyone is extremely quiet anyway 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.540
 really loud on 100% air 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.129
 rotation speed around this 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.370
 to be supplied with electricity 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:36.030
 pci 60 and 80 power connection needed 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.430
 two USB ports for up to 4 way sli 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.829
 pci 3.0 of course and we can see 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.720
 gainward uses a nice black one 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.819
 and very dark brownish pcb 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.590
 black at first sight, so to speak 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.780
 although this card is higher than that 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.120
 Most others still have one 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.190
 the wolford card will be shown as outputs 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.129
 one offered a dvi exit here 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.530
 three mini displayport outputs and one 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.389
 single mini hdmi output too many 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.199
 at least my taste but of course 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:04.840
 no problem 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:08.620
 the gainward gtx 89 change measures 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.060
 about 27 5 cm length that is quite a 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.919
 nice long map but relatively 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.840
 Easily housed on most models 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:15.519
 should find space so listen well now 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.530
 to persuade niklas you think safe 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.340
 already shows us the benchmarks 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.340
 here you go 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:49.860
 no surprise of course this 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.850
 graphics card really much right 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.380
 to offer performance 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:55.080
 luckily I have another one 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.389
 text 980 in my tables and it is 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.729
 every now and then a difference 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:02.490
 invisible between these two 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:04.650
 changing the gainward gtx 980 is one 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.150
 great card I have to say no 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.919
 as far as aesthetics are concerned, however 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.530
 in terms of performance under 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:13.530
 volume, she does not care with which 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.840
 play man tests the gags 89 he swallows 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.479
 Of course, all I have is 1080p 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.840
 I have not tested it yet on 4k 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:20.820
 can 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.410
 the performance is amazing but that 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.970
 I do not have to tell you that here 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.490
 Power consumption is really good though 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.740
 just three dsc tx9 80s a bit 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.539
 more efficient is where these genes change 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.250
 card scores correctly is the 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:34.380
 noise level the graphics card 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.990
 remains extremely quiet even full load 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:39.900
 while the temperatures says on abel 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:42.570
 are at a maximum of 70 degrees centigrade 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.669
 my test there are definitely going 689 it 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:46.229
 with better coolers what the pipes 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:49.110
 Cooling performance but in terms of 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:51.810
 the volume I would say that this 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.789
 the bar has a graphic is the me 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.260
 So far I have tested 

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:55.919
 the couple just more easily 

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.419
 cope with 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:58.860
 I just wish I did not want to 

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:01.080
 this weak plastic cover 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.669
 instead uses better metal or 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.710
 at least better the plastic around the 

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:06.690
 Graphics had optically and also 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.490
 emotionally giving more stability 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.320
 but otherwise it's a great one 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:13.130
 video card I can gainward 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.690
 geforce gtx 89 enemy on the graphics card 

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:17.880
 definitely recommend a whole again 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:19.919
 big thank you to stefan that will 

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.389
 abroad his card and that allow 

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:23.099
 this report i know then 

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:24.780
 Support really appreciated 

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:26.729
