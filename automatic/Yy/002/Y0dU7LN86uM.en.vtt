 Well then, Jupiter- 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.520
 I would like you to explain Nakazawa 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.200
 Nice to meet you 5 years ago 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.870
 I can also take power from a big day 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.820
 And here you can easily connect with such investment 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.750
 It seems that it can be done. There are 8 people and a holy ground here. 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.819
 I did not fly here without ringing 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:33.420
 I started looking into the front of this vehicle 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.740
 If low price here 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.220
 Drive route with PC 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.450
 By the way, it is whole grain flour 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.910
 Did you have a cradle as an accessory? 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.580
 It is weak in the year 1968. Dissolution 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.410
 There is, but it is tied to prey so far 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.810
 And connect two cars loaded with goods more than a big day 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.000
 You can easily install in places where it is easy to work 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.410
 When attaching the dashboard out 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.620
 Please make sure to install 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.670
 I changed various settings and this was also done with the remote control 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.450
 Even if it happens, it seems to be easy to use. 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.090
 I want to write 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.270

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.010
 Talk with thank you 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.770
 This talks to the live-in standby screen this time 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.800
 Which is the calendar screen of the US calendar 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.610
 This is an eco-drive, so the standby screen 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.200
 This will be the unit standby screen for acceleration. 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.320
 It will become management money of the management 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.670
 And from here is a successful attack established 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.270
 It will be on standby when the adapter is connected 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.250

 Express the instantaneous fuel consumption of the throttle opening 

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:14.799
 It is the amount of fuel consumption 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:18.289

 Report on conventional 2x g sensor gyro sensor 

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:57.200
 I do not think that there is a tendency 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.289

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:01.800
