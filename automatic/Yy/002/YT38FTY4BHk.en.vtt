 the hotel Sheraton of Bogota Colombia was 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.879
 the chosen place to develop the 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.629
 first international workshop seminar 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:16.250
 scleral lens is the past July 19 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:18.529
 this academic meeting had the 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.690
 presence of the optometrist edgar dávila de 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.640
 Puerto Rico and the Mauritian optometrist 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.950
 polished who have a great 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.140
 experience in lens adaptations of 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.660
 Special design to workshop seminar 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.000
 attended by ophthalmologists contact logos and 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.860
 optometrists of ecuador venezuela and by 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.079
 supposed colombia who were 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.180
 active participants in this training 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.100
 which was characterized by a model 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.110
 integrated theory and practice 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.000
 we understand that it is the best way to 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.370
 how to work with this type of 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.040
 new technology relative to here in 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.350
 Bogota and in South America as 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.480
 this type of fight is very clear that it 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.280
 that way by having the theory and 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.170
 fine-tune the practice we can learn 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.510
 much faster and be able to offer 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.820
 pathology to the patients we have in 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.530
 the theoretical four hours the assistants 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.469
 they learned about the tools of 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.479
 ocete corneal topography and lamp 

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:10.690
 slit lens applications 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.340
 scleral is manufacturing 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.200
 for its part during the 4 hours 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.120
 practices patients adapted 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.070
 submitted by professionals who 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.930
 they attended every clinical case was 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.090
 presented by the specialist who 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.430
 led and they were all adapted in 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.979
 company of the experts edgar dávila and 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.560
 mauritius polished the practical part it 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.960
 developed based on steps 1 2 and 3 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.440
 which they were applied in patients 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.710
 real that they took to the hotel sheraton 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.690
 1 2 3 is the terminology of 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.700
 adaptation sought by the company excel 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.759
 with tax for the launch of their 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.920
 Claire lenses atlantis atlantis or 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.680
 excel searched through its design 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.350
 scleral make it very easy to 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.790
 adaptation and they in their literature or in 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.890
 his adaptation guides talk about three 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.720
 steps a first step adapt the area 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.270
 central the second step adapt the area 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.810
 lumbar and a third step adapt the area 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.780
 scleral lens that's why it's called 123 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.970
 adaptation in three steps was an event 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.250
 of high scientific level for quality 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.540
 of its speakers and the support of 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:21.219
 commercial houses like excel with tax 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:24.099
 or frost ss polished and Otálora sa s sofia 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:25.989
 with glasses and I saw health 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:29.620
 I think it once the 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:32.319
 practical part the theoretical part the part 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.939
 practice it becomes much much easier 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.459
 I have had experience in handling 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:39.549
 of the lens I wanted to attend to complement 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.980
 that experience already seems excellent 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:44.639
 the dynamics everything has been very very well 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.639
 planned
