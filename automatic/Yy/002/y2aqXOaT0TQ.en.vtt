bunnies let's go to the hood since

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.850 
bunnies let's go to the hood since
that's<00:00:42.450> really<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.809> most<00:00:42.930> important<00:00:43.559> part<00:00:43.590> of

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
that's really the most important part of

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.000 
that's really the most important part of
the<00:00:43.980> parka<00:00:46.670> but<00:00:47.670> hood<00:00:47.850> has<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.120> fake<00:00:49.079> fur<00:00:49.440> trim

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
the parka but hood has a fake fur trim

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.920 
the parka but hood has a fake fur trim
and<00:00:50.370> there's<00:00:50.550> nothing<00:00:50.820> wrong<00:00:51.030> with<00:00:51.090> fake<00:00:51.570> fur

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
and there's nothing wrong with fake fur

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.020 
and there's nothing wrong with fake fur
but<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.320> problem<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.550> trim<00:00:53.850> is

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
but the problem is is that the trim is

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.420 
but the problem is is that the trim is
removable<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:55.410> let's<00:00:55.739> look<00:00:55.860> at<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.070> on<00:00:56.309> the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
removable so let's look at it on the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.869 
removable so let's look at it on the
side<00:00:56.730> here<00:00:57.090> as<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:58.140> can<00:00:58.199> see<00:00:58.640> there's<00:00:59.640> plenty

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
side here as you can see there's plenty

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.639 
side here as you can see there's plenty
of<00:01:00.120> air<00:01:00.359> space<00:01:00.719> here<00:01:01.050> because<00:01:01.410> it's<00:01:01.559> a

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
of air space here because it's a

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.359 
of air space here because it's a
removable<00:01:02.840> fur<00:01:03.840> trend<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:04.680> that's<00:01:04.920> gonna<00:01:05.100> let

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
removable fur trend so that's gonna let

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.679 
removable fur trend so that's gonna let
air<00:01:06.150> in<00:01:06.570> really<00:01:07.439> they<00:01:07.799> should<00:01:08.010> have<00:01:08.689> sewed

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
air in really they should have sewed

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.330 
air in really they should have sewed
down<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.020> trim<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.890> would<00:01:11.040> have<00:01:11.159> made<00:01:11.310> it

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
down the trim that would have made it

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.260 
down the trim that would have made it
much<00:01:11.760> better<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.930> hood<00:01:13.260> itself<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.950> also

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
much better the hood itself is also

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.609 
much better the hood itself is also
