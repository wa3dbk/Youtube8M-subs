00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.549
 nice modaris they would n't have of 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:09.100
 this man spotlight 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:11.320
 today we talk about the extra dr or the 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.440
 mode that adds two ports in minecraft 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.870
 this means we can decorate 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.840
 the house in a different way yes because 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.850
 we can say add all these 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.610
 doors in our home and really are 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.020
 so much comparison to the two we had of 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.180
 usually in minecraft or that of 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.699
 wood is iron while now 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.969
 we have all kinds of wood then 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:36.550
 we have glosses then we have different 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:38.829
 sense in the so on also of gold and of 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.789
 diamond and then we also have of 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.100
 obsidian and so on 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:43.929
 one thing I want to tell you is that some 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.389
 these normally open for example 

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:48.399
 wood this and so on 

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:51.309
 that is, the right button while some 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.260
 need lever or button a 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.899
 depending on how you want to decorate the house 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.249
 I felt how you want 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.229
 while we have that of obsidian which 

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:01.359
 he asks you another thing we say if not 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:02.139
 you have clear ideas and you have not understood 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.710
 something 

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:08.229
 in the post in description or convenient e 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.060
 download the usual wife find the 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.840
 various information found information 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:17.350
 And what we need to say is true 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.109
 we use the methods to open the doors 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.600
 crafting then find download thing 

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:25.299
 will require fashions and the tutorial in English 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.990
 the release in description instead the 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.820
 download 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.590
 then maybe because the mode requires forge 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.579
 and I leave the tutorial in Italian 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.500
 so it is easier to say and furthermore it 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.570
 I write 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.219
 so i hope this ways pleases me 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.829
 really like it because there are 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:45.579
 many types of say of doors 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:47.320
 almost any material then 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.420
 allows to customize as we want 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.530
 our home while we could 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.640
 use only two 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.710
 we are two doors two or two times 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.679

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.680

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:07.800
