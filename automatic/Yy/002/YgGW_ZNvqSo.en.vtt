00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.610
 The cooper pas or copper paste has 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.630
 important and outstanding applications 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.630
 let's see them 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.620
 and the copper paste blind care presents 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.230
 different characteristics among them 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.780
 that would support up to 1200 degrees 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.970
 Temperature can also be used in 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.220
 industrial applications in all 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.110
 those bolted joints that well 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.750
 by exposure to weathering 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:45.760
 high pressures or high temperatures are 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.760
 you risk gripping these joints 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.989
 ah 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.260
 again our workshop to introduce you 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.690
 the cooper pass copper paste we have it 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.210
 available we remember in spray or also 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.980
 in pasta its main function already 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.890
 we said is the anti-flu one that this 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.990
 good way then we can make the 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.370
 unions bolted to the passage of 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.220
 time the oxide of the high 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.840
 temperatures are stiff we go 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.120
 to see that practical example we are going to take 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.520
 our screws that we have it in the 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.590
 low part of our car in the 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.590
 exhaust system we lift the vehicle 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.790
 well we already have the car up and 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.530
 let's take out that screw that 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.530
 we have in the exhaust system 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.520
 here we have it 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.250
 and then apply the paste 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.950
 copper we remember that we can apply 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.450
 a distinctly although this one only gets more 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.750
 recommended for the terminals of the 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.750
 drums 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:24.750
 we open the pasta and it's very easy with 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.910
 help of the finger we count and we place it 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.190
 perfectly on the thread that is not 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.520
 we have no gap or any area 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.330
 about which we have not deposited 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.330
 lamb pasta 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.890
 we clean ourselves 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.840
 and we go again to place it on 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.970
 ah 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.330
 Well, we already have our car under 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:03.569
 and now we're going to open the hood for 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:08.260
 place on the battery terminals 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:10.210
 the copper paste spray we are going to 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.520
 pick it up 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.700
 we shake well remember this is always 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.220
 important 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.720
 and we apply it 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.720
 remember about the terminal 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.600
 and also here 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.090
 we can also apply the cooper pass or 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.430
 copper paste on the screws or 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.410
 Asparagus of the wheel in the same way 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:43.310
 that we have seen open the container 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:45.190
 we help each other with the finger and we cover all 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.670
 the thread area 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.760
 we put together well 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:54.030
 and we had perfect day for 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.290
 apply it on the wheel 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.079
 in threading and masters 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.599
 and with this we would conclude some of the 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:03.900
 applications of the cooper pass or paste 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.900
 copper 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.269
 do not 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.310
 do not 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.070
 to 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.220
 ah 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.900
 ah 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.780
 i 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.060
 i 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.360
 ah
