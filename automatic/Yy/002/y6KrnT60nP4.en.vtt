00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
this like one split-second decision he

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.179 
this like one split-second decision he
starts<00:02:32.689> off<00:02:32.810> really<00:02:33.140> intensely<00:02:33.739> because<00:02:34.099> you

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:34.189 
starts off really intensely because you

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:35.949 
starts off really intensely because you
have<00:02:34.340> a<00:02:34.370> couple<00:02:34.730> chapters<00:02:34.909> of<00:02:35.269> her<00:02:35.390> describing

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
have a couple chapters of her describing

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.899 
have a couple chapters of her describing
how<00:02:36.109> this<00:02:36.680> murder<00:02:36.980> took<00:02:37.310> place<00:02:37.489> and<00:02:37.879> then<00:02:38.889> the

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:39.909 
how this murder took place and then the

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:42.819 
how this murder took place and then the
psychological<00:02:40.909> aspect<00:02:41.510> of<00:02:41.659> it<00:02:41.810> really<00:02:42.439> starts

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
psychological aspect of it really starts

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.009 
psychological aspect of it really starts
to<00:02:42.980> kick<00:02:43.189> in<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:43.609> then<00:02:43.909> it<00:02:44.090> gets<00:02:44.269> slow<00:02:44.629> and<00:02:44.959> I

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
to kick in and then it gets slow and I

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.869 
to kick in and then it gets slow and I
think<00:02:45.319> this<00:02:45.500> is<00:02:45.680> where<00:02:45.889> this<00:02:46.099> book<00:02:46.340> loses<00:02:46.849> a

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
think this is where this book loses a

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.509 
think this is where this book loses a
lot<00:02:47.120> of<00:02:47.269> people<00:02:47.629> I<00:02:47.810> haven't<00:02:48.260> heard<00:02:48.620> many

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
lot of people I haven't heard many

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.000 
lot of people I haven't heard many
positive<00:02:50.299> things<00:02:50.599> about<00:02:51.079> this<00:02:51.439> book<00:02:51.739> I<00:02:51.859> mean

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
positive things about this book I mean

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.710 
positive things about this book I mean
the<00:02:52.129> lovely<00:02:52.459> bones<00:02:52.639> and<00:02:52.909> lucky<00:02:53.180> definitely<00:02:53.689> a

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
the lovely bones and lucky definitely a

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.750 
the lovely bones and lucky definitely a
lot<00:02:53.959> of<00:02:54.109> positive<00:02:54.560> things<00:02:54.590> from<00:02:54.950> those<00:02:55.189> this

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
lot of positive things from those this

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.490 
lot of positive things from those this
one<00:02:56.000> not<00:02:56.239> so<00:02:56.450> much<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:56.870> I<00:02:56.900> really<00:02:57.200> think<00:02:57.349> it's

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
one not so much and I really think it's

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.440 
one not so much and I really think it's
because<00:02:57.799> people<00:02:57.859> get<00:02:58.459> lost<00:02:58.760> in<00:02:59.090> that<00:02:59.209> middle

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
because people get lost in that middle

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.000 
because people get lost in that middle
section<00:02:59.930> and<00:03:00.049> they<00:03:00.200> just<00:03:00.409> can't<00:03:00.799> make<00:03:00.950> it

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
section and they just can't make it

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.750 
section and they just can't make it
through<00:03:01.329> however<00:03:02.329> it<00:03:02.750> does<00:03:03.230> pick<00:03:04.069> up<00:03:04.099> again<00:03:04.609> at

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
through however it does pick up again at

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.330 
through however it does pick up again at
the<00:03:04.790> end<00:03:04.909> it<00:03:05.750> really<00:03:06.139> started<00:03:06.739> to<00:03:06.799> grab<00:03:07.069> me

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
the end it really started to grab me

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.830 
the end it really started to grab me
just<00:03:07.879> like<00:03:07.970> it<00:03:08.000> had<00:03:08.209> done<00:03:08.359> in<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.629> first

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
just like it had done in the first

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.170 
just like it had done in the first
couple<00:03:09.169> pages<00:03:09.370> towards<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.819> end<00:03:10.939> of<00:03:11.060> the

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
couple pages towards the end of the

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.970 
couple pages towards the end of the
novel<00:03:11.359> so<00:03:11.689> that<00:03:11.810> was<00:03:11.959> nice<00:03:12.079> to<00:03:12.139> sort<00:03:12.409> of<00:03:12.560> finish

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
novel so that was nice to sort of finish

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.259 
novel so that was nice to sort of finish
it<00:03:13.129> on<00:03:13.220> a<00:03:13.250> better<00:03:13.459> note<00:03:13.519> rather<00:03:13.849> than<00:03:14.090> just

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
it on a better note rather than just

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.659 
it on a better note rather than just
having<00:03:14.569> everything<00:03:14.870> sort<00:03:15.230> of<00:03:15.260> fall<00:03:15.829> down<00:03:16.370> and

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:16.669 
having everything sort of fall down and

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:19.659 
having everything sort of fall down and
just<00:03:16.790> you<00:03:17.060> know<00:03:17.319> Helen<00:03:18.319> has<00:03:18.500> a<00:03:18.530> lot<00:03:18.919> of<00:03:19.069> time<00:03:19.310> to

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:19.669 
just you know Helen has a lot of time to

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:23.199 
just you know Helen has a lot of time to
sit<00:03:19.909> on<00:03:20.090> this<00:03:20.299> dark<00:03:21.280> side<00:03:22.280> of<00:03:22.310> things<00:03:22.790> and

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
sit on this dark side of things and

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.990 
sit on this dark side of things and
really<00:03:23.799> sit<00:03:24.799> in<00:03:24.949> her<00:03:25.129> house

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
really sit in her house

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.990 
really sit in her house
or<00:03:26.060> sit<00:03:26.659> in<00:03:26.750> her<00:03:26.930> car<00:03:27.229> and<00:03:27.680> just<00:03:27.889> ponder<00:03:28.729> things

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
or sit in her car and just ponder things

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.149 
or sit in her car and just ponder things
and<00:03:29.389> so<00:03:29.780> it<00:03:29.900> is<00:03:30.019> appropriate<00:03:30.650> that<00:03:30.680> we<00:03:30.919> have

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:31.159 
and so it is appropriate that we have

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.270 
and so it is appropriate that we have
these<00:03:31.400> slow<00:03:31.760> moments<00:03:32.329> in<00:03:32.449> the<00:03:32.690> book<00:03:33.129> but<00:03:34.129> it

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
these slow moments in the book but it

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.149 
these slow moments in the book but it
doesn't<00:03:34.699> make<00:03:34.970> for<00:03:35.510> a<00:03:35.540> thrilling<00:03:36.349> read<00:03:36.829> it

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:37.159 
doesn't make for a thrilling read it

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:40.509 
doesn't make for a thrilling read it
makes<00:03:37.459> for<00:03:37.970> a<00:03:38.030> dark<00:03:38.599> psychological<00:03:39.590> read<00:03:40.220> the

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
makes for a dark psychological read the
