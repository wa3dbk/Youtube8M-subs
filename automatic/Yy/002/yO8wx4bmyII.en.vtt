you start them right you put a little

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.270 
you start them right you put a little
anti-seize<00:00:58.410> on<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.649> threads<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.160> go

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
anti-seize on the threads and you go

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.010 
anti-seize on the threads and you go
there<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.699> can<00:00:59.879> gently<00:01:00.180> get<00:01:00.600> these<00:01:00.809> guys

therefore<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.220> starter<00:02:27.580> kit

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
therefore the starter kit

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:40.360 
therefore the starter kit
that<00:02:30.030> light<00:02:30.180> off<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.540> are<00:02:30.660> light<00:02:30.810> off<00:02:31.190> okay

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.430 

dude<00:02:40.940> that<00:02:41.120> runs<00:02:41.330> nice<00:02:41.600> compared<00:02:42.140> to<00:02:42.230> what<00:02:42.319> it

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
dude that runs nice compared to what it

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:50.970 
dude that runs nice compared to what it
was<00:02:42.850> hey<00:02:43.850> oh<00:02:43.880> yeah

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.500 

we're<00:02:51.340> not<00:02:51.430> burping<00:02:51.819> in<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.000> oil<00:02:52.150> out<00:02:52.330> of<00:02:52.360> the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
we're not burping in the oil out of the

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.680 
we're not burping in the oil out of the
bottom

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:11.940 

cool

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.870 

look

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.470 

then<00:03:15.480> shut<00:03:15.690> it<00:03:15.720> down<00:03:17.060> we're<00:03:18.060> gonna<00:03:18.150> decrease

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
then shut it down we're gonna decrease

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.880 
then shut it down we're gonna decrease
the<00:03:18.720> engine<00:03:18.990> real<00:03:19.140> quick<00:03:19.320> put<00:03:19.470> all<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.680> tools

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
away and then take it for a test drive

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.920 
away and then take it for a test drive
oh<00:03:22.010> yeah<00:03:23.340> underneath<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.210> manifold<00:03:24.600> we<00:03:24.720> found

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
oh yeah underneath the manifold we found

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.800 
oh yeah underneath the manifold we found
a<00:03:24.990> little<00:03:25.200> mouse<00:03:25.380> nest<00:03:25.940> awesome<00:03:26.940> that's<00:03:27.630> why

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
a little mouse nest awesome that's why

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.180 
a little mouse nest awesome that's why
all<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.020> wires<00:03:28.200> were<00:03:28.410> chewed<00:03:28.620> on<00:03:28.740> this<00:03:28.980> thing

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
all the wires were chewed on this thing

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.470 
all the wires were chewed on this thing
but<00:03:29.340> I<00:03:29.400> think<00:03:29.550> I<00:03:29.610> got<00:03:29.700> all<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:29.910> wires<00:03:30.060> sorted

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
but I think I got all the wires sorted

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.700 
but I think I got all the wires sorted
out<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:30.720> only<00:03:30.840> thing<00:03:30.990> I<00:03:31.080> have<00:03:31.200> left<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:31.560> do<00:03:31.680> is
