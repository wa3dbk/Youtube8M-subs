00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
been done over the last 10 years but

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:02.939 
been done over the last 10 years but
made<00:01:01.239> it<00:01:01.360> much<00:01:01.510> more<00:01:01.629> flexible<00:01:02.199> so<00:01:02.799> it's

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
made it much more flexible so it's

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.279 
made it much more flexible so it's
easier<00:01:03.519> than<00:01:03.670> ever<00:01:03.820> to<00:01:04.239> do<00:01:04.360> Atkins<00:01:04.750> ok<00:01:05.110> that's

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:05.289 
easier than ever to do Atkins ok that's

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:06.570 
easier than ever to do Atkins ok that's
what<00:01:05.409> I<00:01:05.440> like<00:01:05.590> to<00:01:05.679> hear<00:01:05.710> flexibility<00:01:06.429> no<00:01:06.550> I

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
what I like to hear flexibility no I

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.040 
what I like to hear flexibility no I
know<00:01:06.700> when<00:01:07.210> I've<00:01:07.300> heard<00:01:07.450> of<00:01:07.539> Atkins<00:01:07.810> what<00:01:08.020> I

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
know when I've heard of Atkins what I

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.870 
know when I've heard of Atkins what I
think<00:01:08.259> about<00:01:08.350> is<00:01:08.619> ok<00:01:09.009> you<00:01:09.069> limit<00:01:09.399> your<00:01:09.490> carbs

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
think about is ok you limit your carbs

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.100 
think about is ok you limit your carbs
that's<00:01:10.119> that's<00:01:10.509> how<00:01:10.659> you<00:01:10.720> do<00:01:10.929> it<00:01:10.960> you<00:01:11.080> just

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
that's that's how you do it you just

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.570 
that's that's how you do it you just
take<00:01:11.590> the<00:01:11.710> carbs<00:01:11.950> out<00:01:12.009> of<00:01:12.130> your<00:01:12.220> diet<00:01:12.369> what's

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
but now anytime you overwhelm your sugar

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.180 
but now anytime you overwhelm your sugar
storing<00:02:07.179> capacity<00:02:07.750> you<00:02:07.810> make<00:02:07.990> fat<00:02:08.289> so<00:02:09.009> this

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
storing capacity you make fat so this

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.580 
storing capacity you make fat so this
blue<00:02:09.399> bucket<00:02:09.850> here<00:02:10.119> is<00:02:10.299> actually<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:10.899> fat<00:02:11.140> so

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
blue bucket here is actually the fat so

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.380 
blue bucket here is actually the fat so
this<00:02:11.709> bucket<00:02:12.100> is<00:02:12.220> basically<00:02:12.549> like<00:02:12.730> my<00:02:13.180> thighs

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
this bucket is basically like my thighs

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.370 
this bucket is basically like my thighs
well<00:02:14.459> it's<00:02:15.459> supposed<00:02:15.609> to<00:02:15.940> um<00:02:16.359> but<00:02:16.959> do<00:02:17.109> you<00:02:17.200> just

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
well it's supposed to um but do you just

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.990 
well it's supposed to um but do you just
keep<00:02:17.560> eating<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.950> sugar<00:02:18.130> and<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:18.459> overwhelm

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
keep eating the sugar and you overwhelm

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.610 
keep eating the sugar and you overwhelm
the<00:02:19.209> sugar<00:02:19.450> store<00:02:19.810> it<00:02:19.959> and<00:02:20.140> then<00:02:20.230> it<00:02:20.470> becomes

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
the sugar store it and then it becomes

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.979 
the sugar store it and then it becomes
fat<00:02:21.220> so<00:02:22.060> that's<00:02:22.239> what<00:02:22.390> happens<00:02:22.690> when<00:02:22.840> you<00:02:22.959> eat

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
fat so that's what happens when you eat

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.990 
fat so that's what happens when you eat
too<00:02:23.620> much<00:02:23.799> sugar<00:02:24.100> so<00:02:24.670> that's<00:02:24.820> what's

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
too much sugar so that's what's

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.430 
too much sugar so that's what's
happening<00:02:25.269> when<00:02:25.420> I<00:02:25.450> eat<00:02:25.660> this<00:02:25.870> giant<00:02:26.200> cup<00:02:26.350> of

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
happening when I eat this giant cup of

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.630 
happening when I eat this giant cup of
jellybeans<00:02:26.829> here<00:02:27.040> that's<00:02:27.280> right<00:02:27.400> so

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
jellybeans here that's right so

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.849 
jellybeans here that's right so
basically<00:02:28.030> what<00:02:28.359> we<00:02:28.480> can<00:02:28.660> do<00:02:28.840> is<00:02:29.049> limit<00:02:29.410> the

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:29.859 
basically what we can do is limit the

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:33.270 
basically what we can do is limit the
carb<00:02:30.459> intake<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.299> eat<00:02:31.510> some<00:02:31.900> great<00:02:32.769> foods<00:02:33.069> for

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
carb intake and eat some great foods for

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.650 
carb intake and eat some great foods for
our<00:02:33.310> system<00:02:33.609> I<00:02:33.700> notice<00:02:33.970> that<00:02:34.090> over<00:02:34.299> here<00:02:34.420> we

then the maintenance phase if you have
fruit<00:02:58.780> in<00:02:59.049> that<00:02:59.110> so<00:02:59.739> you<00:02:59.769> may<00:03:00.340> be<00:03:00.400> able<00:03:00.609> if<00:03:00.790> your

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:00.939 
fruit in that so you may be able if your

can<00:03:03.549> have<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.849> berries<00:03:04.180> so<00:03:04.420> one<00:03:04.540> of<00:03:04.569> the

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:04.659 
can have the berries so one of the

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:06.089 
can have the berries so one of the
misconceptions<00:03:04.989> is<00:03:05.560> you<00:03:05.709> know<00:03:05.799> you<00:03:05.890> think<00:03:06.040> of

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
misconceptions is you know you think of

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:07.229 
misconceptions is you know you think of
someone<00:03:06.250> on<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.430> Atkins<00:03:06.579> diet<00:03:06.790> you<00:03:07.000> think<00:03:07.180> of

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
someone on the Atkins diet you think of

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.699 
someone on the Atkins diet you think of
them<00:03:07.359> having<00:03:07.599> this<00:03:07.659> big<00:03:07.840> plate<00:03:08.170> with<00:03:08.379> steak

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
them having this big plate with steak

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.170 
them having this big plate with steak
and<00:03:08.920> like<00:03:09.010> a<00:03:09.040> pound<00:03:09.280> of<00:03:09.459> bacon<00:03:09.609> on<00:03:09.879> it<00:03:09.909> but

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
and like a pound of bacon on it but

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.640 
and like a pound of bacon on it but
that's<00:03:10.269> not<00:03:10.510> necessarily<00:03:10.959> what<00:03:11.200> we're<00:03:11.319> doing

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
that's not necessarily what we're doing

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.410 
that's not necessarily what we're doing
well<00:03:11.950> you<00:03:12.280> know<00:03:12.370> those<00:03:12.730> foods<00:03:12.970> are<00:03:13.060> okay<00:03:13.359> but

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
no there's much more variety and that's

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.069 
no there's much more variety and that's
the<00:03:15.670> key<00:03:15.849> to<00:03:15.970> being<00:03:16.150> able<00:03:16.239> to<00:03:16.359> do<00:03:16.480> it<00:03:16.599> for

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
the key to being able to do it for

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.930 
the key to being able to do it for
lifetime<00:03:17.290> is<00:03:17.889> you<00:03:18.069> have<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.370> have<00:03:18.519> delicious

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:30.569 
those first couple of weeks of doing it
but<00:03:29.799> you've<00:03:29.950> come<00:03:30.099> up<00:03:30.159> with<00:03:30.250> a<00:03:30.370> way<00:03:30.549> to

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
but you've come up with a way to

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.280 
but you've come up with a way to
eliminate<00:03:31.209> some<00:03:31.389> of<00:03:31.420> those<00:03:31.540> side<00:03:31.989> effects

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290

some<00:03:32.829> people<00:03:33.099> have<00:03:33.400> had<00:03:33.670> a<00:03:33.700> cavity<00:03:34.209> when<00:03:34.420> they

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
some people have had a cavity when they

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.110 
some people have had a cavity when they
transition<00:03:35.109> from<00:03:35.430> burning<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.549> sugar<00:03:36.819> to

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
transition from burning the sugar to

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.420 
transition from burning the sugar to
burning<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.450> fat<00:03:37.720> that's<00:03:38.379> easy<00:03:38.590> to<00:03:38.799> remedy

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
burning the fat that's easy to remedy

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.610 
burning the fat that's easy to remedy
it's<00:03:39.579> just<00:03:39.790> a<00:03:39.879> little<00:03:40.000> salt<00:03:40.299> substitute<00:03:40.930> just

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
it's just a little salt substitute just

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.250 
it's just a little salt substitute just
like<00:03:41.769> bouillon<00:03:42.609> cube<00:03:43.060> one<00:03:43.480> or<00:03:43.629> two<00:03:43.750> a<00:03:43.780> day<00:03:43.900> and

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
like bouillon cube one or two a day and

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.379 
like bouillon cube one or two a day and
we<00:03:44.349> explain<00:03:44.799> that<00:03:44.950> in<00:03:45.159> the<00:03:45.189> book<00:03:45.430> oh<00:03:45.670> wow

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
we explain that in the book oh wow

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:47.280 
we explain that in the book oh wow
so<00:03:46.510> that's<00:03:46.689> the<00:03:46.810> thing<00:03:46.959> that<00:03:46.989> people

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
so that's the thing that people

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.509 
so that's the thing that people
complained<00:03:47.620> about<00:03:47.709> they<00:03:47.919> can<00:03:48.040> completely<00:03:48.370> get

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519
