00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
the camera now that's what the what this

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.700 
the camera now that's what the what this
is<00:01:41.400> using<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.270> thing<00:01:43.110> that's<00:01:43.229> built<00:01:43.500> into

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
is using is the thing that's built into

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.020 
is using is the thing that's built into
the<00:01:43.950> iPhone<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.460> think<00:01:44.640> it's<00:01:44.759> called<00:01:44.909> the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
the iPhone I think it's called the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.300 
the iPhone I think it's called the
gyroscope<00:01:45.810> or<00:01:46.079> maybe<00:01:47.009> it's<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
gyroscope or maybe it's the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.960 
gyroscope or maybe it's the
accelerometer<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:48.299> I'm<00:01:48.450> doing<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:48.840> just<00:01:49.079> by

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
accelerometer so I'm doing this just by

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.899 
accelerometer so I'm doing this just by
tilting<00:01:50.970> my<00:01:51.500> iPhone<00:01:52.500> up<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.920> down<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.850> to

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
tilting my iPhone up and down so to

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.060 
tilting my iPhone up and down so to
toggle<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.509> off<00:01:54.570> all<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.290> do<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.649> push<00:01:55.860> that

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
toggle that off all you do is push that

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.450 
toggle that off all you do is push that
little<00:01:56.340> icon<00:01:56.820> again<00:01:58.009> that<00:01:59.009> looks<00:01:59.189> like<00:01:59.310> the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
little icon again that looks like the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.580 
little icon again that looks like the
circle<00:01:59.850> with<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.060> ring<00:02:00.240> around<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:00.899> now

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
circle with the ring around it and now

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.120 
circle with the ring around it and now
you<00:02:01.649> can<00:02:01.950> see<00:02:02.130> it's<00:02:02.340> white<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:04.070> personally<00:02:05.070> I

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
you can see it's white and personally I

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.440 
you can see it's white and personally I
don't<00:02:05.250> prefer<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.119> fly<00:02:06.390> using<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:08.450> gyroscope

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
don't prefer to fly using the gyroscope

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.669 
don't prefer to fly using the gyroscope
because<00:02:09.840> when<00:02:10.289> you're<00:02:10.410> holding<00:02:10.530> the

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
because when you're holding the

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.170 
because when you're holding the
controller<00:02:11.069> sometimes<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.670> have<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.819> tendency

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
controller sometimes you have a tendency

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.820

as you can see there it's going down you
push<00:02:51.540> up<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.959> camera<00:02:52.290> will<00:02:52.410> go<00:02:52.530> up<00:02:52.740> and<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.400> like

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
push up the camera will go up and I like

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.580 
push up the camera will go up and I like
this<00:02:53.850> one<00:02:54.030> because<00:02:54.150> you<00:02:54.390> just<00:02:54.570> tap<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:55.320> you

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.280 
about half way right there and then I'm
going<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.240> take<00:03:03.360> it<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.630> most<00:03:03.810> extreme

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290

going to take it to the most extreme
upward<00:03:04.770> position<00:03:05.120> and<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.510> like<00:03:06.690> how<00:03:06.870> off<00:03:07.050> at

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
upward position and I like how off at

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.840 
upward position and I like how off at
the<00:03:07.380> right<00:03:07.560> like<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:08.010> mentioned<00:03:08.459> earlier<00:03:08.820> you

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
because it's just a visual

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.780 
because it's just a visual
acknowledgement<00:03:19.530> that<00:03:19.590> you<00:03:20.010> can't<00:03:20.250> go<00:03:20.400> up<00:03:20.430> any

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
more see I'm at the upward most position

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.420 
more see I'm at the upward most position
likewise<00:03:23.940> now<00:03:24.269> if<00:03:24.420> I<00:03:24.510> scroll<00:03:24.780> down<00:03:25.250> it's<00:03:26.250> going

most<00:03:28.290> position<00:03:28.800> right<00:03:29.790> there<00:03:29.989> so<00:03:30.989> that's<00:03:31.200> just

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
most position right there so that's just

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.509 
most position right there so that's just
really<00:03:31.620> neat<00:03:32.000> it's<00:03:33.000> like<00:03:33.209> it's<00:03:33.420> a<00:03:33.540> cool<00:03:33.870> a<00:03:34.519> cool

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
way to control the camera that's

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.229 
way to control the camera that's
something<00:03:37.410> you<00:03:37.530> don't<00:03:37.800> get<00:03:38.209> with<00:03:39.209> the
