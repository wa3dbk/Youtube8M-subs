know with another video whenever that
does<00:00:34.890> happen<00:00:35.300> first<00:00:36.300> they<00:00:36.629> are<00:00:36.720> going<00:00:36.960> to

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.019 
does happen first they are going to

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:39.530

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.320 
reduce the K tends bullet damage from 34
to<00:00:39.570> 33<00:00:40.470> now<00:00:41.070> honestly<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.670> will<00:00:41.850> make<00:00:41.940> zero

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
to 33 now honestly this will make zero

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.210 
to 33 now honestly this will make zero
difference<00:00:42.809> whatsoever<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.500> how<00:00:43.680> fast<00:00:43.980> this

difference whatsoever to how fast this

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.820 
difference whatsoever to how fast this
thing<00:00:44.280> kills<00:00:44.850> if<00:00:45.120> viscera<00:00:46.050> really<00:00:46.470> wanted<00:00:46.739> to

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:46.830 
thing kills if viscera really wanted to

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.229 
thing kills if viscera really wanted to
nerf<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.190> vector<00:00:47.489> they<00:00:47.699> should<00:00:47.879> tone<00:00:48.089> its

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
nerf the vector they should tone its

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.389 
nerf the vector they should tone its
rate<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.449> fire<00:00:48.720> down<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.290> about<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.559> thousand<00:00:50.190> or

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
rate of fire down to about a thousand or

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.610 
rate of fire down to about a thousand or
if<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:50.850> not<00:00:50.879> possible<00:00:51.170> they<00:00:52.170> can<00:00:52.290> simply

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
if that is not possible they can simply

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.100 
if that is not possible they can simply
increase<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.309> recoil<00:00:53.760> now<00:00:54.120> with<00:00:54.300> 1200<00:00:54.960> RPM

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
increase the recoil now with 1200 RPM

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.229 
increase the recoil now with 1200 RPM
this<00:00:55.649> thing<00:00:55.860> should<00:00:56.129> have<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> lot<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.700> kick<00:00:57.030> and

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
this thing should have a lot of kick and

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.940 
this thing should have a lot of kick and
it<00:00:57.690> really<00:00:57.899> doesn't<00:00:58.200> at<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.530> moment<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:58.890> I

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:58.950 
it really doesn't at the moment and I

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.010 
it really doesn't at the moment and I
think<00:00:59.160> that's<00:00:59.309> why<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.610> is<00:00:59.879> so<00:00:59.940> good<00:01:00.420> now<00:01:00.960> if

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
think that's why it is so good now if

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.720 
think that's why it is so good now if
you<00:01:01.140> look<00:01:01.260> back<00:01:01.410> at<00:01:01.620> battlefield<00:01:01.980> 4<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.280> famas

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
you look back at battlefield 4 is famas

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.639 
you look back at battlefield 4 is famas
that<00:01:03.000> thing<00:01:03.180> was<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.360> ridiculous<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:04.229> handle<00:01:04.530> it

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649 
that thing was a ridiculous to handle it

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:06.800 
that thing was a ridiculous to handle it
hey<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.860> lot<00:01:05.190> of<00:01:05.309> recoil<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.360> one<00:01:06.630> way

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
hey a lot of recoil so that is one way

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.440 
hey a lot of recoil so that is one way
they<00:01:06.990> can<00:01:07.140> nerf<00:01:07.289> the<00:01:07.470> k10<00:01:07.890> as<00:01:08.100> well<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:09.149> next

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
they can nerf the k10 as well the next

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.540 
they can nerf the k10 as well the next
thing<00:01:09.600> they<00:01:09.750> plan<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.259> change<00:01:10.619> our<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.160> Sega

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
thing they plan to change our the Sega

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.120 
thing they plan to change our the Sega
and<00:01:11.880> PTR<00:01:12.360> DMR's<00:01:13.170> they're<00:01:13.560> reducing<00:01:14.009> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
and PTR DMR's they're reducing the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.070 
and PTR DMR's they're reducing the
recoil<00:01:14.550> to<00:01:14.729> make<00:01:14.880> them<00:01:15.030> just<00:01:15.360> as<00:01:15.539> good<00:01:15.750> as<00:01:15.930> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
recoil to make them just as good as the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.010 
recoil to make them just as good as the
cops<00:01:16.350> DMR's<00:01:16.979> now<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.670> don't<00:01:17.789> usually<00:01:18.030> use<00:01:18.390> DMR's

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
cops DMR's now I don't usually use DMR's

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.600 
cops DMR's now I don't usually use DMR's
but<00:01:19.259> it's<00:01:19.380> good<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.680> they<00:01:19.800> plan<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.340> make<00:01:20.490> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
but it's good that they plan to make the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.760 
but it's good that they plan to make the
factions<00:01:21.119> more<00:01:21.360> even<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.899> think<00:01:22.440> that's<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.649> good

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
factions more even I think that's a good

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.430 
factions more even I think that's a good
move<00:01:22.979> considering<00:01:23.429> you<00:01:23.670> already<00:01:24.119> need<00:01:24.440> 1250

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
move considering you already need 1250

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.870 
move considering you already need 1250

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
kills with any weapon to make it

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.960 
kills with any weapon to make it
available<00:01:27.090> on<00:01:27.450> both<00:01:27.660> factions<00:01:28.110> as<00:01:28.640> for<00:01:29.640> battle

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
available on both factions as for battle

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.089 
available on both factions as for battle
rifles<00:01:30.330> they're<00:01:30.599> reducing<00:01:31.110> recoil<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.800> H

00:01:32.089 --> 00:01:32.099 
rifles they're reducing recoil of the H

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:34.609 
rifles they're reducing recoil of the H

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
car and HK 51 to make them perform

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.730 
car and HK 51 to make them perform
similar<00:01:35.190> to<00:01:35.399> the<00:01:35.520> scar-h<00:01:35.910> in<00:01:36.390> sa<00:01:36.750> 58<00:01:37.289> for<00:01:37.590> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
similar to the scar-h in sa 58 for the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.190 
similar to the scar-h in sa 58 for the
cops<00:01:38.009> side<00:01:38.310> now<00:01:39.000> again<00:01:39.119> just<00:01:39.509> like<00:01:39.599> the<00:01:39.660> DMR's

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
cops side now again just like the DMR's

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.139 
cops side now again just like the DMR's
this<00:01:40.440> is<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.590> very<00:01:40.890> good<00:01:41.039> thing<00:01:41.220> weapons<00:01:41.970> on

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
this is a very good thing weapons on

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.300 
this is a very good thing weapons on
both<00:01:42.360> sides<00:01:42.690> should<00:01:43.080> perform<00:01:43.319> pretty<00:01:43.860> similar

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
both sides should perform pretty similar

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.430 
both sides should perform pretty similar
otherwise<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.240> would<00:01:45.390> be<00:01:45.569> considered<00:01:46.050> unfair

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
otherwise it would be considered unfair

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.199 
otherwise it would be considered unfair
in<00:01:46.590> my<00:01:46.739> opinion<00:01:46.979> if<00:01:47.310> they<00:01:47.429> didn't<00:01:47.729> do<00:01:47.819> this<00:01:48.000> it

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:48.209 
in my opinion if they didn't do this it

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:49.999 
in my opinion if they didn't do this it
would<00:01:48.330> make<00:01:48.720> team<00:01:48.989> switching<00:01:49.440> a<00:01:49.560> viable

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
would make team switching a viable

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.410 
would make team switching a viable
option<00:01:50.130> for<00:01:50.399> those<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.819> want<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.119> use<00:01:51.209> the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
option for those that want to use the

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:01.319 
use this weapon yet I think you need to

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:03.499 
use this weapon yet I think you need to
use<00:02:01.500> sabotages<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.520> unlock<00:02:02.819> it<00:02:02.849> and<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.209> rarely

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
use sabotages to unlock it and I rarely

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.479 
use sabotages to unlock it and I rarely
use<00:02:03.690> those<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.410> actually<00:02:04.920> get<00:02:05.039> kills<00:02:05.310> with

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:05.489 
use those and actually get kills with

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:07.219 
use those and actually get kills with
them<00:02:05.640> however<00:02:06.300> it's<00:02:06.539> good<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.869> know<00:02:07.020> they're

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
them however it's good to know they're

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.139 
them however it's good to know they're
making<00:02:07.259> this<00:02:07.590> thing<00:02:07.649> more<00:02:08.009> powerful<00:02:08.190> some

they're pushing out there fall off
starting<00:02:21.480> range<00:02:21.750> as<00:02:21.930> well<00:02:22.140> I<00:02:22.440> assume<00:02:22.950> that

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
starting range as well I assume that

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.800 
starting range as well I assume that
means<00:02:23.280> more<00:02:23.550> damage<00:02:24.030> over<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.390> greater

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
means more damage over a greater

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.230 
means more damage over a greater
distance<00:02:25.140> now<00:02:25.620> I<00:02:25.650> have<00:02:25.860> it<00:02:25.980> use<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.310> fmg9<00:02:26.640> or

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
distance now I have it use the fmg9 or

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.260 
distance now I have it use the fmg9 or
the<00:02:27.390> m<00:02:27.540> /<00:02:27.840> 45<00:02:28.380> yet<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:28.920> usually<00:02:29.340> tend<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:30.030> stick

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
the m / 45 yet I usually tend to stick

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.440 
the m / 45 yet I usually tend to stick
to<00:02:30.330> assault<00:02:30.780> rifles<00:02:31.110> and

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
to assault rifles and

to assault rifles and
carbines<00:02:31.810> whenever<00:02:32.140> I<00:02:32.230> play<00:02:32.530> anyway<00:02:33.459> all<00:02:33.730> of

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
carbines whenever I play anyway all of

carbines whenever I play anyway all of
the<00:02:34.060> battle<00:02:34.450> rifles<00:02:34.780> minimum<00:02:35.230> damage<00:02:35.440> in<00:02:35.830> the

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
the battle rifles minimum damage in the

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.520 
the battle rifles minimum damage in the
game<00:02:36.099> are<00:02:36.370> being<00:02:36.610> increased<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.390> 25<00:02:37.959> yes<00:02:38.349> that

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
game are being increased to 25 yes that

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.500 
game are being increased to 25 yes that
means<00:02:38.620> every<00:02:38.980> single<00:02:39.310> one<00:02:39.489> I<00:02:39.730> notice<00:02:40.360> that

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
means every single one I notice that

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.300 
means every single one I notice that
these<00:02:40.629> weapons<00:02:41.050> tend<00:02:41.349> to<00:02:41.530> suck<00:02:41.890> when<00:02:42.099> you<00:02:42.220> use

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
these weapons tend to suck when you use

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.710 
these weapons tend to suck when you use
them<00:02:42.550> from<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:42.819> distance<00:02:42.849> and<00:02:43.390> that<00:02:43.420> makes<00:02:43.629> no

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
them from a distance and that makes no

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.930 
them from a distance and that makes no
sense<00:02:43.900> battle<00:02:44.590> rifles<00:02:44.920> are<00:02:45.160> a<00:02:45.190> similar<00:02:45.700> to

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
sense battle rifles are a similar to

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.880 
sense battle rifles are a similar to
DMR's<00:02:46.480> in<00:02:46.660> a<00:02:46.720> way<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:47.110> they're<00:02:47.590> supposed<00:02:47.680> to

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
DMR's in a way and they're supposed to

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.860 
DMR's in a way and they're supposed to
be<00:02:48.010> good<00:02:48.190> at<00:02:48.310> medium<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:48.910> longer<00:02:49.150> ranges<00:02:49.660> which

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
be good at medium to longer ranges which

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.690 
be good at medium to longer ranges which
definitely<00:02:50.410> is<00:02:50.530> not<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.890> case<00:02:51.099> in<00:02:51.310> hardline

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
definitely is not the case in hardline

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.910 
definitely is not the case in hardline
and<00:02:51.970> one<00:02:52.510> of<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.720> final<00:02:53.140> changes<00:02:53.530> coming<00:02:53.800> to

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
and one of the final changes coming to

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.979 
and one of the final changes coming to
hard<00:02:54.310> line<00:02:54.550> is<00:02:54.760> that<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.030> AKMs<00:02:55.510> minimum

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
hard line is that the AKMs minimum

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.559 
hard line is that the AKMs minimum
damage<00:02:56.200> is<00:02:56.560> being<00:02:56.739> reduced<00:02:57.069> to<00:02:57.280> 24<00:02:57.970> now

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
damage is being reduced to 24 now

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.449 
damage is being reduced to 24 now
similar<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:59.080> the<00:02:59.200> K<00:02:59.440> tends<00:02:59.739> nerf<00:03:00.069> this<00:03:00.310> will

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
similar to the K tends nerf this will

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.460 
similar to the K tends nerf this will
make<00:03:00.580> a<00:03:00.640> minor<00:03:01.090> difference<00:03:01.629> in<00:03:01.810> at<00:03:02.019> time<00:03:02.260> to

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
make a minor difference in at time to

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.080 
make a minor difference in at time to
kill<00:03:02.709> you're<00:03:03.280> going<00:03:03.519> to<00:03:03.610> need<00:03:03.760> one<00:03:03.940> more

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
kill you're going to need one more

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.880 
kill you're going to need one more
bullet<00:03:04.330> at<00:03:04.630> a<00:03:04.660> distance<00:03:05.200> which<00:03:05.410> will<00:03:05.620> nerf

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
bullet at a distance which will nerf

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.130 
bullet at a distance which will nerf
this<00:03:06.130> thing<00:03:06.340> tremendously<00:03:07.000> it<00:03:07.569> already<00:03:07.840> has<00:03:08.110> a

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
this thing tremendously it already has a

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.229 
this thing tremendously it already has a
slow<00:03:08.410> rate<00:03:08.560> of<00:03:08.620> fire<00:03:08.739> so<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.340> added<00:03:09.670> bullet<00:03:10.060> to

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
slow rate of fire so the added bullet to

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.150 
slow rate of fire so the added bullet to
kill<00:03:10.269> will<00:03:10.870> change<00:03:11.110> how<00:03:11.290> this<00:03:11.470> weapon<00:03:11.799> handles

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
kill will change how this weapon handles

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.339 
kill will change how this weapon handles
from<00:03:12.400> a<00:03:12.459> distance<00:03:12.849> it's<00:03:13.510> going<00:03:13.750> to<00:03:13.870> still<00:03:14.110> kill

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
from a distance it's going to still kill

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:16.199 
from a distance it's going to still kill
fast<00:03:14.680> in<00:03:15.010> close<00:03:15.280> quarters<00:03:15.700> but<00:03:15.880> with<00:03:16.060> it's

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
fast in close quarters but with it's

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.539 
fast in close quarters but with it's
ridiculously<00:03:16.810> slow<00:03:17.140> rate<00:03:17.530> of<00:03:17.560> fire<00:03:17.680> it<00:03:18.160> really

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
ridiculously slow rate of fire it really

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.400 
ridiculously slow rate of fire it really
isn't<00:03:18.880> meant<00:03:19.060> to<00:03:19.120> be<00:03:19.180> used<00:03:19.480> in<00:03:19.720> close<00:03:19.930> quarters

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
isn't meant to be used in close quarters

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.259 
isn't meant to be used in close quarters
so<00:03:20.620> definitely<00:03:21.010> one<00:03:21.250> of<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.489> bigger<00:03:21.760> changes

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
so definitely one of the bigger changes

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.780 
so definitely one of the bigger changes
on<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:22.599> list<00:03:23.010> visceral<00:03:24.010> are<00:03:24.160> including<00:03:24.640> other
