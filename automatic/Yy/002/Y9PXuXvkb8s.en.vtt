00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.140
 chapter 20 

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.820
 the first day of the week Mary Magdalene was morning 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.939
 being a dark to the grave 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.269
 and he took the stone from the grave 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.269
 then he ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.609
 the one that Jesus loved and told them they have taken the sr. 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:21.810
 we know where they have put him 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.810
 and Peter and the other disciple went out and went to the tomb 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:29.800
 they ran together but the other disciple ran faster than Pedro 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.040
 and he came first to the grave 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.770
 and going down to look I saw them at their posts there but did not enter 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.710
 Then Simon Peter came after him and entered the tomb and gave the canvases 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.950
 placed there and the shroud that had been on Jesus' head 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.710
 not put with the canvases 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.580
 but rolled up in a separate place 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.030
 Then the other disciple who had come first to the 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.860
 tomb 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.990
 and gave and believed 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.420
 because they had not yet understood the writing 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.860
 that it was necessary for the resurrection of the dead 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.950
 and the disciples returned to theirs 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.370
 but Maria was outside crying next to the grave 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.000
 and as he cried he leaned down to look inside the grave 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.950
 and he gave two angels with white robes sitting in one to the 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.979
 head and the other at the feet where the body of Jesus had been placed 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.910
 and they told him 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.200
 woman why are you crying 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.060
 He told them why they took my lord and I do not know where they put him 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.440
 when he had said this he turned and saw Jesus who was there but not 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.590
 I knew it was Jesus 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.650
 jesus told him woman because what hours 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.260
 Who are you looking for 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.330
 she thinking it was the gardener told her 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.120
 sir, if you took it 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.600
 Tell me where you put it and I'll take it 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.120
 Jesus told him 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.100
 turning around she told him 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.160
 raponi 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.210
 What does it mean 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.470
 teacher 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.710
 Jesus told him do not touch me because I have not yet raised my father 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.619
 more than anis civil brothers 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.630
 I raise my father and your father 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.800
 at noon, god 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.690
 it was then Mary Magdalene to give the disciples the news that there was 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.779
 seen the lord 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:14.779
 and that he had told him these things 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:16.949
 When the night came that same day 

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:18.599
 the first of the week 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.829
 being the doors closed in the place where the disciples were gathered 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:24.589
 for fear of the Jews 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:27.629
 Jesus came and put in between told them 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.619
 we passed other 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:31.500
 and when he added that said 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.059
 he showed them his hands and his side 

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:37.059
 and the disciples rejoiced seeing the sr 

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:40.179
 then jesus told them again 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:41.809
 peace to you 

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:43.400
 how the father sent me 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.709
 so also joseph shipping 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.489
 and having said this he breathed and told them 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.669
 receive the holy spirit 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:53.959
 there are those who remit is sins are remitted to them 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.069
 and to those who are seen, they are retained 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:01.300
 but thomas one of the two is called dídimo 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.199
 I was not with them when Jesus came 

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:06.429
 they told him the other disciples 

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:08.159
 We have seen the Lord 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:13.010
 he told them if he did not give the sign of the nails in his hands and I was measured 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.159
 in the place of the nails and he wants me my hand in his side I will not believe 

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:22.779
 eight days later his disciples were again inside and with them tomás 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:27.849
 diego Jesus being the doors closed and he stood in the middle and told them 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:29.859
 we passed other 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.439
 then he said thomas 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:33.729
 Pon actitude do and look at my hands 

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:36.469

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:39.409
 and do not be an unbeliever but a believer 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:42.129
 then tomás answered and said 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:44.639
 my Lord and my God 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.979
 jesus told him why you saw me tomás you believed 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.519
 blessed are those who gave us and believed 

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:56.119
 He also made his many other signs in the presence of his disciples 

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:59.269
 which are not written in this book 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.909
 but this one has been written so that you believe that Jesus is the Christ the son 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:04.619

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:07.369
