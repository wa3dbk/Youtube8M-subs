00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
a grid and it could be in this spot

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.419 
a grid and it could be in this spot
somewhere<00:00:09.840> along<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.139> stairs<00:00:10.410> but<00:00:10.980> if<00:00:11.219> it's

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
go down and to the left and it will be

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.480 
go down and to the left and it will be
down<00:00:20.880> through<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:21.449> area<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:22.769> know<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.250> went

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
down through this area I know I went

back and forth right here but it's

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.720 
back and forth right here but it's
actually<00:00:24.930> turned<00:00:25.710> around<00:00:25.980> it's<00:00:26.369> right<00:00:26.490> there

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
actually turned around it's right there

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
as you can see so this is part number

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.240 
as you can see so this is part number
one<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.849> stairs<00:00:30.119> or<00:00:30.359> right<00:00:30.630> in<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:30.900> area

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
is where you find this one and then I

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.330 
is where you find this one and then I
will<00:00:34.440> be<00:00:34.559> on<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:35.219> part<00:00:35.820> number<00:00:36.090> two<00:00:36.270> here

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
will be on to part number two here

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.170 
will be on to part number two here
continuing<00:00:38.340> through<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.820> tunnels

all the way back here in this corner any
which<00:01:32.880> way<00:01:32.909> you'll<00:01:33.210> get<00:01:33.390> all<00:01:33.570> three<00:01:33.750> parts

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
which way you'll get all three parts

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.649 
which way you'll get all three parts
also<00:01:34.650> out<00:01:34.890> here<00:01:35.220> it's<00:01:35.490> smart<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.240> end<00:01:36.390> up<00:01:36.509> out

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
also out here it's smart to end up out

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.940 
also out here it's smart to end up out
here<00:01:36.810> because<00:01:36.960> out<00:01:37.229> here<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.530> actually<00:01:37.829> where

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
here because out here is actually where

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.530 
here because out here is actually where
you<00:01:37.979> end<00:01:38.159> up<00:01:38.220> building<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.610> now<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.180> solo<00:01:39.450> mode

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
you end up building it now in solo mode

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.050 
you end up building it now in solo mode
you<00:01:39.900> don't<00:01:40.020> have<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.290> pay<00:01:40.439> any<00:01:40.590> money

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
you don't have to pay any money

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.249 
you don't have to pay any money
multiplayer<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.090> believe<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.930> have<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.140> pay

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
multiplayer I believe you have to pay

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.749 
multiplayer I believe you have to pay
two<00:01:43.320> thousand<00:01:43.799> dollars<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:44.189> actually<00:01:44.490> get<00:01:44.640> it

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
two thousand dollars to actually get it

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.160 
two thousand dollars to actually get it
so<00:01:45.240> although<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.659> didn't<00:01:45.840> have<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.049> pay

that hellhound head was right here is
where<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.450> buildable<00:02:25.720> is<00:02:25.900> you<00:02:26.049> can<00:02:26.200> see<00:02:26.319> I<00:02:26.349> can

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
where the buildable is you can see I can

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.830 
where the buildable is you can see I can
craft<00:02:26.799> it<00:02:27.010> don't<00:02:27.670> have<00:02:27.790> to<00:02:27.879> pay<00:02:28.000> $2,000<00:02:28.750> I
