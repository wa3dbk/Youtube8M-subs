00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
Celestion 4 by 12 and they're 20 watt

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.950 
Celestion 4 by 12 and they're 20 watt
selections<00:00:28.789> so<00:00:28.970> they<00:00:29.089> actually<00:00:29.239> break<00:00:29.689> up<00:00:29.869> a

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
selections so they actually break up a

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.499 
selections so they actually break up a
little<00:00:30.079> bit<00:00:30.429> unlike<00:00:31.429> 70<00:00:31.789> Watts<00:00:31.970> that<00:00:32.119> have<00:00:32.359> no

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
little bit unlike 70 Watts that have no

little bit unlike 70 Watts that have no
distortion<00:00:33.020> in<00:00:33.109> them<00:00:33.230> at<00:00:33.320> all<00:00:33.440> and<00:00:33.820> an<00:00:34.820> electro

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
distortion in them at all and an electro

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.000 
distortion in them at all and an electro
voice<00:00:35.329> cabinet<00:00:35.870> it's<00:00:36.020> a<00:00:36.199> marshall<00:00:36.620> cabinet

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:42.040 
with four 250 watt electro-voice
speakers<00:00:40.010> so<00:00:40.519> you<00:00:40.609> get<00:00:40.760> kind<00:00:41.059> of<00:00:41.180> a<00:00:41.329> distorted

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.229 
speakers so you get kind of a distorted
and<00:00:42.230> clean<00:00:42.769> kind<00:00:43.219> of<00:00:43.399> sort<00:00:43.940> of<00:00:43.969> like<00:00:44.149> how

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.760 

there's<00:00:48.690> definitely<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.080> distortion<00:00:49.440> there

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
there's definitely a distortion there

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.970 
there's definitely a distortion there
but<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.100> get<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.640> get<00:00:50.790> this<00:00:51.000> solidity<00:00:51.600> and

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
but you get you get this solidity and

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.920 
but you get you get this solidity and
the<00:00:52.980> thing<00:00:53.220> about<00:00:53.490> plexus<00:00:54.150> isn't<00:00:54.720> they're

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
the thing about plexus isn't they're

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.450 
the thing about plexus isn't they're
pretty<00:00:55.170> bright<00:00:55.440> if<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.680> just<00:00:55.890> barely<00:00:56.070> turn<00:00:56.340> my

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
pretty bright if I just barely turn my

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.460 
pretty bright if I just barely turn my
guitar<00:00:56.820> on<00:00:59.720> kind<00:01:00.720> of<00:01:00.810> hear<00:01:00.960> how<00:01:01.050> bright<00:01:01.290> it<00:01:01.410> is

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 
guitar on kind of hear how bright it is

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.210 
guitar on kind of hear how bright it is
but<00:01:01.680> if<00:01:01.740> you<00:01:01.830> crank<00:01:02.100> it

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
but if you crank it

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.670 
but if you crank it
they<00:01:05.030> stay<00:01:05.300> bright<00:01:05.600> but<00:01:05.990> there's<00:01:06.260> this

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
they stay bright but there's this

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.310 
they stay bright but there's this

quality of whoof that comes up on a
plexi<00:01:09.770> and<00:01:11.290> what's<00:01:12.290> different<00:01:12.410> about<00:01:12.650> my<00:01:13.010> amps

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520

dit and I set it up so that all you have
to<00:01:34.250> do<00:01:34.340> is<00:01:34.460> turn<00:01:34.610> the<00:01:34.760> amp<00:01:34.880> on<00:01:35.060> this<00:01:35.300> is<00:01:35.450> just<00:01:35.720> no

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
to do is turn the amp on this is just no

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.780 
to do is turn the amp on this is just no
big<00:01:36.380> deal<00:01:36.590> you<00:01:36.800> can<00:01:36.950> see<00:01:37.100> that<00:01:37.220> I've<00:01:37.340> turned<00:01:37.610> up

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
big deal you can see that I've turned up

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.850 
big deal you can see that I've turned up
the<00:01:37.970> treble<00:01:38.869> and<00:01:38.930> presence<00:01:39.020> a<00:01:39.470> little<00:01:39.710> bit

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
the treble and presence a little bit

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.700 
the treble and presence a little bit
because<00:01:40.210> when<00:01:41.210> I<00:01:41.240> sampled<00:01:42.050> them<00:01:42.170> I<00:01:42.200> made<00:01:42.530> them

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
because when I sampled them I made them

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.260 
because when I sampled them I made them
a<00:01:42.800> little<00:01:42.920> more<00:01:43.220> neutral<00:01:43.490> so<00:01:43.940> that<00:01:44.000> you'd<00:01:44.210> have

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
a little more neutral so that you'd have

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.060 
a little more neutral so that you'd have
somewhere<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:44.780> go<00:01:44.869> but<00:01:45.290> you<00:01:45.500> can<00:01:45.650> really<00:01:45.950> make

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
somewhere to go but you can really make

somewhere to go but you can really make
them<00:01:46.280> bright<00:01:46.550> if<00:01:46.700> you<00:01:46.820> want<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:47.590> this<00:01:48.590> is<00:01:48.650> sort
