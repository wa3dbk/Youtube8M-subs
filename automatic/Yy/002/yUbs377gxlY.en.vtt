00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.820 
up to point to point to I this is also
for<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.460> server<00:00:14.670> by<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:14.969> way<00:00:15.470> but<00:00:16.470> he

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
for the server by the way but he

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.450 
for the server by the way but he
literally<00:00:17.190> just<00:00:18.740> released<00:00:19.740> two<00:00:20.130> point<00:00:20.400> two

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
literally just released two point two

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.160 
literally just released two point two
point<00:00:20.730> three<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.090> it's<00:00:21.180> more<00:00:21.330> stable<00:00:21.630> with

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
point three and it's more stable with

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.679 
point three and it's more stable with
the<00:00:22.470> server<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.670> decided<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.300> might<00:00:24.420> as<00:00:24.510> well

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
the server so I decided I might as well

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.099 
the server so I decided I might as well
do<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:25.220> so<00:00:26.220> first<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.970> am<00:00:27.240> going<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.689> start

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
I set up the server archiver okay I've

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.240 
I set up the server archiver okay I've
decided<00:04:16.489> to<00:04:16.700> do<00:04:16.820> it<00:04:16.940> a<00:04:17.030> different<00:04:17.180> way<00:04:17.360> i<00:04:18.350> I'm

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
decided to do it a different way i I'm

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.850 
decided to do it a different way i I'm
pretty<00:04:19.610> sure<00:04:19.850> I<00:04:20.209> probably<00:04:20.900> dragged<00:04:21.440> in<00:04:21.650> and

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:21.860 
pretty sure I probably dragged in and

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.070 
pretty sure I probably dragged in and
wrong<00:04:22.040> and<00:04:22.340> i'm<00:04:23.090> just<00:04:23.300> going<00:04:23.390> to<00:04:23.510> restart<00:04:23.720> it

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
wrong and i'm just going to restart it

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.930 
wrong and i'm just going to restart it
so<00:04:25.780> what<00:04:26.780> I<00:04:26.810> think<00:04:27.320> I'm<00:04:27.650> going<00:04:28.010> to<00:04:28.100> do<00:04:28.280> is<00:04:28.580> just

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
so what I think I'm going to do is just

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.750 
so what I think I'm going to do is just
set<00:04:29.630> up<00:04:29.780> the<00:04:30.080> mod<00:04:30.470> loaders<00:04:31.100> and<00:04:31.130> all<00:04:31.580> that

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
set up the mod loaders and all that

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:38.050 
set up the mod loaders and all that
stuff<00:04:31.910> so<00:04:35.860> we'll<00:04:36.860> open<00:04:37.040> it<00:04:37.280> up<00:04:37.400> with<00:04:37.640> general

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
stuff so we'll open it up with general

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:45.010 
stuff so we'll open it up with general
khyber<00:04:38.950> and<00:04:41.230> we<00:04:42.230> will<00:04:43.160> drive<00:04:43.880> modloader<00:04:44.450> MP

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
khyber and we will drive modloader MP

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.620 
khyber and we will drive modloader MP
into<00:04:45.650> their<00:04:45.830> i<00:04:47.410> probably<00:04:49.210> garbage<00:04:50.210> something

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
into their i probably garbage something

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.390 
into their i probably garbage something
in<00:04:50.840> the<00:04:52.060> thing<00:04:53.060> I<00:04:53.390> mind<00:04:54.320> if<00:04:54.470> it<00:04:54.710> might<00:04:54.890> because

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
in the thing I mind if it might because

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.010 
in the thing I mind if it might because
I<00:04:55.550> didn't<00:04:55.850> give<00:04:55.970> it<00:04:56.030> at<00:04:56.150> the<00:04:56.300> l<00:04:56.630> ck<00:04:56.900> file<00:04:59.020> but

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
I didn't give it at the l ck file but

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.450 
I didn't give it at the l ck file but
let's<00:05:00.410> just<00:05:00.470> drag<00:05:00.710> the<00:05:00.860> end<00:05:00.980> of<00:05:01.070> there<00:05:01.220> and

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
let's just drag the end of there and

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.220 
let's just drag the end of there and
then<00:05:01.970> we<00:05:02.120> should<00:05:02.300> be<00:05:02.330> able<00:05:02.450> to<00:05:02.690> run<00:05:02.870> the

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
then we should be able to run the

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.270 
then we should be able to run the
minecraft<00:05:03.800> server<00:05:03.950> jar<00:05:04.270> and<00:05:05.980> as<00:05:06.980> you<00:05:07.130> can<00:05:07.250> see

here so all the engines and suffer here
and<00:06:28.110> it<00:06:29.110> worked<00:06:29.289> just<00:06:29.440> fine<00:06:30.000> that's<00:06:31.000> how<00:06:31.120> you

hopefully I'll be able to come up with a
guide<00:06:46.030> for<00:06:46.270> engines<00:06:46.659> they're<00:06:47.320> kind<00:06:47.530> of<00:06:47.969> tricky

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:48.969 
guide for engines they're kind of tricky

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:51.300 
guide for engines they're kind of tricky
I'm<00:06:49.900> still<00:06:50.229> trying<00:06:50.440> to<00:06:50.469> figure<00:06:50.620> them<00:06:50.800> out<00:06:50.919> more

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:51.310 
I'm still trying to figure them out more

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.630 
I'm still trying to figure them out more
so<00:06:51.639> so<00:06:52.419> you<00:06:52.479> guys
