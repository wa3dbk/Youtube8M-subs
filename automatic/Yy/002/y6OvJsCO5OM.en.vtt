hey folks welcome back to the wealth
around<00:00:02.799> us<00:00:03.100> I<00:00:03.310> just<00:00:03.940> wanted<00:00:04.240> to<00:00:04.420> go<00:00:04.960> over<00:00:04.990> my

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:05.560 
around us I just wanted to go over my

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.430 
around us I just wanted to go over my
latest<00:00:06.100> hurdle<00:00:06.910> in<00:00:07.120> solar<00:00:07.540> technology<00:00:08.260> this

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:08.440 
latest hurdle in solar technology this

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.950 
latest hurdle in solar technology this
is<00:00:08.590> what<00:00:08.769> I<00:00:08.800> call<00:00:09.100> the<00:00:09.340> personal<00:00:09.960> solar

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:10.960 
is what I call the personal solar

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.870 
is what I call the personal solar
generator<00:00:11.559> and<00:00:12.190> as<00:00:12.309> you<00:00:12.430> can<00:00:12.550> see<00:00:12.580> it<00:00:12.790> has

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:12.880 
generator and as you can see it has

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.310 
generator and as you can see it has
jinxes<00:00:13.330> full<00:00:13.809> approval<00:00:14.880> but<00:00:15.880> I've<00:00:16.779> made<00:00:17.109> this

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
jinxes full approval but I've made this

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.790 
jinxes full approval but I've made this
for<00:00:17.859> around<00:00:18.699> 150<00:00:19.539> bucks<00:00:19.779> just<00:00:20.499> stuff<00:00:20.679> you

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
for around 150 bucks just stuff you

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.059 
for around 150 bucks just stuff you
bought<00:00:20.919> at<00:00:21.069> walmart<00:00:22.019> so<00:00:23.019> whoever<00:00:23.560> says<00:00:23.829> solar

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:24.069 
bought at walmart so whoever says solar

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:25.679 
bought at walmart so whoever says solar
is<00:00:24.189> expensive<00:00:24.640> and<00:00:24.789> not<00:00:24.849> practical<00:00:25.449> these

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:25.689 
is expensive and not practical these

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:26.999 
is expensive and not practical these

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.310 
that and he had said that he just

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.890 
that and he had said that he just
doesn't<00:00:36.580> see<00:00:36.610> solar<00:00:36.910> being<00:00:37.150> practical<00:00:37.690> and<00:00:37.870> I

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
doesn't see solar being practical and I

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.140 
doesn't see solar being practical and I
can't<00:00:38.140> old<00:00:38.320> I<00:00:38.500> can<00:00:38.740> totally<00:00:38.980> totally<00:00:39.880> jive

can't old I can totally totally jive
with<00:00:40.390> that<00:00:40.600> but<00:00:41.290> this<00:00:41.410> one<00:00:41.620> is<00:00:41.800> you<00:00:42.190> know<00:00:42.310> this

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:42.490 
with that but this one is you know this

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.340 
with that but this one is you know this
this<00:00:42.640> one<00:00:42.850> is<00:00:43.000> practical<00:00:43.450> for<00:00:43.480> just<00:00:43.870> one<00:00:44.110> guy

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
this one is practical for just one guy

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.250 
this one is practical for just one guy
you<00:00:45.310> know<00:00:45.400> in<00:00:45.670> a<00:00:45.790> tent<00:00:46.060> needin<00:00:46.510> some<00:00:46.720> power<00:00:46.900> and

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
you know in a tent needin some power and

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.350 
you know in a tent needin some power and
that's<00:00:48.100> exactly<00:00:48.340> what<00:00:48.730> I<00:00:48.760> was<00:00:48.880> aiming<00:00:49.030> at<00:00:49.270> the

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
that's exactly what I was aiming at the

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.450 
that's exactly what I was aiming at the
whole<00:00:49.480> time<00:00:49.690> now<00:00:50.530> we<00:00:50.770> had<00:00:50.890> some<00:00:51.010> stuff<00:00:51.220> stuffed

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
whole time now we had some stuff stuffed

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.860 
whole time now we had some stuff stuffed
in<00:00:51.579> here<00:00:51.790> because<00:00:51.910> there's<00:00:52.060> an<00:00:52.270> extra<00:00:52.570> room<00:00:52.720> in

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
in here because there's an extra room in

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.050 
in here because there's an extra room in
there<00:00:53.050> for<00:00:53.079> some<00:00:54.040> other<00:00:54.220> supplies<00:00:54.610> and<00:00:54.880> stuff

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.060 
there for some other supplies and stuff

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.120 
there for some other supplies and stuff
but<00:00:55.300> this<00:00:55.930> is<00:00:56.050> just<00:00:56.110> the<00:00:56.290> alligator<00:00:56.710> clips<00:00:56.980> and

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.130 
but this is just the alligator clips and

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.560 
but this is just the alligator clips and
stuff<00:00:57.310> to<00:00:57.460> come<00:00:57.640> with<00:00:57.850> it<00:00:57.970> for<00:00:58.180> hooking<00:00:58.420> it<00:00:58.510> up

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
stuff to come with it for hooking it up

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.210 
stuff to come with it for hooking it up
to<00:00:58.720> a<00:00:58.780> car<00:00:58.960> battery<00:00:58.989> or<00:00:59.560> some<00:00:59.739> other<00:00:59.829> ATV

battery you want to charge makes a lot

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.569 
battery you want to charge makes a lot
easier<00:01:03.460> than<00:01:03.869> messing<00:01:04.869> terminals<00:01:05.319> all<00:01:06.310> this

00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:06.579 
easier than messing terminals all this

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:08.849 
easier than messing terminals all this
wiring<00:01:06.819> is<00:01:07.179> from<00:01:07.450> the<00:01:07.630> solar<00:01:07.929> panel<00:01:08.380> as<00:01:08.679> you

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:08.859 
wiring is from the solar panel as you

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:12.220 
wiring is from the solar panel as you
can<00:01:08.979> see<00:01:09.189> that's<00:01:09.579> how<00:01:09.670> it<00:01:09.850> looks<00:01:10.119> up<00:01:10.270> to<00:01:10.390> charge

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
can see that's how it looks up to charge

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.650 
can see that's how it looks up to charge
the<00:01:12.830> solar<00:01:13.100> panel<00:01:13.460> of<00:01:13.520> mine<00:01:13.670> is<00:01:13.940> work<00:01:14.240> in<00:01:14.450> its

the solar panel of mine is work in its
it<00:01:14.990> would<00:01:15.260> be<00:01:15.380> charging<00:01:15.740> right<00:01:15.860> now<00:01:15.980> if<00:01:16.100> I<00:01:16.160> had

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
it would be charging right now if I had

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.220 
it would be charging right now if I had
it<00:01:16.400> hooked<00:01:16.490> up<00:01:16.670> to<00:01:16.730> the<00:01:16.880> AC<00:01:17.030> socket<00:01:17.540> inside<00:01:17.840> and

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230 
it hooked up to the AC socket inside and

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.170 
it hooked up to the AC socket inside and
you<00:01:19.220> know<00:01:19.310> this<00:01:19.430> is<00:01:19.490> just<00:01:19.580> how<00:01:19.730> the<00:01:19.790> floor<00:01:20.030> as<00:01:20.150> a
