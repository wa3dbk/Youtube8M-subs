00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.410
 a son to all boys I am rich 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.160
 for the latest fetal teams and we're here today 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.210
 with player and beauty mario gotze 87 di 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.540
 having over all 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:27.170
 and that is how this guys play there 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:29.180
 I immediately say it is a true phenomenon 92 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.460
 ball control the ball he does not 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.550
 open virtually never really 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.559
 devastating also ball and chain 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.420
 try to remove it with control 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.640
 ball is very difficult because he is 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.190
 earth always attached to the foot then 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.390
 let's talk about speed 81 on paper 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.260
 with 82 acceleration then 79 of 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.019
 full speed 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.269
 we say that as true value in itself for 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.190
 it is not really a very high value 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.260
 but I must say that he surprised me 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.780
 especially the acceleration the first 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.790
 step was really really good e 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.350
 managed to jump opponents too 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.900
 only with ball control here is the 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.270
 speed also because of agility 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.280
 then with the ball control done 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.049
 right and left he is very agile 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.350
 the only one against this player 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:18.079
 unfortunately the physical strength is only 66 as 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:22.579
 unfortunately value the first shoulder he 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:24.670
 falls to the ground is almost unfortunately almost always 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:27.320
 all there today we win those a little more 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.799
 more technical basses have this defect 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.890
 but unfortunately he then sky to a 80 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:36.950
 shooting that is a value in my opinion a lot 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.219
 very low because it seems much more 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.520
 and to finalize 85 this value 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:45.140
 it looked like 95 guys in the air you'll see 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.189
 even from the clips he never made a mistake 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.079
 that is, a shot all went online 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.749
 it made a lot of hills reopened 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.429
 he was practically never wrong at 82 of 

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:58.369
 I accept that it also seems a little bit of 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.649
 more let's say he only has 70 long shots 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.990
 but I liked the whole but 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.289
 only 73 of roma power I don't have 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.120
 given this value we seemed like that 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.340
 really 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.950
 I wish he might not have it on paper 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.800
 very high values ​​for certain things 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.680
 but they seem much more in game 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.070
 then he is the best feature 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.050
 according to me and positioning 90 and the 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.630
 average medium works seemed medium high 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.650
 because it was always there position in place 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:32.020
 really guys helped spikes but in 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.180
 a perfect way he was there 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.180
 always when you get a hand 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.100
 he was there you could rely on 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.540
 there was always something I could do about him 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.300
 always relying on him because 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.040
 also 85 of passages which is one 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.050
 here too the phenomenal feature 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.230
 perhaps almost the best ever 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.630
 because you take the boys steps 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.700
 he struck him at 80 of long passes 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.010
 but they looked like you will see 90 in the clips 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.010
 of the opening fan throw pockets 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.110
 very precise and then oh well passages 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.300
 corti 90 we don't talk about it because it doesn't 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.030
 has never wrong 1 to 90 division that 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.580
 absolutely a find I really sort 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:13.300
 balloons in a fantastic way 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.459
 then I loved it with him 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.040
 do tiki taka especially because not 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:21.040
 never wrong steps and having a 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.370
 so high ball control could serve 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.280
 the attackers perfectly then a 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.750
 173 of stamina that I honestly do not know 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.560
 how they put it to him since I didn't 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.250
 he never gets tired 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.600
 at least 80 could then put it at 72 of 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.310
 rigors also here features a 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.340
 very low I pulled three and it has 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.560
 marked three and then overall 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.600
 let's say the players you can 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.090
 use it also for theme definitions a 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.150
 77 as a value but also seemed in which 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.640
 a little more I repeat to you as values 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.940
 to which characteristics they seem too 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.830
 low as it is strong there is the 70 of 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.100
 launch from for example I can not understand 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.170
 because it seems very very intimate then the 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.670
 weak foot seems 5 stars because 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.070
 also there is made of withdrawals and 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.650
 wonderful four-star passages 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.920
 but they seem 5 then in dribbling what to say 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.340
 fantastic 92 of mature triples go 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.730
 Street 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:19.669
 to the opponent in an amazing way 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.209
 you really can't stop it I do 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.550
 always 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.190
 I always refer to the power control 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.169
 which is great but do n't take it off 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.840
 then four-star ski so you can 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.669
 do all the skills you want 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.680
 the only one against it I repeat is only strength 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.530
 physical and maybe a little bit the price 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.540
 because it currently stands on the 2 million e 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.570
 a little too though also considered the 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:44.870
 German plays in the bayern monk is the 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.940
 price is what you guys say 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.290
 succeed and try it because there is none 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.700
 sorry 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.300
 I swear you really a player 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:56.389
 amazing fantastic one you will see 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.370
 listed the top and the final vote flop leads 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:01.550
 and a half because he deserves it is really a 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:04.550
 champion as reality releases class 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.240
 from all the pores it breaks class from all 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.919
 pores 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.870
