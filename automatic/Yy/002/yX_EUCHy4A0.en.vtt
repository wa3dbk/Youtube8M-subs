00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
really using too many colors I like to

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.990 
really using too many colors I like to
stick<00:00:10.620> with<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.800> basics<00:00:11.219> I<00:00:11.340> use<00:00:11.490> burnt<00:00:11.790> umber

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
stick with the basics I use burnt umber

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.999 
stick with the basics I use burnt umber
and<00:00:12.330> then<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:12.929> make<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.200> decision<00:00:13.620> as<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:13.769> what

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
and then I make a decision as to what

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.709 
and then I make a decision as to what
flower<00:00:14.280> I'm<00:00:14.490> gonna<00:00:14.670> paint<00:00:14.880> I<00:00:15.120> use<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.540> burnt

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
flower I'm gonna paint I use the burnt

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.380 
flower I'm gonna paint I use the burnt
umber<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:16.109> outline<00:00:16.500> everything<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:18.270> this

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
umber to outline everything and in this

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.099 
umber to outline everything and in this
case<00:00:18.690> I've<00:00:19.380> decided<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:20.010> go<00:00:20.220> with<00:00:21.109> basically

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
case I've decided to go with basically

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.040 
case I've decided to go with basically
flower<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.920> my<00:00:23.070> own<00:00:23.220> choosing<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:27.019> what<00:00:28.019> I

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
flower of my own choosing and what I

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.830 
flower of my own choosing and what I
what<00:00:28.529> I'm<00:00:28.619> doing<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.099> creating<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.730> flower<00:00:29.970> that

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
what I'm doing is creating a flower that

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:40.880 
what I'm doing is creating a flower that
has<00:00:32.239> some<00:00:33.239> beautiful<00:00:33.390> petals<00:00:39.590> you<00:00:40.590> can<00:00:40.739> make<00:00:40.860> a

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
has some beautiful petals you can make a

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.229 
has some beautiful petals you can make a
decision<00:00:41.190> as<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.460> what<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.700> think<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.030> looks

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
decision as to what you think that looks

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.400 
decision as to what you think that looks
like<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:43.290> me<00:00:43.440> just<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.070> different<00:00:44.399> flower

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
there's so many flowers you can probably

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.740 
there's so many flowers you can probably
find<00:00:47.789> something<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.329> looks<00:00:48.450> like<00:00:48.600> this

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
find something that looks like this

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.880

type of flaw let's suppose you've got
little<00:01:26.670> tiny<00:01:26.939> flowers<00:01:27.240> like<00:01:27.869> this<00:01:30.920> you<00:01:31.920> just

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
little tiny flowers like this you just

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.819 
little tiny flowers like this you just
want<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.310> make<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.610> brush<00:01:32.850> flat<00:01:36.799> like<00:01:37.799> that

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
want to make the brush flat like that

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.859 
want to make the brush flat like that
you<00:01:38.369> leave<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.579> center<00:01:39.000> maybe<00:01:39.210> make<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.509> yellow

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
you leave a center maybe make it yellow

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.940 
you leave a center maybe make it yellow
again<00:01:40.140> we've<00:01:41.100> got<00:01:41.130> yourself<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.670> little<00:01:41.880> flower

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
again we've got yourself a little flower

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.139 
again we've got yourself a little flower
so<00:01:43.950> in<00:01:44.070> reality<00:01:44.310> there's<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.729> lot<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.970> things

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
so in reality there's a lot of things

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.730 
so in reality there's a lot of things
you<00:01:45.270> can<00:01:45.420> do<00:01:48.020> keep<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.170> simple

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
you can do keep it simple

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.200 
you can do keep it simple
it<00:01:49.950> doesn't<00:01:50.220> have<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.369> be<00:01:50.460> anything<00:01:50.670> special

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
it doesn't have to be anything special

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.969 
it doesn't have to be anything special
in<00:01:51.329> terms<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.720> what<00:01:52.170> type<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.439> flower<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.920> is
