00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
the only real thing starting this off

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.760 
the only real thing starting this off
before<00:03:37.220> YouTube<00:03:38.220> gets<00:03:38.489> all<00:03:38.640> pissed<00:03:38.940> off<00:03:39.770> no

before YouTube gets all pissed off no
only<00:03:40.890> the<00:03:41.040> real<00:03:41.280> thing<00:03:41.489> that<00:03:41.520> I<00:03:41.670> don't<00:03:41.760> like

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
only the real thing that I don't like

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.830 
only the real thing that I don't like
about<00:03:42.120> them<00:03:42.540> is<00:03:43.250> the<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.880> commuters<00:03:45.270> don't

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
about them is the the commuters don't

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.300 
about them is the the commuters don't
seem<00:03:46.170> to<00:03:46.350> be<00:03:46.530> as<00:03:47.269> good<00:03:48.269> as<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:49.800> polycarbonate

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
seem to be as good as the polycarbonate

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.729 
seem to be as good as the polycarbonate
and<00:03:50.989> my<00:03:51.989> infinities<00:03:53.750> they<00:03:54.750> have<00:03:55.050> also<00:03:55.410> leaked

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
and my infinities they have also leaked

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.770 
and my infinities they have also leaked
out<00:03:55.920> all<00:03:56.160> of<00:03:56.190> their<00:03:56.519> Fiero<00:03:57.269> fluid<00:03:59.209> which<00:04:00.209> you

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
out all of their Fiero fluid which you

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.320 
out all of their Fiero fluid which you
can<00:04:01.019> probably<00:04:01.260> see<00:04:01.860> better<00:04:02.069> on<00:04:02.400> this<00:04:02.790> speaker

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
can probably see better on this speaker

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:11.170 
can probably see better on this speaker
over<00:04:03.780> here<00:04:07.760> you<00:04:08.760> can<00:04:09.000> see<00:04:09.269> what<00:04:09.870> looks<00:04:09.900> like<00:04:10.170> it

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
over here you can see what looks like it

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.930 
over here you can see what looks like it
it's<00:04:12.180> pretty<00:04:12.510> hard<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:12.840> see<00:04:13.340> if<00:04:14.340> my<00:04:14.549> camera

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
it's pretty hard to see if my camera

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.469 
it's pretty hard to see if my camera
would<00:04:15.090> ever<00:04:15.269> focus<00:04:17.600> on<00:04:18.600> anything<00:04:19.470> in<00:04:19.979> its<00:04:20.130> life

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
would ever focus on anything in its life

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:24.950 
would ever focus on anything in its life
it<00:04:21.479> it's<00:04:22.380> kind<00:04:22.710> of<00:04:22.940> those<00:04:23.940> comes<00:04:24.360> around<00:04:24.660> here

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
it it's kind of those comes around here

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.040 
it it's kind of those comes around here
and<00:04:25.110> goes<00:04:25.289> down<00:04:25.590> and<00:04:25.979> you<00:04:26.070> can<00:04:26.250> see<00:04:26.720> it<00:04:27.720> once

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
and goes down and you can see it once

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:34.150 
and goes down and you can see it once
again<00:04:28.320> if<00:04:28.440> my<00:04:28.470> camera<00:04:28.740> focus<00:04:29.310> um<00:04:31.130> my<00:04:32.130> the<00:04:32.970> text

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
again if my camera focus um my the text

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.180 
again if my camera focus um my the text
whereas<00:04:35.160> pure<00:04:35.669> titanium<00:04:35.990> has<00:04:36.990> a<00:04:37.350> lot<00:04:37.590> of<00:04:37.740> crap

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
whereas pure titanium has a lot of crap

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.560 
whereas pure titanium has a lot of crap
in<00:04:38.220> it<00:04:38.600> from<00:04:39.600> where<00:04:39.870> dust<00:04:40.289> has<00:04:40.650> collected<00:04:41.070> in

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
in it from where dust has collected in

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:49.520 
in it from where dust has collected in
the<00:04:43.010> ferrofluid<00:04:44.479> but<00:04:47.960> these<00:04:48.960> these<00:04:49.350> move

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
the ferrofluid but these these move

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:55.820 
the ferrofluid but these these move
pretty<00:04:49.800> good<00:04:50.100> and<00:04:52.640> there's<00:04:54.169> another<00:04:55.169> artifact

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
pretty good and there's another artifact

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.600 
pretty good and there's another artifact
from<00:04:56.100> where<00:04:56.340> my<00:04:56.520> mom<00:04:56.700> stained<00:04:57.090> them<00:04:57.330> and

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
from where my mom stained them and

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.080 
from where my mom stained them and
they're<00:04:59.610> on<00:04:59.910> the<00:05:00.030> surrounds<00:05:00.690> that<00:05:01.910> makes<00:05:02.910> me

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
they're on the surrounds that makes me

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.719 
they're on the surrounds that makes me
mad<00:05:06.020> but<00:05:07.020> you<00:05:07.289> know<00:05:07.410> I<00:05:07.620> sanded<00:05:08.400> them<00:05:08.520> down

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
mad but you know I sanded them down

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:10.820 
mad but you know I sanded them down
pretty<00:05:08.970> good<00:05:09.270> so<00:05:09.510> they're<00:05:09.690> they're<00:05:10.590> pretty

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
pretty good so they're they're pretty

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.820 
pretty good so they're they're pretty
close<00:05:11.070> to<00:05:11.130> original<00:05:11.580> and<00:05:12.770> I<00:05:14.660> do<00:05:15.660> a<00:05:15.830> teardown

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
close to original and I do a teardown

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.730 
close to original and I do a teardown
video<00:05:17.370> of<00:05:17.490> these<00:05:17.610> pretty<00:05:17.850> soon<00:05:18.150> the<00:05:18.930> the<00:05:19.440> port

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
video of these pretty soon the the port

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.310 
video of these pretty soon the the port
is<00:05:19.950> actually<00:05:20.820> very<00:05:21.450> short<00:05:21.960> it's<00:05:22.350> it's<00:05:24.320> it

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
is actually very short it's it's it

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.100 
is actually very short it's it's it
stops<00:05:25.830> about<00:05:26.220> right<00:05:26.490> here<00:05:26.820> so<00:05:27.780> it's<00:05:27.960> only

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
stops about right here so it's only

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.020 
stops about right here so it's only
about<00:05:28.470> these<00:05:28.650> first<00:05:28.890> two<00:05:29.130> links<00:05:29.490> of<00:05:29.610> my<00:05:29.640> finger

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
about these first two links of my finger

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.560 
about these first two links of my finger
long<00:05:30.240> and<00:05:30.630> it's<00:05:31.110> not<00:05:31.380> flared<00:05:31.979> at<00:05:32.280> all

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
long and it's not flared at all

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:39.470 
long and it's not flared at all
but<00:05:34.570> you<00:05:35.230> know<00:05:35.350> it<00:05:35.680> works<00:05:35.950> and<00:05:37.200> they<00:05:38.200> do<00:05:38.260> have

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
but you know it works and they do have

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.260 
but you know it works and they do have
padding<00:05:40.480> in<00:05:40.630> them<00:05:40.780> if<00:05:41.050> you<00:05:41.290> can<00:05:41.470> see<00:05:41.680> right

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
padding in them if you can see right

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.650 
padding in them if you can see right
here

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
here

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:50.790 
here

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.650 
I'll see you yeah yeah the
bottom<00:05:51.250> corner<00:05:51.640> of<00:05:51.730> this<00:05:51.910> speaker<00:05:52.150> right<00:05:52.450> here

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
bottom corner of this speaker right here

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.410 
bottom corner of this speaker right here
is<00:05:52.780> correct<00:05:53.640> the<00:05:54.640> cat<00:05:54.820> goes<00:05:55.090> all<00:05:55.270> the<00:05:55.300> way

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:55.420 
is correct the cat goes all the way

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.540 
is correct the cat goes all the way
through<00:05:55.540> the<00:05:55.960> inside<00:05:56.500> of<00:05:56.620> the<00:05:56.680> box<00:05:56.920> so<00:05:57.220> as<00:05:57.370> long

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
through the inside of the box so as long

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.730 
through the inside of the box so as long
as<00:05:57.610> the<00:05:58.000> the<00:05:58.030> fiberglass<00:05:58.780> is<00:05:58.990> pushed<00:05:59.470> down<00:05:59.710> to

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
as the the fiberglass is pushed down to

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.790 
as the the fiberglass is pushed down to
the<00:06:00.090> shoved<00:06:01.090> in<00:06:01.270> the<00:06:01.390> corner<00:06:01.780> they<00:06:02.320> don't<00:06:02.530> leak

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
the shoved in the corner they don't leak

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.410 
the shoved in the corner they don't leak
but<00:06:03.370> if<00:06:03.520> that<00:06:03.670> fiberglass<00:06:04.150> ever<00:06:04.780> is<00:06:04.930> to<00:06:05.110> move

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:06.420 
but if that fiberglass ever is to move

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.330 
but if that fiberglass ever is to move
and<00:06:07.420> I<00:06:07.540> cover<00:06:07.870> up<00:06:07.990> the<00:06:08.110> port<00:06:08.530> you<00:06:08.830> can<00:06:08.980> hear<00:06:09.220> it

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340 
and I cover up the port you can hear it

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.900 
and I cover up the port you can hear it
making<00:06:09.700> farting<00:06:10.360> noises<00:06:10.420> and<00:06:11.790> blowing<00:06:12.790> air

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
making farting noises and blowing air

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.410 
making farting noises and blowing air
out<00:06:13.150> of<00:06:13.180> the<00:06:13.360> corner<00:06:13.720> so<00:06:13.900> I<00:06:13.930> fix<00:06:14.410> that<00:06:15.420> but

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:16.420 
out of the corner so I fix that but

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.440 
out of the corner so I fix that but
other<00:06:16.960> than<00:06:17.140> that<00:06:17.260> they're<00:06:17.980> uh<00:06:18.450> they're

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450 
other than that they're uh they're

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.140 
other than that they're uh they're
pretty<00:06:20.020> nice<00:06:20.260> and<00:06:20.710> the<00:06:21.640> frequency<00:06:22.060> response

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
pretty nice and the frequency response

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.120 
pretty nice and the frequency response
on<00:06:22.630> them<00:06:22.780> if<00:06:22.870> I<00:06:22.990> had<00:06:23.110> known<00:06:23.500> or<00:06:23.710> thought<00:06:23.950> of

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.130 
on them if I had known or thought of

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.310 
on them if I had known or thought of
this<00:06:24.340> in<00:06:24.970> this<00:06:25.300> video<00:06:25.480> I've<00:06:25.810> made<00:06:25.840> this<00:06:26.170> so

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.320 
this in this video I've made this so

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.020 
this in this video I've made this so
many<00:06:26.530> times<00:06:26.710> I'm<00:06:26.950> losing<00:06:27.280> track<00:06:27.520> of<00:06:27.550> what<00:06:27.910> up

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:28.030 
many times I'm losing track of what up

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.390 
many times I'm losing track of what up
said<00:06:28.240> and<00:06:28.420> not<00:06:28.510> said<00:06:28.780> frequency<00:06:29.770> response<00:06:30.160> on

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
said and not said frequency response on

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.670 
said and not said frequency response on
them<00:06:30.580> is<00:06:31.140> 55<00:06:32.140> to<00:06:33.240> 20,000<00:06:34.240> Hertz<00:06:34.330> and<00:06:34.960> I<00:06:35.320> do<00:06:35.380> have

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 
them is 55 to 20,000 Hertz and I do have

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.970 
them is 55 to 20,000 Hertz and I do have
the<00:06:35.980> the<00:06:36.700> covers<00:06:37.660> for<00:06:37.870> them<00:06:37.990> they're<00:06:38.590> they're

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:38.980 
the the covers for them they're they're

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.310 
the the covers for them they're they're
pretty<00:06:39.010> beat<00:06:39.400> up<00:06:39.460> than<00:06:39.790> all<00:06:39.940> the<00:06:40.030> corners<00:06:40.450> this

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:41.320 
pretty beat up than all the corners this

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.160 
pretty beat up than all the corners this
one's<00:06:41.590> not<00:06:41.830> as<00:06:42.040> bad<00:06:42.220> as<00:06:42.400> the<00:06:42.550> other<00:06:42.730> one<00:06:43.170> the

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:44.170 
one's not as bad as the other one the

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.220 
one's not as bad as the other one the
other<00:06:44.200> one<00:06:44.350> down<00:06:44.620> there<00:06:44.890> has<00:06:45.100> lots<00:06:45.310> of<00:06:46.230> pin

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:47.230 
other one down there has lots of pin

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:53.280 
other one down there has lots of pin
pricks<00:06:47.560> in<00:06:47.800> it<00:06:47.950> and<00:06:51.120> when<00:06:52.120> I<00:06:52.150> get<00:06:52.300> them<00:06:52.750> redone

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:53.290 
pricks in it and when I get them redone

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:54.660 
pricks in it and when I get them redone
them<00:06:53.500> when<00:06:53.620> I<00:06:53.650> get<00:06:53.860> them<00:06:54.010> redone<00:06:54.310> in<00:06:54.550> the

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:54.670 
them when I get them redone in the

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.960 
them when I get them redone in the
material<00:06:55.420> that<00:06:55.480> these<00:06:56.310> Infinity<00:06:57.310> covers<00:06:57.700> are

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:57.970 
material that these Infinity covers are

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.900 
material that these Infinity covers are
made<00:06:58.030> of<00:06:58.590> have<00:06:59.590> on<00:06:59.740> them<00:06:59.890> because<00:07:00.130> I<00:07:00.490> like<00:07:00.700> it<00:07:00.850> a

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:00.910 
made of have on them because I like it a

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:06.750 
made of have on them because I like it a
lot<00:07:01.030> better<00:07:04.230> but<00:07:05.230> you<00:07:05.830> can<00:07:05.860> you<00:07:06.190> can<00:07:06.340> see<00:07:06.520> just

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:06.760 
lot better but you can you can see just

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.580 
lot better but you can you can see just
the<00:07:06.910> size<00:07:07.120> difference<00:07:07.660> between<00:07:07.810> my

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:08.590 
the size difference between my

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.730 
the size difference between my
infinities<00:07:09.210> I<00:07:10.210> think<00:07:11.080> there's<00:07:11.230> only<00:07:11.350> go<00:07:11.590> down

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:11.740 
infinities I think there's only go down

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:17.880 
infinities I think there's only go down
to<00:07:11.890> the<00:07:12.660> 65<00:07:13.660> Hertz<00:07:14.910> these<00:07:15.910> go<00:07:16.120> down<00:07:16.150> to<00:07:16.420> 55<00:07:17.020> but

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:17.890 
to the 65 Hertz these go down to 55 but

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.390 
to the 65 Hertz these go down to 55 but
you<00:07:18.130> know<00:07:18.250> bigger<00:07:18.580> bigger<00:07:19.180> cabinet<00:07:19.690> and

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 
you know bigger bigger cabinet and

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.130 
you know bigger bigger cabinet and
Nathan<00:07:21.400> to<00:07:21.520> offer<00:07:21.790> and<00:07:21.970> I<00:07:22.480> am<00:07:22.600> about<00:07:22.810> to<00:07:22.870> run

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.600 
out of space on my phone again so I
better<00:07:24.880> just<00:07:25.150> shut<00:07:25.210> up<00:07:26.100> anyway<00:07:27.100> thanks<00:07:27.580> for
