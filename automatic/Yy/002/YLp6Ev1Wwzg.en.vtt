00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.960
 girls the video of today I'm going to show 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.179
 For you, I've painted hair again. 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.580
 the paint I wanted to paint came out 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.500
 here in brazil is had before in 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.870
 The time I painted about three months ago 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.039
 ago it was very difficult to find this 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.529
 ink 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.500
 I was not finding these days I 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.230
 I went to the pharmacy and I saw her very expensive. 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.449
 I still found it very expensive but I was 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.390
 much in the fissure of experimenting then 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.059
 I bought to paint my hair again 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:37.230
 I talked about harry but it was not 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.790
 giving to see that I had done good 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.170
 harry but I thought it was not too long. 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.219
 clear that I had painted the hair 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.739
 some people saw a little burnt 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.379
 sun I wanted a little more light 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.590
 I do not want very blond, I think 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.309
 rare in the video but so I liked it 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.399
 enough of the result that gave a shot 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.680
 more on my face 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.629
 I found this ink very practical only 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.360
 I thought it was still there and it was very much mine. 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.320
 hair I found her hydrogen peroxide 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.270
 very strong so I guess I should 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.170
 have done the same process as I did 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.920
 with normal ink because it leaves the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.810
 hair much more hydrated but that's it 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.630
 I decided to experiment and I liked it. 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.939
 I'll have to take care much more and I liked it. 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.820
 also because everyone was given 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.869
 drives now is not strange because 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.320
 My briefs were the ones in the 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.750
 tip with that blonde more burnt 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.110
 so now it's good, my hair is cool 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.689
 I liked it and I'll show you how 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.030
 I tried the ink again that I used 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:54.479
 this da l'oreÃ©al on average ex English 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:58.680
 Californian that is for Californian 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:01.979
 shadow rene was made for this I found 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.490
 cool because it also has is all 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.160
 hair tones like that for blondes 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.030
 medium brown to dark and good rides 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.920
 dark 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.050
 I bought it from the dark half because a 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.600
 dark table 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.500
 but this very intonation I do not 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.790
 I left in 25 minutes and stayed in that tone 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.350
 I think I was a little too 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.880
 My hair sore at the ends but I 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.850
 I did not miss much, I did not want to 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:33.830
 stay the same in the box got a 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.880
 a little more natural and mine is not 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.210
 that 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.130
 and I did not film very well as 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.680
 combing my hair because I was 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.680
 alone , it's kinda bad because I 'm 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.820
 always stand and fiddle with paint and 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.470
 shooting 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:53.540
 but so just for you to see and even 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.030
 I hope you liked the result 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.280
 There are people who thought it was strange. 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:04.450
 My family did not like it very much but I 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:12.860
 I liked that and also show you 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:15.200
 Come on, girls. Here's what's on. 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.489
 box is the same as the other 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.190
 only differential is that it comes 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:22.239
 competing applying the ball well 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.239
 pressed and the ink 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:42.410
 good people the application schema is the 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.410
 of other inks 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.150
 the only difference is that you will apply 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.880
 from the bottom up using the brush 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.670
 to get clearer at the tips and do 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:56.230
 a gradient in the hair 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.230
 I separated it to 4 and it was applied 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:58.590
 urn was the result of my hair 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.050
 I hope you liked the video 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:04.760
 decided to show you one thing 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:07.620
 different I did in my day-to-day life and 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.330
 comment what you found in my 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:13.290
 new hair
