you won't be able to save but you could

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.710 
you won't be able to save but you could
play<00:01:21.990> through<00:01:22.380> like<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.220> Minecraft<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.939> game<00:01:24.450> for

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
play through like a Minecraft a game for

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.749 
play through like a Minecraft a game for
hours<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.470> play<00:01:26.159> through<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.520> with<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
hours and and play through it with the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.390 
hours and and play through it with the
textures<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.290> way<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.470> could<00:01:28.860> not<00:01:29.159> buy

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
textures so in a way you could not buy

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.310 
textures so in a way you could not buy
it<00:01:29.460> but<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:30.210> think<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.930> would<00:01:31.020> be<00:01:31.110> worthwhile

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
it but I think it would be worthwhile

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.140 
it but I think it would be worthwhile
just<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.920> save<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.460> could<00:01:32.610> go<00:01:32.700> back<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.030> it

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
just to save so you could go back to it

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.850 
just to save so you could go back to it
obviously<00:01:33.270> but<00:01:33.990> yeah<00:01:34.229> guys<00:01:34.380> that's<00:01:34.530> pretty

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860
