immensely immensely helpful for me to
sort<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.939> detach<00:01:48.329> from<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.659> thinking<00:01:49.200> you

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
sort of detach from the thinking you

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.520 
sort of detach from the thinking you
know<00:01:50.250> we<00:01:50.460> get<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:50.970> caught<00:01:51.000> up<00:01:51.600> in<00:01:51.750> our<00:01:51.899> minds<00:01:52.380> if

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
know we get so caught up in our minds if

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.920 
know we get so caught up in our minds if
we<00:01:53.100> can<00:01:53.280> learn<00:01:53.430> how<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.670> detach<00:01:54.119> from<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.540> mind

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.649 
we can learn how to detach from the mind
and<00:01:55.170> just<00:01:55.619> observe<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.340> it's<00:01:56.759> it's<00:01:57.240> like<00:01:57.479> the

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
and just observe it it's it's like the

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.179 
and just observe it it's it's like the
heart<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.079> mind<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.439> very<00:01:58.469> similar<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.040> the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
heart the mind is very similar to the

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.880 
heart the mind is very similar to the
heart<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.939> we<00:02:00.689> haven't<00:02:00.990> quite<00:02:01.110> got<00:02:01.409> this<00:02:01.619> yet

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
heart and we haven't quite got this yet

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.920 
heart and we haven't quite got this yet
as<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.399> society<00:02:02.880> but<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.420> mind<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:03.899> just

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
as a society but the mind is just

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.810 
as a society but the mind is just
thinker<00:02:04.469> that's<00:02:05.130> what<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.399> does<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.790> just

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
thinker that's what it does it just

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.280 
thinker that's what it does it just
thinks<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.420> things<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.780> things<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.110> things

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
thinks and things and things and things

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
and things and things but you can get to

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.119 
and things and things but you can get to
a<00:02:08.970> higher<00:02:09.239> level<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.780> awareness<00:02:09.950> where<00:02:10.950> you

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
a higher level of awareness where you

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.670 
a higher level of awareness where you
can<00:02:11.340> observe<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:12.150> thinking

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
can observe the thinking

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.069 
can observe the thinking
and<00:02:13.769> detached<00:02:14.340> from<00:02:14.489> it<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.790> then<00:02:15.060> with<00:02:15.599> focus

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
and detached from it and then with focus

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:18.619 
and detached from it and then with focus
and<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:17.129> can<00:02:17.370> actually<00:02:17.790> begin<00:02:17.939> to<00:02:18.090> slow<00:02:18.450> down

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
and you can actually begin to slow down

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.349 
and you can actually begin to slow down
the<00:02:18.840> thoughts<00:02:19.400> surrender<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.430> thinking<00:02:21.180> and

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:21.359 
the thoughts surrender the thinking and

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:25.009 
the thoughts surrender the thinking and
go<00:02:22.260> into<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.769> state<00:02:23.370> where<00:02:23.400> it's<00:02:24.030> more<00:02:24.450> non-dual

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
go into a state where it's more non-dual

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.869 
go into a state where it's more non-dual
and<00:02:25.379> where<00:02:25.560> there's<00:02:25.950> just<00:02:26.129> a<00:02:26.219> lot<00:02:26.370> of<00:02:26.430> peace

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
and where there's just a lot of peace

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.500

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
bringing it back and then the mind

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.770
