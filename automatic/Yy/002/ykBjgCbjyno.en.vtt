Hourglass<00:00:21.990> or<00:00:22.259> something<00:00:24.169> this<00:00:25.169> game<00:00:25.529> it's<00:00:25.800> a

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:25.919 
Hourglass or something this game it's a

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.310 
Hourglass or something this game it's a
lot<00:00:26.070> like<00:00:26.250> Zelda<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.149> was<00:00:27.300> like<00:00:27.540> looking<00:00:28.169> at

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
lot like Zelda and I was like looking at

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.560 
lot like Zelda and I was like looking at
the<00:00:28.439> cover<00:00:28.619> thinking<00:00:29.250> how<00:00:30.029> could<00:00:30.360> this<00:00:30.509> be

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
the cover thinking how could this be

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.479 
the cover thinking how could this be
anything<00:00:31.110> like<00:00:31.559> Zelda<00:00:32.660> it<00:00:33.660> just<00:00:33.960> didn't<00:00:34.290> look

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
anything like Zelda it just didn't look

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.490 
anything like Zelda it just didn't look
anything<00:00:35.489> like<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.940> Zelda<00:00:36.329> game<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.690> me<00:00:36.870> I

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
anything like a Zelda game to me I

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.830 
anything like a Zelda game to me I
looked<00:00:38.040> at<00:00:38.130> a<00:00:38.190> couple<00:00:38.219> screenshots<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.600> my

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
looked at a couple screenshots of it my

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.290 
looked at a couple screenshots of it my
whatever<00:00:40.649> these<00:00:41.399> people<00:00:41.460> are<00:00:41.820> crazy

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
whatever these people are crazy

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.259 
whatever these people are crazy
this<00:00:42.449> can't<00:00:42.750> be<00:00:42.809> anything<00:00:43.140> like<00:00:43.500> Zelda<00:00:44.269> but

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
this can't be anything like Zelda but

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.290 
this can't be anything like Zelda but
then<00:00:45.449> I<00:00:45.809> watched<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.710> few<00:00:47.070> gameplay<00:00:47.730> trailers

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
then I watched a few gameplay trailers

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.650 
then I watched a few gameplay trailers
and<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.929> I<00:00:49.379> thought<00:00:49.620> maybe<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.940> could<00:00:50.969> kind<00:00:51.600> of

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
and and I thought maybe it could kind of

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.959 
and and I thought maybe it could kind of
be<00:00:51.780> as<00:00:51.899> sort<00:00:52.199> as<00:00:52.379> old<00:00:52.559> like<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.100> let's<00:00:53.730> give<00:00:53.940> it

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
be as sort as old like so let's give it

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.540 
be as sort as old like so let's give it
a<00:00:54.089> shot<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:55.170> played<00:00:55.499> it<00:00:55.679> and<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:56.309> was

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
a shot and I played it and it was

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.389 
a shot and I played it and it was
amazing<00:00:57.469> it's<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:58.769> game<00:00:59.960> Okami

Twilight Princesses style it would be a

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.110 
Twilight Princesses style it would be a
Zelda<00:02:04.320> game<00:02:04.350> if<00:02:04.800> you<00:02:05.640> probably<00:02:05.820> have<00:02:06.030> to

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
kind of thing so it took a little bit of

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.050 
kind of thing so it took a little bit of
getting<00:02:30.629> used<00:02:30.749> to<00:02:31.200> but<00:02:31.319> when<00:02:31.829> I<00:02:31.879> but<00:02:32.879> not

really about long actually I feel like
nearly<00:02:36.030> as<00:02:36.150> soon<00:02:36.359> as<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:36.629> actually<00:02:36.810> started

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
nearly as soon as I actually started

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.619 
nearly as soon as I actually started
controlling<00:02:37.769> the<00:02:38.010> character<00:02:38.459> I<00:02:38.489> was<00:02:38.730> taken

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
controlling the character I was taken

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.160 
controlling the character I was taken
back<00:02:40.109> by<00:02:40.500> how<00:02:40.920> beautiful<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:42.299> art<00:02:42.450> style<00:02:42.810> was

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
back by how beautiful the art style was

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.140 
back by how beautiful the art style was
and<00:02:43.439> that's<00:02:43.739> no<00:02:43.950> surprise<00:02:44.189> that<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:44.909> turned

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
and that's no surprise that it turned

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.929 
and that's no surprise that it turned
out<00:02:45.329> that<00:02:45.540> this<00:02:45.750> game<00:02:46.139> a<00:02:46.790> lot<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:47.819> people

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:47.939 
out that this game a lot of people

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:50.929 
out that this game a lot of people
consider<00:02:48.569> it<00:02:48.659> a<00:02:48.840> Zelda<00:02:49.169> clone<00:02:49.379> because<00:02:49.939> it

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:50.939 
consider it a Zelda clone because it

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:53.539 
consider it a Zelda clone because it
isn't<00:02:51.150> really<00:02:51.689> a<00:02:51.719> Zelda<00:02:52.260> clone<00:02:52.409> but<00:02:52.950> it<00:02:53.219> does

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
isn't really a Zelda clone but it does

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.449 
isn't really a Zelda clone but it does
have<00:02:53.879> a<00:02:54.120> lot<00:02:54.510> of<00:02:54.540> gameplay<00:02:55.169> similarities<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.430> a

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
have a lot of gameplay similarities to a

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.849 
have a lot of gameplay similarities to a
Zelda<00:02:56.969> game<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.450> this<00:02:58.200> isn't<00:02:58.469> surprising

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
Zelda game and this isn't surprising

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.309 
Zelda game and this isn't surprising
because<00:02:59.219> the<00:02:59.969> developers<00:03:00.449> themselves<00:03:00.629> have

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
because the developers themselves have

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.339 
because the developers themselves have
said<00:03:01.620> yeah<00:03:02.370> we're<00:03:02.669> fans<00:03:02.909> of<00:03:03.150> Zelda<00:03:03.569> we<00:03:04.230> were

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
said yeah we're fans of Zelda we were

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:05.959 
said yeah we're fans of Zelda we were
trying<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.650> create<00:03:04.949> something<00:03:05.250> a<00:03:05.430> little<00:03:05.849> bit

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:05.969 
trying to create something a little bit

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.119 
trying to create something a little bit
like<00:03:06.540> that<00:03:06.930> you're<00:03:07.139> playing<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.709> part<00:03:07.980> of

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
like that you're playing the part of

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.229 
like that you're playing the part of
this<00:03:08.760> God<00:03:09.090> who<00:03:09.510> has<00:03:10.019> been<00:03:10.379> resurrected<00:03:11.239> or

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
this God who has been resurrected or

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.629 
this God who has been resurrected or
reborn<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.290> you<00:03:13.859> don't<00:03:14.069> have<00:03:14.250> all<00:03:14.430> of<00:03:14.519> your

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
reborn and you don't have all of your

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:17.809 
reborn and you don't have all of your
powers<00:03:14.699> yet<00:03:15.680> so<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.829> way<00:03:16.949> you<00:03:17.010> attack<00:03:17.489> is

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
powers yet so the way you attack is

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.679 
powers yet so the way you attack is
you've<00:03:18.030> got<00:03:18.269> these<00:03:19.280> swords<00:03:20.280> type<00:03:20.669> items<00:03:21.180> that

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:21.689 
you've got these swords type items that

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:25.129 
you've got these swords type items that

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
you sort of magically attack with it it

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.140 
you sort of magically attack with it it
feels<00:03:25.409> exactly<00:03:25.680> like<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.159> silver<00:03:26.519> game<00:03:26.699> you<00:03:26.909> hit

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
feels exactly like a silver game you hit

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.149 
feels exactly like a silver game you hit
a<00:03:27.209> button<00:03:27.389> and<00:03:27.720> that<00:03:27.750> swings<00:03:28.109> a<00:03:28.290> sword<00:03:28.319> it's

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 
a button and that swings a sword it's

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.360 
a button and that swings a sword it's
just<00:03:29.579> you<00:03:29.819> happen<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:30.120> be<00:03:30.299> able<00:03:30.919> and<00:03:31.919> the<00:03:32.069> sword

just you happen to be able and the sword
is<00:03:32.579> is<00:03:32.939> just<00:03:33.299> kind<00:03:33.540> of<00:03:33.569> swinging

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
is is just kind of swinging

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.479 
is is just kind of swinging
independently<00:03:34.680> of<00:03:34.799> that<00:03:34.829> you<00:03:35.159> get<00:03:35.340> other

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
independently of that you get other

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.839 
independently of that you get other
types<00:03:35.879> of<00:03:36.060> weapons<00:03:36.829> like<00:03:37.829> a<00:03:37.859> whip<00:03:38.189> sort<00:03:38.699> of

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
types of weapons like a whip sort of

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.830 
types of weapons like a whip sort of
thing<00:03:39.389> of<00:03:39.629> beads<00:03:39.930> and<00:03:40.530> this<00:03:41.459> disk<00:03:41.939> thing<00:03:42.479> that

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
thing of beads and this disk thing that

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.759 
thing of beads and this disk thing that
attacks<00:03:43.319> a<00:03:43.439> lot<00:03:43.590> of<00:03:43.709> enemies<00:03:44.449> and<00:03:45.500> what<00:03:46.500> were

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
attacks a lot of enemies and what were

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.030 
attacks a lot of enemies and what were
the<00:03:46.919> game<00:03:47.129> really<00:03:47.609> shines<00:03:47.639> is<00:03:48.829> if<00:03:49.829> you've

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
the game really shines is if you've

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.969 
the game really shines is if you've
played<00:03:50.459> any<00:03:50.909> of<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.329> DS<00:03:51.599> all<00:03:52.169> the<00:03:52.349> games<00:03:52.620> that

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:52.979 
played any of the DS all the games that

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:55.369 
played any of the DS all the games that
have<00:03:53.519> requiring<00:03:53.970> you<00:03:54.180> to<00:03:54.209> draw<00:03:54.750> with<00:03:55.229> the

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
have requiring you to draw with the

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.330 
have requiring you to draw with the
stylus<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.069> solve<00:03:56.639> puzzles<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.479> things<00:03:58.340> this

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
stylus to solve puzzles and things this

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.330 
stylus to solve puzzles and things this
is<00:04:00.000> very<00:04:00.150> similar<00:04:00.720> to<00:04:01.079> that<00:04:01.229> because<00:04:01.500> what<00:04:02.250> it

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
is very similar to that because what it

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.939 
is very similar to that because what it
uses<00:04:02.639> is<00:04:03.150> this<00:04:03.840> thing<00:04:04.139> called<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.470> celestial

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:04.949 
uses is this thing called the celestial

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.399 
uses is this thing called the celestial
paintbrush<00:04:05.639> and<00:04:05.879> with<00:04:06.569> this<00:04:06.810> you<00:04:07.109> basically

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:07.409 
paintbrush and with this you basically

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:11.149 
paintbrush and with this you basically
freeze<00:04:08.159> time<00:04:08.579> and<00:04:08.939> then<00:04:09.569> you<00:04:09.719> draw<00:04:10.079> over<00:04:10.769> the

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 
freeze time and then you draw over the

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:13.490 
freeze time and then you draw over the
screen<00:04:11.549> and<00:04:11.849> this<00:04:12.180> lets<00:04:12.629> you<00:04:12.689> do<00:04:12.959> a<00:04:12.989> lot<00:04:13.169> of

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
screen and this lets you do a lot of

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.709 
screen and this lets you do a lot of
things<00:04:13.859> unless<00:04:14.189> you<00:04:14.310> solve<00:04:14.579> puzzles<00:04:14.819> by

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:15.719 
things unless you solve puzzles by

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:18.170 
things unless you solve puzzles by
filling<00:04:16.320> in<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.469> gaps<00:04:16.859> and<00:04:17.190> then<00:04:17.400> recreating

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
filling in the gaps and then recreating

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.719 
filling in the gaps and then recreating
the<00:04:18.509> bridge<00:04:18.840> unless<00:04:19.799> you<00:04:20.009> slice<00:04:20.370> through

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
the bridge unless you slice through

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:25.129 
the bridge unless you slice through
enemies<00:04:21.269> it<00:04:21.599> lets<00:04:21.840> you<00:04:22.729> make<00:04:23.729> trees<00:04:24.240> bloom<00:04:24.840> and

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
enemies it lets you make trees bloom and
