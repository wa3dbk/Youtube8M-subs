00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
just mid what mid length and they are

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.640 
just mid what mid length and they are
thin<00:01:23.610> stitching<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.720> then<00:01:25.290> these<00:01:25.409> aren't

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
thin stitching and then these aren't

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.410 
thin stitching and then these aren't
over<00:01:25.830> here<00:01:26.009> are<00:01:26.189> fooling<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.090> then<00:01:27.240> these<00:01:27.360> are

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
over here are fooling and then these are

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.120 
over here are fooling and then these are
just<00:01:27.570> thicker<00:01:27.930> stitching<00:01:28.470> with<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> more

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
just thicker stitching with the more

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.200 
just thicker stitching with the more
simple<00:01:29.930> pocket<00:01:31.159> not<00:01:32.159> as<00:01:32.310> crazy<00:01:32.549> as<00:01:32.790> like<00:01:33.030> other

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
simple pocket not as crazy as like other

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.240 
simple pocket not as crazy as like other
ones<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.750> then<00:01:34.350> these<00:01:34.560> ones<00:01:34.770> right<00:01:35.009> here<00:01:35.040> are

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
ones and then these ones right here are

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.649 
ones and then these ones right here are
just<00:01:35.400> these<00:01:35.640> cross<00:01:35.970> ones<00:01:36.299> with<00:01:36.479> thin

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
just these cross ones with thin

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.780 
just these cross ones with thin
stitching<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.350> think<00:01:37.560> they<00:01:37.680> then<00:01:38.310> cinch<00:01:38.640> it

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
stitching I think they then cinch it

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.039 
stitching I think they then cinch it
because<00:01:39.060> they<00:01:39.150> have<00:01:39.420> like<00:01:39.540> such<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.810> dramatic

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
because they have like such a dramatic

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.149 
because they have like such a dramatic
like<00:01:40.500> pocket

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
like pocket

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.880 
like pocket
and<00:01:41.420> that's<00:01:42.420> not<00:01:42.689> those<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.500> these<00:01:43.560> are<00:01:43.740> all

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
and that's not those and these are all

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.109 
and that's not those and these are all
really<00:01:44.100> long<00:01:45.470> and<00:01:46.470> then<00:01:47.100> there's<00:01:47.670> these<00:01:47.880> ones

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
really long and then there's these ones

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.700 
really long and then there's these ones
that<00:01:48.299> I've<00:01:48.570> had<00:01:48.810> these<00:01:49.020> from<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.200> think<00:01:49.409> my<00:01:49.500> very
