00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello together some time ago I have 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.130
 I decided to change the one 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.480
 I have the ssd hard disk 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.300
 Hard disk replaced and not like 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.280
 some have optics three 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.260
 because I put the optical deep 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.779
 from time to time used just for friends 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.460
 and I used to know a dvd burner 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.260
 and therefore definitely the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.760
 hard disk because there was no 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.160
 I ask my data except the camp 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.570
 off and open load with out from therefore 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.920
 the decision was not for me 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.660
 as hard as the prices leave us 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.190
 At the moment I do not want to 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.960
 continue to tighten on the torture and will 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.460
 say let's just start 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.500
 explanation I have three different ones 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.140
 Boot time made because I am now 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.309
 first bought the RAM 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.899
 always wanted to show how things are improving 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:55.260
 man I always have the power 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.750
 button is pressed and the start button on 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.100
 the part of the ipad to the lions are like that 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.559
 that you have the perfect 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.030
 impression we want to start and 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.710
 did not on purpose should the state 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.970
 I waited because I think that then I 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.930
 but a second or two 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.439
 Tenths of a second 100 seconds maybe 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.060
 but always would have been different and thus 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.390
 the result year more or less for 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.299
 feldstetten that was not my intention 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:24.299
 yes we can see the imac at 27 here 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:27.560
 inch the 2009 with 8 gb of RAM 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.610
 and the swapped hard disk from the 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.009
 exchange program before there was one 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.810
 western digital now there is one 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.500
 winner apple has it for free 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.869
 exchanged exchange program and straight 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.220
 once two weeks ago 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:46.079
 Nonetheless, for me it was 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:51.060
 but important and you see the now 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:53.390
 start time system was now 55 258 believe 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.390
 7 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.980
 in comparison, as already starts 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.440
 that starts then 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.750
 now we have the imac 27 inch so 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.430
 is the same device but with 16 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.920
 gb memory and the old one 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.570
 hard disk to see you there already 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.510
 what touches the memory on 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.340
 a small change happens to us 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.640
 will see soon 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:21.700
 Incidentally, I have myself for the samsung 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:25.370
 ssd fall 840 percent 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.830
 some say human 2009 imac can 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.680
 yes, only three gigabit about the theater 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.820
 the map or the plate view 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.680
 can be six gigabit 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.820
 I opted for that because 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.620
 it has 512 mb cache like all others 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.150
 had only 256 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.770
 I promise anyway 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.020
 a little more protection in the year 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:49.310
 2050 now is 48.3 seconds 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.070
 started up and inserted 94 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.400
 seconds of photoshop started and now 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:58.420
 Let's start with the 16 gb and the new one 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.350
 ssd disk we will see 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.450
 I do not have much time left 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.380
 That's why I want to chat 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:10.310
 Thank you very much 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:13.670
 watch rated mg resp 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.300
 the video and I would even join 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.250
 let it spread 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.800
 to make a video of it like the ssd 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.010
 Renovation in itself works for the one 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.209
 or others may still doubt 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.209
 I do not even have half an hour there 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.040
 ran sat and hope I can with the 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.410
 video that they doubt now 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.660
 conviction to make the conversion because 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:40.190
 now seen with 22 seconds system 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:42.380
 boot time has a lot if I have 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.120
 that with the first normal comparisons 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.700
 So I wish you a lot of fun thank you 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.700
 until then rate your patrick
