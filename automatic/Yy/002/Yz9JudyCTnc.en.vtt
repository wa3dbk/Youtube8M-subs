00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
warship will move it to a different spot

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.289 
warship will move it to a different spot
on<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.040> map<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.640> can<00:01:05.790> get<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.939> clear

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
on the map so that you can get a clear

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.510 
on the map so that you can get a clear
view<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:06.750> your<00:01:06.930> targets<00:01:07.380> now<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.130> right

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
view of your targets now the right

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.310 
view of your targets now the right
button<00:01:08.909> will<00:01:09.060> actually<00:01:09.390> fire<00:01:09.630> missiles<00:01:10.170> as

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
button will actually fire missiles as

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.010 
button will actually fire missiles as
well<00:01:10.560> also<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.610> VTOL<00:01:12.000> warship<00:01:12.330> last<00:01:12.720> for<00:01:12.990> a

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
well also the VTOL warship last for a

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.469 
well also the VTOL warship last for a
max<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.530> 55<00:01:14.130> seconds<00:01:14.580> if<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.850> does<00:01:15.030> not<00:01:15.060> get

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
max of 55 seconds if it does not get

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.260 
max of 55 seconds if it does not get
shot<00:01:15.810> down<00:01:15.860> now<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:16.979> multiplayer<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.759> do<00:01:18.000> tend

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
shot down now in multiplayer you do tend

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.149 
shot down now in multiplayer you do tend
to<00:01:18.330> see<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.780> loads<00:01:19.020> are<00:01:19.290> being<00:01:19.560> used<00:01:19.799> much

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
to see the loads are being used much

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.039 
to see the loads are being used much
more<00:01:20.400> often<00:01:20.580> than<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.060> VTOL<00:01:21.450> warship<00:01:21.780> and

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
more often than the VTOL warship and

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.840 
more often than the VTOL warship and
that's<00:01:22.170> for<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.350> good<00:01:22.500> reason<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:23.369> lodestar

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
that's for a good reason the lodestar

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.690 
that's for a good reason the lodestar
requires<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.420> score<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.049> 100<00:01:25.830> less<00:01:26.070> point<00:01:26.460> and

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
requires a score of 100 less point and

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.490 
requires a score of 100 less point and
it<00:01:26.790> actually<00:01:26.970> gets<00:01:27.360> more<00:01:27.659> kills<00:01:27.930> on<00:01:28.140> average

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
it actually gets more kills on average

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.560 
it actually gets more kills on average
than<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.829> worship<00:01:29.220> by<00:01:29.670> no<00:01:29.729> means<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.420> the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
than the worship by no means is the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.749 
than the worship by no means is the
warship<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.140> bad<00:01:31.380> kill<00:01:31.710> streak<00:01:32.009> at<00:01:32.220> all<00:01:32.460> it's

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
warship a bad kill streak at all it's

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.130 
warship a bad kill streak at all it's
just<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.150> load<00:01:33.329> stars<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.689> little<00:01:34.020> bit

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
just that the load stars a little bit

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.569 
just that the load stars a little bit
easier<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.500> get<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.250> little<00:01:35.400> bit

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
easier to get and just a little bit

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.789 
easier to get and just a little bit
better<00:01:35.820> personally<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.780> feel<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.439> VTOL

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
better personally I feel that the VTOL

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.980 
better personally I feel that the VTOL
warship<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.430> much<00:01:38.700> more<00:01:38.909> fun<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.270> control<00:01:39.780> than

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
warship is much more fun to control than

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.660 
warship is much more fun to control than
the<00:01:40.140> lodestar<00:01:40.619> simply<00:01:40.979> because<00:01:41.250> it's<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.490> bit

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
the lodestar simply because it's a bit

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.950 
the lodestar simply because it's a bit
more<00:01:41.820> interactive<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.540> has<00:01:42.689> some<00:01:42.869> more

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
more interactive and has some more

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.810 
more interactive and has some more
functions<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:44.009> one<00:01:44.189> time<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.640> would

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
functions but one time that I would

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.730 
functions but one time that I would
definitely<00:01:45.090> recommend<00:01:45.570> using<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.350> VTOL

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
definitely recommend using the VTOL

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.620 
definitely recommend using the VTOL
warship<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.340> when<00:01:47.579> running<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.060> Warthog

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
warship is when running the Warthog

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.560 
warship is when running the Warthog
lodestar<00:01:49.259> warship<00:01:49.770> set<00:01:50.040> up<00:01:50.189> this<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.060> great

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
lodestar warship set up this is a great

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.969 
lodestar warship set up this is a great
score<00:01:51.960> streak<00:01:52.200> set<00:01:52.350> up<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.649> that's<00:01:52.770> what<00:01:52.890> I'm

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
score streak set up and that's what I'm

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.010 
score streak set up and that's what I'm
using<00:01:53.189> in<00:01:53.460> this<00:01:53.610> game<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.119> that's<00:01:54.479> because<00:01:54.720> if

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
using in this game and that's because if

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.359 
using in this game and that's because if
you<00:01:55.170> get<00:01:55.350> your<00:01:55.470> warthog<00:01:55.890> you're<00:01:56.159> almost

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
you get your warthog you're almost

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.850 
you get your warthog you're almost
guaranteed<00:01:57.030> both<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.320> your<00:01:58.439> other<00:01:58.530> kill

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
guaranteed both of your other kill

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.380 
guaranteed both of your other kill
streaks<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.340> this<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.579> because<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.969> Warthog

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
streaks and this is because the Warthog

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.389 
streaks and this is because the Warthog
will<00:02:00.570> help<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.840> out<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.200> all<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.040> need<00:02:02.219> is

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
will help you out and all you need is

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.280 
will help you out and all you need is
just<00:02:02.579> one<00:02:02.700> kill<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.299> get<00:02:03.390> your<00:02:03.630> lodestar<00:02:04.110> and

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
just one kill to get your lodestar and

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.749 
just one kill to get your lodestar and
then<00:02:04.380> your<00:02:04.530> lodestar<00:02:04.979> will<00:02:05.130> definitely<00:02:05.579> get

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
then your lodestar will definitely get

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.609 
then your lodestar will definitely get
you<00:02:05.969> your<00:02:06.149> worship<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:06.840> it's<00:02:07.049> an<00:02:07.170> absolutely

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
you your worship so it's an absolutely

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.190 
you your worship so it's an absolutely
amazing<00:02:08.099> set<00:02:08.910> up<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.119> really<00:02:09.479> like<00:02:09.660> using<00:02:09.899> it

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
amazing set up I really like using it

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.639 
amazing set up I really like using it
and<00:02:10.289> if<00:02:10.410> you

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
and if you

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.470 
and if you
do<00:02:10.739> manage<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.129> get<00:02:11.400> your<00:02:11.489> warthog<00:02:11.939> like<00:02:12.450> I

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
do manage to get your warthog like I

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.059 
do manage to get your warthog like I
said<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:12.900> gets<00:02:13.079> you<00:02:13.170> your<00:02:13.200> worship<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:13.950> that's

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
said it gets you your worship and that's

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.399 
said it gets you your worship and that's
typically<00:02:14.400> around<00:02:14.700> another<00:02:14.970> 20<00:02:15.450> 25<00:02:15.870> kills<00:02:16.230> in

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
typically around another 20 25 kills in

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.009 
typically around another 20 25 kills in
your<00:02:16.530> game<00:02:16.739> so<00:02:17.430> overall<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:18.090> VTOL<00:02:18.420> warship<00:02:18.750> is

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
your game so overall the VTOL warship is

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.899 
your game so overall the VTOL warship is
slightly<00:02:19.530> underpowered<00:02:20.129> for<00:02:20.549> the<00:02:20.640> score

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
slightly underpowered for the score

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.789 
slightly underpowered for the score
streak<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.329> requires<00:02:21.689> but<00:02:22.379> when<00:02:22.620> used

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
streak it requires but when used

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.559 
streak it requires but when used
correctly<00:02:22.950> if<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.519> can<00:02:23.790> manage<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.209> get<00:02:24.420> that

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
correctly if you can manage to get that

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.140 
correctly if you can manage to get that
score<00:02:24.989> it<00:02:25.170> is<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.319> very<00:02:25.650> solid<00:02:26.250> streak<00:02:26.549> hope<00:02:27.060> you

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
score it is a very solid streak hope you

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.580 
score it is a very solid streak hope you
