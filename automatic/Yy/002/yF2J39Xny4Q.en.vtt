they<00:00:00.870> wanted<00:00:01.110> to<00:00:01.199> find<00:00:01.500> out<00:00:01.740> the<00:00:02.129> number<00:00:02.700> of

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
they wanted to find out the number of

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.760 
they wanted to find out the number of
moves<00:00:03.149> it<00:00:03.510> would<00:00:03.629> take<00:00:03.959> to<00:00:04.200> solve<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.620> most

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
moves it would take to solve the most

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.000 
moves it would take to solve the most
difficult<00:00:05.660> combination<00:00:06.660> and<00:00:06.839> this<00:00:07.740> number

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
difficult combination and this number

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.339 
difficult combination and this number
would<00:00:08.189> be<00:00:08.250> called<00:00:08.580> God's<00:00:08.910> number<00:00:09.210> if<00:00:09.540> you<00:00:10.139> had

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
would be called God's number if you had

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.560 
would be called God's number if you had
perfect<00:00:10.679> knowledge<00:00:11.340> of<00:00:11.580> how<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.059> do<00:00:12.389> the

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
perfect knowledge of how to do the

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.780 
perfect knowledge of how to do the
Rubik's<00:00:13.019> Cube<00:00:13.380> you<00:00:14.009> would<00:00:14.130> be<00:00:14.280> able<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.519> solve

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
Rubik's Cube you would be able to solve

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.170 
Rubik's Cube you would be able to solve
the<00:00:15.330> most<00:00:15.450> difficult<00:00:15.619> position<00:00:16.619> in<00:00:17.180> it's

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
the most difficult position in it's

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.620 
the most difficult position in it's
perfect<00:00:18.990> most<00:00:19.350> efficient<00:00:19.980> algorithm

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.600 

obviously<00:00:24.350> it<00:00:24.560> could<00:00:24.770> if<00:00:24.950> you<00:00:25.100> get<00:00:25.250> a<00:00:25.280> solved

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 
obviously it could if you get a solved

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.850 
obviously it could if you get a solved
cube<00:00:25.670> and<00:00:26.150> you<00:00:26.540> twist<00:00:26.960> one<00:00:27.230> bit<00:00:27.470> you've<00:00:27.680> just

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:27.860 
cube and you twist one bit you've just

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.440 
cube and you twist one bit you've just
got<00:00:27.980> to<00:00:28.010> twist<00:00:28.190> it<00:00:28.370> back<00:00:28.520> so<00:00:28.910> it<00:00:28.970> could<00:00:29.150> be<00:00:29.270> one

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.450 
got to twist it back so it could be one

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.060 
got to twist it back so it could be one
or<00:00:29.660> it<00:00:29.840> could<00:00:29.990> be<00:00:30.080> two<00:00:30.320> twists<00:00:30.620> so<00:00:30.770> it<00:00:30.860> could<00:00:30.980> be

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
or it could be two twists so it could be

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.280 
or it could be two twists so it could be
five<00:00:31.280> or<00:00:31.310> so<00:00:31.640> on<00:00:31.760> but<00:00:32.540> what's<00:00:32.720> the<00:00:32.870> most<00:00:33.050> you're

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
five or so on but what's the most you're

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.810 
five or so on but what's the most you're
going<00:00:33.410> to<00:00:33.500> need<00:00:33.650> and<00:00:33.830> it<00:00:34.010> turns<00:00:34.310> out<00:00:34.520> I<00:00:34.700> mean

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
going to need and it turns out I mean

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.170 
going to need and it turns out I mean
for<00:00:34.970> a<00:00:35.000> long<00:00:35.150> time<00:00:35.360> we<00:00:35.480> didn't<00:00:35.750> know<00:00:37.030> so<00:00:38.030> they

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
for a long time we didn't know so they

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.390 
for a long time we didn't know so they
knew<00:00:38.450> that's<00:00:38.900> the<00:00:39.500> number<00:00:39.710> of<00:00:39.800> combinations

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.400 
knew that's the number of combinations

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.830 
knew that's the number of combinations
for<00:00:40.580> the<00:00:40.610> Rubik's<00:00:40.910> Cube<00:00:41.239> was<00:00:41.450> this<00:00:41.570> huge

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
for the Rubik's Cube was this huge

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.490 
for the Rubik's Cube was this huge
numbers<00:00:42.230> 43<00:00:42.980> quintillion<00:00:43.250> and<00:00:43.940> you<00:00:44.660> turn<00:00:45.080> a

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
numbers 43 quintillion and you turn a

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.900 
numbers 43 quintillion and you turn a
piece<00:00:46.370> 17<00:00:47.210> times<00:00:47.629> if<00:00:47.960> we<00:00:48.050> do<00:00:48.170> 17<00:00:48.680> moves<00:00:49.010> the

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
piece 17 times if we do 17 moves the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.640 
piece 17 times if we do 17 moves the
number<00:00:50.180> of<00:00:50.239> combinations<00:00:50.449> you<00:00:50.960> can<00:00:51.110> reach<00:00:51.379> is

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
number of combinations you can reach is

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.460 
number of combinations you can reach is
less<00:00:51.920> than<00:00:52.820> this<00:00:53.030> massive<00:00:53.480> number<00:00:53.870> 43

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
less than this massive number 43

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.310 
less than this massive number 43
quintillion<00:00:54.790> so<00:00:55.790> if<00:00:56.269> you<00:00:56.809> want<00:00:56.960> to<00:00:57.050> be<00:00:57.140> able<00:00:57.230> to

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
quintillion so if you want to be able to

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.009 
quintillion so if you want to be able to
solve<00:00:57.559> all<00:00:57.769> combinations<00:00:58.629> it's<00:00:59.629> definitely

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
solve all combinations it's definitely

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:01.270 
solve all combinations it's definitely
more<00:01:00.110> than<00:01:00.140> seventeen<00:01:00.650> because<00:01:00.890> there's<00:01:01.100> some

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
more than seventeen because there's some

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.189 
more than seventeen because there's some
that<00:01:01.400> you<00:01:01.550> can't<00:01:01.729> even<00:01:01.820> reach<00:01:02.120> and<00:01:03.050> they

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
that you can't even reach and they

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:04.750 
that you can't even reach and they
managed<00:01:03.440> to<00:01:03.500> work<00:01:03.710> out<00:01:04.010> that<00:01:04.370> it<00:01:04.489> was<00:01:04.580> less

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
managed to work out that it was less

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.530 
managed to work out that it was less
than<00:01:04.790> 30<00:01:05.560> and<00:01:06.560> over<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:07.159> years<00:01:07.550> they<00:01:08.180> started

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
than 30 and over the years they started

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.850 
than 30 and over the years they started
to<00:01:08.600> whittle<00:01:08.990> this<00:01:09.110> down<00:01:09.170> closer<00:01:09.860> and<00:01:10.220> closer

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
to whittle this down closer and closer

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.280 
to whittle this down closer and closer
then<00:01:12.860> you<00:01:13.010> can<00:01:13.159> tell<00:01:13.370> I'm<00:01:13.640> not<00:01:13.909> really<00:01:14.600> fast

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
then you can tell I'm not really fast

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.020 
then you can tell I'm not really fast
but<00:01:15.740> I'm<00:01:15.890> not<00:01:16.460> too<00:01:16.880> slow<00:01:17.270> either<00:01:17.710> it<00:01:18.710> was<00:01:19.030> 2010

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
but I'm not too slow either it was 2010

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.120 
but I'm not too slow either it was 2010
was<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:20.720> first<00:01:20.930> time<00:01:21.200> we<00:01:21.409> actually<00:01:21.440> knew<00:01:21.920> for

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
was the first time we actually knew for

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.090 
was the first time we actually knew for
sure<00:01:22.180> no<00:01:23.180> matter<00:01:23.360> how<00:01:23.630> much<00:01:23.900> you<00:01:24.229> scramble<00:01:24.950> up

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
sure no matter how much you scramble up

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.789 
sure no matter how much you scramble up
a<00:01:25.190> rubik's<00:01:25.580> cube<00:01:25.940> you<00:01:26.240> can<00:01:26.479> solve<00:01:26.750> it<00:01:26.930> in<00:01:27.020> 20<00:01:27.560> or

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
a rubik's cube you can solve it in 20 or

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.609 
a rubik's cube you can solve it in 20 or
fewer<00:01:28.159> twists<00:01:29.090> it's<00:01:30.049> caught<00:01:30.259> from<00:01:30.380> called

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
fewer twists it's caught from called

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:31.330 
fewer twists it's caught from called
God's<00:01:30.890> number

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
God's number

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.429 
God's number
it's<00:01:31.670> called<00:01:31.909> God's<00:01:32.180> number<00:01:32.539> because<00:01:32.869> you'd

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
it's called God's number because you'd

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.649 
it's called God's number because you'd
have<00:01:33.500> to<00:01:33.829> be<00:01:33.950> some<00:01:34.219> kind<00:01:34.520> of<00:01:34.610> a<00:01:34.700> missing<00:01:35.210> being

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
have to be some kind of a missing being

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.289 
have to be some kind of a missing being
to<00:01:36.380> work<00:01:36.590> out<00:01:36.860> those<00:01:37.100> 20<00:01:37.579> moves<00:01:37.820> it's<00:01:38.090> just

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
to work out those 20 moves it's just

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.620 
to work out those 20 moves it's just
this<00:01:39.200> it's<00:01:39.649> so<00:01:40.159> difficult<00:01:40.490> to<00:01:40.820> calculate<00:01:41.149> what

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
this it's so difficult to calculate what

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.420 
this it's so difficult to calculate what
those<00:01:41.780> moves<00:01:42.109> are<00:01:42.350> I<00:01:42.560> mean<00:01:42.649> I<00:01:42.740> couldn't<00:01:43.130> look

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
those moves are I mean I couldn't look

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.849 
those moves are I mean I couldn't look
at<00:01:43.579> a<00:01:43.640> cube<00:01:43.969> and<00:01:44.119> say<00:01:44.390> oh<00:01:44.600> I<00:01:44.960> need<00:01:45.320> to<00:01:45.350> do<00:01:45.590> these

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:45.859 
at a cube and say oh I need to do these

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:48.160 
at a cube and say oh I need to do these
twelve<00:01:46.430> moves<00:01:46.820> or<00:01:46.969> whatever<00:01:47.210> but<00:01:47.990> there<00:01:48.079> are

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
twelve moves or whatever but there are

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.830 
twelve moves or whatever but there are
people<00:01:48.409> who<00:01:48.469> can<00:01:48.649> so<00:01:49.399> they<00:01:49.520> do<00:01:49.659> rubik's<00:01:50.659> cube

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
people who can so they do rubik's cube

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.090 
people who can so they do rubik's cube
solving<00:01:51.170> competitions<00:01:51.680> and<00:01:51.859> they<00:01:51.950> have

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
solving competitions and they have

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.279 
solving competitions and they have
obviously<00:01:52.850> speed<00:01:53.149> challenges<00:01:53.780> and<00:01:53.929> see<00:01:54.229> you

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
obviously speed challenges and see you

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:56.260 
obviously speed challenges and see you
can<00:01:54.409> solve<00:01:54.590> it<00:01:54.679> the<00:01:54.770> fastest<00:01:55.189> but<00:01:55.969> one<00:01:56.090> of<00:01:56.179> the

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
can solve it the fastest but one of the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.480 
can solve it the fastest but one of the
other<00:01:56.420> things<00:01:56.659> that<00:01:56.750> they<00:01:56.960> do<00:01:57.020> is<00:01:57.409> a<00:01:57.770> kind<00:01:58.460> of

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
other things that they do is a kind of

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.389 
other things that they do is a kind of
efficient<00:01:59.119> solve<00:02:00.009> competition<00:02:01.009> and<00:02:01.280> the

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
efficient solve competition and the

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.249 
efficient solve competition and the
competition<00:02:01.909> there<00:02:02.119> is<00:02:02.329> look<00:02:02.719> at<00:02:02.869> a<00:02:02.899> rubik's

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
competition there is look at a rubik's

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.980 
competition there is look at a rubik's
cube<00:02:03.560> and<00:02:03.799> then<00:02:04.219> just<00:02:04.429> write<00:02:04.670> down<00:02:04.700> a<00:02:05.270> list<00:02:05.780> of

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
cube and then just write down a list of

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.239 
cube and then just write down a list of
moves<00:02:06.170> that<00:02:06.380> will<00:02:06.469> solve<00:02:06.679> it<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.039> world

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:07.249 
moves that will solve it the world

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:09.669 
moves that will solve it the world
record<00:02:07.609> for<00:02:07.640> that<00:02:07.939> is<00:02:08.060> 23<00:02:08.780> moves<00:02:09.020> and

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
record for that is 23 moves and

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.260 
record for that is 23 moves and
obviously<00:02:10.039> that<00:02:10.280> was<00:02:10.460> for<00:02:11.000> a<00:02:11.030> particular

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
obviously that was for a particular

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.670 
obviously that was for a particular
scramble<00:02:11.840> of<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:11.990> cube<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:12.320> it<00:02:12.440> may<00:02:12.560> have

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
scramble of the cube and it may have

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.440 
scramble of the cube and it may have
been<00:02:12.710> that<00:02:13.070> the<00:02:13.220> actual<00:02:13.580> most<00:02:13.880> efficient<00:02:14.360> way

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
been that the actual most efficient way

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.960 
been that the actual most efficient way
to<00:02:14.480> solve<00:02:14.810> that<00:02:15.080> was<00:02:15.260> fewer<00:02:15.500> than<00:02:15.620> 20<00:02:16.010> but<00:02:16.940> a

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
to solve that was fewer than 20 but a

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.700 
to solve that was fewer than 20 but a
human<00:02:17.300> can<00:02:17.600> look<00:02:17.750> at<00:02:17.900> it<00:02:18.020> and<00:02:18.170> actually<00:02:18.320> write

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
human can look at it and actually write

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.260 
human can look at it and actually write
down<00:02:18.740> a<00:02:18.920> list<00:02:19.130> of<00:02:19.250> 23<00:02:19.580> which<00:02:19.790> i<00:02:19.940> think<00:02:20.000> is

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
down a list of 23 which i think is

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.360 
down a list of 23 which i think is
probably<00:02:20.900> more<00:02:21.290> impressive<00:02:21.860> than<00:02:21.950> people<00:02:22.250> who

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
probably more impressive than people who

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.830 
probably more impressive than people who
can<00:02:22.520> solve<00:02:22.700> it<00:02:22.880> really<00:02:23.090> quickly<00:02:23.300> you<00:02:23.690> might

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
can solve it really quickly you might

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.600 
can solve it really quickly you might
think<00:02:24.020> well<00:02:24.140> how<00:02:24.200> do<00:02:24.260> we<00:02:24.350> know<00:02:24.500> how<00:02:25.160> do<00:02:25.220> we<00:02:25.340> know

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
think well how do we know how do we know

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.210 
think well how do we know how do we know
that<00:02:25.780> did<00:02:26.780> we<00:02:26.870> just<00:02:27.050> check<00:02:27.290> all<00:02:27.500> to<00:02:27.650> all<00:02:27.830> forty

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
that did we just check all to all forty

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.770 
that did we just check all to all forty
three<00:02:28.400> point<00:02:28.610> two<00:02:28.730> five<00:02:28.910> billion<00:02:29.270> billion

different<00:02:30.590> ways<00:02:30.740> of<00:02:30.950> solving<00:02:31.130> and<00:02:31.640> we

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
different ways of solving and we

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.559 
different ways of solving and we
effectively<00:02:32.780> did<00:02:33.140> that

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.470 

I'm<00:02:36.569> moved<00:02:36.870> by<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.140> way<00:02:37.319> is<00:02:37.640> a<00:02:38.640> quarter<00:02:39.269> turn

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
I'm moved by the way is a quarter turn

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.949 
I'm moved by the way is a quarter turn
or<00:02:40.159> quarter<00:02:41.159> turn<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.459> other<00:02:41.610> way<00:02:41.760> or<00:02:42.000> half

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
or quarter turn the other way or half

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.380 
or quarter turn the other way or half
turn<00:02:43.409> that<00:02:44.280> count<00:02:44.549> so<00:02:44.670> anything<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.060> you

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
turn that count so anything that you

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.440 
turn that count so anything that you
move<00:02:45.769> counters<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:46.950> move<00:02:47.370> all<00:02:48.120> right<00:02:48.299> so<00:02:48.420> a

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
move counters and move all right so a

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.660 
move counters and move all right so a
quarter<00:02:48.780> turn<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:49.230> quarter<00:02:49.590> turn<00:02:49.769> or<00:02:50.069> half<00:02:50.340> turn

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
quarter turn a quarter turn or half turn

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.830 
quarter turn a quarter turn or half turn
those<00:02:51.090> all<00:02:51.209> counts<00:02:51.540> as<00:02:51.659> one<00:02:51.900> move<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:53.840> guys

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
those all counts as one move you guys

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.500 
those all counts as one move you guys
got<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.920> Rubik's<00:02:56.220> Cube<00:02:56.579> and<00:02:56.819> they<00:02:57.000> said<00:02:57.299> look

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
got the Rubik's Cube and they said look

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.119 
got the Rubik's Cube and they said look
at<00:02:57.629> all<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.870> possible<00:02:58.260> combinations<00:02:58.560> and

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
at all the possible combinations and

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.009 
at all the possible combinations and
they<00:02:59.250> realize<00:02:59.700> that<00:02:59.940> actually<00:03:00.090> you<00:03:00.870> don't

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
they realize that actually you don't

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.390 
they realize that actually you don't
have<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.290> check<00:03:01.440> all<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.650> them<00:03:01.920> because<00:03:02.250> some

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
have to check all of them because some

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.000 
have to check all of them because some
of<00:03:02.430> them<00:03:02.579> are<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.730> same<00:03:02.909> and<00:03:03.209> so<00:03:03.450> they<00:03:03.569> used

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
of them are the same and so they used

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.229 
of them are the same and so they used
arguments<00:03:05.010> from<00:03:05.129> symmetry<00:03:05.489> saying<00:03:05.940> in<00:03:06.060> fact

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
arguments from symmetry saying in fact

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.270 
arguments from symmetry saying in fact
being<00:03:06.780> mixed<00:03:06.959> up<00:03:07.170> this<00:03:07.440> way<00:03:07.650> is<00:03:07.890> actually<00:03:08.040> the

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
being mixed up this way is actually the

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.770 
being mixed up this way is actually the

same as being mixed up that way it's the

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.050 
same as being mixed up that way it's the
same<00:03:09.810> way<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.260> solve<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.829> and<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.609> so<00:03:11.640> on<00:03:11.940> and

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
same way to solve it and and so on and

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.809 
same way to solve it and and so on and
so<00:03:12.209> on<00:03:12.239> and<00:03:12.510> so<00:03:13.019> that<00:03:13.170> they<00:03:13.379> may<00:03:14.190> stew<00:03:14.400> whittle

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
so on and so that they may stew whittle

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.580 
so on and so that they may stew whittle
down<00:03:14.849> the<00:03:15.120> number<00:03:15.629> of<00:03:15.750> ones<00:03:15.989> they<00:03:16.200> have<00:03:16.410> to

down the number of ones they have to

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.809 
down the number of ones they have to
check<00:03:16.829> and<00:03:17.129> this<00:03:17.340> is<00:03:17.430> one<00:03:17.519> of<00:03:17.549> those<00:03:17.640> wonderful

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
check and this is one of those wonderful

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.220 
check and this is one of those wonderful
things<00:03:18.030> where<00:03:18.390> you<00:03:18.480> do<00:03:18.599> a<00:03:18.629> proof<00:03:18.930> by

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
things where you do a proof by

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.099 
things where you do a proof by
exhaustion<00:03:19.680> they<00:03:20.280> found<00:03:20.700> a<00:03:21.120> very<00:03:21.720> difficult

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
exhaustion they found a very difficult

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.800 
exhaustion they found a very difficult
position<00:03:22.590> it<00:03:23.579> was<00:03:23.730> called<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.090> super<00:03:24.540> flip

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
position it was called the super flip

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.890 
position it was called the super flip
now<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:25.829> super<00:03:26.310> flip<00:03:26.549> is<00:03:26.900> essentially

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
now the super flip is essentially

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.190 
now the super flip is essentially
completely<00:03:28.709> solved<00:03:29.510> except<00:03:30.510> each<00:03:30.810> edge

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
completely solved except each edge

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.930 
completely solved except each edge
position<00:03:32.159> was<00:03:32.909> flipped<00:03:33.269> over<00:03:34.099> now<00:03:35.099> that<00:03:35.489> would

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
position was flipped over now that would

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.680 
position was flipped over now that would
be<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.090> very<00:03:36.569> difficult<00:03:37.190> position<00:03:38.190> to<00:03:38.220> solve

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
be a very difficult position to solve

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.599 
be a very difficult position to solve
they<00:03:39.690> realized<00:03:40.380> that<00:03:40.680> you<00:03:40.769> could<00:03:40.950> solve<00:03:41.340> that

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
they realized that you could solve that

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.259 
they realized that you could solve that
position<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.209> super<00:03:42.660> flip<00:03:42.930> in<00:03:43.760> 20<00:03:44.760> moves<00:03:45.000> and

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
position the super flip in 20 moves and

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.360 
position the super flip in 20 moves and
they<00:03:46.139> proved<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:46.500> you<00:03:46.739> couldn't<00:03:47.010> do<00:03:47.099> it<00:03:47.220> in

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
they proved that you couldn't do it in

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.879 
they proved that you couldn't do it in
anything<00:03:47.700> less<00:03:48.180> than<00:03:48.510> 20<00:03:48.870> moves<00:03:49.109> so<00:03:49.859> you

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
anything less than 20 moves so you

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.369 
anything less than 20 moves so you
couldn't<00:03:50.220> do<00:03:50.280> it<00:03:50.400> in<00:03:50.459> 19<00:03:50.819> or<00:03:51.090> 18<00:03:51.200> nothing<00:03:52.200> less

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
couldn't do it in 19 or 18 nothing less

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.550 
couldn't do it in 19 or 18 nothing less
so<00:03:53.099> 20<00:03:53.579> moves<00:03:53.819> so<00:03:54.000> they<00:03:54.120> thought<00:03:54.239> great<00:03:54.780> maybe

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
so 20 moves so they thought great maybe

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.190 
so 20 moves so they thought great maybe
20<00:03:56.190> is<00:03:56.430> God's<00:03:56.849> number<00:03:57.299> and<00:03:57.569> to<00:03:57.660> do<00:03:57.750> a<00:03:57.780> proof<00:03:57.989> by

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
20 is God's number and to do a proof by

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.390 
20 is God's number and to do a proof by
exhaustion<00:03:58.560> you<00:03:58.709> have<00:03:58.799> to<00:03:58.889> do<00:03:58.980> two<00:03:59.160> things

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
exhaustion you have to do two things

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.729 
exhaustion you have to do two things
you've<00:03:59.790> got<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.000> first<00:04:00.269> of<00:04:00.450> all<00:04:00.569> reduce<00:04:01.530> the

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
you've got a first of all reduce the

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.379 
you've got a first of all reduce the
number<00:04:02.010> of<00:04:02.040> cases<00:04:02.310> you<00:04:02.669> need<00:04:02.790> to<00:04:02.970> check<00:04:03.209> as

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
number of cases you need to check as

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:04.250 
number of cases you need to check as
much<00:04:03.599> as<00:04:03.780> you<00:04:03.870> can

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
much as you can

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.650 
much as you can
secondly<00:04:04.859> you've<00:04:05.250> got<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:05.519> get<00:04:05.940> very<00:04:06.209> clever

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
secondly you've got to get very clever

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.080 
secondly you've got to get very clever
ways<00:04:06.959> of<00:04:07.290> checking<00:04:07.560> them<00:04:07.919> and<00:04:08.069> so<00:04:08.430> they<00:04:08.819> got<00:04:09.030> a

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
ways of checking them and so they got a

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.089 
ways of checking them and so they got a
better<00:04:09.599> and<00:04:09.750> better<00:04:09.840> computer<00:04:10.319> programs<00:04:10.739> and

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
better and better computer programs and

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.059 
better and better computer programs and
also<00:04:11.459> more<00:04:12.030> and<00:04:12.209> more<00:04:12.299> powerful<00:04:12.959> computers<00:04:13.530> so

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
also more and more powerful computers so

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.920 
also more and more powerful computers so
they've<00:04:14.190> got<00:04:14.340> a<00:04:14.699> GS<00:04:15.299> crossed

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
they've got a GS crossed

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.990 
they've got a GS crossed
so<00:04:16.349> they'd<00:04:16.500> reduce<00:04:16.889> the<00:04:17.070> number<00:04:17.280> of<00:04:17.370> cases<00:04:17.579> far

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
so they'd reduce the number of cases far

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.849 
so they'd reduce the number of cases far
enough<00:04:18.209> they<00:04:18.359> had<00:04:18.510> a<00:04:18.539> fast<00:04:19.139> enough<00:04:19.440> computer

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
enough they had a fast enough computer

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.110 
enough they had a fast enough computer
