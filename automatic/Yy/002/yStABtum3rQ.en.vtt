00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
softener these pipes here before I piped

softener these pipes here before I piped
it<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.890> this<00:00:43.890> used<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.219> be<00:00:44.340> just<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.700> u-shape

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
it in this used to be just a u-shape

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.250 
it in this used to be just a u-shape
this<00:00:45.960> was<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.340> you<00:00:47.420> so<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.750> main<00:00:49.020> water

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
this was a you so this is the main water

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.760 
this was a you so this is the main water
into<00:00:49.980> my<00:00:50.129> house<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.670> they<00:00:50.730> conveniently

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
into my house and they conveniently

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.930 
into my house and they conveniently
plumbed<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.920> out<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.250> wall<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.730> can

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
plumbed it out of the wall so you can

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.060 
plumbed it out of the wall so you can
hook<00:00:54.090> into<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.480> for<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:54.870> water<00:00:55.110> softener<00:00:55.649> and

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
hook into it for this water softener and

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.490 
hook into it for this water softener and
so<00:00:56.579> what<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.329> did<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.750> shut<00:00:57.960> off<00:00:58.079> my<00:00:58.289> main

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
so what I did is I shut off my main

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.279 
so what I did is I shut off my main
valve<00:00:59.180> out<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> front<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.690> my<00:01:00.809> house<00:01:00.989> I

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
valve out in the front of my house I

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.520 
valve out in the front of my house I
shut<00:01:01.829> off<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> main<00:01:02.219> valve<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.789> then<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:04.019> went

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
shut off the main valve and then I went

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.640 
shut off the main valve and then I went
ahead<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.769> cut<00:01:05.100> right<00:01:05.159> here<00:01:06.320> with<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> hacksaw

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
ahead and cut right here with a hacksaw

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.190 
ahead and cut right here with a hacksaw
and<00:01:08.070> then<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.610> had<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.119> opened<00:01:09.659> up<00:01:09.720> my<00:01:09.780> valve<00:01:10.080> a

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
and then I had to I opened up my valve a

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.170 
and then I had to I opened up my valve a
little<00:01:10.439> bit<00:01:10.560> because<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.890> needed<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.310> see<00:01:11.549> if

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
little bit because I needed to see if

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.570 
little bit because I needed to see if
where<00:01:12.780> my<00:01:12.930> water<00:01:13.170> was<00:01:13.380> coming<00:01:13.680> from<00:01:13.830> if<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.460> was

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
where my water was coming from if it was

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.190 
where my water was coming from if it was
coming<00:01:14.729> from<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.090> side<00:01:15.299> or<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.540> side<00:01:15.689> and

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
coming from this side or this side and

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.140 
coming from this side or this side and
conveniently<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.950> was<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.220> side<00:01:17.460> which

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
conveniently it was this side which

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.820 
conveniently it was this side which
works<00:01:18.570> well<00:01:18.810> because<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.320> goes<00:01:19.439> right<00:01:19.650> into

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
works well because it goes right into

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.880 
works well because it goes right into
the<00:01:20.070> end<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.580> water<00:01:20.880> softener<00:01:21.299> here<00:01:21.890> so

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
the end of the water softener here so

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.140 
the end of the water softener here so
once<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.520> cut<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.210> pipe<00:01:25.009> I<00:01:26.060> spent<00:01:27.060> about

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
once I I cut this pipe I spent about

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.200 
once I I cut this pipe I spent about
thirty<00:01:27.720> dollars<00:01:27.990> at<00:01:28.409> Lowe's<00:01:28.970> for<00:01:29.970> all<00:01:30.090> the

copper fittings and for the copper pipe

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.179 
copper fittings and for the copper pipe
I<00:01:32.450> bought<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:33.659> coupler<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.320> about<00:01:34.860> five

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
think a five-foot piece of copper pipe

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.080 
think a five-foot piece of copper pipe
and<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.479> did<00:01:42.720> everything<00:01:43.490> and<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.579> just<00:01:44.759> sweat

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
and that did everything and I just sweat

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.770 
and that did everything and I just sweat
this<00:01:45.979> sweat<00:01:46.979> all<00:01:47.130> these<00:01:47.310> fittings<00:01:48.030> right<00:01:49.100> here

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
this sweat all these fittings right here

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.780 
this sweat all these fittings right here
but<00:01:51.780> then<00:01:51.899> when<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.110> came<00:01:52.229> in<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.009> water

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
but then when I came in to the water

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.539 
but then when I came in to the water
softener<00:01:54.210> itself<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.869> was<00:01:55.560> current<00:01:55.890> concerned

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
softener itself I was current concerned

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.450 
softener itself I was current concerned
about<00:01:56.790> sweating<00:01:57.270> near<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.430> the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
about sweating near this the in and the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.580 
about sweating near this the in and the
out<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.909> water<00:02:00.090> softener<00:02:00.540> because<00:02:01.259> this

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
out of the water softener because this

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.139 
out of the water softener because this
gets<00:02:01.860> extremely<00:02:02.189> hot<00:02:02.399> when<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.820> heat<00:02:02.969> up<00:02:03.000> the

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
gets extremely hot when you heat up the

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.940 
gets extremely hot when you heat up the
copper<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.719> didn't<00:02:03.930> want<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.290> do<00:02:04.590> mess

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
copper and I didn't want that to do mess

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.089 
copper and I didn't want that to do mess
up<00:02:05.130> this<00:02:05.280> water<00:02:05.549> softener<00:02:06.000> Inlet<00:02:06.329> at<00:02:06.479> all<00:02:07.099> and

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.589 
up this water softener Inlet at all and
so<00:02:08.280> when<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.429> was<00:02:08.550> at<00:02:08.729> Lowe's<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.119> actually<00:02:09.270> saw

so when I was at Lowe's I actually saw

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.029 
so when I was at Lowe's I actually saw

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
these fittings that are called Gator

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.260 
these fittings that are called Gator
bite

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
bite

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.990 
bite
on<00:02:12.360> g<00:02:12.930> ato<00:02:13.350> r<00:02:14.130> bi<00:02:15.120> te<00:02:15.950> gator<00:02:16.950> bite<00:02:17.250> fittings<00:02:17.730> and

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
on g ato r bi te gator bite fittings and

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.820 
on g ato r bi te gator bite fittings and
they're<00:02:18.690> actually<00:02:19.020> designed<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.560> take

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
they're actually designed to take

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:20.540 
they're actually designed to take
anything

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
anything

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.390 
anything
not<00:02:21.360> only<00:02:21.540> copper<00:02:22.080> but<00:02:22.380> they<00:02:22.530> can<00:02:22.650> take<00:02:22.830> PVC

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
not only copper but they can take PVC

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.950 
not only copper but they can take PVC
and<00:02:23.670> see<00:02:24.000> PVC<00:02:24.810> as<00:02:24.930> well<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.440> so<00:02:26.100> you<00:02:26.160> just<00:02:26.960> what

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
and see PVC as well and so you just what

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.220 
and see PVC as well and so you just what
i<00:02:27.990> did<00:02:28.290> was<00:02:28.500> i<00:02:28.680> put<00:02:29.300> some<00:02:30.300> teflon<00:02:30.690> tape<00:02:30.930> here

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
i did was i put some teflon tape here

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.010 
i did was i put some teflon tape here
because<00:02:32.190> it's<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.460> water<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:33.330> water<00:02:33.510> fittings

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
because it's a water to water fittings

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.880 
because it's a water to water fittings
so<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.500> went<00:02:35.160> ahead<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.400> screwed<00:02:35.760> in<00:02:35.880> this<00:02:36.890> this

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
so I went ahead and screwed in this this

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.390 
so I went ahead and screwed in this this
male<00:02:38.730> adapter<00:02:39.630> into<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.740> water<00:02:40.950> softener

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
male adapter into the water softener

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.940 
male adapter into the water softener
first<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.690> plumbed<00:02:43.080> everything<00:02:43.620> up<00:02:43.770> to

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
first and I plumbed everything up to

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.160 
first and I plumbed everything up to
here<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.250> my<00:02:44.610> stems<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.630> I<00:02:45.690> just<00:02:45.900> took<00:02:46.050> the

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
here to my stems and I just took the

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.900 
here to my stems and I just took the
water<00:02:46.380> software<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.070> I<00:02:47.130> literally<00:02:47.550> just

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
water software and I literally just

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.600 
water software and I literally just
pushed<00:02:48.390> it<00:02:48.600> right<00:02:49.080> onto<00:02:49.260> these<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.740> they<00:02:50.340> lock

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
pushed it right onto these and they lock

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.500 
pushed it right onto these and they lock
in<00:02:50.820> place<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:52.080> was<00:02:52.230> super<00:02:52.680> simple<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:54.180> it

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
in place and it was super simple and it

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.480 
in place and it was super simple and it
was<00:02:54.660> worth<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.110> money<00:02:55.440> each<00:02:55.950> one<00:02:56.250> of<00:02:56.370> these

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
was worth the money each one of these

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.210 
was worth the money each one of these
cost<00:02:56.820> about<00:02:56.970> five<00:02:57.360> dollars<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.870> piece<00:02:58.190> so<00:02:59.190> I

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
cost about five dollars a piece so I

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.130 
cost about five dollars a piece so I
only<00:02:59.460> spent<00:02:59.850> about<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.180> dollar<00:03:00.480> piece<00:03:00.870> for

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
only spent about a dollar piece for

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.590 
only spent about a dollar piece for
these<00:03:01.320> different<00:03:02.250> copper<00:03:02.610> fittings<00:03:03.000> when<00:03:03.540> I

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
these different copper fittings when I

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.720 
these different copper fittings when I
got<00:03:03.780> here<00:03:04.110> I<00:03:04.320> spent<00:03:04.800> about<00:03:04.860> five<00:03:05.220> dollars<00:03:05.370> a

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
got here I spent about five dollars a

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.450 
got here I spent about five dollars a
piece<00:03:06.330> just<00:03:06.360> for<00:03:06.720> these<00:03:06.930> two<00:03:07.400> these<00:03:08.400> two

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
piece just for these two these two

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.980 
piece just for these two these two
fittings<00:03:09.000> but<00:03:09.180> I<00:03:09.240> think<00:03:09.480> it<00:03:09.540> was<00:03:09.630> definitely

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
fittings but I think it was definitely

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.550 
fittings but I think it was definitely
worth<00:03:10.170> it

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
worth it

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.620 
worth it
and<00:03:11.190> then<00:03:11.340> half<00:03:11.460> the<00:03:11.490> sweat<00:03:11.880> took<00:03:12.210> literally

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
and then half the sweat took literally

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.720 
and then half the sweat took literally
two<00:03:12.870> seconds<00:03:13.320> just<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.620> push<00:03:13.860> it<00:03:14.040> in<00:03:14.190> nice<00:03:14.700> and

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
two seconds just to push it in nice and

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.300 
two seconds just to push it in nice and
tight<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.330> locked<00:03:15.630> into<00:03:15.810> place<00:03:16.070> then<00:03:17.070> I<00:03:17.160> went

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
tight and locked into place then I went

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.370 
tight and locked into place then I went
in<00:03:17.400> tonight<00:03:17.580> went<00:03:18.540> back<00:03:18.720> out<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:18.960> the<00:03:19.200> main

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
in tonight went back out to the main

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.800 
in tonight went back out to the main
valve<00:03:19.680> I<00:03:19.920> open<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:20.460> just<00:03:20.490> slightly<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.780> make

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
valve I open it just slightly to make

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.020 
valve I open it just slightly to make
sure<00:03:22.200> that<00:03:22.920> there<00:03:23.130> weren't<00:03:23.280> any<00:03:23.460> leaks<00:03:23.790> in<00:03:24.000> the

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.280 
sure that there weren't any leaks in the
sweat<00:03:25.130> and<00:03:26.130> then<00:03:27.030> upon<00:03:27.660> seeing<00:03:27.960> that<00:03:28.110> there

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
sweat and then upon seeing that there

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.650 
sweat and then upon seeing that there
wasn't<00:03:28.620> any<00:03:28.740> there<00:03:29.700> weren't<00:03:29.910> any<00:03:30.060> leaks<00:03:30.360> I
