00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.090 
number 27 I believe but right now I just
kind<00:01:38.810> of<00:01:38.840> want<00:01:39.020> to<00:01:39.110> use<00:01:39.230> this<00:01:39.410> up<00:01:39.590> this

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
kind of want to use this up this

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.790 
kind of want to use this up this
contains<00:01:40.550> I<00:01:40.820> think<00:01:41.000> 50<00:01:41.470> milliliters<00:01:42.470> I

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
contains I think 50 milliliters I

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.760 
contains I think 50 milliliters I
believe<00:01:43.460> um<00:01:43.880> I<00:01:44.330> can't<00:01:44.660> really<00:01:44.720> see<00:01:45.200> it<00:01:45.350> yeah<00:01:45.740> I

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
believe um I can't really see it yeah I

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.500 
believe um I can't really see it yeah I
know<00:01:45.830> it<00:01:46.070> does<00:01:46.190> contain<00:01:46.490> 50<00:01:46.850> milliliters<00:01:47.360> and

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
know it does contain 50 milliliters and

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.210 
know it does contain 50 milliliters and
I<00:01:48.110> thought<00:01:48.320> it<00:01:48.410> would<00:01:48.500> last<00:01:48.650> me<00:01:48.890> a<00:01:48.920> really<00:01:49.100> long

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
I thought it would last me a really long

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.370 
I thought it would last me a really long
time<00:01:49.370> but<00:01:49.760> I've<00:01:49.880> already<00:01:50.060> used<00:01:50.390> up<00:01:50.720> half<00:01:50.990> of<00:01:51.200> it

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
time but I've already used up half of it

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.980 
time but I've already used up half of it
so<00:01:51.680> I<00:01:51.980> guess<00:01:52.790> maybe<00:01:52.970> it's<00:01:53.210> because<00:01:53.360> I<00:01:53.720> use

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
so I guess maybe it's because I use

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.350 
so I guess maybe it's because I use
maybe<00:01:54.410> too<00:01:54.620> much<00:01:54.770> of<00:01:54.980> it<00:01:55.040> I<00:01:55.250> use<00:01:55.700> a<00:01:55.730> full<00:01:56.030> pump

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
maybe too much of it I use a full pump

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.810 
maybe too much of it I use a full pump
to<00:01:57.050> cover<00:01:57.260> my<00:01:57.470> entire<00:01:57.560> face<00:01:58.070> and<00:01:58.340> I<00:01:58.610> probably

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
to cover my entire face and I probably

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.630 
to cover my entire face and I probably
don't<00:01:59.030> need<00:01:59.150> that<00:01:59.360> much<00:01:59.570> but<00:01:59.960> um<00:02:00.710> that's<00:02:01.370> just

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
don't need that much but um that's just

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.060 
don't need that much but um that's just
how<00:02:01.940> much<00:02:02.120> i<00:02:02.300> use<00:02:02.510> but<00:02:03.080> anyway<00:02:03.350> i<00:02:03.380> mix<00:02:03.710> this<00:02:03.860> in

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
how much i use but anyway i mix this in

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.040

because of my skin tone and it will have

very<00:03:15.770> pale<00:03:16.160> complexion<00:03:16.580> I<00:03:17.030> don't<00:03:17.300> really<00:03:17.450> have

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
very pale complexion I don't really have

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.450 
very pale complexion I don't really have
to<00:03:17.750> be<00:03:17.840> careful<00:03:17.870> with<00:03:18.320> this<00:03:18.500> I<00:03:18.710> can<00:03:19.190> just<00:03:19.280> put

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
to be careful with this I can just put

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.950 
to be careful with this I can just put
it<00:03:19.550> basically<00:03:19.850> wherever<00:03:20.240> as<00:03:20.630> long<00:03:20.780> as<00:03:20.900> I

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:20.960 
it basically wherever as long as I

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.500 
it basically wherever as long as I
blended<00:03:21.290> in<00:03:21.470> and<00:03:21.710> it<00:03:22.250> looks<00:03:22.460> great<00:03:22.580> but<00:03:23.240> if<00:03:23.480> you

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
blended in and it looks great but if you

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.660 
blended in and it looks great but if you
do<00:03:23.840> have<00:03:24.050> fair<00:03:24.350> skin<00:03:24.380> you<00:03:25.040> have<00:03:25.070> to<00:03:25.430> be<00:03:25.520> careful

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
do have fair skin you have to be careful

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.760 
do have fair skin you have to be careful
because<00:03:26.030> this<00:03:26.570> could<00:03:26.930> make<00:03:27.230> you<00:03:27.350> look<00:03:27.500> orange

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
because this could make you look orange

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.220 
because this could make you look orange
and<00:03:28.100> it<00:03:28.280> can<00:03:28.460> also<00:03:28.610> look<00:03:28.970> quite<00:03:29.330> unnatural<00:03:29.750> on

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
and it can also look quite unnatural on

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.100 
and it can also look quite unnatural on
your<00:03:30.290> skin<00:03:30.800> but<00:03:31.070> fortunately<00:03:31.700> I<00:03:32.120> already<00:03:32.840> have

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
your skin but fortunately I already have

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.500 
your skin but fortunately I already have
a<00:03:33.140> very<00:03:33.410> tan<00:03:34.100> complexion<00:03:34.520> so<00:03:35.180> I<00:03:35.210> don't<00:03:35.450> really

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
a very tan complexion so I don't really

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.870 
a very tan complexion so I don't really
have<00:03:35.750> to<00:03:35.870> worry<00:03:35.930> about<00:03:36.230> that<00:03:36.350> too<00:03:36.710> much<00:03:36.740> but<00:03:37.730> I

instead of just picking and choosing

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.230
