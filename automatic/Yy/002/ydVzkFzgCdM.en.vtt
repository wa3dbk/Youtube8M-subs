00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.330 
Rianne saying you're sorry apologizing
and<00:00:26.600> admitting<00:00:27.289> that<00:00:27.680> you're<00:00:27.800> wrong<00:00:27.949> is<00:00:28.279> a

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
and admitting that you're wrong is a

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.939 
and admitting that you're wrong is a
lifelong<00:00:29.000> lesson<00:00:29.480> and<00:00:29.660> we<00:00:30.080> all<00:00:30.260> we<00:00:30.769> all<00:00:30.800> have

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
lifelong lesson and we all we all have

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.379 
lifelong lesson and we all we all have
to<00:00:31.250> learn<00:00:31.400> it<00:00:31.609> and<00:00:32.649> what<00:00:33.649> I<00:00:33.679> would<00:00:33.889> say<00:00:34.100> is

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:34.389 
to learn it and what I would say is

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:38.110 
to learn it and what I would say is
practice<00:00:35.389> actually<00:00:35.839> helps<00:00:36.760> you<00:00:37.760> know<00:00:37.879> because

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
practice actually helps you know because

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.539 
practice actually helps you know because
the<00:00:38.269> goal<00:00:38.479> is<00:00:38.809> not<00:00:39.079> to<00:00:39.350> be<00:00:39.710> perfect<00:00:40.129> or<00:00:40.339> to<00:00:40.429> be

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:40.549 
the goal is not to be perfect or to be

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:43.000 
the goal is not to be perfect or to be
right<00:00:40.760> because<00:00:41.359> we're<00:00:41.989> never<00:00:42.260> either<00:00:42.649> one<00:00:42.920> of

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
right because we're never either one of

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.110 
right because we're never either one of
those<00:00:43.159> things<00:00:43.370> all<00:00:43.579> the<00:00:43.699> time

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
those things all the time

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.319 
those things all the time
but<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:44.629> goal<00:00:44.839> is<00:00:45.019> to<00:00:45.049> try<00:00:45.379> to<00:00:45.409> to<00:00:46.280> shorten<00:00:47.239> the

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
but the goal is to try to to shorten the

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:48.819 
but the goal is to try to to shorten the
amount<00:00:47.359> of<00:00:47.600> time<00:00:47.690> between<00:00:48.170> when<00:00:48.499> we<00:00:48.649> make

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
amount of time between when we make

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.259 
amount of time between when we make
mistakes<00:00:48.859> or<00:00:49.459> when<00:00:49.579> we<00:00:49.699> say<00:00:49.850> something<00:00:50.179> we

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
mistakes or when we say something we

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:51.699 
mistakes or when we say something we
don't<00:00:50.389> mean<00:00:50.569> or<00:00:50.749> when<00:00:50.870> we<00:00:50.959> hurt<00:00:51.170> someone<00:00:51.559> and

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:51.709 
don't mean or when we hurt someone and

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:54.629 
don't mean or when we hurt someone and
when<00:00:52.429> we<00:00:52.549> apologize<00:00:53.119> for<00:00:53.359> that<00:00:53.449> and

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:54.639 
when we apologize for that and

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:57.489 
when we apologize for that and
practicing<00:00:55.639> that<00:00:56.030> can<00:00:56.600> help<00:00:56.719> you<00:00:56.989> get<00:00:57.199> better

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:57.499

apology<00:01:06.530> is<00:01:06.649> not<00:01:06.799> defeat<00:01:07.299> it's<00:01:08.299> not<00:01:08.600> admitting

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
apology is not defeat it's not admitting

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.560

that<00:01:09.770> someone<00:01:10.100> else<00:01:10.219> is<00:01:10.399> right<00:01:10.640> it's<00:01:11.390> just

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
that someone else is right it's just

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.959 
that someone else is right it's just
it's<00:01:12.560> just<00:01:12.890> actually<00:01:13.399> quite<00:01:13.759> powerful

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:13.969 
it's just actually quite powerful

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:16.260 
it's just actually quite powerful
because<00:01:14.960> it's<00:01:15.409> showing<00:01:15.770> that<00:01:15.920> you're

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
because it's showing that you're

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.719 
because it's showing that you're
vulnerable<00:01:17.270> and<00:01:17.990> that<00:01:18.020> you're<00:01:18.679> you<00:01:19.130> know<00:01:19.250> that

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
vulnerable and that you're you know that

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.230 
vulnerable and that you're you know that
you're<00:01:19.909> a<00:01:19.939> subtle<00:01:20.929> person<00:01:21.170> who<00:01:22.060> can<00:01:23.060> admit

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
you're a subtle person who can admit

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.840 
you're a subtle person who can admit
when<00:01:23.829> when<00:01:24.829> they've<00:01:25.039> made<00:01:25.219> a<00:01:25.250> mistake<00:01:25.609> and

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
when when they've made a mistake and

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.889 
when when they've made a mistake and
therefore<00:01:26.689> it<00:01:26.780> can<00:01:26.899> also<00:01:27.140> be<00:01:27.649> trusted<00:01:28.899> when

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
therefore it can also be trusted when

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.080 
therefore it can also be trusted when
they<00:01:30.079> say<00:01:30.320> I'm<00:01:30.560> not<00:01:30.590> sorry<00:01:31.100> about<00:01:31.429> that<00:01:31.789> or<00:01:32.060> I

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
they say I'm not sorry about that or I

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.300 
they say I'm not sorry about that or I
don't<00:01:32.390> want<00:01:32.570> to<00:01:32.630> apologize<00:01:33.079> for<00:01:33.289> that<00:01:33.409> does

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
don't want to apologize for that does

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.399 
don't want to apologize for that does
that<00:01:34.429> make<00:01:34.549> sense<00:01:34.600> you<00:01:35.600> can<00:01:35.749> also<00:01:35.869> say<00:01:36.170> to<00:01:36.229> your

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
that make sense you can also say to your

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.730 
that make sense you can also say to your
mom<00:01:37.299> later<00:01:38.299> maybe<00:01:38.780> after<00:01:39.289> the<00:01:39.560> conversation

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
mom later maybe after the conversation

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.649 
mom later maybe after the conversation
isn't<00:01:40.280> so<00:01:40.429> emotional<00:01:40.969> you<00:01:41.119> could<00:01:41.359> just<00:01:41.479> go<00:01:41.600> up

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
isn't so emotional you could just go up

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.599 
isn't so emotional you could just go up
to<00:01:41.840> her<00:01:41.960> and<00:01:42.079> say<00:01:42.289> I'm<00:01:42.770> sorry<00:01:43.069> I<00:01:43.189> said<00:01:43.369> that

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:45.819 
to her and say I'm sorry I said that
sometimes<00:01:44.299> it's<00:01:44.509> hard<00:01:44.719> for<00:01:44.899> me<00:01:45.049> to<00:01:45.530> say<00:01:45.740> I'm

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
sometimes it's hard for me to say I'm
