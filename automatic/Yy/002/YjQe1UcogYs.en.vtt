00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.080
 How am I going to teach you how to do some 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.449
 collected voucher 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.880
 hair as this example 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:21.480
 worked before with loops to make a 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.250
 semirecogido with a bit of youtube and 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.410
 prepare parties for any questions 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.410
 that you have or something and that you stay pretty 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.690
 so what I do first of all 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.610
 all 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:37.660
 I'm going to catch 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.660
 a partition 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.270
 it makes me more or less 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.300
 I was told a lot by natural eyes of 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.030
 little more about those here 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.420
 and now what am I going to do as a kind 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.420
 of toupee 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.330
 so much you can do 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.750
 is one of those who more happiness to the 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.100
 people 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.100
 and stay super movement 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.070
 so 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.200
 I took quite a partition kisses 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.520
 from that partition I'm going to be left alone 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.520
 with those in front 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.160
 that is a child 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.690
 but left behind 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.090
 send a little 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.010
 all put brushes you use a 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.580
 big polish 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.580
 I'm going to pass it 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.620
 what are we going to do 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.539
 I'm going to brush a tad 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.539
 and then we're going to finish 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.960
 that was a little bit the camera so that 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:19.370
 see how they charge well to give 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:21.790
 tele not to get tangled I 'm going to do it 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.290
 small tufts with convention 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.290
 then the brushes first of all 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.300
 and they are made from here to below here 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.670
 down and from here to down 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.360
 so it does not happen again and we take 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.360
 other facts 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.910
 and here for down since down and 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.900
 although down 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.900
 traffic 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.540
 from here to below from here to below and 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.940
 down 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.819
 and the last month I have left 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.329
 same 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.329
 down 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.250
 that's the only way you're going to 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:12.450
 get the dog session trailer 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.450
 then we have this but nothing 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.770
 what we are going to do with the part 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.110
 front we change paragraph we're going to 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.920
 take back and we're going to put it together 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.920
 everything with this 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.110
 and let's brush our teeth 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:45.170
 for what kind of expert or anything like this 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.170
 that's it would say a lot now for a life 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.989
 the phase 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.200
 a little touch 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.440
 how good we are going 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.200
 and I'm going to apply 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:17.019
 to 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:19.799
 two pods two clicks 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.799
 meters 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.829
 to demonstrate 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.940
 to hold it well 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:54.710
 the cocoa to stay is ready I'm going to 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:57.680
 pull the doll so you can see how 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.979
 is the back is usually done 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.919
 here 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:06.310
 or if you have an ornament so that 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:09.480
 the hairpins can be seen 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.480
 there are several possibilities 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.220
 to see if I find there are people who 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.880
 applies those guidelines for on the 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:20.050
 they have bright and cough 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.050
 and remove the other 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:26.760
 It has to be like more 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:30.260
 not like above but it would remove the other 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.260
 I would directly apply this 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.950
 with options is 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.180
 what does 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.180
 agapito 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.820
 to the 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.820
 area 1 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.430
 but not 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:16.400
 you had an option 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:19.710
 stays in the footwear 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:23.130
 the collected and the waves 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:25.660
 and then this takes a lot is very 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:29.020
 nice is elegant 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.910
 modern be it for weddings for parties or 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:34.690
 for everything you want 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:42.420
 I hope you liked it and now I will be 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:42.420
 more tutorials with more hairstyles I hope
