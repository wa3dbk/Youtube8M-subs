00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
to make all business decisions but you

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.939 
to make all business decisions but you
will<00:00:54.719> also<00:00:55.020> have<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.379> drive<00:00:55.800> around<00:00:57.649> to<00:00:58.649> solve

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
will also have to drive around to solve

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.130 
will also have to drive around to solve
several<00:00:59.460> tasks<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.180> missions<00:01:00.359> which<00:01:01.020> are

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
several tasks and missions which are

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.609 
several tasks and missions which are
quite<00:01:01.320> interesting<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:05.570> hear<00:01:06.570> it's<00:01:06.840> our<00:01:07.229> job

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
quite interesting to hear it's our job

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.090 
quite interesting to hear it's our job
to<00:01:07.890> free<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.580> truck<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.990> got<00:01:10.229> stuck<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:10.979> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
to free a truck that got stuck in the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.719 
to free a truck that got stuck in the
snow<00:01:11.479> so<00:01:12.479> we<00:01:12.630> start<00:01:12.930> our<00:01:13.110> small<00:01:13.770> snowcat<00:01:14.490> we

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
snow so we start our small snowcat we

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.130 
snow so we start our small snowcat we
will<00:01:14.850> get<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.150> bigger<00:01:15.689> one

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
will get a bigger one

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.100 
will get a bigger one
several<00:01:16.560> bigger<00:01:16.830> ones<00:01:17.420> when<00:01:18.420> we<00:01:18.600> earn<00:01:18.750> more

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
several bigger ones when we earn more

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.039 
several bigger ones when we earn more
money<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:20.310> higher<00:01:20.490> rank<00:01:20.850> but<00:01:21.600> for<00:01:21.840> now<00:01:21.990> we

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
money and a higher rank but for now we

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.030 
money and a higher rank but for now we
have<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.350> drive<00:01:22.650> around<00:01:23.009> with<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.340> small<00:01:24.000> one

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
have to drive around with the small one

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.670 
have to drive around with the small one
as<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.250> can<00:01:26.460> see<00:01:26.670> it's<00:01:26.850> pretty<00:01:27.680> interesting

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
as you can see it's pretty interesting

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.410 
as you can see it's pretty interesting
and<00:01:29.040> nice<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:31.290> physics<00:01:31.890> are<00:01:32.189> simulated<00:01:33.060> good

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
and nice the physics are simulated good

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.490 
and nice the physics are simulated good
you<00:01:33.990> can<00:01:35.210> basically<00:01:36.210> do<00:01:36.600> anything<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:37.290> real

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
you can basically do anything a real

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.740 
you can basically do anything a real
snowcat<00:01:38.070> could<00:01:38.280> also<00:01:38.490> do<00:01:38.790> but<00:01:39.329> here<00:01:39.540> it's<00:01:39.659> the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
snowcat could also do but here it's the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.190 
snowcat could also do but here it's the
job<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.350> feed<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.710> truck<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.750> there<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.899> here

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
job to feed a truck and there is here

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.710 
job to feed a truck and there is here
yellow<00:01:43.860> dot<00:01:44.130> he's<00:01:44.939> leading<00:01:45.240> us<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.630> the

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
yellow dot he's leading us to the

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.310 
yellow dot he's leading us to the
position<00:01:46.290> where<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> mission<00:01:47.009> gold<00:01:47.369> waits<00:01:48.320> so

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
position where a mission gold waits so

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.039 
position where a mission gold waits so
the<00:01:49.439> steering<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:50.040> not<00:01:50.250> easy<00:01:50.750> but<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:51.930> a

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
the steering is not easy but it's a

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.850 
the steering is not easy but it's a
believable<00:01:52.710> physics<00:01:53.130> simulation<00:01:53.729> and

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
believable physics simulation and

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.340 
believable physics simulation and
we<00:01:55.010> have<00:01:55.160> to<00:01:55.540> get<00:01:56.540> the<00:01:56.870> two<00:01:57.110> connected<00:01:58.870> so<00:01:59.870> as

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
we have to get the two connected so as

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.160 
we have to get the two connected so as
you<00:02:00.500> can<00:02:00.650> see<00:02:00.710> you<00:02:01.340> have<00:02:01.400> to<00:02:01.640> work<00:02:01.850> very

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
you can see you have to work very

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:09.249 
you can see you have to work very
precise<00:02:04.900> yes<00:02:05.900> we<00:02:06.230> are<00:02:06.290> turning<00:02:06.560> around<00:02:08.259> some

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
precise yes we are turning around some

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.940 
precise yes we are turning around some
feets<00:02:09.649> back<00:02:10.039> and<00:02:10.399> now<00:02:10.640> we<00:02:10.700> can<00:02:11.710> connect<00:02:12.710> the

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
feets back and now we can connect the

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.210 
feets back and now we can connect the
truck<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.700> our<00:02:13.820> snowcat

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
truck to our snowcat

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.920 
truck to our snowcat
yes<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:17.410> now<00:02:18.410> I<00:02:18.440> will<00:02:18.650> bring<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:20.300> precious

Goods back to the restaurant to this
waiting<00:02:23.720> for<00:02:23.930> them<00:02:25.390> so<00:02:26.390> not<00:02:26.690> only<00:02:26.959> the<00:02:27.080> physics

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
waiting for them so not only the physics

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.920 
waiting for them so not only the physics
also<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:27.800> graphics<00:02:28.190> are<00:02:28.310> pretty<00:02:28.640> good<00:02:28.930> we

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
also the graphics are pretty good we

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.720 
also the graphics are pretty good we
will<00:02:30.080> take<00:02:30.350> a<00:02:30.380> deeper<00:02:30.680> look<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:31.340> little<00:02:31.580> bit

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
will take a deeper look a little bit

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.350 
will take a deeper look a little bit
later<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.980> driving<00:02:34.459> around<00:02:34.790> is<00:02:35.120> not

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
later the driving around is not

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.729 
later the driving around is not
mandatory<00:02:35.720> you<00:02:36.290> can<00:02:37.250> give<00:02:37.550> all<00:02:37.820> tasks<00:02:38.450> to

something about that and this is done we

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.740 
something about that and this is done we

are the amount of ticket sold the price

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.030 
are the amount of ticket sold the price
for<00:03:27.230> tickets<00:03:27.950> food<00:03:28.459> accommodation<00:03:29.450> and<00:03:30.040> of

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
course it depends on our rank and

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.370 
course it depends on our rank and
satisfaction<00:03:35.630> factor<00:03:36.049> of<00:03:36.200> the<00:03:36.410> customers<00:03:37.010> so

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
satisfaction factor of the customers so

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.800 
satisfaction factor of the customers so
now<00:03:39.380> we<00:03:39.440> could<00:03:39.650> even<00:03:39.920> buy<00:03:40.299> bigger<00:03:41.299> snow<00:03:41.510> cats
