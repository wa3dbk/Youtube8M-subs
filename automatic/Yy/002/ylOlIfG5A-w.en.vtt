00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:11.130
 hello today I want to tell you about 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.549
 ganzo knife 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.619
 This is ganzo g 717 b rain to me very 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.260
 quite liked the overall quality 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.930
 processing as already accustomed to the company 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.699
 ganzo but if there are pigtails food they are very 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.580
 insignificant and very rare 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.150
 here a little out of center can be straight 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.580
 notice 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.329
 looking closer but overall quality 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.750
 processing and assembly, it certainly pleases 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.879
 means that here I can say later on 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.239
 specifically this knife is used here 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.170
 g10 with such an interesting picture 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.809
 the drawing itself 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.940
 provides good knife retention 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.629
 may be wet with some hands 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.090
 dirty and very interesting design minus 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.390
 In principle, he has only one in such 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.820
 design of the coupe arm with powerful enough 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.780
 a clip that was slightly bent and 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.510
 became weaker 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.729
 knife hard still clings to pocket 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.439
 and it is also hard to connect with one 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.710
 the sides of course the knife you won't lose 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.420
 but on the other hand there is some 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.430
 discomfort in this matter 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.700
 note for example the clip 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.360
 spider Quandour and somewhere the creeps but 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.520
 it space here see more then 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.830
 there is a clip though it is considered exactly 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.290
 fine but space to 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.079
 pin on your pocket a little more here 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.570
 accordingly a little easier 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.270
 well, plus is a texture in itself 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.880
 handle that here is such as would 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.890
 plus and minus at the same time you dog 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.930
 rearranged on two sides big 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.149
 part of the handle sticks out above the pocket but it 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.579
 customary for most knives but 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.979
 move from the blade 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.110
 excellent despite being close here 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.200
 located peg 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.479
 directly to the handle and trimming it 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.920
 but you need a certain habit so say 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.200
 I would not say that it is difficult and 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.380
 some special skill is necessary perhaps 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.630
 get used to pushing it a little differently 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.549
 but the knife fits comfortably in your hand 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.890
 really well fills the palm and 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:13.130
 not just so this knife is enough 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.380
 fat if we compare it with ganzo g704 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.239
 look how big the difference is 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.540
 between the hilt on the more so if we 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:23.180
 compare with spider-man fool I mean 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:27.380
 I think the difference is obvious that Ganja 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:30.470
 Ganza 1717 g he actually but 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.920
 Substantially thicker let's show you in 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.900
 macro 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:38.239
 here it is g700 17b 440 steel such here 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:43.569
 blade processing in my opinion is very 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:45.860
 I like it very well 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.750
 similar processing moreover very much 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.510
 like the rounded shoes about which 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.519
 you can put your finger on some 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.680
 power additional cutting 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.660
 or vice versa with some kind of delicate 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.260
 such a rounded shoe on yourself 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.239
 ndi of course for an amateur but me this 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.389
 like and enjoy such classic 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.870
 I think the forms will be to your taste 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:07.850
 Most people 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.150
 which of course is very correct from the point 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.160
 view company ganzo but the reduction as 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.500
 always probably with some kind of protection from 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.560
 fool because it will bring the knife fat 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.450
 here around 07 and mid 08 lick 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.459
 the tip is about a millimeter 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.680
 accordingly some huge games from 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:29.030
 Siberia zenith if you compare it here 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.880
 for example with gandhi 714 in terms of risotto 714 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.510
 bites much more aggressive that is 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.519
 Feels like cutting significantly 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.829
 encouragement on the one hand on the other 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.769
 the sides there that figurative form is not 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:45.680
 allows you to control so well 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:48.769
 the leash knife and does not give that feeling 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.140
 comfort all the same which provides 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.790
 more classic blade shape in 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.090
 principle can be if its a little bit 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.609
 more aggressively sharpen that situation 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.829
 you can correct 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:03.859
 besides the handle has a big 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:06.799
 the thickness inside the liners the rest too 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:09.310
 substantial enough serious without 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:13.659
 some kind of loosening inside without some 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:19.759
 losing weight that's what gives it 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:23.539
 considerable gives him considerable weight of them 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:27.349
 hurried to put then 0 will be 156 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:29.660
 gram turned out the weight of the knife itself but 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:30.860
 this steam is easy many up to 155 grams there 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.560
 will weigh that is weight pretty 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.990
 impressive clear that a knife with a similar 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.360
 the thickness of the handle with such information 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.880
 and weighing it is a knife more for such some 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.669
 serious strength work where they can 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.250
 and pick something up on the tip of u 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.889
 the night also does not decrease over its entire length 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:52.099
 the thickness of the y 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:54.020
 plenochka then only the tip goes away that 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:56.240
 speaks about directly such power 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.849
 directivity of this knife let's 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.060
 I will show it to you in comparison 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:04.880
 once sedan ganzo g704 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.820
 like this it is different in size like this 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.470
 spider queen fool about what you could 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.900
 see but this is a knife of some sort 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.970
 of this size which are quite quite to me 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.320
 I liked their qualities and for 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.659
 except for some of their own 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:21.530
 features that everyone can for 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:23.690
 you need to set yourself apart 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:28.039
 characteristics of a knife or not but by 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:31.639
 The knife itself is of course interesting now . 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:34.449
 ten processing is of course more 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:37.520
 so complicated in my opinion interesting 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:40.250
 by itself also happens in some kind 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.230
 sand this color of the handle itself 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.990
 can 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.550
 it is even very good to choose for 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.520
 themselves wishing 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.560
 what color wants even more colors 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.860
 in general it was excellent there was interesting 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.860
 until
