00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
data put up there and it's actually been

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.710 
data put up there and it's actually been
three<00:01:29.310> weeks<00:01:29.340> since<00:01:29.610> we've<00:01:30.000> played<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.479> and

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
three weeks since we've played this and

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.039 
three weeks since we've played this and
i<00:01:30.869> gotta<00:01:31.079> say<00:01:31.350> i<00:01:31.650> missed<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.570> doing<00:01:33.750> we<00:01:33.899> have

i gotta say i missed it so doing we have
some<00:01:34.200> really<00:01:34.500> good<00:01:34.770> galaxies<00:01:35.369> today<00:01:36.140> that<00:01:37.140> a

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
some really good galaxies today that a

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:44.790 
some really good galaxies today that a
little<00:01:40.939> hey

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.100 

that<00:01:45.580> don't<00:01:46.270> understand<00:01:46.660> why<00:01:46.780> some<00:01:46.960> of<00:01:46.990> the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
that don't understand why some of the

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.170 
that don't understand why some of the
lumens<00:01:47.410> eat<00:01:47.530> star<00:01:47.800> but<00:01:47.980> some<00:01:48.010> ecoins<00:01:48.610> I<00:01:49.000> mean

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
lumens eat star but some ecoins I mean

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.840 
lumens eat star but some ecoins I mean
different<00:01:50.140> digestive<00:01:50.920> tracts<00:01:51.280> I<00:01:51.490> guess<00:01:51.700> you

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
different digestive tracts I guess you

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.410 
different digestive tracts I guess you
could<00:01:51.880> say<00:01:52.770> boom<00:01:53.770> like<00:01:54.550> ones<00:01:54.850> lactose

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
could say boom like ones lactose

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.330 
could say boom like ones lactose
intolerant<00:01:55.780> one<00:01:56.200> can<00:01:56.380> eat<00:01:56.500> the<00:01:56.620> lactose<00:01:57.070> it's

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
intolerant one can eat the lactose it's

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.250 
intolerant one can eat the lactose it's
okay<00:01:57.700> whoa<00:01:58.330> that's<00:01:59.110> a<00:01:59.260> trippy<00:01:59.830> galaxy<00:02:01.260> all

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
okay whoa that's a trippy galaxy all

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:10.010 
okay whoa that's a trippy galaxy all
right<00:02:02.530> let's<00:02:02.800> go<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:04.890> beat<00:02:05.890> block<00:02:06.900> galaxy<00:02:07.900> Oh

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
that is coming from the wiimote now

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.180 
that is coming from the wiimote now
whenever<00:02:40.300> it<00:02:40.870> goes<00:02:42.810> boom<00:02:43.810> then<00:02:44.650> it<00:02:44.800> whatever
