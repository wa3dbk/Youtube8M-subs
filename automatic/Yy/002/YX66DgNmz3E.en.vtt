00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 and it him right then I come to 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.560
 thomas human gautier good good so if 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.210
 you are minimally connected with the 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.880
 outside world you may know that 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.650
 soon it's christmas I noticed that 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.540
 often in life the people of the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.250
 bad licadho this is in the bottom after 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.810
 this video you will know what does 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.939
 not buy in the world 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.490
 so make a note of what is clear 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.230
 it's gone if you have big 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.480
 parents you may know the habit 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.099
 to give a gift that I think very 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.359
 beautiful for example are persuaded that the 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.239
 clothes gives it's the clothes the 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.440
 shorter on the market whereas in 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:40.079
 the bottom is for me 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.790
 wow teilhet puy plus he wanted that 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.079
 I put it then so it was not 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.399
 really a thing that in life is 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.090
 beautiful I thought it gives me a 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.469
 little he particular hi good it's a 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.059
 tool of its kind it's a Christmas gift to 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.860
 his needs a pretty statue of a 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.329
 Hand carved wooden hippopotamus 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.719
 good so at first glance it's a gift 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.520
 lousy backpack and people 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.559
 who gives it to you is usually justified 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.290
 in gender stuff was carved 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.720
 hand by an Indian woman in five 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.130
 best blind without legs on his 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.049
 deathbed in europe 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.180
 everyone in europe is the fashion there 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.890
 down then thirdly receive 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.570
 books usually it's never fun 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.720
 I know that another is trying to 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.040
 say but thomas me I knew it's 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.930
 true books it can be fun 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.890
 sometimes but against me my father he 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.240
 absolutely want me to do some 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.159
 mathematics then had no 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.869
 feeling for the little message for me 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.460
 convince to marion if you read 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.600
 books and maths it gives 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.439
 usually something 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.750
 completely nil 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.750
 but you would not have a well packed dad 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.990
 haha then someone is lying big 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.180
 painters have succeeded and he gives a 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.740
 unknown old machine unknown 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.260
 in fact at first sight we all know 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.520
 to have a nice reaction but we feel 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:59.170
 actually fact that it absolutely 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.170
 nothing if it's not without a little more 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:09.009
 what is it but I know for myself then 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.120
 when a brother a little caused a 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.620
 nobody told me you're not waiting 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.230
 usually at a great deal of rapport 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.920
 it's normal to give a gift on behalf of a child 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.270
 of 10 years to buy you a lamborghini 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.830
 does not stop meaning so usually 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.080
 these funds are DIY victims or the 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.540
 little drawings that are generally good 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.340
 really for beautiful name but it's beautiful 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.000
 it's the child saying he's doing this 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.380
 okay but at the same time it's ugly 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.090
 still when they are 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.130
 usually verdict men were coming out 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:42.890
 always a gift to Patrick's interests 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:46.910
 the state mouths ok ok waro a kart of you 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.380
 thank you son and I have a candidate on 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.700
 do not suck the hypocrite as a way of 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.380
 react because the child could not 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.340
 not really react otherwise a gift 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:58.160
 of a child that would be it would be the dog 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.780
 ah ah no no no it's ugly it's 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.800
 disgusting vote and sent back this 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.070
 family of banished for life 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.260
 he was sentenced to death by winning 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.450
 what is it too much why the 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.400
 nobody tht that but good with a little 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.900
 of imagination we always end up 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.310
 find something fun to do 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.330
 with that to the walo will hold thank you I know 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.660
 not so much what can I 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.660
 do with 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.299
 jump in seventh position and eric addo 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.069
 which are just not appropriate to the 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.049
 situation in the context of mourning 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.510
 it's not necessarily the best 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:37.109
 it's my son a guitar but dad 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:40.219
 I have no right hand and Christmas what's that 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:42.450
 you never happened to me either 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:45.000
 good in eighth position is the kind 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.230
 of gift that's at the second you see 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.799
 that the person did not care 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.969
 completely 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.560
 usually when you get the 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:50.579
 food that has been out of date for 3 years 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.139
 and that the person does not have 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.040
 necessarily thought a lot about this 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.680
 they must have given everything 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.200

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.480

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.959
 songs of the birds in the parties 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.919

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.919
