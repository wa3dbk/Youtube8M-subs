I've<00:00:58.050> been<00:00:58.199> doing<00:00:58.410> some<00:00:58.530> research<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.219> was

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
I've been doing some research and it was

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.610 
I've been doing some research and it was
apparently<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.789> first<00:01:00.090> ever<00:01:00.620> dynamic

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
apparently the first ever dynamic

apparently the first ever dynamic
cardioid<00:01:02.160> microphone<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:04.010> probably<00:01:05.010> fairly

cardioid microphone so probably fairly

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.190 
cardioid microphone so probably fairly
significant<00:01:06.060> if<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.270> know<00:01:06.390> exactly<00:01:06.840> what

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
significant if you know exactly what

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.800 
significant if you know exactly what
that<00:01:07.350> means<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.950> don't<00:01:08.909> profess<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.390> know<00:01:09.600> that

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
that means I don't profess to know that

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.179

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
of it so which has enabled me to use it

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.060 
of it so which has enabled me to use it
today<00:01:28.790> because<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:30.570> don't<00:01:30.869> know<00:01:31.049> what<00:01:31.229> exact

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
today because I don't know what exact

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.319 
today because I don't know what exact
connect<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.549> these<00:01:32.670> originally<00:01:33.090> how<00:01:33.150> but<00:01:33.299> a

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
connect to these originally how but a

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.700 
connect to these originally how but a
lot<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.509> our<00:01:33.659> microphones<00:01:34.110> are<00:01:34.259> those<00:01:34.409> odd

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
lot of our microphones are those odd

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.929 
lot of our microphones are those odd
sort<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.430> double<00:01:35.759> plug<00:01:36.060> things<00:01:36.979> so<00:01:37.979> yeah<00:01:38.759> it

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
sort of double plug things so yeah it

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.940 
sort of double plug things so yeah it
works<00:01:39.150> very<00:01:39.360> well<00:01:39.479> there's<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.200> base<00:01:40.380> for<00:01:40.740> it

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
works very well there's the base for it

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.649 
works very well there's the base for it
I'll<00:01:41.610> bring<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:41.970> near<00:01:42.210> my<00:01:42.329> mouth<00:01:42.479> actually

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
I'll bring this near my mouth actually

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.039 
I'll bring this near my mouth actually
so<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:42.990> can<00:01:43.110> hear<00:01:43.290> me<00:01:43.380> properly<00:01:43.759> the<00:01:45.049> again

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
so you can hear me properly the again

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.230 
so you can hear me properly the again
bakelite<00:01:46.560> very<00:01:46.920> big<00:01:47.220> heavy<00:01:47.460> construction<00:01:47.820> got

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
bakelite very big heavy construction got

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.120 
bakelite very big heavy construction got
a<00:01:48.270> big<00:01:48.450> groove<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> side<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.799> so<00:01:49.829> the

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
a big groove in the side of it so the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.100 
a big groove in the side of it so the
microphone<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:51.030> wire<00:01:51.240> can<00:01:51.600> sort<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.840> go

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
microphone the wire can sort of go

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.340 
microphone the wire can sort of go
through<00:01:52.350> there<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.979> not<00:01:53.299> get<00:01:54.299> all<00:01:54.350> pinched

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
through there and not get all pinched

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.560 
through there and not get all pinched
and<00:01:55.560> stuff<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.040> very<00:01:56.670> nice<00:01:56.909> design<00:01:57.119> again

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
and stuff so very nice design again

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.410 
and stuff so very nice design again
perfect<00:01:58.110> condition<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:59.250> very<00:01:59.909> nice<00:02:00.090> piece

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
perfect condition so a very nice piece

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.330 
perfect condition so a very nice piece
all<00:02:00.689> things<00:02:00.960> considered
