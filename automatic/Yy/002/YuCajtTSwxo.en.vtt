00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.960
 but 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:30.169
 still here 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.100
 since childhood 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.100
 a responsibility 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.050
 It is known that the moment to balance 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.440
 young man 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.550
 the idea was born enough 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.880
 in reality 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.880
 but after talking 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.110
 I beg 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.430
 March 10 in the glass is very long 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.430
 what spouse was granted 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.020
 attackers get good 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.170
 free access not 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.549
 feel very comfortable 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.540
 possible reason 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.500
 now women in society well what can 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.690
 say about the exhibition 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.070
 time she is so transient 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.290
 space for some time remains with 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.880
 us 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.170
 but often we do not notice and looks in 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.460
 the floor we look at the land we look at the asphalt 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.110
 she often needs only victory depends 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.020
 what a beauty around us 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.140
 some people even have their own 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.970
 representation about space 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:39.600
 which 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.680
 around us 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.640
 every look at this space 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.450
 he is unique 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.230
 currently we are present 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.460
 unique event reflected in 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.640
 unique views of a unique person 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.399
 Radchenko October 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.399
 3 5 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.330
 but I repeat we have a lot I can not 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.560
 to tell that 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.549
 I am far from concrete pay 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:07.500
 I do not like 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.799
 million tons 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:10.619
 I look 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.519
 it will be a place to dump of course 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.889
 he is generally interested in my principle 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:17.859
 people who have achieved some particular 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:19.609
 fame 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:21.189
 total according to plan 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.209
 repeated trends yes that's what i'm very 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.979
 I like to analyze certain things 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:26.859
 there is no interest 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:28.970
 look at some particular person 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.699
 Not only 

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:33.699
 in terms of it, even a photo of creativity Athos it 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:36.579
 the ways that that man went through me 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:37.809
 what good pictures are they 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:39.739
 cause here is one such Mutsoeva 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.889
 itâ€™s a pity too 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:43.639
 photographed not 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:45.699
 his opinion generates the opposite 

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:47.419
 creative impulse potential if 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:48.980
 I want to be a singer 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.959
 great-grandfather through the centuries some idea 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.250
 there is that time which is forgiven 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.250
 pondering this stuff on 

00:02:58.179 --> 00:02:59.849
 on some kind of development some kind of own 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.379
 ideas she gives me the opportunity to steam 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:03.919
 we are against such a structure snapshot 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:05.709
 who already does not look like anything 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.909
 this land is a good shot this is kind 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:10.959
 but a certain vector yes that is like a certain 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.790
 the potential that does not give opportunity 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.709
 go somewhere else but for yourself 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.769
 just fine ceilings 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.019
 his work amazes 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.359
 so it is 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:20.739
 work hearts 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.709
 works fine space 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.469
 unfortunately not every photographer 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:28.049
 so i'm rashad just great 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:28.769
 potaps 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.929
 it is certainly interesting 

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:33.019
 Photo 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.259
 unusual since 

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:38.539
 so how to affect 

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:41.269
 material that has now become 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.579
 often reflecting other similar metals 

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:49.219
 meet old age 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:52.109
 at least it seems to me 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.749
 he was one of the first 

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:56.919
 hand volleys here it is 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:59.889
 such a way 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:01.639
 first of all it will be bad 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:03.079
 except what I saw in all the works 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.079
 drinks and even more so 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.269
 if you are a true patriot 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.699
 what is the general period of 12 for some reason her 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:13.709
 attracts 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.709
 do some other productions 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.109
 finally that sense of use 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.220
 bringing here into consideration that is this 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.790
 lot 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.900
 No, but I have enough basic 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.680
 it's just explained here with 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.820
 so for some reason I like the moment 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.600
 shoot nude that is it 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.810
 so really is as well 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.599
 just possible all the same 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:38.949
 I asked, but take off nicely 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:40.680
 here is no one 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.630
 no one bothers you to take off beautifully 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.740
 beautiful 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.610
 but this is the very common question itar 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.979
 tass 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.409
 ratio is digital and is 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:51.409
 Russian language 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:53.490
 does not have 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.469
 i.e 

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:55.939
 I am all technical components 

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:58.649
 perceived as a certain singing which 

00:04:58.649 --> 00:05:01.649
 can definitely hold there 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:06.089
 but certain things make me like 

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:08.279
 viewers as a photographer care about that of course 

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:10.559
 the result is that if you could not 

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:13.559
 do something 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.620
 produces not like reading to the viewers 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.099
 what causes him certain feelings 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:19.849
 it doesn't matter in what ways 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:21.999
 this has reached me so it seems 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:23.129
 I do not 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:26.129
 at the end of September 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:33.259
 I think you need 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:39.139
 unusual saturday 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:47.460
 respectively 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.460
 e Lipetsk street 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.710
 February 8 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:05.270
 prehistory 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.349
 I would like to think of the court so what 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:11.349
 there is a person who sees in the eu countries 

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:13.789
 see in this no one considered that is 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:15.919
 first of all 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:17.979
 I would like it not to be forgotten too 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:19.400
 them really yes 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.960
 so would not want to get into the exhibition 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.490
 called yes I didn't want to show 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.210
 limit another world yes alternative then 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.279
 there is something that does not exist in real 

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:28.039
 the world 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:30.569
 she notes ephemeral fantasy 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:31.919
 here and expressed 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:34.020
 Clinton limit principle 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.770
 conciseness
