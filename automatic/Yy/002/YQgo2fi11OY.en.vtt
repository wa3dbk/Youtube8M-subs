 That's a good news, what's it, what it is, what it is, what it is not.

 Here's a message I really want to tell you, so be sure to listen to this new song, wake up.

 We're gonna shake the woooooorld, little bit of spicy, little bit of wonder. 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.500
 You! So many things that I wanna say and that you wanna hear and I Brrrrr 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.500
 The difficult everyday everyone knows The world is what it is, even my smartphone can (s) crash 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.500
 But where I want to take you, it's just too swag without messing heaven on earth, you're in or rather stuck 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:46.500

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.500
 What is your style ? Your favorite Walt Disney tone? We offer you happiness to the map, it's up to you to play! 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.700
 Why do you look back? This is the moment. Tonight is the night, in his name we're together. 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:05.700
 So we put our hands on the skies open for us. Like the skies open for us 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.000
 Why do you look back? This is the moment. Tonight is the night, in his name we're together. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 So we put our hands on the skies open for us. Like the skies open for us 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.000
 The joy of the gospel fills the heart and the whole life of those who meet Jesus. 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Those who let themselves be saved by him are freed from sin, sadness, inner emptiness, isolation. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.500
 With Jesus Christ, joy is born and is always reborn. 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.800
 In this Exhortation I wish to address the faithful Christians, to invite them to a new evangelizing stage marked by this joy 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.300
 and to point out ways for the Church's progress in the coming years. 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.600
 The big risk of today's world, with its multiple and overwhelming consumer offer, 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.500
 is an individualistic sadness that comes from a well-established and avaricious heart, a search sick of superficial pleasures, isolated consciousness. 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.200
 When the inner life closes on its own interests, there is no room for others, the poor do not enter, 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.100
 we no longer listen to the voice of God, we no longer enjoy the sweet joy of his love, the enthusiasm to do good no longer throbs. 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.800
 Even believers run this risk, certain and permanent. 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.800
 Why do you look back? This is the moment. Tonight is the night, in his name we're together. 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.800
 So we put our hands on the skies open for us. Like the skies open for us. 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.000
 Why do you look back? This is the moment. Tonight is the night, in his name we're together. 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 So we put our hands on the skies open for us. Like the skies open for us.
