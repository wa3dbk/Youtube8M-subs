00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
can't use that and for that exact reason

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.080

is the variant that I'm showing you guys
today<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.930> actually<00:01:10.409> better<00:01:10.890> than<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.430> KF<00:01:11.850> 5

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
today is actually better than the KF 5

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.850 
today is actually better than the KF 5
breakneck<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.020> very<00:01:13.200> only<00:01:13.409> popping<00:01:13.710> up<00:01:13.770> on

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
breakneck so the very only popping up on

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.140 
breakneck so the very only popping up on
your<00:01:13.890> screen<00:01:13.979> right<00:01:14.159> now<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.430> see<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.729> k5

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
your screen right now you see is the k5

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.749 
your screen right now you see is the k5
the<00:01:15.689> genuine<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.740> professional<00:01:17.430> variant

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
the genuine the professional variant

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.399 
the genuine the professional variant
which<00:01:17.850> means<00:01:18.060> it's<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.270> lot<00:01:18.420> easier<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.900> get<00:01:19.110> and

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
which means it's a lot easier to get and

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.020 
which means it's a lot easier to get and
the<00:01:19.560> chances<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.220> actually<00:01:20.280> getting<00:01:20.729> gun

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
the chances of you actually getting gun

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.450 
the chances of you actually getting gun
are<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.299> lot<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.869> lot<00:01:22.409> higher<00:01:22.710> than<00:01:22.740> an<00:01:23.130> elite

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
are a lot a lot higher than an elite

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.820 
are a lot a lot higher than an elite
weapon<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.180> you're<00:01:25.080> gonna<00:01:25.200> see<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.650> is

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
weapon so you're gonna see that this is

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.370 
weapon so you're gonna see that this is
plus<00:01:26.130> damage<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.060> accuracy<00:01:27.960> which<00:01:28.200> is

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
plus damage and accuracy which is

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.020 
plus damage and accuracy which is
essentially<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.130> opposite<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
essentially the opposite is the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.600 
essentially the opposite is the
breakneck<00:01:30.450> because<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.020> breakneck<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.680> minus

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
breakneck because the breakneck is minus

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.120 
breakneck because the breakneck is minus
accuracy<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.689> doesn't<00:01:34.530> have<00:01:34.619> any<00:01:34.680> plus

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
accuracy and doesn't have any plus

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.620 
accuracy and doesn't have any plus
damage<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:35.700> it's<00:01:35.790> pretty<00:01:35.970> much<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.360> exact

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
damage so it's pretty much the exact

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.410 
damage so it's pretty much the exact
opposite<00:01:37.140> but<00:01:37.710> here's<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.640> thing<00:01:38.670> okay<00:01:39.390> so

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
opposite but here's the thing okay so

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.480 
opposite but here's the thing okay so
you're<00:01:39.720> like<00:01:39.750> superior<00:01:40.560> these<00:01:41.070> guns<00:01:41.340> are

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
you're like superior these guns are

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.910 
you're like superior these guns are
opposites<00:01:42.060> like<00:01:42.390> how<00:01:42.689> are<00:01:43.140> these<00:01:43.380> guns<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
opposites like how are these guns the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.859 
opposites like how are these guns the
same<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.369> let<00:01:44.549> me<00:01:44.729> explain<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.840> okay

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
same and let me explain that to you okay

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.050 
same and let me explain that to you okay
so<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.680> professional<00:01:47.430> doesn't<00:01:47.640> have<00:01:47.820> any

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
so the professional doesn't have any

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.120 
so the professional doesn't have any
blocked<00:01:48.509> attachments<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.860> know<00:01:50.009> what

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
blocked attachments so you know what

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.620 
blocked attachments so you know what
that<00:01:50.250> means<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.670> means<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:50.939> can<00:01:51.030> put<00:01:51.119> rapid

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
that means that means you can put rapid

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.810 
that means that means you can put rapid
fire<00:01:51.840> on<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.320> if<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.530> equip<00:01:52.829> rapid<00:01:53.369> fire<00:01:53.549> it

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
fire on and if you equip rapid fire it

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.090 
fire on and if you equip rapid fire it
is<00:01:54.180> about<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.810> same<00:01:55.110> fire<00:01:55.409> rate<00:01:55.680> as<00:01:55.890> the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
is about the same fire rate as the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.190 
is about the same fire rate as the
breakneck<00:01:56.399> already<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.329> it's<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:57.570> boom<00:01:57.750> the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
breakneck already so it's like boom the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.170 
breakneck already so it's like boom the
clip<00:01:58.409> rapid<00:01:58.740> fire<00:01:58.950> seeing<00:01:59.460> gun<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.759> know<00:01:59.880> same

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
clip rapid fire seeing gun you know same

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.859 
clip rapid fire seeing gun you know same
great<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.509> player

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
great a player

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.139 
great a player
everything's<00:02:01.380> just<00:02:01.500> boom<00:02:01.890> bro<00:02:02.490> rapid<00:02:02.790> fire<00:02:02.969> on

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
everything's just boom bro rapid fire on

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.580 
everything's just boom bro rapid fire on
and<00:02:03.390> there<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.810> go<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:03.960> have<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.200> breakneck

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
and there you go you have the breakneck

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.889 
and there you go you have the breakneck
rapid<00:02:05.159> fire<00:02:05.490> now<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.119> can<00:02:06.329> throw<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.509> grip<00:02:06.750> on

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
rapid fire now you can throw a grip on

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.210 
rapid fire now you can throw a grip on
it<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.170> increase<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.560> accuracy<00:02:07.799> blah<00:02:08.099> blah

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
it to increase the accuracy blah blah

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.740 
it to increase the accuracy blah blah
blah<00:02:08.369> blah<00:02:08.640> whatever<00:02:08.879> attachment<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.660> you

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
blah blah whatever attachment that you

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.940 
blah blah whatever attachment that you
actually<00:02:09.929> want<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.470> go<00:02:10.590> ahead<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.860> do

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
actually want you to go ahead and do

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.040 
actually want you to go ahead and do
that

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
that

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.110 
that
so<00:02:12.290> once<00:02:12.500> you<00:02:12.590> equip<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:12.950> lab<00:02:13.100> the<00:02:13.580> rapid<00:02:13.940> fire

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
so once you equip the lab the rapid fire

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.390 
so once you equip the lab the rapid fire
everything<00:02:14.480> on<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.810> gun<00:02:14.960> is<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.440> same<00:02:15.680> except

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
everything on the gun is the same except

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.400 
everything on the gun is the same except
the<00:02:16.550> genuine<00:02:16.970> stats<00:02:17.270> are<00:02:17.540> better<00:02:18.020> and<00:02:18.320> you

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
the genuine stats are better and you

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.080 
the genuine stats are better and you
can't<00:02:18.680> equip<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:19.010> rapid<00:02:19.400> fire<00:02:19.520> under<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:19.880> brake

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
can't equip a rapid fire under the brake

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.510 
can't equip a rapid fire under the brake
knife<00:02:20.330> so<00:02:20.840> it's<00:02:20.960> not<00:02:21.020> like<00:02:21.170> you<00:02:21.260> could<00:02:21.520> put

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
knife so it's not like you could put

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.580 
knife so it's not like you could put
rapid<00:02:22.820> fire<00:02:22.970> on<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.180> breakneck<00:02:23.450> plus<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.260> you

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
rapid fire on the breakneck plus the you

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.410 
rapid fire on the breakneck plus the you
know<00:02:24.740> rapid<00:02:25.400> fire<00:02:25.550> that's<00:02:25.760> built<00:02:26.030> into<00:02:26.270> the

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
know rapid fire that's built into the

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.760 
know rapid fire that's built into the
gun<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:26.660> you<00:02:26.720> have<00:02:26.810> like<00:02:26.990> double<00:02:27.230> rapid<00:02:27.590> fire

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
gun and you have like double rapid fire

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:28.930 
gun and you have like double rapid fire
you<00:02:27.950> aren't<00:02:28.190> allowed<00:02:28.340> to<00:02:28.370> do<00:02:28.550> that<00:02:28.760> on<00:02:28.850> the

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
you aren't allowed to do that on the

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.700 
you aren't allowed to do that on the
breakneck<00:02:29.150> so<00:02:29.540> adding<00:02:29.930> rapid<00:02:30.260> fire<00:02:30.440> just<00:02:30.530> to

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
breakneck so adding rapid fire just to

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.950 
breakneck so adding rapid fire just to
the<00:02:30.860> genuine<00:02:31.280> does<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:31.970> exact<00:02:32.360> same<00:02:32.450> thing<00:02:32.600> as

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
the genuine does the exact same thing as

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.440 
the genuine does the exact same thing as
using<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.440> breakneck<00:02:33.880> except<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:35.000> genuine

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
using the breakneck except the genuine

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.270 
using the breakneck except the genuine
gives<00:02:35.690> you<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:35.900> extra<00:02:36.020> damage<00:02:36.410> and<00:02:36.680> accuracy

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
gives you the extra damage and accuracy

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.130 
gives you the extra damage and accuracy
and<00:02:37.340> stuff<00:02:37.640> like<00:02:37.820> that<00:02:38.000> so<00:02:38.270> the<00:02:38.720> using<00:02:39.050> the

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
and stuff like that so the using the

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.840 
and stuff like that so the using the
genuine<00:02:39.560> is<00:02:39.710> a<00:02:39.740> lot<00:02:40.010> better<00:02:40.250> because<00:02:40.460> it<00:02:40.670> has

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
genuine is a lot better because it has

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.450 
genuine is a lot better because it has
the<00:02:41.180> decrease<00:02:41.630> recoil<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.710> genuine<00:02:43.100> actually

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
the decrease recoil the genuine actually

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.580 
the decrease recoil the genuine actually
adds<00:02:43.670> 10<00:02:44.210> percent<00:02:44.660> more<00:02:44.840> recoil<00:02:45.290> in<00:02:45.530> the

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
adds 10 percent more recoil in the

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.760 
adds 10 percent more recoil in the
normal<00:02:45.860> k5<00:02:46.660> whereas<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:47.810> genuine<00:02:48.290> or<00:02:48.530> no<00:02:48.620> the

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
normal k5 whereas the genuine or no the

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.230 
normal k5 whereas the genuine or no the
breakneck<00:02:49.070> I<00:02:49.430> think<00:02:49.610> I<00:02:49.670> said<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:49.940> wrong<00:02:50.030> the

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
breakneck I think I said the wrong the

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.840 
breakneck I think I said the wrong the
breakneck<00:02:50.570> adds<00:02:51.170> ten<00:02:52.070> percent<00:02:52.430> more<00:02:52.520> recoil

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
breakneck adds ten percent more recoil

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.660 
breakneck adds ten percent more recoil
and<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.120> genuine<00:02:53.740> decreases<00:02:54.740> the<00:02:55.190> recoil<00:02:55.550> by

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
and the genuine decreases the recoil by

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.340 
and the genuine decreases the recoil by
10<00:02:55.910> percent<00:02:56.270> so<00:02:56.570> I<00:02:56.600> don't<00:02:56.900> know<00:02:56.990> about<00:02:57.170> you

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
10 percent so I don't know about you

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.710 
10 percent so I don't know about you
guys<00:02:57.530> but<00:02:57.590> if<00:02:57.830> I<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.040> option<00:02:58.640> to<00:02:59.000> use<00:02:59.180> a<00:02:59.210> gun

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
guys but if I the option to use a gun

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.010 
guys but if I the option to use a gun
that<00:03:00.320> has<00:03:00.650> a<00:03:00.710> lot<00:03:01.130> of<00:03:01.160> recoil<00:03:01.700> no<00:03:02.390> extra<00:03:02.840> damage

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
that has a lot of recoil no extra damage

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.530 
that has a lot of recoil no extra damage
and<00:03:03.440> rapid<00:03:04.100> fire<00:03:04.310> versus<00:03:04.940> the<00:03:05.030> gun<00:03:05.210> that<00:03:05.390> has

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
and rapid fire versus the gun that has

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.500 
and rapid fire versus the gun that has
less<00:03:06.170> recoil<00:03:06.440> rapid<00:03:07.220> fire<00:03:07.430> and<00:03:07.670> extra<00:03:08.330> damage

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
less recoil rapid fire and extra damage

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.570 
less recoil rapid fire and extra damage
I<00:03:08.900> would<00:03:09.470> definitely<00:03:09.830> pick<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.130> second<00:03:10.460> one<00:03:10.490> I

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
I would definitely pick the second one I

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.310 
I would definitely pick the second one I
think<00:03:10.640> that<00:03:10.790> is<00:03:10.880> a<00:03:11.090> much<00:03:11.300> better<00:03:11.570> choice<00:03:11.930> and

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
think that is a much better choice and

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.590 
think that is a much better choice and
it<00:03:12.770> is<00:03:12.890> better<00:03:13.070> than<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.280> KF<00:03:13.610> 5<00:03:13.760> breakneck<00:03:14.090> if

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
it is better than the KF 5 breakneck if

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.940 
it is better than the KF 5 breakneck if
you<00:03:14.810> play<00:03:14.990> your<00:03:15.110> attachments<00:03:15.590> right<00:03:15.620> on<00:03:15.860> the
