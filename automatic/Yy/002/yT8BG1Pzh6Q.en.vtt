00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
be good enough just for this

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.479 
be good enough just for this

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
and let's get to the cutting to begin

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.490 
and let's get to the cutting to begin
all<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.670> have<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.850> do<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.030> take<00:00:48.210> your<00:00:48.570> charge

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
battery and load it up into the sonic

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.939 
battery and load it up into the sonic
blade<00:00:52.770> like<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.370> just<00:00:54.360> like<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.770> and<00:00:55.770> then<00:00:55.860> it

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
blade like so just like that and then it

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.680 
blade like so just like that and then it
actually<00:00:56.070> has<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.340> little<00:00:56.460> safety<00:00:57.120> lock<00:00:57.449> right

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
bread is really tough so and i'm not

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.260 
bread is really tough so and i'm not
using<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.140> bread<00:02:51.380> knife<00:02:52.010> adapter<00:02:52.700> so<00:02:52.910> i'm

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
using the bread knife adapter so i'm

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.370 
using the bread knife adapter so i'm
going<00:02:53.390> to<00:02:53.480> switch<00:02:53.570> the<00:02:53.810> blade<00:02:54.020> and<00:02:54.050> see<00:02:54.320> if

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
going to switch the blade and see if

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.780 
going to switch the blade and see if
that<00:02:54.440> one<00:02:54.620> works<00:02:54.709> a<00:02:54.830> little<00:02:54.920> bit<00:02:55.070> better<00:02:55.190> so

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
that one works a little bit better so

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.360 
that one works a little bit better so
i'm<00:02:55.880> going<00:02:55.970> to<00:02:56.030> put<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.300> bread<00:02:56.570> knife<00:02:56.840> at

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
i'm going to put the bread knife at

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.540 
i'm going to put the bread knife at
adapting<00:02:58.370> on<00:02:59.150> here<00:02:59.390> and<00:02:59.890> it's<00:03:00.890> for<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.370> bread

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
adapting on here and it's for the bread

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.060 
adapting on here and it's for the bread
and<00:03:02.239> so<00:03:02.750> let's<00:03:02.900> try<00:03:03.110> that<00:03:03.260> once<00:03:03.500> if<00:03:03.739> it<00:03:03.860> works<00:03:04.010> a

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
and so let's try that once if it works a

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.250 
and so let's try that once if it works a
little<00:03:04.160> better<00:03:07.060> and<00:03:08.060> it's<00:03:08.270> not<00:03:08.420> on<00:03:08.600> right

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
little better and it's not on right

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:17.740 
little better and it's not on right
right<00:03:11.200> why<00:03:12.200> is<00:03:12.260> it<00:03:12.380> not<00:03:12.620> working<00:03:16.420> ok<00:03:17.420> now<00:03:17.570> it's

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
right why is it not working ok now it's

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:28.210 
right why is it not working ok now it's
locked<00:03:17.989> here<00:03:18.260> we<00:03:18.350> go<00:03:25.420> and<00:03:26.470> that<00:03:27.470> worked<00:03:27.769> a<00:03:28.040> lot

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
locked here we go and that worked a lot

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.780 
locked here we go and that worked a lot
better<00:03:28.900> so<00:03:29.900> cut<00:03:30.260> up<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.530> vegetables<00:03:30.799> great<00:03:31.519> it

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
better so cut up the vegetables great it

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.000 
better so cut up the vegetables great it

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.110 
and I'm going to cover it like you would
a<00:03:44.930> turkey<00:03:45.350> so<00:03:45.709> here<00:03:45.860> we<00:03:45.920> go<00:03:46.959> make<00:03:47.959> sure<00:03:47.989> it's<00:03:48.290> on

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
a turkey so here we go make sure it's on

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.530 
a turkey so here we go make sure it's on
and<00:03:50.120> here<00:03:50.299> we<00:03:50.330> go

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.259 

cut<00:03:55.540> through<00:03:55.780> it<00:03:55.870> like<00:03:56.020> butter<00:03:56.260> almost<00:03:57.269> this

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
cut through it like butter almost this

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.490 
cut through it like butter almost this
works<00:03:58.540> really<00:03:58.810> really<00:03:58.959> well

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.559 

and<00:04:02.500> this<00:04:02.680> what<00:04:02.829> it's<00:04:03.250> designed<00:04:03.430> to<00:04:03.790> do<00:04:04.030> so<00:04:04.359> eat

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
and this what it's designed to do so eat

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:11.520 
and this what it's designed to do so eat
we<00:04:04.719> have<00:04:04.870> bone

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.780 

so<00:04:12.530> imagine<00:04:12.920> if<00:04:13.010> that<00:04:13.070> was<00:04:13.310> a<00:04:13.430> turkey<00:04:14.620> good

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
so imagine if that was a turkey good

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:22.560 
so imagine if that was a turkey good
thanksgiving<00:04:16.790> eve<00:04:17.030> so<00:04:17.450> it's<00:04:19.870> about<00:04:20.870> that<00:04:21.230> time

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
thanksgiving eve so it's about that time

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.090 
thanksgiving eve so it's about that time
so<00:04:23.570> this<00:04:23.750> touch<00:04:23.990> to<00:04:24.230> it<00:04:24.260> really<00:04:24.860> easily

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
so this touch to it really easily

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.430 
so this touch to it really easily
there's<00:04:25.850> a<00:04:25.940> little<00:04:26.120> bit<00:04:26.240> shaking<00:04:27.020> back<00:04:27.260> and

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
there's a little bit shaking back and

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.320 
there's a little bit shaking back and
