00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.580 
those Christmas specials which I was
like<00:03:38.739> what<00:03:39.160> my<00:03:39.580> bloom<00:03:39.850> anyway<00:03:40.810> so<00:03:41.260> their<00:03:41.410> heads

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
like what my bloom anyway so their heads

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.930 
like what my bloom anyway so their heads
don't<00:03:41.890> turn<00:03:42.100> I<00:03:42.250> thought<00:03:42.430> they'd<00:03:42.580> be<00:03:42.700> a<00:03:42.730> little

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
don't turn I thought they'd be a little

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.210 
don't turn I thought they'd be a little
more<00:03:43.120> articulated<00:03:43.630> but<00:03:43.959> it's<00:03:44.530> just<00:03:44.680> the<00:03:44.739> arms

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
more articulated but it's just the arms

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.770 
more articulated but it's just the arms
so<00:03:45.550> they<00:03:45.910> can<00:03:46.060> be<00:03:46.150> like<00:03:46.620> up<00:03:47.620> down<00:03:47.970> and<00:03:48.970> that's

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
so they can be like up down and that's

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.170 
so they can be like up down and that's
all<00:03:49.989> the<00:03:50.620> old<00:03:50.830> the<00:03:51.190> miniatures<00:03:51.580> from<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:51.820> 80s

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
all the old the miniatures from the 80s

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.500

their<00:03:53.080> legs<00:03:53.350> and<00:03:53.530> heads<00:03:53.890> also<00:03:54.370> moved<00:03:54.640> and<00:03:55.150> some

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
their legs and heads also moved and some

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.390 
their legs and heads also moved and some

the<00:04:05.350> books<00:04:05.560> are<00:04:05.799> all<00:04:05.980> the<00:04:06.160> same<00:04:06.430> they<00:04:06.700> didn't

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
the books are all the same they didn't

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.110 
the books are all the same they didn't
make<00:04:08.080> them<00:04:08.320> different<00:04:08.740> at<00:04:09.070> all<00:04:09.100> which<00:04:09.970> would

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
make them different at all which would

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.100 
make them different at all which would
have<00:04:10.180> been<00:04:10.240> cute<00:04:10.480> if<00:04:10.630> they<00:04:10.690> had<00:04:10.810> different

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
have been cute if they had different

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.100 
have been cute if they had different
expressions<00:04:11.680> but<00:04:12.640> that's<00:04:13.210> okay<00:04:13.510> I<00:04:13.690> think<00:04:13.900> that

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
expressions but that's okay I think that

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.979 
expressions but that's okay I think that
just<00:04:14.380> the<00:04:14.500> colors<00:04:14.890> and<00:04:15.390> alone<00:04:16.390> just<00:04:16.660> make<00:04:16.810> them

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
just the colors and alone just make them

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.539 
just the colors and alone just make them
really<00:04:17.260> cool<00:04:17.560> like<00:04:17.709> they're<00:04:17.890> really<00:04:18.280> vibrant
