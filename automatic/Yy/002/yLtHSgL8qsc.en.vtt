know but we're gonna keep on going and

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.640

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
really it's like I don't know I think

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.240 
really it's like I don't know I think
it's<00:01:26.009> really<00:01:26.159> addicting<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:26.759> game<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.210> far

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
it's really addicting this game so far

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.770 
it's really addicting this game so far
because<00:01:29.250> it's<00:01:29.400> just<00:01:29.549> like<00:01:29.700> bhai<00:01:30.060> says<00:01:30.420> oh<00:01:30.540> no<00:01:30.750> I

because it's just like bhai says oh no I

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.390 
because it's just like bhai says oh no I
just<00:01:31.110> screwed<00:01:31.290> myself

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.790 

but<00:01:35.030> it's<00:01:35.150> really<00:01:35.390> just<00:01:35.510> like<00:01:35.930> the<00:01:36.320> game<00:01:36.500> is<00:01:36.680> so

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
but it's really just like the game is so

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.620 
but it's really just like the game is so
addicting<00:01:37.370> because<00:01:37.580> of<00:01:37.940> the<00:01:38.030> fact<00:01:38.240> that<00:01:38.360> it's

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
addicting because of the fact that it's

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.300 
addicting because of the fact that it's
just<00:01:38.720> like<00:01:39.050> the<00:01:39.380> levels<00:01:39.680> are<00:01:39.830> pretty<00:01:40.040> dang
