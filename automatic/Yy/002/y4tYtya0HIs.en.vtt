 Welcome to a new kind 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.670
 duel on this channel we do today 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.429
 a retro duel together with the end 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.259
 Let's play from the beginning on 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.450
 jugo story today we only play 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.250
 with cards from the volume 1 buses 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.340
 first lawyer of all time from the 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:25.050
 Aussie and first time bullfight paper 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.519
 yes everyone that he has taken since have 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.189
 cut through and we'll see soon 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.760
 get meta we have next level 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.679
 meter 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.180
 and since I start now and we 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.090
 now these new rules have start 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.110
 Now with five cards we take now 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.910
 I do not even know us 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.940
 can exhibit 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:46.289
 I have no problem with that 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:48.270
 I first put two cards face down 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.809
 and monster and then my opponent 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.680
 One turn 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.980
 best card like we have before 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.629
 bitched about it great basin shit it 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.789
 are so bad cards but that is 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.229
 unbelievable there is my right tech 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.150
 strategy also finds it difficult 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:13.369
 let's see what you're doing the same 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.369
 stick 1200 is not there 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.500
 now comes 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:33.619
 only times you get that would be without one 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:35.000
 take that and then offer that was me 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:47.899
 live points technically ahead of you 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:52.240
 you have pulled all your biceps that is indeed 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:57.190
 the whole misere was incredible 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.750
 Dirty comes I have to all mine 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.280
 register that 's not there 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:07.399
 You 're really brave enough to get video 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.319
 next level meta age you have all 12 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:16.430
 pulled cards for it 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:18.890
 no no no one more tick that 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.840
 There's no play to protocol 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.100
 it already has a sense yes I know 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:32.230
 which will see if you keep that up 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:32.230
 can biotope 1070 here that takes 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:48.440
 Cabinet piece 90 +1 here with the match 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:53.079
 I may sometimes 210 by then still 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.079
 intact as of course sexy triple black 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:03:01.750
 rocco already two movies one has the 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:08.690
 there is not 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:12.940
 for that they kings better not too tight 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:15.170
 the trains will take time 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:20.510
 I would have a hit the bet 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:28.040
 that the trafo of course I am mine 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:30.500
 first 1 2 scored so there is someone there 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.980
 was really hardcore here on it wants 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:42.130
 I really get started right there 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:44.510
 Corneau 44 strike the 4 1 suffered 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.130
 I have just moved 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:51.380
 yes but there are only views who had 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.569
 but there is still one more thing 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.370
 until then do not think so well 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.330
 it's good that just pulled that better 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.330
 Heart of the card is on your side 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.630
 no no 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:11.210

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:17.120
 dark gray here is that has 100 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:19.299
 attack more than 1000 name adobe seen 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.820
 he was arrived by 12 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:32.630
 god looks like game that's not 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:38.540
 Nice that all your mother pulled that 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:42.710
 Grass is definitely going to be so much 1 2 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:45.170
 There are not so many people like that 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.970
 was game 1 with our volume 1 duel 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.170

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.670
 is shot because we have no time 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:53.560
