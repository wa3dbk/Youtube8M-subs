save<00:00:57.190> on<00:00:57.370> animation<00:00:57.970> or<00:00:58.059> something<00:00:58.360> I<00:00:58.450> don't

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
save on animation or something I don't

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.540 
save on animation or something I don't
know<00:00:58.720> whatever<00:00:59.320> probably<00:00:59.950> got<00:01:00.040> some<00:01:00.160> logical

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
know whatever probably got some logical

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.990 
know whatever probably got some logical
explanation<00:01:00.610> anyway<00:01:01.480> this<00:01:01.960> is<00:01:02.110> a<00:01:02.140> chest<00:01:03.000> so

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
explanation anyway this is a chest so

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.189 
explanation anyway this is a chest so
what<00:01:04.390> do<00:01:04.449> you<00:01:04.540> need<00:01:04.600> for<00:01:04.750> a<00:01:04.839> chest<00:01:05.019> is

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
what do you need for a chest is

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.960 
what do you need for a chest is
obviously<00:01:05.560> a<00:01:05.650> key<00:01:05.920> which<00:01:06.310> there<00:01:06.790> was<00:01:06.940> a

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
obviously a key which there was a

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.320 
obviously a key which there was a
keyhole<00:01:07.330> that<00:01:08.070> chest<00:01:09.070> usually<00:01:09.430> contain<00:01:09.820> or

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
keyhole that chest usually contain or

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.320 
keyhole that chest usually contain or
actually<00:01:11.110> always<00:01:11.350> contain<00:01:11.920> more<00:01:12.670> gems<00:01:12.970> than

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
actually always contain more gems than

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.050 
actually always contain more gems than
the<00:01:13.509> average<00:01:14.290> chest<00:01:14.770> would<00:01:15.070> I<00:01:15.340> mean<00:01:15.670> like

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
the average chest would I mean like

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.710 
the average chest would I mean like
chess<00:01:16.869> whatever<00:01:17.820> crank<00:01:18.820> whatever<00:01:19.210> would

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
chess whatever crank whatever would

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.920 
chess whatever crank whatever would
contain<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:24.640> one<00:01:24.820> contains<00:01:25.060> ten<00:01:25.479> gems<00:01:25.750> i

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
think the other one which is in dark

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.490 
think the other one which is in dark
hollow<00:01:27.700> contains<00:01:28.030> ten<00:01:28.479> Jeff<00:01:28.660> as<00:01:28.780> well<00:01:28.990> which

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
trouble spiral um yeah then mission ssin

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.130 
trouble spiral um yeah then mission ssin
in<00:01:47.830> arm<00:01:48.070> 18<00:01:48.369> but<00:01:48.970> these<00:01:49.149> are<00:01:49.420> platforms<00:01:49.810> also

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
in arm 18 but these are platforms also

in arm 18 but these are platforms also
off<00:01:50.350> this<00:01:50.470> checkpoint<00:01:50.770> so<00:01:51.220> when<00:01:51.369> you<00:01:51.460> stand<00:01:51.700> on

weren't to iodine this although
hopefully<00:02:00.340> um<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:02.409> enemies<00:02:02.710> for<00:02:02.890> this<00:02:02.979> level

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
hopefully um the enemies for this level

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.669

carry eggs and you have to run after
them<00:06:26.400> flame<00:06:27.210> in<00:06:27.360> my<00:06:27.450> charger<00:06:27.870> it's<00:06:28.080> probably

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.170 
them flame in my charger it's probably

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.260 
them flame in my charger it's probably
either<00:06:28.410> the<00:06:28.620> flamin<00:06:28.980> and<00:06:29.160> then<00:06:29.880> you<00:06:30.060> get<00:06:30.240> your

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
either the flamin and then you get your

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.840 
either the flamin and then you get your
egg<00:06:30.510> back<00:06:30.720> the<00:06:31.620> egg<00:06:31.740> and<00:06:32.010> there's<00:06:32.280> 12<00:06:32.550> eggs<00:06:32.700> in

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:32.850 
egg back the egg and there's 12 eggs in

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.220 
egg back the egg and there's 12 eggs in
the<00:06:32.940> game<00:06:33.090> so<00:06:33.270> there<00:06:33.390> isn't<00:06:33.750> many<00:06:33.810> egg<00:06:34.050> fees

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.230 
the game so there isn't many egg fees

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.480 
the game so there isn't many egg fees
but<00:06:36.350> that's<00:06:37.350> the<00:06:37.710> Stonehill<00:06:38.100> one<00:06:38.280> is<00:06:38.370> probably

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
but that's the Stonehill one is probably

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.210 
but that's the Stonehill one is probably
one<00:06:38.730> the<00:06:38.760> harder<00:06:39.210> ones<00:06:39.680> because<00:06:40.680> he<00:06:40.830> has<00:06:41.190> a

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.220 
one the harder ones because he has a

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.640 
one the harder ones because he has a
longer<00:06:41.730> area<00:06:42.180> to<00:06:42.360> run<00:06:42.540> around<00:06:42.660> usually<00:06:43.530> the

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.650 
longer area to run around usually the

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.130 
longer area to run around usually the
longer<00:06:43.980> areas<00:06:44.340> run<00:06:44.490> around<00:06:44.730> the<00:06:44.820> harder<00:06:45.150> but

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:46.140 
longer areas run around the harder but

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.600 
longer areas run around the harder but
it<00:06:46.260> really<00:06:46.410> depends

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:47.610 
it really depends

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:53.270 
it really depends
um<00:06:49.430> anyway<00:06:51.199> thinking<00:06:52.199> about<00:06:52.289> that<00:06:52.530> will<00:06:53.099> get

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 
um anyway thinking about that will get

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.890 
um anyway thinking about that will get
more<00:06:53.430> good<00:06:53.610> tea<00:06:53.729> egg<00:06:53.849> thieves<00:06:54.060> later<00:06:55.250> this<00:06:56.250> is
