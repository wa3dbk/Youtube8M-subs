want to demonstrate copying a file which
is<00:01:58.829> roughly<00:01:59.070> about<00:01:59.310> one<00:01:59.579> point<00:01:59.729> seven<00:01:59.939> two

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
is roughly about one point seven two

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.670 
is roughly about one point seven two
gigabytes<00:02:00.479> I'll<00:02:00.659> give<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:00.960> an<00:02:01.049> idea<00:02:01.170> how

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
gigabytes I'll give you an idea how

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.930 
gigabytes I'll give you an idea how
is<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.130> copy<00:02:02.520> something<00:02:03.920> as<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.130> can<00:02:05.280> see<00:02:05.460> it's

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
is to copy something as you can see it's

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.930 
is to copy something as you can see it's
going<00:02:06.300> around

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
going around

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.790 
going around
114<00:02:08.940> megabyte<00:02:09.330> per<00:02:09.479> second<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.140> that's<00:02:10.470> pretty

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
114 megabyte per second so that's pretty

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.520 
114 megabyte per second so that's pretty
fast<00:02:11.070> for<00:02:11.250> right<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.780> this<00:02:12.780> file<00:02:13.080> will<00:02:13.350> take

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
fast for right and this file will take

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.830 
fast for right and this file will take
roughly<00:02:13.770> another<00:02:14.520> of<00:02:14.670> ten<00:02:15.000> seconds<00:02:15.420> so<00:02:15.810> a

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
roughly another of ten seconds so a

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.590 
roughly another of ten seconds so a

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
3.0 harddrive previously I will give you

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.880 
3.0 harddrive previously I will give you
show<00:02:36.450> you<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.720> previous<00:02:37.050> version<00:02:37.350> uses<00:02:37.530> my

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
show you the previous version uses my

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.470 
show you the previous version uses my
Western<00:02:38.370> Digital<00:02:38.520> Drive<00:02:38.910> that<00:02:39.150> I<00:02:39.209> bought

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
Western Digital Drive that I bought

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.590 
Western Digital Drive that I bought
about<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:40.620> year<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.370> half<00:02:41.489> ago<00:02:41.640> so<00:02:42.420> it's<00:02:42.570> a

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
about a year and a half ago so it's a

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.940 
about a year and a half ago so it's a
little<00:02:42.750> bit<00:02:42.840> older<00:02:43.110> technology<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.830> the

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
little bit older technology and the

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.190 
little bit older technology and the
drive<00:02:44.190> is<00:02:44.340> about<00:02:44.580> midway<00:02:45.120> through<00:02:45.150> up<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:46.080> you

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
drive is about midway through up so you

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.680 
drive is about midway through up so you
can<00:02:46.320> see<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.680> speed<00:02:47.040> is<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.190> little<00:02:47.220> bit<00:02:47.430> slower

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
can see the speed is a little bit slower

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.930 
can see the speed is a little bit slower
you<00:02:48.690> know<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:49.140> can<00:02:49.920> do<00:02:50.070> it<00:02:50.100> empty<00:02:50.400> selling<00:02:50.760> wanna

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
you know I can do it empty selling wanna

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.390 
you know I can do it empty selling wanna
completely<00:02:51.780> for<00:02:52.290> metal<00:02:52.500> drive<00:02:52.680> but<00:02:52.950> kind<00:02:53.340> of

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
completely for metal drive but kind of

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.130 
completely for metal drive but kind of
give<00:02:53.489> you<00:02:53.580> an<00:02:53.670> idea<00:02:53.730> of<00:02:53.970> what<00:02:54.510> an<00:02:54.630> empty<00:02:54.930> drive

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
give you an idea of what an empty drive

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.560 
give you an idea of what an empty drive
and<00:02:55.380> you<00:02:56.280> know<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:56.670> now<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.850> new<00:02:57.060> technology

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
and you know and now the new technology

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.960 
and you know and now the new technology
of<00:02:57.660> USB<00:02:57.959> 2.0<00:02:58.500> can<00:02:58.920> give<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.160> speed<00:02:59.489> wise<00:02:59.670> I

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
of USB 2.0 can give you speed wise I

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.360 
of USB 2.0 can give you speed wise I
want<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.720> pull<00:03:00.900> now<00:03:01.020> something<00:03:01.470> which<00:03:02.100> I

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
want to pull now something which I

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.820 
want to pull now something which I
didn't<00:03:02.640> really<00:03:02.850> like<00:03:03.110> this<00:03:04.110> little<00:03:04.380> tap<00:03:04.650> here

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
didn't really like this little tap here

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.240 
didn't really like this little tap here
after<00:03:05.160> all<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.520> USB<00:03:06.090> cable<00:03:06.390> in<00:03:06.660> place<00:03:07.130> even<00:03:08.130> to

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
after all the USB cable in place even to

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.770 
after all the USB cable in place even to
this<00:03:08.459> time<00:03:08.700> they're<00:03:08.880> kind<00:03:09.120> of<00:03:09.150> well<00:03:09.299> but<00:03:09.540> they

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
this time they're kind of well but they

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.729 
this time they're kind of well but they
come<00:03:10.170> out<00:03:10.260> kind<00:03:10.590> of<00:03:10.650> easy<00:03:12.110> you<00:03:13.110> basically<00:03:13.470> push

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
come out kind of easy you basically push

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.830 
come out kind of easy you basically push
them<00:03:13.920> in<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.280> slide<00:03:15.000> back<00:03:15.209> in<00:03:15.360> you<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:15.690> it

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
them in and slide back in you and it

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.160 
them in and slide back in you and it
stay<00:03:16.019> in<00:03:16.049> place<00:03:16.290> however<00:03:17.010> if<00:03:17.340> you<00:03:17.459> pull<00:03:17.670> them

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
stay in place however if you pull them

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.449 
stay in place however if you pull them
to<00:03:19.170> come<00:03:19.350> out<00:03:19.500> because<00:03:19.799> this<00:03:20.040> rubber<00:03:20.340> is

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
to come out because this rubber is

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.080 
to come out because this rubber is
really<00:03:20.790> soft<00:03:21.030> so<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.890> me<00:03:23.040> listing<00:03:23.760> it's<00:03:23.940> going

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
really soft so to me listing it's going

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.470 
really soft so to me listing it's going
to<00:03:24.150> be<00:03:24.209> really<00:03:24.420> easy<00:03:24.660> to<00:03:25.280> to<00:03:26.280> lose<00:03:26.459> over<00:03:26.730> the

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
to be really easy to to lose over the

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.289 
to be really easy to to lose over the
silicon<00:03:28.019> armor<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:28.799> sixty<00:03:29.430> one<00:03:29.820> terabyte

shockproof<00:03:30.750> drive<00:03:31.260> was<00:03:32.100> a<00:03:32.130> really<00:03:32.459> good<00:03:32.640> hard

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
shockproof drive was a really good hard

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.080 
shockproof drive was a really good hard

is<00:03:36.330> and<00:03:36.720> how<00:03:37.110> fast<00:03:37.350> it<00:03:37.590> was<00:03:37.769> during<00:03:38.519> my<00:03:38.730> testing

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
is and how fast it was during my testing

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.910 
is and how fast it was during my testing
I<00:03:39.269> found<00:03:39.570> one<00:03:39.810> minor<00:03:40.019> issues<00:03:40.470> with<00:03:40.680> it<00:03:40.769> and

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
I found one minor issues with it and

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.110 
I found one minor issues with it and
that<00:03:41.130> was<00:03:41.340> with<00:03:41.610> the<00:03:42.260> connection<00:03:43.260> of<00:03:43.350> this<00:03:43.470> guy

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
that was with the connection of this guy

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.120 
that was with the connection of this guy
initially<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:45.450> was<00:03:46.019> blocking<00:03:46.290> this<00:03:46.500> guy<00:03:46.709> in<00:03:46.769> and

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
initially I was blocking this guy in and

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.630 
initially I was blocking this guy in and
was<00:03:47.700> unable<00:03:48.150> to<00:03:48.209> get<00:03:48.630> fast<00:03:49.590> throughput<00:03:50.100> during

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
was unable to get fast throughput during

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.150 
was unable to get fast throughput during
my<00:03:50.760> test<00:03:51.030> I<00:03:51.239> was<00:03:51.780> only<00:03:51.900> getting<00:03:52.079> about<00:03:52.320> a<00:03:52.530> USB

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
my test I was only getting about a USB

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.800 
my test I was only getting about a USB
2.0<00:03:53.640> speed<00:03:53.940> so<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.180> couldn't<00:03:54.390> figure<00:03:54.540> I<00:03:54.660> was

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
2.0 speed so I couldn't figure I was

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.140 
2.0 speed so I couldn't figure I was
wrong<00:03:55.019> with<00:03:55.170> it<00:03:55.519> after<00:03:56.519> contacting<00:03:57.030> the

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
wrong with it after contacting the

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.630 
wrong with it after contacting the
manufacturer<00:03:57.810> I<00:03:58.440> figured<00:03:59.100> it<00:03:59.220> was<00:03:59.489> the

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
manufacturer I figured it was the

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.550 
manufacturer I figured it was the
problem<00:04:00.000> when<00:04:00.600> you<00:04:00.690> plug<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:00.989> device<00:04:01.019> in<00:04:01.440> like

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
problem when you plug the device in like

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.090 
problem when you plug the device in like
this<00:04:01.820> like<00:04:02.820> so<00:04:03.000> it<00:04:03.690> actually<00:04:04.170> come<00:04:04.590> on<00:04:04.769> when

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
this like so it actually come on when

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.319 
this like so it actually come on when

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
and you can see it however apparently I

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.850 
and you can see it however apparently I
didn't<00:04:16.870> push<00:04:17.020> it<00:04:17.050> all<00:04:17.260> the<00:04:17.290> way<00:04:17.350> in<00:04:17.560> you<00:04:17.770> have

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:17.860

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
to push it a little bit more in like

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.770 
to push it a little bit more in like
that<00:04:19.840> and<00:04:20.020> then<00:04:20.890> it<00:04:21.220> will<00:04:21.340> use<00:04:21.550> the<00:04:21.730> USB<00:04:22.090> 3.0

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
that and then it will use the USB 3.0

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.640 
that and then it will use the USB 3.0
speed

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
speed

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.560 
speed
so<00:04:23.860> I'll<00:04:24.280> blue<00:04:24.550> light<00:04:24.760> come<00:04:25.000> on<00:04:25.120> that's<00:04:25.330> how<00:04:25.480> I

so I'll blue light come on that's how I

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.290 
so I'll blue light come on that's how I
was<00:04:25.810> able<00:04:25.960> to<00:04:26.140> figure<00:04:26.470> out<00:04:26.620> it<00:04:26.890> was<00:04:27.070> if<00:04:27.880> my<00:04:27.940> hard

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
was able to figure out it was if my hard

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.540 
was able to figure out it was if my hard
drive<00:04:28.480> was<00:04:28.630> using<00:04:29.290> the<00:04:29.350> USB<00:04:29.530> 2.0<00:04:30.130> or<00:04:30.160> tweak<00:04:30.400> or

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
drive was using the USB 2.0 or tweak or

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.780 
drive was using the USB 2.0 or tweak or
no<00:04:30.670> I<00:04:30.960> was<00:04:31.960> told<00:04:32.170> that<00:04:32.350> you<00:04:32.680> know<00:04:32.770> for<00:04:33.310> 3.0<00:04:33.760> the

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
no I was told that you know for 3.0 the

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.820 
no I was told that you know for 3.0 the
speak<00:04:34.150> will<00:04:34.300> be<00:04:34.330> blue<00:04:34.630> and<00:04:34.660> 2.0<00:04:35.350> will<00:04:35.500> be<00:04:35.620> red

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
speak will be blue and 2.0 will be red

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.160 
speak will be blue and 2.0 will be red
and<00:04:36.040> I<00:04:36.670> figured<00:04:37.090> I<00:04:37.150> was<00:04:37.300> in<00:04:37.330> the<00:04:37.570> wrong<00:04:37.780> speed

and I figured I was in the wrong speed
um<00:04:39.030> after<00:04:40.030> figured<00:04:40.510> out<00:04:40.660> plug<00:04:40.870> it<00:04:40.990> back<00:04:41.020> in<00:04:41.350> and

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
um after figured out plug it back in and
