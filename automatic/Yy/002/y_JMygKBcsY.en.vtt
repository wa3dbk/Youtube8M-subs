 channel life of android welcome to 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.189
 one more son is bringing one more 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.780
 and application is now a super 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.880
 application there people the people you like 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.980
 to make gameplay do tutorials 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.570
 directly on the smartphone is the 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.730
 then this will be possible with this 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.740
 great app that I brought there who 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.650
 It will come, so it's an application. 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.050
 Free same right for him to be free and 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.240
 offers a very 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.279
 good for you to do in 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.810
 recording even with audio that is very 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.180
 hard to find the application 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.579
 of this type that you record with audio in the 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.770
 free of it so I'm sure that 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.480
 You'll like it, do not want me to stay. 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.899
 connected in the video that we see there 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.670
 someone 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.640
 Okay, so we're here on the page. 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.010
 here and we'll see 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.350
 Here I recalled the good who actually 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.510
 It 's a lot of it 's simple, people will not go there. 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.640
 come here or the configuration of it and 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.680
 this one known here in the field so here 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.449
 that I will not go deep into the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.949
 settings say what is and what is not 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.980
 I'm just going to leave it ready for that 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.110
 you make one last recording 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.770
 here then you will leave an attack there 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.360
 here and 50 brings here to say it is the 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.210
 not even if you want it 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.310
 start counting down and up to five 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.409
 seconds or if it starts you mark 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.119
 starts immediately when you leave 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.340
 hence the application where frequency 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.420
 images and delimited quality I 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.150
 I always recommend either a definition 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.380
 depends a lot still comes from the fact that its 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.270
 I think I left that 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.380
 setting it makes the great recording here 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.970
 is here 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.740
 audio recording it depends a lot on what 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.990
 you will doing and if you want to capture the 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.880
 of the recording itself, I'm never 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.680
 using the camera then I do not want 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.420
 record the audio but you can go go 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.040
 leave it here so you can 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.530
 see then there is only one demonstration 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.110
 zink of the recording that drawing here and I know 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.119
 I also do not find it interesting and kind 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.470
 so as I 'm doing this 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.270
 move here if you let that 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.340
 marked it will pass us treated here 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.740
 look you define agreement defines when 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.299
 the law that you want to stay and such 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.979
 so we are very interesting, are not you? 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.899
 is making videos showing 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.490
 something does not stay if that risk is 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.500
 passing forever the low is very 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.899
 boring in tank is just that the configuration 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.360
 It's just this is scales and it's height. 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.480
 child width disabled quality 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.920
 here and had high 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.659
 They are radios and leave also marked 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.760
 enable better performance 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:18.470
 still at the time of recording he uses everything 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.330
 that is good and then had a recording 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.540
 here in the 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.580
 germany who is recording with audio 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.360
 then that shows that the microphone is 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.940
 catching ne 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.349
 ldu audio reminded me good then he 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.819
 the countdown begins as I 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.920
 I said five seconds the time 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.440
 vote only by moving here remembering that 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.510
 this version this free version is not it 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.549
 he stays with the one that soon marks in 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.970
 low right there with the application name 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.709
 and is not translucent. 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.450
 first I paid in is one thing 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.250
 strange anyway I do not think so 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.920
 It does not make much difference to your 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.700
 there is the type of recording that 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.280
 You want to do 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.319
 So for me, calm down, so it is. 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.700
 the best free application to do 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.650
 that sort of thing I found until 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.299
 now that most of it does not allow 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.920
 You record an audio so here we go. 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.690
 for the team does not extend much video 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.760
 is the battery also in the cell phone and the 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.329
 hut is forgotten to put 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.220
 to charge 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:16.160
 so here the cedece the bar 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.700
 notification emanates stop stop record 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.819
 There he is, this library and 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.620
 there you click on linen and we will reproduce 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:35.389

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.870
 He does not stop or anything 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:47.150
