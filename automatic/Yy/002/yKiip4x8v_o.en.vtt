 Aubrey di Gray claims that many of 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.490
 living people today will live 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:59.390
 For centuries a number of modern scientists 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:01.730
 believe that in 2050 on earth 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.630
 a radically new type will be formed 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.210
 human 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.869
 this will contribute to the natural 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.180
 technology selection and development one more

 brain frame last 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.030
 claims that right now 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.530
 humanity is going through a serious 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.990
 evolutionary leap 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.650
 it is possible that by the middle of it 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.420
 centuries our life span 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.820
 increase substantially says con 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.600
 people will be able to have children in any 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.820
 age 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.040
 and most everyday tasks will be 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.150
 performed using artificial 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.820
 intelligence 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.580
 also most of the time we will become 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.759
 conduct in virtual reality in 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.369
 your 80 or 100 you will be radically 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.940
 different from current grandparents 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:52.390
 says last he says so period 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.250
 puberty in people of the future 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.950
 will increase youth will fall 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.700
 for years that are now considered average 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.630
 age 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:06.860
 namely 40 60 years and everything we will live 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.080
 about 200 years and this is not the limit in 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.080
 particular to 12 international 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.510
 conference as filiform neuroscience in 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.610
 Australia group of neuroscience 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.980
 talked about his discovery 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.650
 turns out to be a brain zone 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.390
 responsible for spatial attention 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.770
 shows no signs with age 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.930
 aging 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.900
 while most other functions 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.760
 brain deteriorate it is possible that with 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.670
 time will be able to open the mechanism store 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.610
 not brain and learn to turn off the program 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.409
 age destruction it will allow 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.799
 avoid such unpleasant consequences 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:46.560
 aging like sclerosis or insanity 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:49.379
 but that 's not all life extension 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.230
 can provide and replace worn 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:54.480
 parts of the body because it is out of 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.299
 by building some organ most often 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.150
 the cause of death, and now 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.140
 designed artificial heart liver 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.390
 and kidneys 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.049
 the challenge is to make them work 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:10.079
 long enough and without interruption of many 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:12.239
 save and donor organs the truth of their 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:16.370
 quantity is not enough yet 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:19.739
 save the lives of all in need and here in 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.700
 2013 at the Smithsonian Aviation Museum 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.889
 and cosmonautics held a presentation 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.989
 models created by the london company to her 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:30.030
 robot companies are called to 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.670
 demonstrate a breakthrough in bio 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.480
 construction and creation of artificial 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.510
 bodies 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.970
 the model is a new class 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.010
 walking bio robots working on 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.680
 muscle cells breakthrough in creating 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.359
 new generation of robots allowed 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.290
 make a 3d printer 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:49.980
 thanks to him managed to print 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.949
 miniature cars 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.109
 bending of his hydrogel and living skeletal 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:57.629
 muscles so that the muscles can 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:00.419
 compress and unclamp are applied 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:02.730
 electrical impulses impact 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:05.160
 electra pulses of various frequencies 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.519
 can force biorobots for example 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:11.160
 move faster or slower so 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.949
 the way given to the floor man semi robot 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.830
 will be a real panacea for the sick and 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:17.860
 Do the old 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:20.680
 and it will grow all the necessary 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:24.210
 internal organs and then change them to us 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:27.360
 the old ones are next followed by the most shocking 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.920
 the expected discovery if we learn 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.050
 carry the contents of human 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.870
 brain on computer media 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.870
 thus creating a matrix of thinking 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.700
 specific individuals then the chip 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.520
 with this matrix you can completely 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:45.640
 move into an artificial body which 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:49.050
 will last 200 years after this 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:52.450
 The term of the body can be replaced by new ones. 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:55.720
 the human will survive along with the whole 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.900
 memory and individuality and happen 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:02.220
 it at the current pace of development 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:05.430
 technology may relatively soon to 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.430
 2050
