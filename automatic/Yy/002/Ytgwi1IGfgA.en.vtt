00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.679
 but it works quite well the 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.260
 Free delivery for enrollment hour 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.430
 runs the nearly 2000 freshman were 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.140
 invited to 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.270
 the rush in the mensa would have there 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.980
 suggest that most are just this 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.109
 the opportunity to first contact with 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.810
 Professors and fellow students used 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.429
 many impressions and information the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.199
 have to be processed once 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.340
 you have to bring to the series on each 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.320
 if you suddenly have your own 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.149
 household leads mostly just the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.129
 information that flow on a like 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.149
 lecture schedule hourly schedule 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.710
 how do i have to go for the exam 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.629
 register where must I have been 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.700
 what does it mean a lot what ct means 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.079
 You have to do things like that at the beginning 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.969
 learn a bit more it takes its 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.289
 time but ultimately you get routine 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.110
 at the latest at christmas are all 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.480
 used to it and in case of cases 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.300
 offer stuka and university too 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.129
 help almost 12,000 students 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.250
 are currently working at the university bayreuth 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.510
 enrolled spatially and personally 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.489
 you have to be on time for that 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.100
 years of rising student numbers 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.080
 set the high attractiveness of the 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.740
 studies in bayreuth could be held 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.750
 become 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.240
 I think that 's because of the choice of 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.909
 courses of study we have that very much 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.409
 in the discipline he aligns us 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.229
 Some courses have one 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.610
 absolute unique feature 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.880
 represent philosophy economics 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.320
 health economics 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.130
 it gives the jurists with the 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.380
 economics 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.159
 Additional training All these are reasons 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.659
 why the students come here 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.369
 that also shows the statistics that we 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.799
 have a nationwide catchment area 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.280
 that says out again we 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.020
 are naturally attractive nationwide 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.479
 Personnel were mainly the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.640
 economics jurassic and the 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.040
 media sciences increased the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.080
 good expansion planning ensures that 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.659
 despite the student rush hardly 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.250
 spatial bottlenecks have arisen and 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.310
 also the first-class places in the 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.600
 university ranking for study conditions 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.060
 individual care and good 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.920
 equipment clearly shows that one 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.530
 successful study at university 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.870
 bayreuth little stand in the way for it 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.580
 that besides studying the fun is not 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.230
 too many are worried 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.200
 student groups and initiatives 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.459
 then on the campus, then warmly 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.459
 welcome the brs this
