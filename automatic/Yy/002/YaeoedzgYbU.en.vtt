00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.560 
Hawkins says it's still hard to breathe
at<00:01:37.500> times<00:01:37.740> but<00:01:38.250> it's<00:01:38.430> much<00:01:38.640> better<00:01:38.880> than<00:01:39.450> not

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
at times but it's much better than not

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.569 
at times but it's much better than not
breathing<00:01:40.020> at<00:01:40.110> all<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.650> thought<00:01:40.950> runs<00:01:41.250> across

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
breathing at all the thought runs across

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.139 
breathing at all the thought runs across
my<00:01:41.790> mind<00:01:42.090> probably<00:01:42.840> every<00:01:43.320> day<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:44.060> mean<00:01:45.060> you

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
my mind probably every day I mean you

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.240 
my mind probably every day I mean you
can't<00:01:45.329> just<00:01:45.420> sit<00:01:45.659> there<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:45.979> watch<00:01:46.979> someone

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
can't just sit there and watch someone

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.389 
can't just sit there and watch someone
kill<00:01:47.610> you

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
kill you

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.099 
kill you
the<00:01:48.969> most<00:01:49.149> interesting<00:01:49.539> thing<00:01:49.869> about<00:01:49.899> our

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:50.109 
the most interesting thing about our

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:52.080 
the most interesting thing about our
interview<00:01:50.439> is<00:01:50.619> that<00:01:50.679> Hawkins<00:01:50.979> kept<00:01:51.369> saying<00:01:51.670> he

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
interview is that Hawkins kept saying he

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.279 
interview is that Hawkins kept saying he
could<00:01:52.329> have<00:01:52.450> done<00:01:52.659> more<00:01:52.869> but<00:01:53.020> he<00:01:53.109> couldn't

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
could have done more but he couldn't

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.499 
could have done more but he couldn't
pinpoint<00:01:53.530> exactly<00:01:53.890> what<00:01:54.729> that<00:01:54.969> would<00:01:55.179> be<00:01:55.299> but

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
pinpoint exactly what that would be but

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.149 
pinpoint exactly what that would be but
the<00:01:55.570> bottom<00:01:55.840> line<00:01:55.869> is<00:01:56.170> he<00:01:56.469> deserves<00:01:56.799> a<00:01:56.950> pat<00:01:57.100> on

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
the bottom line is he deserves a pat on

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.380 
the bottom line is he deserves a pat on
the<00:01:57.340> back<00:01:57.429> I'm<00:01:57.700> sure<00:01:57.850> those<00:01:58.000> passengers

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
the back I'm sure those passengers

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.029 
the back I'm sure those passengers
