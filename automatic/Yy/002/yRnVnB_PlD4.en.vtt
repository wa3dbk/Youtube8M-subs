00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:12.390
 Um, hi, now I want to show you 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:17.130
 photo flash 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:22.610
 not from China is in such a bag we 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.610
 here bang this is not that suede could not understand 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:35.540
 here is such a flash and 460 flash 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.540
 suitable for beginners 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.190
 since here 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:48.899
 management is not very difficult let's 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:58.460
 will demonstrate so regulated 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:01:04.350
 flash power as you can see yes here 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:06.800
 press the test button pilot and she 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.800
 blinking 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:16.900
 very quickly recharged but that's all 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:21.490
 battery dependent so has two 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:26.860
 manual mascara manual mode then 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.280
 you stick in the camera in hot 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.920
 shoe 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:34.440
 and it works directly from 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:42.520
 shutter 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:44.830
 There is a mode with the 1 button changes the modes is 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.430
 mean intended if you 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:52.990
 working through a synchronizer then on this 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:59.070
 flash mode is transmitted through and to 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:07.330
 sensor signal and it works 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:10.390
 but are 2 f2 mode it ignites 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.650
 directly from camera flash 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:18.610
 i.e. there is an example 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:23.160
 Deliver such a bet on 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.160
 stand flash example 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.370
 where do you go for lunch which 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:39.510
 need to highlight 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:45.600
 and taking pictures with a camera and 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:53.670
 sets fire to the sensor too 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:03:02.590
 the flash and the synchronizer fires too 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:06.700
 from the flash angle is like normal 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:11.110
 standard tastes goes turn so here 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:16.300
 you can even make a turn so you can 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:24.210
 make but in this direction only 90 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:28.030
 degrees is also available standard 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:31.000
 lens and reflector well i usually 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:36.100
 I do not use them, they have no effect 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.110
 give in my best make paper or 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:43.270
 some kind of cardboard she does much 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:48.100
 better gives effect wider which is well 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:53.940
 actually here is such a flash heap 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.940
 not bad for a novice photographer 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:02.830
 there is another connector here so i am 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.340
 I understand the synchronizer here for her too 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.790
 clings and just did not try 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:15.959
 I will not say anything 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:18.580
 4 batteries work 4 batteries 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:23.340
 can become batteries we battery 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:27.270
 don't be mad at them for long 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.270
 so that's actually 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.300
 entry level shichko for photographers
