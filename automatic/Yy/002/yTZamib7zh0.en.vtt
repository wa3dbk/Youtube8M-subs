00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.679

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:41.979
 in this they will be here others 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.979
 so so so here it was necessary still 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.899
 pre-fill account replenishes 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:52.290

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.040
 I give the example and on the web dot ru 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.860
 because I don't use the principle very much 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.800

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:29.270
 push domain management but how much 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:33.590
 various sites here are tied press 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:38.450

 all now the domain will be here 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.209
 enough 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.310
 I update the page that is the domain to where 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.170
 will register 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.709
 will be transferred to your hosting and 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:14.950
 In the future you will be able to use 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:17.989

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.549
