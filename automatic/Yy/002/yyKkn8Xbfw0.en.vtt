00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.570
 for all of them I bring the video of my 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:08.870
 reaction and my opinion about you being d 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:11.690
 the clock that I have the one that got rid of this 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.790
 from here as an ordered departure today from 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.080
 done this in instagram image but not 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.700
 took to see what everyone and what 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.050
 let's see I hope that if it fits more or 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.150
 less because it depends on the mobile 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.340
 because I'm in a video so it integrates 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.520
 You are going super bad but well we are going to 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.520
 it 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.440
 good 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:06.080
 worships me it gets a little like 50 shades 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.909
 de gray no and it's not at all that's how 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.000
 that they put it like they do because they do not 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.280
 like he's very active sexually and 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.290
 when they see for nothing it's like that to know that I 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.950
 book you know they've been doing for a long time 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:22.690
 time I did not have a sexual partner 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:28.620
 if you have me rations 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:31.030
 and then the sex scene on the plane 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.420
 and it's not for nothing but if it had been in 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.070
 an airplane you know that the bathrooms 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.400
 just each person is impossible to 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.810
 do that there are other rivals then I think 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.460
 that he bit into the center of Murcia where 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:47.770
 sex is not what I have seen that is 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.930
 in the book sweet and 23 like that if there 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.150
 some scene and it's just not very 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.480
 explicit none of that but the important 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:59.290
 is not that 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:03.160
 to attract if you still do not know what and +0 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.980
 of the actress of the date otate and a 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.490
 mirror 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:13.200
 although he knows who is great he knows the 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.200
 brother of her with a misunderstanding 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:23.660
 I love the voice of the protagonist to the 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.850
 time I expected a lot some 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.340
 hank you want to see the trailer without a doubt 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.720
 film and likes big but I 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.520
 a little scary because portals like 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.050
 I say it seems to me that they have done it for 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.220
 much less 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.050
 I also is the same is the same and then not 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.310
 no, it is not equal at all 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.170
 it's a super nice book that I hope that 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.120
 more or less they get it right and they do not know 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.460
 focus on sex because as I say no 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.770
 has nothing to do someone has to see 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.900
 but no 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.150
 is not the protagonist is not what 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.270
 important but I really want without 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.870
 doubt to see the film and especially 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.850
 know who is going to do the 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.880
 protagonists because we have two and if 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.970
 It occurs in February 2016 if you remember it 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.590
 if I'm not wrong or at least what 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.590
 february the good 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.569
 then when they go to record 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.500
 I mean the time 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:24.290
 but he left saying they have to stop no longer 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.290
 I do not know my thinking is that home 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.099
 and above the drum of lack to sing 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.700
 he has to do things with the actress 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.830
 to touch 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.310
 I mean 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.310
 but 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.730
 I do not have much turned into that because 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.209
 is that at all those books totally 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.980
 different here things apart from sex of 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.530
 barely done and sex 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.540
 I do not want you to do so good 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.540
 liked but I have a lot of noise now 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.790
 that there will be a very bad movie but no 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.430
 I'm going to see and I'm going to sing 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.629
 I'm sure I hope so nothing else like that 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:12.510
 that I'll leave the teaser gone 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:14.549
 liked about is like me and those that we 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.949
 you have read the book do it because it is 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:19.970
 great and you have to see it because 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.970
 I recommend so 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.550
 until those days but he liked it and 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:25.550
 See you in the next video
