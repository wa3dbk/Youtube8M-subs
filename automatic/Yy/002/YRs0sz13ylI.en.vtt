00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.049
 Immediately apologize for the quality of the video 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:16.529
 take off my cell phone front camera but this 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.220
 It really doesn't matter why 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.960
 extra straight behind the wheel going on the air 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.019
 my my page vkontakte just 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.260
 blown every 30 seconds even more often 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.910
 it is necessary to communicate in which 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.669
 keyword wrestling 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:37.070
 return rising where wrestling when rising 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.719
 whether rather wrestling wrestling 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.960
 bad words write and so on right away 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.510
 I want to say I can only state 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.760
 The fact of wrestling at night you more 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.800
 really won't be at least 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.680
 I donâ€™t know what will happen next 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.699
 let's see wait and see this decision 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.809
 channel guide we again com to this 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.250
 have no solution 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.890
 why do I say this because 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.150
 the message comes back could it be 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:09.390
 would return could have returned what else 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.470
 wanna say we really din up again 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.600
 proud that for five years we 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.439
 voiced translated them voiced 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.009
 wrestling in Ukrainian is 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.320
 the only thing in the world 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.119
 if the world so to speak option 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.180
 Ukrainian translation Ukrainian voice acting 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:31.560
 wrestling ww and this to some extent 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.110
 cool though 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.060
 I was the first who tried to go on 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.549
 Russian was just easier for me in Russian 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.479
 communicate but nevertheless we stayed on 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.930
 Ukrainian language 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.789
 what's wrong with it is not at all fine 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.189
 on the contrary how are you such pride we 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.710
 the only one on the planet earth is 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.130
 did we now in the market about it or 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.479
 although in principle I do not speak about it 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.539
 many thanks to everyone who was with us 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:01.110
 five years is very hot like this is very 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:03.350
 warm day thanks to everyone who was with us 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.880
 five years who watched risen who 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.030
 supported us who happened to be friends 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.870
 described some may be curses 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.790
 thanks to which we stopped better 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.760
 at least tried yes I am now 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.849
 I listen to what was five years ago 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.299
 it is of course a wild horror nightmare 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:26.340
 now it seems to me we have become dark 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:28.819
 much more professional and 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.819
 etc 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:36.900
 something not fastened food is not good here 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.710
 so what else to say yes not very much 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.150
 nice truth as it is even very sad 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.330
 in my heart 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.490
 what next will not be possible for us 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.580

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:03.150
 so to say I do not know what pride is 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:07.490
