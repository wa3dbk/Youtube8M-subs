00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hi girls how are you in this video les 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.850
 I want to talk a little bit about the 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.160
 lipsticks that are from a brand that is 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.870
 called terramar are these that I have here 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.030
 they are some lipsticks and some sparkles 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.830
 Lipsticks want to tell you a little 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.820
 about them and show them how the 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.170
 taxes' 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.430
 first I want you to know that these 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.260
 lipsticks I had already approved 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.300
 very much before I was in 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.550
 my shop rites because they are excellent 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.590
 quality are super creamy and very very 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.750
 pigmented as I had mentioned 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.090
 before in my little store, I 'm just going to 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.189
 have things that I have already used and that 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.809
 I really recommend so if someone 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.640
 is interested in acquiring some of 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.290
 these products that I will mention for 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.700
 Here I am going to leave the link of my 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.170
 shop herita and in the description of 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.850
 this video I'm going to leave all the 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.829
 links to each of the labials that 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.930
 I will mention the first plane that 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.969
 I want to talk is about this that 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.940
 I have here that is called almonte is in the 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.430
 number 108 and it's a color like a 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.230
 coffee clear this kind of tones 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.210
 It works perfectly for when you use 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.160
 looks very loaded in your eyes so 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.079
 you want to give all the prominence to these 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.379
 the next lip is called soft metal 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.450
 and it 's number 118 this is a color that 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.759
 it's my favorite because it's a little rose 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.950
 very soft then you serve perfect 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.960
 for all your daily looks this 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.719
 another one that I have here is a super color 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.360
 interesting this is called ginger network and 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:20.610
 it is at number 120 the color it has 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.759
 It's like a mixture of pink and orange 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.950
 but as with a neon tone I do not know how 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.350
 describe it but the truth is that it looks very 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.670
 very eye-catching cute and this kind of tones 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.689
 I like it for the time of 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.069
 spring Summer 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.509
 in fact this everything that has just 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:35.579
 show our existence right now 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.469
 because as I just mentioned, it's a 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.810
 tone rather like for spring-summer 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:41.520
 and right now it is already autumn approaches 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.740
 winter and there is not a tone that is 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.599
 lend for this season I suppose 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.759
 that maybe later in the next 

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:49.319
 season, they really take it back and 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.849
 I hope they take it again because 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:53.340
 as I mentioned is a tone that 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:54.929
 I really like it and then if in a moment 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.270
 given I'm finished and I want to be able 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:59.610
 buy it again here I have this other 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.649
 which is one of my favorites 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.329
 This is a super powerful pink that 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.789
 fact is very similar to what is known 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:09.149
 as a Mexican rose this one here is called 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.619
 orchid and it's number 121 this tone I 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.569
 I like to use it when I feel something 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.370
 concrete that I want to leave as well as the 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.470
 eyes 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.510
 and take all the leading role towards 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.900
 lips the next one that I have here is 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.450
 hipster flame is at number 112 and it's 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.360
 like a kind of red burned with a 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.489
 orange tonito this kind of tones I 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.590
 like for this next season of 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.079
 autumn-winter because I think it 's 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.760
 a very sophisticated color and surely 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.590
 They will see me use it a lot in our 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.390
 Finally coming days regarding 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.450
 I have this one from here that is called 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.099
 passion network that is number 107 like 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.870
 that the previous one is a kind of red 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.879
 burned alone that is a little bit more 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.430
 dark and I also think that this 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.959
 type of tones again that means the 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.370
 life when you want a super look 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.379
 natural in the eyes and something of 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.730
 prominence on your lips now in 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.980
 how much lip gloss I love you 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.989
 show these three that I have here first 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.430
 that nothing its consistency is very very 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.069
 father because although they are lip glosses 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.170
 they do not feel sticky and in fact 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.359
 they have a very good pigmentation and you 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.190
 they last a long time the first one that I have 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:14.090
 here it is called pearl jlag and until the 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.040
 number 208 and it's a tone like between rose 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.840
 orange and it 's very very soft that 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.580
 It is also perfect for your day to day 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.239
 the next one that I have here is called 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.950
 sparkling end and it's number 201 this 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.140
 has a little more pigmentation than 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.930
 the previous one and I think it 's like a 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.250
 coppery hue roughly this kind of 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.349
 tones I think it looks very 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.470
 sophisticated in fact I used it for 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:38.120
 one of my looks called makeup 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.590
 for holiday parties something like that because 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.510
 I'll also leave the link for a hundred 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.910
 check it and the truth that I think that 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.190
 It looks very nice and finally I have here 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.819
 my favorite of favorites that is this that 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.980
 it's called bougainvillea at number 212 is 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.239
 a pink tone is super powerful that 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.680
 fact is a little clearer than the 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.709
 lipstick that I mentioned to you that is called 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.299
 orchid and I love the color of this 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.099
 lip video the truth that is super 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.349
 pigmented it lasts a lot of time 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.599
 on the lips and the texture is not 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:07.519
 sticky in fact this is the second one 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:09.650
 I buy in this tone because I really 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.599
 I loved the color and I bring in 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.299
 look at it some other tones one that 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:17.510
 called the tangerine that is a farm 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:20.239
 super nice and another that is called roach 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.160
 that is a red as well as passion red like 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.930
 I tell them you can find these lipsticks 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.550
 in my store here for a while 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.199

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.120
