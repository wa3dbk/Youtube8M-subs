00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
in the comments so the thing is this is

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.729 
in the comments so the thing is this is
all<00:00:46.590> my<00:00:46.739> single<00:00:46.920> but<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.700> has<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:48.079> very<00:00:49.079> very

all my single but it has a very very

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.029 
all my single but it has a very very
important<00:00:50.160> maintenance<00:00:50.370> problem<00:00:51.890> since<00:00:52.890> it

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
important maintenance problem since it

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.470 
important maintenance problem since it
has<00:00:53.250> twin<00:00:54.149> arms<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:55.340> this<00:00:56.340> tends<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.120> wallow

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
has twin arms the this tends to wallow

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.299 
has twin arms the this tends to wallow
in<00:00:57.989> time<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.559> will<00:00:58.770> wear<00:00:59.039> down<00:00:59.309> and<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:01.739> result

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
in time it will wear down and the result

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.460 
in time it will wear down and the result
will<00:01:02.550> be<00:01:03.229> wobbly<00:01:04.229> auxiliary<00:01:04.949> arm<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.640> see

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
will be wobbly auxiliary arm you see

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.950 
will be wobbly auxiliary arm you see
with<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:07.650> moving<00:01:07.979> around<00:01:08.189> it's<00:01:08.850> quite<00:01:09.720> hard

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
with this moving around it's quite hard

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.830 
with this moving around it's quite hard
for<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.409> wiper<00:01:10.860> blade<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.820> hold<00:01:12.090> into<00:01:12.659> the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
for the wiper blade to hold into the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.780 
for the wiper blade to hold into the
into<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.290> glass<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.920> makes<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.460> wiper

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
into the glass and that makes the wiper

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.940 
into the glass and that makes the wiper
blade<00:01:14.909> jump<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.659> not<00:01:15.840> wipe<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.320> water<00:01:16.530> like

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
blade jump and not wipe the water like

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.070 
blade jump and not wipe the water like
it<00:01:17.100> should<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.210> first<00:01:18.420> step<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.659> remove

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
it should so the first step to remove

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.160 
it should so the first step to remove
the<00:01:19.320> wiper<00:01:19.680> arm<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.700> simply<00:01:21.150> remove<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.750> bolt

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
the wiper arm is simply remove the bolt

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.160 
the wiper arm is simply remove the bolt
the<00:01:22.500> black<00:01:22.710> vault<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.549> holds<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.720> wiper<00:01:24.869> arm

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
the black vault that holds the wiper arm

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.289 
the black vault that holds the wiper arm
in<00:01:25.320> place<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.799> already<00:01:26.189> removed<00:01:26.430> mine<00:01:26.850> but<00:01:27.150> it's

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
in place I already removed mine but it's

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.780 
in place I already removed mine but it's
quite<00:01:27.540> simple<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.990> figure<00:01:28.110> out<00:01:28.790> afterwards

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
quite simple to figure out afterwards

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.999 
quite simple to figure out afterwards
you'll<00:01:30.210> have<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.509> remove<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.900> second<00:01:31.229> bolt<00:01:31.409> that

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
you'll have to remove a second bolt that

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.760 
you'll have to remove a second bolt that
holds<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.670> wiper<00:01:33.180> arm<00:01:33.530> particularly<00:01:34.530> the

of wiping the reign of the the glass the

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.339 
of wiping the reign of the the glass the
rings<00:02:33.099> are<00:02:33.340> now<00:02:33.519> very<00:02:33.909> thin<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:34.390> will<00:02:35.109> not

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
rings are now very thin and will not

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.789 
rings are now very thin and will not
hold<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.579> wiper<00:02:36.760> arm<00:02:37.060> in<00:02:37.209> place<00:02:37.349> so<00:02:38.349> what<00:02:38.680> we

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
hold the wiper arm in place so what we

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.949 
hold the wiper arm in place so what we
have<00:02:38.920> to<00:02:39.040> do<00:02:39.159> is<00:02:39.340> open<00:02:39.879> it<00:02:39.970> up<00:02:40.209> and<00:02:40.450> replace

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
have to do is open it up and replace

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.589 
have to do is open it up and replace
those<00:02:41.260> rings<00:02:41.560> with<00:02:41.920> new<00:02:42.340> ones<00:02:45.329> so<00:02:46.329> you<00:02:46.389> see

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
those rings with new ones so you see

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.979 
those rings with new ones so you see
Toyota<00:02:47.590> engineers<00:02:47.980> are<00:02:48.220> really<00:02:49.030> smart<00:02:49.540> people

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
Toyota engineers are really smart people

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.979 
Toyota engineers are really smart people
so<00:02:50.500> decided<00:02:50.889> to<00:02:51.040> put<00:02:51.730> a<00:02:51.760> holding<00:02:52.239> ring<00:02:52.420> around

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
so decided to put a holding ring around

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.720 
so decided to put a holding ring around
this<00:02:53.260> area<00:02:53.500> here<00:02:54.299> see<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:56.470> holds<00:02:56.950> the<00:02:57.040> pin<00:02:57.220> to

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
this area here see that holds the pin to

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.270 
this area here see that holds the pin to
the<00:02:57.760> holding<00:02:58.389> part<00:02:58.659> in<00:02:59.019> there<00:02:59.230> so<00:02:59.889> we<00:03:00.250> just

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
the holding part in there so we just

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.610 
the holding part in there so we just
have<00:03:00.549> to<00:03:00.700> get<00:03:00.909> our<00:03:01.150> pliers<00:03:01.480> and<00:03:01.750> then<00:03:02.139> remove

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
have to get our pliers and then remove

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.119 
have to get our pliers and then remove
this<00:03:03.010> ring<00:03:04.859> so<00:03:05.859> we<00:03:06.359> get<00:03:07.359> our<00:03:07.599> pliers<00:03:08.129> and

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
this ring so we get our pliers and

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:18.589 
this ring so we get our pliers and
remove<00:03:09.760> this<00:03:10.480> bolt<00:03:10.540> this<00:03:11.430> ring<00:03:12.430> on<00:03:12.939> the<00:03:13.540> bottom

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:27.610 

then<00:03:20.400> remove<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.549> Rings

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:34.160 

the<00:03:28.620> holding<00:03:28.980> our<00:03:29.370> part<00:03:32.810> then<00:03:33.810> there<00:03:33.989> will<00:03:34.140> be

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
the holding our part then there will be

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.369 
the holding our part then there will be
two<00:03:34.950> more<00:03:35.099> rings<00:03:36.799> so<00:03:37.799> you<00:03:37.859> see<00:03:38.069> I<00:03:38.340> am<00:03:38.640> using

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:39.379 
two more rings so you see I am using

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:41.780 
two more rings so you see I am using
copper<00:03:40.379> rings<00:03:40.590> that<00:03:40.950> were<00:03:41.219> left<00:03:41.489> over<00:03:41.670> from

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
copper rings that were left over from

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.339 
copper rings that were left over from
the<00:03:43.129> from<00:03:44.129> the<00:03:44.250> brake<00:03:44.430> line<00:03:44.909> repair<00:03:45.299> these<00:03:46.170> are

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
the from the brake line repair these are

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.410 
the from the brake line repair these are
just<00:03:46.590> you<00:03:47.069> can<00:03:47.220> look<00:03:47.609> for<00:03:47.790> this<00:03:47.939> at<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.150> party

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
just you can look for this at the party

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.729 
just you can look for this at the party
start<00:03:48.659> look<00:03:48.870> for<00:03:49.109> the<00:03:49.620> brake<00:03:49.950> line<00:03:50.189> rings<00:03:51.739> and

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
start look for the brake line rings and

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.390 
start look for the brake line rings and
then<00:03:53.639> we<00:03:54.510> will<00:03:54.689> be<00:03:54.900> using<00:03:55.349> these<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:55.829> shim<00:03:56.129> the

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
then we will be using these to shim the

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.949 
then we will be using these to shim the
the<00:03:57.329> part<00:03:57.980> so<00:03:58.980> I<00:03:59.220> insert<00:03:59.639> the<00:04:00.180> ring<00:04:02.959> the

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
the part so I insert the ring the

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:15.570 
the part so I insert the ring the
pivoting<00:04:04.680> part

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:24.630 

one<00:04:16.150> of<00:04:16.269> the<00:04:16.390> older<00:04:16.660> rings<00:04:22.380> smaller<00:04:23.640> inner

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
one of the older rings smaller inner

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.360 
one of the older rings smaller inner
ring<00:04:24.850> and<00:04:27.060> then<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.090> holding<00:04:28.740> ring<00:04:29.740> that

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
ring and then the holding ring that

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.730 
ring and then the holding ring that
works<00:04:30.880> as<00:04:31.090> a<00:04:31.120> pin<00:04:33.660> this<00:04:34.660> does<00:04:34.930> not<00:04:35.110> need<00:04:35.380> to<00:04:35.590> be

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
works as a pin this does not need to be

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
works as a pin this does not need to be
too<00:04:36.340> tight<00:04:36.550> you<00:04:36.880> have<00:04:37.060> to<00:04:37.270> the<00:04:38.200> the<00:04:38.760> mechanism

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
too tight you have to the the mechanism

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.410 
too tight you have to the the mechanism
has<00:04:40.180> to<00:04:40.210> slide<00:04:40.660> effortlessly<00:04:41.700> but<00:04:42.700> with<00:04:43.390> a

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
has to slide effortlessly but with a

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:49.700 
has to slide effortlessly but with a
slight<00:04:43.900> spring<00:04:44.830> springy<00:04:46.710> action<00:04:47.710> because

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
slight spring springy action because

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.220 
slight spring springy action because
these<00:04:50.710> rings<00:04:51.070> are<00:04:51.520> not<00:04:51.760> flat<00:04:52.060> these<00:04:52.720> rings<00:04:53.020> are

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
these rings are not flat these rings are

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.740 
these rings are not flat these rings are
meant<00:04:53.440> to<00:04:53.560> be<00:04:53.800> slightly<00:04:54.520> bent<00:04:54.940> so<00:04:55.240> that

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
meant to be slightly bent so that

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.410 
meant to be slightly bent so that
whenever<00:04:56.260> you<00:04:56.590> push<00:04:56.950> the<00:04:57.370> ring<00:04:57.760> in<00:04:57.910> there<00:04:58.090> it

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
whenever you push the ring in there it

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.420 
whenever you push the ring in there it
makes<00:04:59.230> a<00:04:59.380> certain<00:04:59.610> spring<00:05:00.610> action<00:05:02.250> so<00:05:03.250> it's

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
makes a certain spring action so it's

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.760 
makes a certain spring action so it's
just<00:05:03.550> a<00:05:03.700> matter<00:05:03.730> of<00:05:03.970> putting<00:05:04.780> this<00:05:05.020> back<00:05:05.620> in

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
just a matter of putting this back in

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.480 
just a matter of putting this back in
the<00:05:05.860> car<00:05:06.040> we<00:05:06.630> insert<00:05:07.630> two<00:05:08.110> volts<00:05:08.560> and<00:05:08.980> you're

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
the car we insert two volts and you're

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:10.050 
the car we insert two volts and you're
good<00:05:09.640> to<00:05:09.730> go

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
good to go

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.000 
good to go
the<00:05:10.450> important<00:05:10.840> things<00:05:11.020> you<00:05:11.140> have<00:05:11.320> to<00:05:11.380> have<00:05:11.890> in

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
the important things you have to have in

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.470 
the important things you have to have in
mind<00:05:12.040> is<00:05:12.430> that<00:05:12.810> if<00:05:13.810> you<00:05:14.310> set<00:05:15.310> the<00:05:15.790> the<00:05:15.820> wiper

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
mind is that if you set the the wiper

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:22.020 
mind is that if you set the the wiper
arm<00:05:17.220> too<00:05:18.220> low<00:05:19.890> the<00:05:20.890> wiper<00:05:21.100> blade<00:05:21.460> will<00:05:21.760> hit

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
arm too low the wiper blade will hit

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.230 
arm too low the wiper blade will hit
against<00:05:22.870> this<00:05:22.960> protective<00:05:23.500> shroud<00:05:23.710> of<00:05:24.040> the<00:05:24.760> of
