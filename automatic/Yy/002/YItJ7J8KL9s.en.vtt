00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.590
 I really like this car all over the place. 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.680
 The story that he has this guy is the 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.470
 I saw that car there. 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.090
 You can buy it by buying it. 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.600
 can get a 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.640
 during the game okay it's not very simple 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.960
 Finding you, it was not simple, I got it. 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.760
 this car 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.120
 I searched a lot and stayed some 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:00.379
 hours ago to get one managed 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.420
 111 and it was difficult was not simple 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.640
 even then if you guys do not know if you 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.720
 You have money left over, it costs you 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.850
 twenty thousand is cheap is worth more 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.430
 I buy every day they see the 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.850
 customizing what's going on 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:20.030
 And as you can see, this is the car. 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.899
 of the diesel vin the torito in the fast and 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.380
 furious 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:27.409
 one is my friend and he himself this vehicle 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.090
 there is the vehicle that is the car of 10 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.369
 I remember that for seconds. 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.149
 he said that he had a car of 10 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.000
 seconds 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:37.460
 and it was that car there that is the car that 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.740
 he is in the case of a dispute with Paul 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.950
 Kenny the actor who recently died a 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.649
 car accident there is the last race of the 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.100
 game play there getting the last thing 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:52.670
 and with that he ends up flipping over 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.049
 with the car and the paul giving the car 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.159
 orange for him 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:00.950
 Good, I really liked having this car. 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.990
 This car in the garage that I've been waiting for is me. 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.229
 I really like cars like that. 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.600
 but that calls the galley who does not 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.890
 know the newest guys and I found 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.330
 cool, have you 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.010
 I left some of the story behind the 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.870
 vehicle for you what I think of 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.060
 in a way it can even be an easter egg 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.430
 the game is not that game has so much 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.730
 reference so much why not 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.270
 be a reference to the torito's car in the 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.550
 fast and furious 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.310

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.810
 street and this is it people if you liked it
