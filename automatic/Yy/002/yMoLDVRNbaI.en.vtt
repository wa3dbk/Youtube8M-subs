00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.780
 composed by rafael cañete and I've had 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.519
 have to take into account on the one hand a 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.989
 music that is adapted to the 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:52.489
 instruments are you that were of 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.800
 conservatory and they have different 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.690
 levels and on the other hand think about that 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.610
 they were very easy melodies because 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.040
 children who have learned the songs do not 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.390
 they are in conservatory to the majority but 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.399
 this is just the result of a 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.770
 ambitious project led by Pedro 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:09.080

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.360
 this of music education and integrate 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.250
 theory and practice is his motto in his 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.860
 school does not need to be a virtuoso 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.530

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.100

 so that this is a prelude to the 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.350
 life why I say many times that the 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.580
 music is not a teaching that serves 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.890
 only to play an instrument but 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.870
 with life-long teaching to talk in 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.460
