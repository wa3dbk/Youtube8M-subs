00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.779
 hello there is a package in front of you 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.500
 from china which i just took with 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.740
 mail is such a flat envelope is very 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.170
 well securely packed this parcel i 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.990
 very much waited and must admit 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.640
 she came pretty quickly somewhere for 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.430
 20 days maybe even less 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.289
 the fact is that I make another order and 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.380
 it is quite possible that this is not something that I 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:32.099
 I think but judging by the form it seems to me that 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.500
 it 's still a phone case order 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.850
 I saw on the site aliexpress and spent 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.309
 about 3 dollars 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:48.320
 here too is actually 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:55.520
 Now we will check it carefully. 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:58.190
 would not cut off anything extra worthy and 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:03.090
 here it is the moment of truth 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:06.299
 Yes, it is he case finally here such 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.990
 stylish fashionable youth with a tiger everything 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:13.110
 as i wanted the case is made of plastic 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.180
 quite pleasant to the touch even better 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.409
 than i thought since it turned out to be 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.540
 matte and slightly grooved and now 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.310
 heartbreaking story about why i 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:29.250
 I decided to order a cover here I think here 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.619
 I don't even need to say anything for a long time 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.689
 delayed with the purchase of the case because 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.049
 I really like the flickering back 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.909
 flip phone and one day 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.310
 it so happened that he vibrated 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.860
 and fell from the table to the floor I want to note that 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.869
 For me this is the first time since I am a technician. 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.470
 I am very neat and I don’t even 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.549
 I thought that this could happen to me 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.770
 speak out everyone learns on his 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.079
 mistakes 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.979
 very sad because the phone is not there 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.530
 same half a year 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.770
 glass change stew apiary is half 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.290
 the cost of the phone and you can say that 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.860
 this incident served me so 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.920
 tell me to push 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.060
 finally ordered a case very 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.520
 sad story 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.530
 I hope that maybe she will 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.560
 example of someone and may even save 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.720
 the life of something phones people try 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.290
 buy them right after purchase 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.470
 the phone then it will be quite long 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.870
 have a static view but what 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.510
 This cover is in principle 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.700
 everything suits me because of its matte 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.269
 the surface of the phone has become much better 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.580
 lie in your hand case fits well already 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.580
 as if merged with the phone I didn’t even 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.610
 I know how to remove it subscribe to my 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.780
