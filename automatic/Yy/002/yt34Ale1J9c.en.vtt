00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:17.019 
hi this is russ bucher from control my

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:18.720 
hi this is russ bucher from control my
nikon<00:00:17.409> and<00:00:17.589> in<00:00:17.949> this<00:00:18.039> video<00:00:18.249> we're<00:00:18.579> going<00:00:18.669> to

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:18.730 
nikon and in this video we're going to

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.429 
nikon and in this video we're going to
take<00:00:18.939> a<00:00:18.999> look<00:00:19.240> at<00:00:19.419> how<00:00:19.599> we<00:00:19.659> can<00:00:19.839> create<00:00:20.169> a

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:20.439 
take a look at how we can create a

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.489 
take a look at how we can create a
series<00:00:20.919> of<00:00:21.099> images<00:00:21.550> of<00:00:22.029> varying<00:00:22.390> exposure<00:00:22.839> so

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:23.499 
series of images of varying exposure so

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:26.419 
series of images of varying exposure so
that<00:00:23.679> you<00:00:23.890> can<00:00:24.069> later<00:00:24.279> create<00:00:24.759> an<00:00:24.970> HDR<00:00:25.539> image

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:26.429 
that you can later create an HDR image

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.399 
that you can later create an HDR image
now<00:00:27.429> I<00:00:27.460> have<00:00:27.880> control<00:00:28.300> my<00:00:28.509> nikon<00:00:28.839> version<00:00:29.199> for

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:29.409 
now I have control my nikon version for

my d7000 I've got the image browser ups
will<00:00:34.539> take<00:00:34.690> a<00:00:34.719> look<00:00:34.930> at<00:00:35.019> the<00:00:35.140> images<00:00:35.530> as

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
will take a look at the images as

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.029 
will take a look at the images as
they're<00:00:36.340> being<00:00:36.519> captured<00:00:36.820> and<00:00:37.739> I'll<00:00:38.739> go<00:00:38.890> up<00:00:38.949> to

00:00:39.029 --> 00:00:39.039 
they're being captured and I'll go up to

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.669 
they're being captured and I'll go up to
the<00:00:39.160> trigger<00:00:39.399> menu<00:00:39.820> and<00:00:40.000> to<00:00:40.780> bracketing<00:00:41.530> and

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.439 
here's the bracketing window right here
I'm<00:00:43.690> just<00:00:43.750> going<00:00:43.929> to<00:00:44.050> set<00:00:44.320> it<00:00:44.469> right<00:00:44.500> here<00:00:45.449> now

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
I'm just going to set it right here now

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:49.410 
I'm just going to set it right here now
when<00:00:46.960> we<00:00:46.989> bracket<00:00:47.620> we<00:00:47.769> can<00:00:47.980> use<00:00:48.250> these<00:00:48.940> three

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
when we bracket we can use these three

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.840 
when we bracket we can use these three
options<00:00:49.839> up<00:00:49.989> top<00:00:50.230> we<00:00:50.500> can<00:00:50.769> take<00:00:51.309> a<00:00:51.339> series<00:00:51.820> of

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
options up top we can take a series of

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.180 
options up top we can take a series of
images<00:00:52.120> with<00:00:52.570> differing<00:00:52.989> shutter<00:00:53.469> speeds<00:00:53.859> and

images with differing shutter speeds and

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.069 
images with differing shutter speeds and
you<00:00:54.249> have<00:00:54.399> to<00:00:54.519> be<00:00:54.609> in<00:00:54.699> shutter<00:00:55.269> or<00:00:55.359> manual<00:00:55.899> mode

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
you have to be in shutter or manual mode

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.649 
you have to be in shutter or manual mode
for<00:00:56.320> that<00:00:56.440> or<00:00:57.370> at<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:57.789> bottom<00:00:58.149> here<00:00:58.390> you<00:00:58.449> can

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:58.659 
for that or at the bottom here you can

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.270 
for that or at the bottom here you can
have<00:00:58.780> a<00:00:59.460> series<00:01:00.460> of<00:01:00.489> images<00:01:00.940> of<00:01:01.329> variable

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
have a series of images of variable

exposure compensation need to be in
aperture<00:01:05.380> mode<00:01:05.740> for<00:01:06.010> that<00:01:06.160> and<00:01:07.110> leave<00:01:08.110> you

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.230 
aperture mode for that and leave you

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.810 
aperture mode for that and leave you
threw<00:01:08.440> in<00:01:08.590> a<00:01:08.710> different<00:01:09.100> feature<00:01:09.280> here<00:01:09.670> where

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
threw in a different feature here where

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.460 
threw in a different feature here where
you<00:01:09.910> can<00:01:10.000> take<00:01:10.210> a<00:01:10.240> series<00:01:10.720> of<00:01:10.750> images<00:01:11.050> and

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
you can take a series of images and

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.650 
you can take a series of images and
adjust<00:01:11.980> the<00:01:12.070> aperture<00:01:12.340> this<00:01:13.000> of<00:01:13.150> course<00:01:13.180> would

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
adjust the aperture this of course would

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.840 
adjust the aperture this of course would
change<00:01:13.990> the<00:01:14.290> exposure<00:01:14.620> but<00:01:14.980> also<00:01:15.220> changes<00:01:15.820> the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
change the exposure but also changes the

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.270 
change the exposure but also changes the
depth<00:01:16.150> of<00:01:16.270> field<00:01:16.540> so<00:01:17.110> you<00:01:17.200> can<00:01:17.410> use<00:01:17.650> that<00:01:17.830> to<00:01:17.890> do

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
depth of field so you can use that to do

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.790 
depth of field so you can use that to do
some<00:01:18.610> different<00:01:19.210> kind<00:01:19.810> of<00:01:20.020> effects<00:01:20.470> on<00:01:20.680> your

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
some different kind of effects on your

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.940 
some different kind of effects on your
final<00:01:21.220> image<00:01:21.780> let's<00:01:22.780> give<00:01:22.990> this<00:01:23.140> first<00:01:23.440> option

give<00:01:58.690> these<00:01:58.840> a<00:01:58.900> try<00:01:59.020> now<00:01:59.380> to<00:01:59.410> start<00:01:59.800> we<00:01:59.950> just

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
give these a try now to start we just

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.640 
give these a try now to start we just
press<00:02:00.310> the<00:02:00.490> start<00:02:00.760> button<00:02:00.820> and<00:02:01.270> in<00:02:02.140> any<00:02:02.380> time

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
press the start button and in any time

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.410 
press the start button and in any time
you<00:02:02.830> could<00:02:02.980> click<00:02:03.190> on<00:02:03.340> stop<00:02:03.610> kieriell<00:02:04.000> cancel

you could click on stop kieriell cancel

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.150 
you could click on stop kieriell cancel
it<00:02:04.540> now<00:02:05.200> you<00:02:05.290> can<00:02:05.410> see<00:02:05.560> it<00:02:05.650> created<00:02:06.040> this

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
it now you can see it created this

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.730 
it now you can see it created this
folder<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:06.790> here's<00:02:07.360> our<00:02:07.480> three<00:02:07.750> images<00:02:08.019> and

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
folder and here's our three images and

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.090 
folder and here's our three images and
we<00:02:08.860> started<00:02:09.250> off<00:02:09.369> of<00:02:09.610> 121<00:02:09.970> to<00:02:10.780> 140<00:02:11.320> than<00:02:11.470> 180<00:02:11.860> so

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
we started off of 121 to 140 than 180 so

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.440 
we started off of 121 to 140 than 180 so
here's<00:02:12.520> our<00:02:12.700> 120

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
here's our 120

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.410 
here's our 120
look<00:02:13.629> at<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.840> metadata<00:02:14.800> 120<00:02:16.080> 140<00:02:17.080> and<00:02:18.209> 180<00:02:19.209> and

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
look at the metadata 120 140 and 180 and

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.000 
look at the metadata 120 140 and 180 and
they<00:02:19.510> progressively<00:02:19.989> got<00:02:20.230> darker<00:02:20.620> so<00:02:20.800> now<00:02:20.950> you

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
they progressively got darker so now you

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.500 
they progressively got darker so now you
can<00:02:21.250> go<00:02:21.340> into<00:02:21.459> some<00:02:21.700> third-party<00:02:21.970> software

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
can go into some third-party software

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.470 
can go into some third-party software
and<00:02:23.370> combine<00:02:24.370> these<00:02:24.580> three<00:02:24.849> images<00:02:25.090> to

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
and combine these three images to

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.830 
and combine these three images to
produce<00:02:25.690> an<00:02:26.050> HDR<00:02:26.860> image<00:02:27.459> and<00:02:28.390> control<00:02:28.780> my

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
produce an HDR image and control my

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
create an HDR image you need to use

create an HDR image you need to use
external<00:02:32.500> software<00:02:32.830> for<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:34.050> let's<00:02:35.050> add

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
external software for that let's add

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.860 
external software for that let's add
some<00:02:35.319> more<00:02:35.769> let's<00:02:36.190> say<00:02:36.280> we<00:02:36.430> also<00:02:36.580> want<00:02:36.940> a<00:02:37.090> 125

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
some more let's say we also want a 125

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.620 
some more let's say we also want a 125
and<00:02:38.250> we'll<00:02:39.250> go<00:02:39.370> a<00:02:39.400> little<00:02:39.580> darker<00:02:39.849> last<00:02:40.420> ones

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
and we'll go a little darker last ones

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.869 
and we'll go a little darker last ones
120<00:02:41.200> we'll<00:02:41.319> go<00:02:41.410> 110<00:02:41.950> except<00:02:42.489> i'll<00:02:42.610> bring<00:02:42.730> my

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
120 we'll go 110 except i'll bring my

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.870 
120 we'll go 110 except i'll bring my
110<00:02:43.360> up<00:02:43.510> here<00:02:45.690> okay<00:02:46.690> this<00:02:46.810> time<00:02:46.959> I<00:02:47.019> do<00:02:47.170> five

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
110 up here okay this time I do five

00:02:47.880 --> 00:03:01.229 
110 up here okay this time I do five
let's<00:02:48.880> take<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.120> shot<00:02:49.390> I<00:02:59.430> can<00:03:00.430> see<00:03:00.700> that<00:03:01.030> this

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
let's take a shot I can see that this

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.059 
let's take a shot I can see that this
brought<00:03:01.690> us<00:03:01.870> five<00:03:02.110> images<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.709> first<00:03:02.920> one

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
brought us five images the first one

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.550 
brought us five images the first one
starting<00:03:03.400> 110<00:03:03.910> last<00:03:04.360> one<00:03:04.599> going<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:05.049> 125

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
starting 110 last one going to 125

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.080 
starting 110 last one going to 125
dislike<00:03:06.040> we<00:03:06.160> had<00:03:06.280> set<00:03:06.519> it<00:03:06.640> up<00:03:06.760> here

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
dislike we had set it up here

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.759 
dislike we had set it up here
progressively<00:03:07.840> going<00:03:08.260> from<00:03:08.440> lighter<00:03:08.680> to

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
progressively going from lighter to

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.000 
progressively going from lighter to
darker<00:03:09.599> now<00:03:10.599> you<00:03:10.660> can<00:03:10.900> look<00:03:11.079> at<00:03:11.349> the<00:03:11.650> histogram

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
darker now you can look at the histogram

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.530 
darker now you can look at the histogram
here<00:03:12.220> to<00:03:12.610> ensure<00:03:12.700> that<00:03:12.970> you<00:03:13.090> have<00:03:13.120> enough

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
here to ensure that you have enough

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.110 
here to ensure that you have enough
coverage<00:03:13.780> so<00:03:14.560> for<00:03:14.829> example<00:03:14.890> on<00:03:15.459> this<00:03:15.700> one<00:03:15.940> you

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
coverage so for example on this one you

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.699 
coverage so for example on this one you
want<00:03:16.299> to<00:03:16.360> make<00:03:16.480> sure<00:03:16.510> on<00:03:16.959> your<00:03:17.079> lightest<00:03:17.380> image

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
want to make sure on your lightest image

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.080 
want to make sure on your lightest image
that<00:03:17.889> you<00:03:17.980> don't<00:03:18.160> have<00:03:18.370> anything<00:03:18.700> that<00:03:19.060> is

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
that you don't have anything that is

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.180 
that you don't have anything that is
completely<00:03:19.630> blown<00:03:19.989> out<00:03:20.139> black<00:03:20.590> so<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.100> you

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
completely blown out black so and you

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.059 
completely blown out black so and you
don't<00:03:21.220> so<00:03:21.639> that's<00:03:21.819> a<00:03:21.970> good<00:03:22.239> start<00:03:22.950> you<00:03:23.950> have

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
don't so that's a good start you have

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.420 
don't so that's a good start you have
nothing<00:03:24.310> here<00:03:25.170> so<00:03:26.170> as<00:03:26.319> we<00:03:26.470> progress<00:03:26.680> upwards

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
nothing here so as we progress upwards

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.160 
nothing here so as we progress upwards
who<00:03:27.549> want<00:03:27.730> to<00:03:27.850> look<00:03:27.970> at<00:03:28.090> your<00:03:28.239> last<00:03:28.420> image<00:03:28.930> and

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
who want to look at your last image and

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.110 
who want to look at your last image and
make<00:03:29.200> sure<00:03:29.709> you<00:03:29.950> have<00:03:30.130> nothing<00:03:30.340> blown<00:03:30.940> out

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
make sure you have nothing blown out

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.140 
make sure you have nothing blown out
white<00:03:31.480> and<00:03:31.780> you<00:03:32.109> have<00:03:32.410> something<00:03:33.010> just<00:03:33.519> touch

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
white and you have something just touch

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.150 
white and you have something just touch
blown<00:03:34.510> out<00:03:34.660> late<00:03:34.840> it's<00:03:35.049> probably<00:03:35.290> one<00:03:35.590> pixel

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
blown out late it's probably one pixel

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.309 
blown out late it's probably one pixel
right<00:03:36.400> in<00:03:36.519> the<00:03:36.639> center<00:03:37.000> here<00:03:37.049> that<00:03:38.049> should<00:03:38.230> be

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
right in the center here that should be

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.770 
right in the center here that should be
okay<00:03:38.620> this<00:03:38.980> is<00:03:39.130> really<00:03:39.340> just<00:03:39.700> a<00:03:40.359> reflection

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
okay this is really just a reflection

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.750 
okay this is really just a reflection
