to<00:03:15.819> a<00:03:15.849> next<00:03:16.180> level<00:03:16.390> I<00:03:16.720> have<00:03:16.870> played<00:03:17.140> the

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
to a next level I have played the

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.039 
to a next level I have played the
next-gen<00:03:17.709> version<00:03:18.489> of<00:03:18.609> fifa<00:03:19.060> 14<00:03:19.420> and<00:03:19.840> it<00:03:19.930> is

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
next-gen version of fifa 14 and it is

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.690 
next-gen version of fifa 14 and it is
brilliant<00:03:20.320> a<00:03:20.650> lot<00:03:20.920> actually<00:03:21.280> it's<00:03:21.609> quite

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
brilliant a lot actually it's quite

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.960 
brilliant a lot actually it's quite
similar<00:03:22.060> to<00:03:22.180> this<00:03:22.390> and<00:03:22.660> I<00:03:23.609> think<00:03:24.609> that's<00:03:24.820> going

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
similar to this and I think that's going

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.789 
similar to this and I think that's going
to<00:03:25.060> be<00:03:25.180> a<00:03:25.209> hard<00:03:25.480> change<00:03:25.870> as<00:03:26.079> well<00:03:26.230> making<00:03:26.470> that

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
to be a hard change as well making that

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.180 
to be a hard change as well making that
change<00:03:27.040> over<00:03:28.000> from<00:03:28.030> FIFA<00:03:28.720> next<00:03:29.680> FIFA

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
change over from FIFA next FIFA

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.520 
change over from FIFA next FIFA
current-gen<00:03:30.720> orbiter<00:03:31.720> next-gen<00:03:32.170> that'd<00:03:32.440> be

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
current-gen orbiter next-gen that'd be

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.870 
current-gen orbiter next-gen that'd be
very<00:03:33.010> very<00:03:33.579> annoying<00:03:35.400> but<00:03:36.400> yeah<00:03:36.579> we're<00:03:36.819> all
