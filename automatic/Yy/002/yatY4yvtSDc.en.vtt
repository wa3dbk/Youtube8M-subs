hello<00:00:04.440> everyone<00:00:04.830> one<00:00:05.819> of<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.060> first<00:00:06.270> things<00:00:06.479> I

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:06.599 
hello everyone one of the first things I

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:08.390 
hello everyone one of the first things I
teach<00:00:06.660> my<00:00:07.019> students<00:00:07.470> or<00:00:07.649> tell<00:00:07.859> my<00:00:08.010> students

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
teach my students or tell my students

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.339 
teach my students or tell my students
whenever<00:00:08.849> I<00:00:08.940> meet<00:00:09.450> them<00:00:09.690> for<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:09.990> first<00:00:10.080> time

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
whenever I meet them for the first time

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.730 
whenever I meet them for the first time
is<00:00:10.950> that<00:00:11.160> math<00:00:11.370> is<00:00:11.880> everywhere<00:00:12.290> okay<00:00:13.290> it's<00:00:13.620> in

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
is that math is everywhere okay it's in

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.250 
is that math is everywhere okay it's in
the<00:00:13.830> air<00:00:13.950> we<00:00:14.130> breathe<00:00:14.599> it's<00:00:15.599> in<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.930> stores

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
the air we breathe it's in the stores

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.890 
the air we breathe it's in the stores
whenever<00:00:16.800> we<00:00:16.949> go<00:00:17.070> buy<00:00:17.279> things<00:00:17.420> it's<00:00:18.420> even<00:00:18.689> in

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
whenever we go buy things it's even in

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.720 
whenever we go buy things it's even in
works<00:00:19.169> of<00:00:19.349> art<00:00:19.679> whenever<00:00:20.189> we<00:00:20.339> go<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.519> the

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
works of art whenever we go to the

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.950 
works of art whenever we go to the
museums<00:00:21.380> now<00:00:22.380> my<00:00:22.949> job<00:00:22.980> as<00:00:23.519> an<00:00:23.640> educator<00:00:23.789> is<00:00:24.419> to

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
museums now my job as an educator is to

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.919 
museums now my job as an educator is to
teach<00:00:25.140> my<00:00:25.319> students<00:00:25.739> how<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.159> recognize<00:00:26.929> when

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:27.929 
teach my students how to recognize when

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.819 
teach my students how to recognize when
math<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.349> applied<00:00:28.649> it's<00:00:29.640> not<00:00:29.880> easy<00:00:30.179> but<00:00:31.019> it's

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:31.829 
math is applied it's not easy but it's

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:33.460 
math is applied it's not easy but it's
one<00:00:31.979> of<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.130> things<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.460> we<00:00:32.550> have<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.880> do<00:00:33.000> as

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
one of the things that we have to do as

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.000 
one of the things that we have to do as
students<00:00:34.470> and<00:00:34.620> educators<00:00:35.359> okay<00:00:36.800> so<00:00:37.800> that's

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
students and educators okay so that's

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.599 
students and educators okay so that's
what<00:00:38.160> I'm<00:00:38.250> going<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.519> do<00:00:38.640> today<00:00:38.820> I'm<00:00:39.660> going<00:00:40.199> to

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.720 
teach you how math and art are
interrelated<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:46.579> actually<00:00:47.579> more

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
interrelated and actually more

interrelated and actually more
specifically<00:00:48.300> I'm<00:00:48.839> going<00:00:48.929> to<00:00:49.109> teach<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.289> how

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
specifically I'm going to teach you how

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.790 
specifically I'm going to teach you how
to<00:00:49.710> create<00:00:50.070> your<00:00:50.190> own<00:00:50.579> work<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.570> art<00:00:51.800> using

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
to create your own work of art using

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.939 
to create your own work of art using
math<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.879> work<00:00:54.089> of<00:00:54.179> art<00:00:54.269> is<00:00:54.420> called

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
math and this work of art is called

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.560 
math and this work of art is called
tessellations<00:00:55.949> but<00:00:56.789> before<00:00:57.089> we<00:00:57.179> get<00:00:57.329> into

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
tessellations but before we get into

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.419 
tessellations but before we get into
that<00:00:57.620> we<00:00:58.620> have<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.829> do<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> little<00:00:59.160> bit<00:00:59.339> of

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
that we have to do a little bit of

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:02.989 
that we have to do a little bit of
reviewing<00:00:59.760> what<00:01:00.440> we<00:01:01.440> need<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.710> review<00:01:02.129> are<00:01:02.519> the

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:02.999 
reviewing what we need to review are the

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:04.369 
reviewing what we need to review are the
different<00:01:03.359> movements<00:01:03.749> that<00:01:03.870> we<00:01:03.989> have<00:01:04.199> in

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
different movements that we have in

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.880 
different movements that we have in
geometry<00:01:04.650> namely<00:01:05.360> transformations<00:01:06.360> a

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
geometry namely transformations a

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.020 
geometry namely transformations a
transformation<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.280> change<00:01:08.730> in<00:01:08.880> a

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
transformation is the change in a

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.620 
transformation is the change in a
geometric<00:01:09.270> figures<00:01:09.900> position<00:01:10.440> shape<00:01:11.040> or<00:01:11.340> size

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.850 
geometric figures position shape or size
here<00:01:12.630> are<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.810> couple<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:13.140> examples<00:01:13.290> of

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
here are a couple of examples of

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.530 
here are a couple of examples of
transformations<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.550> you<00:01:14.760> will<00:01:15.030> use<00:01:15.210> today

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
transformations that you will use today

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.400 
transformations that you will use today
the<00:01:16.470> first<00:01:16.740> one<00:01:16.800> is<00:01:16.980> called<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.370> translation<00:01:18.120> a

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
the first one is called a translation a

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.570 
the first one is called a translation a
translation<00:01:19.410> is<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.620> transformation<00:01:20.430> that

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
translation is a transformation that

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.730 
translation is a transformation that
moves<00:01:20.820> points<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.420> lines<00:01:21.660> the<00:01:22.020> same<00:01:22.260> distance

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
moves points and lines the same distance

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.460 
moves points and lines the same distance
and<00:01:22.980> in<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.370> same<00:01:23.550> direction<00:01:24.200> let's<00:01:25.200> look<00:01:25.350> at

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
and in the same direction let's look at

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.880 
and in the same direction let's look at
an<00:01:26.070> example<00:01:26.780> here<00:01:27.780> we<00:01:27.930> have<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.140> blue<00:01:28.560> triangle

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
an example here we have a blue triangle

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.430 
an example here we have a blue triangle
where<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.550> moves<00:01:29.940> to<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> different<00:01:30.960> position

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
where it moves to a different position

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.040 
where it moves to a different position
that's<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.250> translation<00:01:32.910> all<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.600> points<00:01:33.960> in

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
that's a translation all the points in

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.490 
that's a translation all the points in
lines<00:01:34.320> move<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:34.740> different<00:01:35.010> location<00:01:36.500> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
lines move in different location the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.780 
lines move in different location the
other<00:01:37.530> transformation<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.550> called<00:01:38.730> a

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
other transformation is called a

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.790 
other transformation is called a
rotation<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.540> rotation<00:01:39.690> is<00:01:40.320> when<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> figure

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
rotation a rotation is when a figure

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.160 
rotation a rotation is when a figure
point<00:01:41.610> or<00:01:41.850> line<00:01:41.880> moves<00:01:42.570> about<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.870> specific

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
point or line moves about a specific

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.950 
point or line moves about a specific
point<00:01:44.030> let's<00:01:45.030> look<00:01:45.210> at<00:01:45.330> an<00:01:45.450> example

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
point let's look at an example

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.680 
point let's look at an example
using<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.620> same<00:01:46.830> blue<00:01:46.980> triangle<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:48.420> blue

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
using the same blue triangle that blue

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.170 
using the same blue triangle that blue
triangle<00:01:49.260> rotates<00:01:49.800> about<00:01:50.010> a<00:01:50.400> specific<00:01:50.970> point

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
triangle rotates about a specific point

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.480 
triangle rotates about a specific point
where<00:01:51.450> all<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.660> lines<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.230> points<00:01:52.490> rotate

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
where all the lines and points rotate

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.450 
where all the lines and points rotate
about<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.210> same<00:01:54.420> direction

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
about in the same direction

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.490 
about in the same direction
now<00:01:57.460> we<00:01:57.520> can<00:01:57.760> start<00:01:58.030> talking<00:01:58.210> about

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
now we can start talking about

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.320 
now we can start talking about
tessellations<00:01:59.500> a<00:02:00.120> tessellation<00:02:01.120> is<00:02:01.240> a

and<00:03:07.510> a<00:03:07.540> half<00:03:07.630> inches<00:03:08.040> we<00:03:09.040> start<00:03:09.400> at<00:03:09.640> one<00:03:09.880> corner

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910

of<00:03:10.330> one<00:03:10.690> side<00:03:10.989> and<00:03:11.350> we<00:03:11.560> draw<00:03:11.830> any<00:03:12.420> shape<00:03:13.420> of

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
of one side and we draw any shape of

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.199 
of one side and we draw any shape of
line<00:03:14.080> or<00:03:14.380> any<00:03:14.530> line<00:03:14.860> that<00:03:15.070> we<00:03:15.190> want<00:03:15.430> to<00:03:16.090> the

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
line or any line that we want to the

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
other corner of that same side what

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.940 
other corner of that same side what
we're<00:03:19.090> trying<00:03:19.330> to<00:03:19.480> do<00:03:19.720> is<00:03:19.989> to<00:03:20.290> create<00:03:20.500> a

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
we're trying to do is to create a

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.759 
we're trying to do is to create a
template<00:03:21.459> so<00:03:21.700> that<00:03:21.730> we<00:03:22.060> can<00:03:22.330> copy<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.530> same

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
template so that we can copy the same

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.720 
template so that we can copy the same
figure<00:03:24.220> over<00:03:24.700> and<00:03:24.940> over<00:03:25.360> and<00:03:25.570> over<00:03:25.780> again

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
figure over and over and over again

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.240 
figure over and over and over again
now<00:03:27.730> it<00:03:27.910> doesn't<00:03:28.120> matter<00:03:28.620> what<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.800> shape<00:03:29.830> of

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
now it doesn't matter what the shape of

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.759 
now it doesn't matter what the shape of
the<00:03:30.400> line<00:03:30.640> is<00:03:30.910> you<00:03:31.510> just<00:03:31.720> want<00:03:31.930> to<00:03:32.019> do<00:03:32.519> whatever

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
the line is you just want to do whatever

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.420 
the line is you just want to do whatever
now<00:03:35.769> it's<00:03:36.010> time<00:03:36.400> to<00:03:36.670> cut<00:03:37.239> out<00:03:37.420> our<00:03:37.780> shape<00:03:38.430> we

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
now it's time to cut out our shape we

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.640 
now it's time to cut out our shape we
cut<00:03:39.670> out<00:03:39.820> the<00:03:39.850> shape<00:03:40.180> along<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:40.720> line<00:03:40.930> to<00:03:41.530> the

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
cut out the shape along the line to the

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.910 
cut out the shape along the line to the
best<00:03:41.860> that<00:03:42.310> we<00:03:42.459> can<00:03:43.410> now<00:03:44.410> this<00:03:44.560> is<00:03:44.739> where

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
best that we can now this is where

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.850 
best that we can now this is where
geometry<00:03:45.580> comes<00:03:45.820> into<00:03:46.060> play<00:03:46.299> we<00:03:47.290> take<00:03:47.560> the

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
geometry comes into play we take the

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.940 
geometry comes into play we take the
side<00:03:48.280> that<00:03:48.519> we<00:03:48.670> cut<00:03:48.970> out<00:03:49.000> and<00:03:49.450> we<00:03:50.230> translate<00:03:50.920> it

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
side that we cut out and we translate it

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.580 
side that we cut out and we translate it
to<00:03:51.070> the<00:03:51.190> other<00:03:51.459> side<00:03:51.580> of<00:03:52.150> the<00:03:52.930> square

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
to the other side of the square

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.530 
to the other side of the square
now<00:03:53.920> remember<00:03:54.250> translating<00:03:54.910> means<00:03:55.120> moving

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
now remember translating means moving

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.009 
now remember translating means moving
everything<00:03:56.170> over<00:03:56.560> to<00:03:56.980> another<00:03:57.549> position<00:03:58.150> now

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
everything over to another position now

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.410 
everything over to another position now
once<00:03:59.260> we<00:03:59.410> translate<00:03:59.950> it<00:04:00.130> we<00:04:00.760> need<00:04:00.940> to<00:04:01.030> tape<00:04:01.239> it

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
once we translate it we need to tape it

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.850 
once we translate it we need to tape it
down<00:04:01.450> so<00:04:01.840> it<00:04:01.930> doesn't<00:04:01.959> move<00:04:02.260> anymore

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
down so it doesn't move anymore

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.629 
down so it doesn't move anymore
we<00:04:03.790> still<00:04:04.030> have<00:04:04.209> two<00:04:04.420> sides<00:04:04.690> to<00:04:04.900> take<00:04:05.109> care<00:04:05.560> of

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
we still have two sides to take care of

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.800 
we still have two sides to take care of
we<00:04:06.639> do<00:04:06.790> the<00:04:06.940> same<00:04:07.090> things<00:04:07.389> that<00:04:07.450> we<00:04:07.630> did

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
we do the same things that we did

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.330 
we do the same things that we did
earlier<00:04:08.109> where<00:04:08.290> we<00:04:08.440> start<00:04:08.739> at<00:04:08.859> one

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
earlier where we start at one

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.449 
earlier where we start at one
and<00:04:09.640> we<00:04:09.819> draw<00:04:10.120> a<00:04:10.390> line<00:04:11.010> annual<00:04:12.010> line<00:04:12.190> that<00:04:12.370> we

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
and we draw a line annual line that we

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.009 
and we draw a line annual line that we
like<00:04:13.319> we<00:04:14.319> cut<00:04:14.590> out<00:04:14.739> the<00:04:15.010> piece<00:04:15.690> along<00:04:16.690> the<00:04:16.810> line

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
like we cut out the piece along the line

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.370 
like we cut out the piece along the line
and<00:04:17.910> we<00:04:18.910> take<00:04:19.120> that<00:04:19.329> piece<00:04:19.510> and<00:04:19.690> translate<00:04:20.260> it

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
and we take that piece and translate it

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.719 
and we take that piece and translate it
to<00:04:20.410> the<00:04:20.590> other<00:04:20.739> side<00:04:21.190> and<00:04:21.549> tape<00:04:22.510> it<00:04:22.660> down<00:04:23.729> now

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
to the other side and tape it down now

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.200 
to the other side and tape it down now
we<00:04:24.790> have<00:04:25.150> our<00:04:25.449> template<00:04:26.220> well<00:04:27.220> with<00:04:27.729> this<00:04:27.970> we

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
we have our template well with this we

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.510 
we have our template well with this we
can<00:04:28.419> create<00:04:28.900> the<00:04:29.199> same<00:04:29.410> figure<00:04:29.710> that<00:04:29.889> fits

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
can create the same figure that fits

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.360 
can create the same figure that fits
within<00:04:30.760> itself<00:04:31.210> over<00:04:31.960> and<00:04:32.229> over<00:04:32.470> and<00:04:32.590> over<00:04:32.740> so

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
within itself over and over and over so

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.909 
within itself over and over and over so
let's<00:04:33.520> do<00:04:33.699> that<00:04:33.810> we<00:04:34.810> trace<00:04:35.139> around<00:04:35.380> our

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
let's do that we trace around our

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.540 
let's do that we trace around our
template<00:04:36.610> to<00:04:37.600> create<00:04:37.930> our<00:04:38.020> figure<00:04:38.380> and<00:04:38.620> then

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
template to create our figure and then

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.170 
template to create our figure and then
we<00:04:39.729> fit<00:04:40.030> our<00:04:40.540> template<00:04:41.050> within<00:04:41.320> itself<00:04:42.180> so

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
we fit our template within itself so

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.210 
we fit our template within itself so
that<00:04:43.210> we<00:04:43.540> can<00:04:43.780> create<00:04:44.020> this<00:04:44.290> tessellation<00:04:45.010> and

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
that we can create this tessellation and

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.070 
that we can create this tessellation and
notice<00:04:45.460> that<00:04:45.639> there<00:04:45.850> aren't<00:04:46.030> any<00:04:46.330> gaps<00:04:46.690> and

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
notice that there aren't any gaps and

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.150 
notice that there aren't any gaps and
that<00:04:47.650> I'm<00:04:47.950> tracing<00:04:48.729> the<00:04:49.630> template<00:04:50.050> off<00:04:50.200> the

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
that I'm tracing the template off the

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.760 
that I'm tracing the template off the
blank<00:04:51.400> sheet<00:04:51.580> of<00:04:51.669> paper<00:04:52.320> we<00:04:53.320> want<00:04:53.530> to<00:04:53.620> cover

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
blank sheet of paper we want to cover

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:00.210 
blank sheet of paper we want to cover
the<00:04:53.919> entire<00:04:54.070> sheet<00:04:54.970> just<00:04:55.660> like<00:04:55.780> this<00:04:59.100> here<00:05:00.100> is

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
the entire sheet just like this here is

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.100 
the entire sheet just like this here is
our<00:05:00.310> tessellation<00:05:01.030> notice<00:05:01.750> that<00:05:01.900> there

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
our tessellation notice that there

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.680 
our tessellation notice that there
aren't<00:05:02.260> any<00:05:02.440> gaps<00:05:02.919> or<00:05:03.340> overlapping<00:05:04.240> pieces

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
aren't any gaps or overlapping pieces

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.730 
aren't any gaps or overlapping pieces
within<00:05:05.500> this<00:05:06.010> figure<00:05:06.490> and<00:05:06.900> so<00:05:07.900> what<00:05:08.440> we<00:05:08.560> need

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
within this figure and so what we need

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.890 
within this figure and so what we need
to<00:05:08.830> do<00:05:08.949> now<00:05:09.100> is<00:05:09.370> we<00:05:09.789> need<00:05:09.970> to<00:05:10.150> either<00:05:10.419> decide<00:05:10.870> to

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
to do now is we need to either decide to

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.029 
to do now is we need to either decide to
draw<00:05:11.590> a<00:05:11.620> picture<00:05:11.970> or<00:05:12.970> color<00:05:13.360> it<00:05:14.039> unfortunately

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
draw a picture or color it unfortunately

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:17.340 
draw a picture or color it unfortunately
I<00:05:15.340> couldn't<00:05:16.120> figure<00:05:16.360> out<00:05:16.570> what<00:05:16.870> this<00:05:17.080> looked

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
I couldn't figure out what this looked

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.529 
I couldn't figure out what this looked
like<00:05:17.440> so<00:05:17.830> I<00:05:17.860> just<00:05:18.130> decided<00:05:18.490> to<00:05:18.639> color<00:05:18.940> it<00:05:19.150> using

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
like so I just decided to color it using

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:21.930 
like so I just decided to color it using
two<00:05:20.110> different<00:05:20.289> colors<00:05:20.550> we<00:05:21.550> want<00:05:21.729> to<00:05:21.820> make

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
two different colors we want to make

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.000 
two different colors we want to make
sure<00:05:21.970> that<00:05:22.300> the<00:05:22.479> tessellation<00:05:23.229> is<00:05:23.440> visually

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
sure that the tessellation is visually

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.860 
sure that the tessellation is visually
appealing<00:05:24.280> because<00:05:24.729> this<00:05:24.940> is<00:05:25.120> a<00:05:25.360> work<00:05:25.539> of<00:05:25.690> art

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
appealing because this is a work of art

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:37.729 
appealing because this is a work of art
so<00:05:26.440> take<00:05:26.680> your<00:05:26.830> time

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:37.739 

00:05:37.739 --> 00:05:40.949 

so<00:05:38.739> here's<00:05:38.949> a<00:05:39.039> final<00:05:39.249> tessellation<00:05:39.969> notice

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:40.959 
so here's a final tessellation notice

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:43.229 
so here's a final tessellation notice
that<00:05:41.139> there's<00:05:41.439> no<00:05:41.709> gaps<00:05:41.979> there<00:05:42.909> was<00:05:43.089> no

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:43.239 
that there's no gaps there was no

00:05:43.239 --> 00:05:46.429 
that there's no gaps there was no
overlapping<00:05:43.779> and<00:05:44.199> it's<00:05:44.830> visually<00:05:45.309> appealing

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:46.439 
overlapping and it's visually appealing

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:48.570 
overlapping and it's visually appealing
lastly<00:05:47.439> I'd<00:05:47.679> like<00:05:47.709> to<00:05:47.919> show<00:05:48.249> you<00:05:48.309> some

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
lastly I'd like to show you some

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.309 
lastly I'd like to show you some
examples<00:05:49.179> from<00:05:49.330> students<00:05:49.809> I've<00:05:49.929> had<00:05:50.110> in<00:05:50.229> the

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:50.319 
examples from students I've had in the

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:51.919 
examples from students I've had in the
past<00:05:50.499> who<00:05:50.739> created<00:05:51.309> some<00:05:51.519> amazing

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:51.929 
past who created some amazing

00:05:51.929 --> 00:05:53.129 
past who created some amazing
tessellations

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:53.139 
tessellations

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:56.129 
tessellations
however<00:05:54.039> some<00:05:54.969> didn't<00:05:55.300> use<00:05:55.449> translations

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:56.139 
however some didn't use translations

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:56.909 
however some didn't use translations
like<00:05:56.349> I<00:05:56.529> did

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
like I did

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:59.609 
like I did
they<00:05:57.429> used<00:05:57.669> rotations<00:05:58.449> and<00:05:58.689> the<00:05:59.169> results<00:05:59.529> are

00:05:59.609 --> 00:05:59.619 
they used rotations and the results are

00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:01.679 
they used rotations and the results are
pretty<00:05:59.739> impressive<00:06:00.239> let's<00:06:01.239> see<00:06:01.389> if<00:06:01.479> he<00:06:01.569> can

00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:01.689 
pretty impressive let's see if he can

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:03.779 
pretty impressive let's see if he can
figure<00:06:01.959> out<00:06:02.080> which<00:06:02.349> examples<00:06:02.889> used<00:06:03.099> rotations

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:03.789 
figure out which examples used rotations

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:19.760 
figure out which examples used rotations
and<00:06:04.059> which<00:06:04.719> used<00:06:05.110> translations

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.570 

now<00:06:20.770> it's<00:06:20.980> your<00:06:21.100> turn<00:06:21.250> to<00:06:21.310> make<00:06:21.520> a

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
now it's your turn to make a

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.850 
now it's your turn to make a
tessellation<00:06:22.320> follow<00:06:23.320> all<00:06:23.590> of<00:06:23.620> the

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 
tessellation follow all of the

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.440 
tessellation follow all of the
directions<00:06:24.400> and<00:06:24.580> make<00:06:24.730> sure<00:06:24.910> that<00:06:25.060> your<00:06:25.210> final

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:25.450 
directions and make sure that your final

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.060 
directions and make sure that your final
tessellation<00:06:26.140> doesn't<00:06:26.530> have<00:06:26.680> any<00:06:26.860> white

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.070 
tessellation doesn't have any white

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:28.740 
tessellation doesn't have any white
showing<00:06:27.100> unless<00:06:27.970> why<00:06:28.180> it's<00:06:28.360> found<00:06:28.510> in<00:06:28.660> your

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
showing unless why it's found in your

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.740 
showing unless why it's found in your
drawing<00:06:29.100> in<00:06:30.100> other<00:06:30.310> words<00:06:30.520> make<00:06:30.850> sure<00:06:31.000> there

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750 
drawing in other words make sure there

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.830 
drawing in other words make sure there
aren't<00:06:31.900> any<00:06:32.020> gaps<00:06:32.820> be<00:06:33.820> creative<00:06:34.390> and<00:06:34.570> you'll

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 
aren't any gaps be creative and you'll

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.130 
aren't any gaps be creative and you'll
be<00:06:34.960> amazed<00:06:35.290> at<00:06:35.590> what<00:06:35.740> you've<00:06:35.890> made
