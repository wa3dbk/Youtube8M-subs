00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960 

all<00:00:00.810> right<00:00:00.930> so<00:00:01.170> here's<00:00:01.530> a<00:00:01.589> look<00:00:01.800> at<00:00:01.979> the<00:00:02.100> canon

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
all right so here's a look at the canon

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.470 
all right so here's a look at the canon
40<00:00:03.419> millimeter<00:00:03.750> pancake<00:00:04.290> lens<00:00:05.120> this<00:00:06.120> has<00:00:06.330> the

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
40 millimeter pancake lens this has the

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.759 
40 millimeter pancake lens this has the
new<00:00:06.740> STM<00:00:07.740> motor<00:00:08.599> I<00:00:09.599> guess<00:00:09.960> so<00:00:10.170> it<00:00:10.320> does

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
new STM motor I guess so it does

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.430 
new STM motor I guess so it does
autofocus<00:00:11.340> with<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.639> EOS<00:00:12.509> t4i

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
autofocus with the EOS t4i

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.090 
autofocus with the EOS t4i
when<00:00:14.190> in<00:00:14.370> video<00:00:14.670> mode<00:00:14.880> full<00:00:15.269> time<00:00:15.420> autofocus

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
when in video mode full time autofocus

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.700 
when in video mode full time autofocus
pretty<00:00:17.100> cool<00:00:17.310> but<00:00:17.789> there<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.390> noise<00:00:18.660> it's<00:00:19.650> not

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
pretty cool but there is noise it's not

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.189 
pretty cool but there is noise it's not
as<00:00:19.920> silent<00:00:20.310> as<00:00:20.490> they<00:00:20.730> say<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.060> is<00:00:21.199> it's

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
as silent as they say it is it's

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.080 
as silent as they say it is it's
actually<00:00:22.439> pretty<00:00:22.590> quick<00:00:22.890> but<00:00:23.430> definitely<00:00:23.939> not

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
actually pretty quick but definitely not

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.380 
actually pretty quick but definitely not
as<00:00:24.300> silent<00:00:24.779> as<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.140> might<00:00:25.560> think<00:00:26.090> you<00:00:27.090> could

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
as silent as you might think you could

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.679 
as silent as you might think you could
switch<00:00:27.900> this<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.260> manual<00:00:28.590> focus<00:00:29.480> this<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.660> a

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
switch this to manual focus this is a

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.560 
switch this to manual focus this is a
really<00:00:31.289> great<00:00:31.679> lens<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.399> like<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.270> like<00:00:33.450> the

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
really great lens I like it I like the

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.569 
really great lens I like it I like the
way<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.719> looks<00:00:34.380> that's<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.890> good<00:00:35.040> focal<00:00:35.399> length

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
way it looks that's a good focal length

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.819 
way it looks that's a good focal length
for<00:00:35.670> both<00:00:35.969> cropped<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.200> for<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.469> full-frame

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
for both cropped and for a full-frame

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.850 
for both cropped and for a full-frame
cameras<00:00:38.750> but<00:00:39.750> when<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.110> switch<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.530> manual

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
cameras but when you switch it to manual

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.459 
cameras but when you switch it to manual
focus<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:42.649> here's<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:44.930> manual<00:00:45.930> focus<00:00:46.410> ring

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
focus and here's the manual focus ring

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.700 
focus and here's the manual focus ring
here<00:00:46.800> it's<00:00:46.920> really<00:00:47.190> fluid<00:00:47.550> really<00:00:48.000> smooth<00:00:48.710> may

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
here it's really fluid really smooth may

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.959 
here it's really fluid really smooth may
not<00:00:49.860> be<00:00:50.010> something<00:00:50.190> you're<00:00:50.399> gonna<00:00:50.489> put<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> lens

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
not be something you're gonna put a lens

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.029 
not be something you're gonna put a lens
gear<00:00:51.239> on<00:00:51.390> but<00:00:51.629> it's<00:00:51.809> really<00:00:52.079> fluid<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.829> really

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
gear on but it's really fluid and really

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.979 
gear on but it's really fluid and really
smooth<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:54.000> only<00:00:54.270> problem<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.809> makes

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
smooth the only problem is it makes

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.200 
smooth the only problem is it makes
noise<00:00:55.760> even<00:00:56.760> when<00:00:57.059> you're<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.329> manual<00:00:57.960> focus

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
noise even when you're in manual focus

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.990 
noise even when you're in manual focus
and<00:01:00.350> you<00:01:01.350> know<00:01:01.440> for<00:01:02.250> situations<00:01:02.789> where<00:01:02.910> you

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
and you know for situations where you

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.509 
and you know for situations where you
may<00:01:03.120> not<00:01:03.300> use<00:01:03.539> audio<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.260> your<00:01:04.290> video<00:01:04.680> could<00:01:05.460> be

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
may not use audio in your video could be

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.630 
may not use audio in your video could be
fine<00:01:05.850> but<00:01:06.810> if<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.229> need<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.439> retain<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.340> audio

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
fine but if you need to retain the audio

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.940 
fine but if you need to retain the audio
that's<00:01:08.790> captured<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.450> camera<00:01:09.840> it's<00:01:10.799> gonna

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
that's captured in the camera it's gonna

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.760 
that's captured in the camera it's gonna
be<00:01:11.100> noisy<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:11.909> let<00:01:12.900> me<00:01:12.960> show<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.170> guys<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.350> clip

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
be noisy so let me show you guys a clip

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.310 
be noisy so let me show you guys a clip
of<00:01:13.979> what<00:01:14.340> that's<00:01:14.460> gonna<00:01:14.640> sound<00:01:14.880> like<00:01:15.320> right

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
of what that's gonna sound like right

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:36.200 
of what that's gonna sound like right
here

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.330 

all<00:01:37.210> right<00:01:37.329> so<00:01:37.479> what<00:01:37.689> you<00:01:37.810> heard<00:01:37.960> was<00:01:38.340> me

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
all right so what you heard was me

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.499 
all right so what you heard was me
basically<00:01:39.700> putting<00:01:39.969> the<00:01:40.090> camera<00:01:40.360> on<00:01:40.450> the

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
basically putting the camera on the

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:42.330 
basically putting the camera on the
floor<00:01:40.659> I<00:01:40.780> switched<00:01:41.350> it<00:01:41.469> to<00:01:41.500> manual<00:01:41.829> focus<00:01:42.189> and

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
floor I switched it to manual focus and

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.740 
floor I switched it to manual focus and
then<00:01:42.520> I<00:01:42.549> was<00:01:42.759> just<00:01:42.909> kind<00:01:43.060> of<00:01:43.090> rack<00:01:43.299> focusing

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
then I was just kind of rack focusing

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.169 
then I was just kind of rack focusing
back<00:01:43.869> and<00:01:44.110> forth<00:01:44.350> here<00:01:44.560> and<00:01:44.770> that's<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:45.939> noise

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
back and forth here and that's the noise

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:48.779 
back and forth here and that's the noise
inside<00:01:46.689> the<00:01:46.869> lens<00:01:47.079> that's<00:01:47.590> what<00:01:48.369> your<00:01:48.549> camera

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
inside the lens that's what your camera

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:51.120 
inside the lens that's what your camera
is<00:01:49.000> going<00:01:49.149> to<00:01:49.270> pick<00:01:49.420> up<00:01:49.600> so<00:01:49.979> if<00:01:50.979> you're

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
is going to pick up so if you're

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.510 
is going to pick up so if you're
considering<00:01:51.459> this<00:01:51.670> lens<00:01:51.909> for<00:01:52.030> video<00:01:53.520> manual

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
considering this lens for video manual

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.699 
considering this lens for video manual
focus<00:01:55.149> on<00:01:55.299> this<00:01:55.450> lens<00:01:55.689> may<00:01:56.079> not<00:01:56.259> work<00:01:56.470> for<00:01:56.500> you

00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:56.709 
focus on this lens may not work for you

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:01.620 
focus on this lens may not work for you
if<00:01:57.270> audio<00:01:58.270> is<00:01:58.709> going<00:01:59.709> to<00:01:59.799> be<00:01:59.890> a<00:01:59.920> problem<00:02:00.630> so

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
if audio is going to be a problem so

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.580 
if audio is going to be a problem so
that's<00:02:02.409> a<00:02:02.649> look<00:02:02.829> at<00:02:03.159> the<00:02:04.229> 40<00:02:05.229> millimeter

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
that's a look at the 40 millimeter

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.900 
that's a look at the 40 millimeter
pancake<00:02:06.009> I<00:02:06.390> have<00:02:07.390> some<00:02:07.569> images<00:02:07.929> on<00:02:07.989> my<00:02:08.289> website
