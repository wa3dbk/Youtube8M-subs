00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
one of my previous videos I talked about

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.450 
one of my previous videos I talked about
Playstation<00:00:18.529> releasing<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.619> slim<00:00:19.890> version<00:00:20.100> of

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
Playstation releasing a slim version of

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.359 
Playstation releasing a slim version of
their<00:00:20.699> new<00:00:21.000> console<00:00:21.510> if<00:00:22.020> Xbox<00:00:22.859> finally<00:00:23.220> caught

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
their new console if Xbox finally caught

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.580 
their new console if Xbox finally caught
up<00:00:23.400> in<00:00:23.670> sales<00:00:23.970> or<00:00:24.300> surpassed<00:00:24.930> them<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.320> sales

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
up in sales or surpassed them in sales

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.170 
up in sales or surpassed them in sales
but<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:26.430> think<00:00:26.699> they're<00:00:26.820> going<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:26.970> do<00:00:27.090> it

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
but I think they're going to do it

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.150 
but I think they're going to do it
anyway<00:00:27.269> so<00:00:27.480> they<00:00:27.750> have<00:00:27.869> done<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.230> with<00:00:28.500> their

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
anyway so they have done that with their

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.919 
anyway so they have done that with their
last<00:00:29.369> Jin<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.880> think<00:00:30.119> what<00:00:30.300> they<00:00:30.420> had<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.570> total

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
last Jin I think what they had a total

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.510 
last Jin I think what they had a total
of<00:00:31.050> three<00:00:31.080> different<00:00:31.619> versions<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.250> ps3

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
of three different versions of the ps3

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.220 
of three different versions of the ps3
and<00:00:32.969> it's<00:00:33.510> kept<00:00:33.690> getting<00:00:33.899> smaller<00:00:33.960> smaller

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
and it's kept getting smaller smaller

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.780 
and it's kept getting smaller smaller
they<00:00:34.530> also<00:00:34.649> did<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.040> with<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.250> PlayStation

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
they also did that with the PlayStation

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.520 
they also did that with the PlayStation
2<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.540> it's<00:00:36.719> definitely<00:00:36.960> going<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.140> happen<00:00:37.440> no

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
2 so it's definitely going to happen no

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.369 
2 so it's definitely going to happen no
matter<00:00:37.649> what<00:00:37.770> within<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> year<00:00:38.460> or<00:00:38.760> two<00:00:39.379> and

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379
