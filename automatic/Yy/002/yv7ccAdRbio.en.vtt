got that control room that ghost is

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.720 
got that control room that ghost is
royally<00:02:03.320> gonna<00:02:03.500> screw<00:02:03.860> up<00:02:04.010> controlling<00:02:04.640> the

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
royally gonna screw up controlling the

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.700 
royally gonna screw up controlling the
doors<00:02:04.970> for<00:02:05.300> us<00:02:05.330> well<00:02:06.320> you<00:02:06.410> know<00:02:06.530> let's

doors for us well you know let's
probably<00:02:06.980> old<00:02:07.100> technology<00:02:07.580> got<00:02:07.730> shot<00:02:08.000> up<00:02:08.030> a

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
probably old technology got shot up a

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.750 
probably old technology got shot up a
bit<00:02:08.390> so<00:02:08.630> I've<00:02:08.990> given<00:02:09.260> a<00:02:09.320> break<00:02:09.920> and<00:02:10.429> Ray<00:02:10.580> at<00:02:10.670> the

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
bit so I've given a break and Ray at the

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.130 
bit so I've given a break and Ray at the
