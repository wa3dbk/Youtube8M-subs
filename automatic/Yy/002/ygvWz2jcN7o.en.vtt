Hi! This is my first holiday look! I have
done two different makeups; this is the first

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:18.929
one with gold and glitters but not too intense
and the second one will be a very bright smokey. I Hope you like it! &lt;3

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.200
Apply a stick eyeshadow as a base to the lid.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:48.300
Apply a wet gold/bronze eyeshadow to the centre of the lid.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.710
Apply a lighter gold to the inner corner of the lid

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.600
and along the inner corner of
the lower lashes.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:35.100
Apply a shimmer brown (from the Naked palette) to the outer corner of the lid and to the crease.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.800
And obviously blend well.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.700
Apply a concealer over the fallout.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:18.300
Add brown eyeshadow to the outer corner of the lower lashes

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:36.519
Apply a primer to add glitters to the inner corner and then add gold glitter.

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:53.500
Line your eyes with a liquid eyeliner.
Then apply mascara, black kajal and false lashes.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.200
I wear a nude lipstick and the gold/bronze
eyeshadow to the centre of the lips.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:17.200
This is my complete look, hope you like it!!
Thanks for watching &lt;3
