00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.420
 though a gray water I am the 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.309
 guitar teacher of the online music school 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.320
 and I'm going to show you how to get the strings 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.320
 of this spanish guitar 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:33.669
 pigeon needs a set 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:33.669
 release me after a liner and a tuner 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.780
 the first cut we're going to replace is 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.760
 the fat one is to 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.469
 to release it quickly you have 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.109
 need the winer that you can put on it 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:50.530
 set tuning mechanism so that you have it strong 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:50.530
 shaft can turn 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.479
 you revolve around my self 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:01:00.280
 clockwise if have the tension 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:00.280
 kim can easily be released from the string 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.920
 the other side is easily released 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.450
 by pushing the string through the hole 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.450
 and release the button 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.900
 you take it thicker once out of you 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.880
 new set of strings and the end doe 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.880
 you go through the point in the bridge 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.850
 make sure you have around 10 to 12 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.850
 centimeters 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:43.460
 then you make a knot you are about it 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:47.920
 underneath and in between and 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.920
 then go under again 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.000
 you only need two for the wound strings 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.759
 times and so make it tight for you 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.830
 pulls on the transparent strings 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.140
 do that three times to secure them properly 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.860
 get care that the hole where the 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.120
 string must be at the top 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.120
 then you put the string through 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:33.180
 and then you pick it up on the other side 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:41.250
 back up then you bring down 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:43.170
 the other quickly along and then do as one 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.209
 u-shape on the other side where that 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.209
 came back down 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.100
 you can now gently on the E string 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:59.069
 bring tension by counterclockwise 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:02.510
 to turn if the beak voltage is kun 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.510
 you start voting him with your tuner 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.720
 so if you have voted him well you can 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.310
 after pulling out a bit 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.720
 you do that because otherwise they are very fast 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.940
 displeased again 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.740
 you can do it as follows you submit 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.660
 fingers below so and you pull on 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:25.350
 while holding your thumb 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:33.950
 you do this all over your body 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:33.950
 neck and back 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.910
 then you vote again 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:55.090
 and you want the same thing twice more 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.500
 you also all the other strings of your guitar 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.940
 to replace 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.440
 if you didn't have a tuner yourself 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.450
 then you can always have the voices help 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.980
 of the site and find that link 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.330
