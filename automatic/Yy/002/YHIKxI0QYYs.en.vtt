really fast and we slowed down gears to
a<00:01:28.270> little<00:01:28.540> bit<00:01:28.660> in<00:01:28.840> terms<00:01:29.200> of<00:01:29.380> China<00:01:29.620> again<00:01:29.980> to

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
a little bit in terms of China again to

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.400

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
make it more accessible and we felt like

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.110 
make it more accessible and we felt like
it<00:01:32.710> you<00:01:32.920> know<00:01:33.010> I<00:01:33.310> think<00:01:33.670> a<00:01:33.700> lot<00:01:33.790> of<00:01:33.940> feedback

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
it you know I think a lot of feedback

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.370 
it you know I think a lot of feedback
we've<00:01:34.390> gotten<00:01:34.420> from<00:01:34.630> players<00:01:34.960> is<00:01:35.170> that<00:01:35.290> we

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
we've gotten from players is that we

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.510 
we've gotten from players is that we
felt<00:01:35.500> like<00:01:35.650> they<00:01:35.770> were<00:01:35.830> the<00:01:36.010> pendulum<00:01:36.340> swung

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
felt like they were the pendulum swung

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.000 
felt like they were the pendulum swung
too<00:01:36.730> far<00:01:36.760> and<00:01:37.330> so<00:01:37.720> we've<00:01:38.170> found<00:01:38.530> this<00:01:38.710> middle

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
too far and so we've found this middle

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:58.249 
too far and so we've found this middle
ground<00:01:39.250> I<00:01:41.580> think<00:01:42.580> we<00:01:42.670> found<00:01:42.790> a<00:01:42.940> sweet<00:01:43.030> spot
