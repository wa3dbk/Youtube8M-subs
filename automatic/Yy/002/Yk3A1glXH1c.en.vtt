marginal gains to me is an improvement
through<00:00:11.450> small<00:00:11.750> steps<00:00:12.020> the<00:00:12.380> idea<00:00:12.740> was<00:00:12.950> to<00:00:13.280> get

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:13.790 
through small steps the idea was to get

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.190 
through small steps the idea was to get
people<00:00:14.150> to<00:00:14.270> think<00:00:14.420> that<00:00:14.540> they<00:00:14.750> could<00:00:15.050> improve

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.200 
people to think that they could improve

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.200 
people to think that they could improve
and<00:00:16.040> once<00:00:16.219> you<00:00:16.340> started<00:00:16.670> out<00:00:16.760> it<00:00:16.910> kinda

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
and once you started out it kinda

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.700 
and once you started out it kinda
created<00:00:17.570> is<00:00:17.660> contagious<00:00:18.140> sort<00:00:18.620> of

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
created is contagious sort of

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.230 
created is contagious sort of
environment<00:00:19.280> where<00:00:19.910> you<00:00:20.000> have<00:00:20.150> this

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
environment where you have this

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.640 
environment where you have this
continuous<00:00:20.780> improvements<00:00:21.440> it's<00:00:21.590> a

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
continuous improvements it's a

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.800 
continuous improvements it's a
philosophy<00:00:21.890> that<00:00:22.460> everybody<00:00:23.240> became<00:00:23.510> engaged

with<00:00:25.840> not<00:00:26.840> investing<00:00:27.289> in<00:00:27.350> people<00:00:27.710> is<00:00:27.770> a<00:00:27.860> huge

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
with not investing in people is a huge

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.189 
with not investing in people is a huge
risk<00:00:28.310> a<00:00:28.550> team<00:00:28.940> isn't<00:00:29.330> a<00:00:29.449> thing<00:00:29.720> it's<00:00:29.960> a<00:00:30.020> group

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
risk a team isn't a thing it's a group

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:31.779 
risk a team isn't a thing it's a group
of<00:00:30.320> people<00:00:30.380> all<00:00:30.860> working<00:00:31.250> together<00:00:31.400> to<00:00:31.670> become

educate and teach the course goals but

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.580 
educate and teach the course goals but
