about a game plan and luckily it's not
like<00:03:10.790> last<00:03:11.090> year<00:03:11.359> when<00:03:11.390> you<00:03:12.109> know<00:03:12.200> we<00:03:12.349> raced

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
like last year when you know we raced

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.690 
like last year when you know we raced
out<00:03:12.709> last<00:03:12.920> national<00:03:13.310> and<00:03:13.400> then<00:03:13.489> we<00:03:13.549> had<00:03:13.670> to

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
out last national and then we had to

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.309 
out last national and then we had to
jump<00:03:13.879> on<00:03:13.970> planes<00:03:14.239> right<00:03:14.420> away<00:03:14.660> and<00:03:14.840> go<00:03:14.959> to<00:03:15.019> the

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
jump on planes right away and go to the

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:16.780 
jump on planes right away and go to the

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790
