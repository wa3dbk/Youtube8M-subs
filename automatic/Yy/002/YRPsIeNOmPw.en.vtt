00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Photo animation has been in our mind lately 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.120
 especially with many school animes in 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.069
 An everyday setting is the first time 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.030
 in the last season with free and before 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.860
 already with kane 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.750
 but whether she also gives us a fantasy 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.910
 setting with lots of action and 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.379
 Demons can convince them 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.379
 once put under proof 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.660
 in canada, people's lives 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.610
 of demons threatens but there is also 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.800
 many people use the demons with theirs 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.360
 chasing special skills and with the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.610
 remnants of the demons 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.830
 livelihoods also deserve akihito 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.960
 lives in this dangerous world leads 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.270
 but a relatively normal life up 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.270
 one day shows up and get on with it 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.500
 a sword on board but agitated 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.270
 not so easy because he is not 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.699
 normal human and has one 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.040
 amazing regeneration almost 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.019
 makes immortal and that's how it is 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.440
 she slowly but surely with mira 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:00.530
 makes friends pretty fast 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.449
 becomes clear is the cocaine o canada 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.430
 the animations look really good 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.440
 act very fluid and the movements 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.960
 Of course the colors fit perfectly 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.420
 together and there are also many details 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.340
 to see if now in the fight where everyone 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.440
 smallest particle to be in motion 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.920
 appears or just the rain 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.540
 slowly running down the face 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.610
 in this beautiful world can be found 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.740
 then akihito the immortal and 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.470
 the last blood tame me again 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.390
 usually the normal school day 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.070
 follow up and yes who would have thought 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.210
 also has the kioto animation times 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.550
 again a school setting made it 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.260
 to install or they are just meeting 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.930
 again with the siblings Mizuki 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.820
 and hiromi but the four are then 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.560
 not quite so common then in her 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.150
 leisure time they keep chasing demons 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.430
 and to protect humanity or 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.660
 to earn something 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.880
 but clearly in the foreground are me 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.640
 sorry and akihito both something 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.410
 mysterious se have is me 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.540
 the last of an old blood benninger 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.990
 clans exterminated because of his power 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.670
 has been 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.860
 and otherwise you do not know anything about them 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.370
 and the banco you know even more 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.560
 fewer 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:08.009
 but for some reason he is 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.330
 immortal this ignorance makes it 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.489
 exciting the story continues 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.709
 track and gradually become the 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.510
 single secrets revealed and it 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.480
 Everything seems to make sense and 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.610
 was very well resolved until the end but on 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.830
 the end will be so many again 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.050
 New questions raised and only very 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.879
 halfhearted or not answered 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.700
 that you have the anime with a bad one 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.079
 leave feeling must set the anime 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.560
 but not alone on his mystery 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.000
 element 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.830
 and his action is really one 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.330
 eye candy is but works too 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.760
 with every amount of comedy 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.470
 tucano canada attacks again and again 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.150
 back to the same three elements 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.459
 The glasses fetish of our hero 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.040
 akihito the sister complex of his 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.080
 friend hiromi and the lust of mine 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.970
 but they never eat anything 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.989
 can afford 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.150
 especially the glasses fetish has me 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.680
 I liked it a lot in the beginning and always did 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.290
 again a grin conjured on the face 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.390
 but that's where the problem is 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.640
 initially good 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.590
 it just keeps getting better over time 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.780
 more ridiculous and even if I always have it 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.120
 and again and again, my name was Schwand 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.470
 Enthusiasm always on and towards the end 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.440
 the jokes were just still 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.970
 hatched what led animation but 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.340
 again with no canada done 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.750
 it was created by really 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.580
 sympathetic characters 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.769
 we do not have any here now 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.810
 novel or super well thought out 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.209
 characters but all occurring 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.250
 characters grow in your heart and soul 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.690
 seem to fulfill a role 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.849
 But I still have to be special 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.500
 emphasize negatively rather than towards the middle 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.690
 of the anime it comes to an absurd 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.519
 dance episode the complete 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.890
 seriousness of the demons at one 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.200
 silk thread is hanging and no story 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.000
 contains relevant information and 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.040
 actually just be skipped 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.030
 can 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.340
 All in all, I have the anime 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.709
 enjoyed with his funny sad 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.840
 or action-packed moments, after all 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.670
 unfortunately not until the very end against 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.950
 At the end of the jokes were just too 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.440
 it consumes opened against just 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.579
 Once again many new questions ask 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.600
 until the very end no more 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.910
 were clarified 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.579
 but this got a big fight 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.980
 and a great thunderstorm all in 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:13.109
 all is no canada with security 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.420
 a good anime and i got up to it 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:18.120
 finally asked if I 75 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.450
 or maybe give 775 points 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.579
 should 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.380
 and then the great opening is for me though 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.700
 especially that much better ending 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.680
 shot in the head 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.690
 that with every episode for a great 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.610
 and although I did 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.770
 opening and ending usually not 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.600
 to be included in the evaluation because 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.830
 here it is the tip on the scales 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.539
 and no canada gets from me 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.290
 7.75 points and is thus a good one 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:45.450
 anime with asterisks 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.919
 yes people that was the rio tokio canada 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.450
 I hope it failed 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.280
 also in the comments what you from the 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.260
 persistently the same opinion as me 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.389
 and other opinion has everything 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.919
 be possible if you like the video 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.730
 I liked it with both thumbs 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:01.470
 above 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:03.150
 and down here you will become a farmer 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.889
 you will find two more reviews 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.260
 probably here is the ju 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:10.230
 jutsu be thankful and maybe here 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.639
 love to ergo proxy if not then 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.230
 I just did it differently but me 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.520
 I think I'll take it all 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.200
 I watch myself video again 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.850
 okay but that was real for today 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.850
 so bye and see you next time
