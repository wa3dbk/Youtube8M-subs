00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.389
 in a material made by the positive active schools program 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.449
 we'll see 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.449
 something that we must learn once and for all 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.439
 learn clay 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.869
 we have to get used to recycling 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.010
 and that starts at home 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.040
 you have to learn to separate 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.910
 which are organic inorganic novelties 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.780
 and also the four genes 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.460
 everything has a technique 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.610
 that not only do good to the environment but also do good to 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.710
 the society 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.610
 recycling is a necessary activity for people including health and other 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.670
 actions in an ecological vision of the world 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.820
 lp recycling is the only measure that allows the reduction of waste 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.959
 an aluminum can 

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:05.670
 a plastic container 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.600
 A glass jar can be perfectly recycled 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.859
 since the degradation of these materials is invented hobaugh the 

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:17.180
 for example 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:24.640
 the aluminum is degraded 500 years the plastic in 350 years and the glass never 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.480
 It decomposes 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.290
 these little ones every minute if in some corner of the country a person throws away 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.549
 inappropriately these containers 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.359
 without thinking about the serious damage it does to the ecosystem 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.380
 nature without the intervention of the human being does not produce garbage if 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.230
 we observe the cycle of nature 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.660
 we see that nothing is wasted, all food is consumed by beings 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.660
 alive that are part of the chain 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.370
 Throughout our evolution we tried numerous products that we 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:10.220
 they facilitate life but on the other hand they generate a problem because they do not 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.710
 they return to nature they arrive at a landfill mixed generating a 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.609
 landfill that harms our health and environment 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:25.819
 ranchers work in this way in landfills exposing themselves to 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.469
 diseases to rescue some of the materials that are thrown but only 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:38.709
 10% of these receipts are recovered however there is a way in which 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:44.909
 we can help to reverse this cycle that does not close in this graph we see 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:49.859
 how a new product leaves a factory to be used by the 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:56.309
 man then this cyclone can be closed if we separate the containers in the house 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:58.799
 school or at work 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:04.419
 so that it can be collected separately from the items receipts 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:05.289
 A) Yes 

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:08.289
 the industries can come back though to use 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:14.929
 We can all contribute by reducing receipts and improving our environment 

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:22.319
 separating recyclable materials recycling is the closest thing to the cycle 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.079
 of the nature 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.209
 produce 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:26.339
 consume 

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:33.259
 and to re-produce for that reason the international symbol of recycling has these 

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.839
 shapes
