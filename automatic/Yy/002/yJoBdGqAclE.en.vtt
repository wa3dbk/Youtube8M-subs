was<00:05:42.020> easy<00:05:43.020> for<00:05:43.320> you<00:05:43.410> guys<00:05:43.590> to<00:05:43.770> understand<00:05:44.190> what

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
was easy for you guys to understand what

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.280 
was easy for you guys to understand what
I<00:05:44.400> do<00:05:44.550> because<00:05:45.180> it's<00:05:45.450> very<00:05:45.480> difficult<00:05:45.870> to

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
I do because it's very difficult to

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.400 
I do because it's very difficult to
explain<00:05:46.440> without<00:05:47.310> showing<00:05:48.020> the<00:05:49.020> way<00:05:49.169> that<00:05:49.380> I

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
explain without showing the way that I
