00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.260
 we now move on to this policeman who was injured last year at 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.890
 sevran seine-saint-denis was deliberately overthrown by a 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.710
 the 34-year-old police officer suffers from facial fractures and drivers have 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.369
 fled if Libyans get caught 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.429
 so it's a little more intense sit-in on what happened last night 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.169
 but it was at 11 pm last night and this brigade officer 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:25.390
 anti-crime carried out a security check in the city 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.199
 bastide was tactical 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.070
 with the five chains of his colleagues at 30 a car a peugeot 206 street 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.090
 arcand deliberately basically it's sure the official fired at five 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:41.640
 times to try to stop the vehicle but it was still 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.390
 then overthrown and this 34-year-old policeman is seriously hurt add adds 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.250
 to listen to christophe ragondet created the union alliance in 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.250
 seine-saint-denis he answers ceret on the cross 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.690
 polytraumatized so to say that he will be operated to make sure he has already 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.069
 been heavily convicted 

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:03.809
 we are told about more than 30 fractures a priori its prognosis would not be 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.170
 not finally engaged the flaw make a tracheotomy it's it's very 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.770
 seriously injured so even though achievements in liga acb on what we 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.439
 of course, it's still very very 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:18.450
 very serious very serious it was deliberately rolled over for the 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.470
 then kill after one if the goal is not achieved 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.180
 by the same time challenged us for our colleague but that 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.740
 will not in any case remove the wounds of more than 30 bill it's 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:27.810
 colossal 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.170
 so a sports bag was found nearby with the 400 grams of 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.049
 cannabis 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.680
 inside that may suggest that to the police and had to be 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:41.810
 intervened a little bit inside another action watches urban drug traffic 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.369
 the d inhabitants of the city we wrote off camera that but the 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.799
 police had no armbands yesterday and so the driver could have 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.219
 to believe who it was dressing gown came from a rival city with 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.140
 that there are fights with recurring problems 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.490
 the police say it's impossible that he was too restrained 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.820
 of policing yesterday 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.620
 in any case there was a police raid this morning a person was 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.230
 questioned but we do not know yet if it is the driver of the car 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.450
 but verifications are ongoing on the value sevran seine-saint-denis
