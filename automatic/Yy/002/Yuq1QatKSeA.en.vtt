00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.710
 I think they have several foundations 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.710
 i 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.920
 at 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.340
 hello very good everyone good here 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.440
 we are in another secondary mission of 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.150
 metal are already five were jealousy and good 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.220
 I'm on the last mission I have left 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.260
 to do and well basically this 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.879
 mission have repeated a couple of times not 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.790
 I knew very well that I had a link 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.650
 I was always looking for an uncle who 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.410
 I never found for the cassette 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.930
 Well, you can already read 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.790
 that left at the beginning and good 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.400
 basically the cancer was in another 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.260
 site that I have already located and 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.780
 I'm going to show you how to get to 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.970
 site more quickly and find the 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.970
 cassette and basically we can go 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.250
 it's very simple and good to do it in little 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.789
 time and with the range so good 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:17.570
 we go there now we have to wait for 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:22.300
 let the cancer go to the cassette uy 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.300
 the truck is slowing this 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.280
 and good for nothing are already taking 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.280
 a little 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.990
 the contract with the agent supposedly 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.840
 we had to find the subject this one 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.600
 this subject we have to find this one 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.520
 and contact him to recover the 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.520
 cassette but I can not find it 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.930
 and rent receivers call you or something 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.079
 Well, well , I did it from another 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.780
 way and it's better simpler I do not know if 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.090
 the subject of that we can find it or 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.009
 no and you see there is the booth there 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.630
 we will have to go there is a camera we have 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.850
 be careful , we are going to do it 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.380
 otherwise there is another camera first 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.259
 let's turn off the cameras 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.259
 security doing they detect them 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:17.140
 well I'm marking as always 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.650
 just in case 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.160
 and well once entered we can 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.160
 get out 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.050
 here we go down we go here for this 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.050
 part of here 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.580
 the gun with this silencer 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.580
 soothing 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.069
 and we have to be careful that there is another 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.230
 camera 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.300
 and a guard that goes there is that 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.590
 custom that I now 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.590
 so it gets closer 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.439
 well there we have it 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.340
 OK 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.340
 there is another guard who is he 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.460
 well let's deactivate the cameras 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.450
 we enter here 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:28.970
 and here we have control panels like 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.920
 you want to call it and we've turned off the 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.330
 cameras 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.330
 the lights and everything 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.180
 now no no no no 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.909
 there is a guard that will surely have 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.909
 dad this means 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.060
 the guard comes one comes 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.930
 I'll watch shoot and just because 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.740
 do not 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.040
 OK 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:11.170
 Well now there is no danger 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.750
 but then we go up here and now 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.549
 we have the danger that the camera will 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.799
 that we do have to be careful is 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:22.859
 with the fence is because from outside 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.859
 you can see us as we bend over 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:29.160
 from outside if they see us they detect them 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.940
 also after rising the 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.940
 staircase but good 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.340
 and here we have the cassette 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:53.610
 and simply because it is already done 

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:56.119
 this is completed and now we have 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.119
 what to go 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.900
 we go down 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.610
 and we go through the other door 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.350
 king minus guards around here 

00:05:28.209 --> 00:05:33.679
 let's call a helicopter so that 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:35.880
 come for us or directly 

00:05:33.679 --> 00:05:38.910
 we can also go 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:43.830
 we can not go let's get out of the 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:46.130
 zone or call a helicopter that is 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.130
 almost 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.660
 low 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.879
 good 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:03.800
 let's do where the helicopter will be 

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:07.900
 we do not leave the area directly 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.900
 magda each other 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.330
 Helicopter girlfriend who gets more 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.340
 entertaining 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.440
 If not, it would end directly in the 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:27.150
 country 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.150
 good running days 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.050
 come and run 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:42.120
 with looking we already have it flowered 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:51.570
 and simply because it is this this is the 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:55.190
 last mission he had to teach us 

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:58.250
 we go up and it's already settled 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:07:01.120
 here the secondary mission ends and you 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:04.880
 I leave with the rank and now only the 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:07.280
 I'll bring it this week and 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:11.350
 Well I hope you liked it and we 

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.350
