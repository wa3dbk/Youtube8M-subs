so the ones I've got on here at the snug

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.189 
so the ones I've got on here at the snug
system<00:00:17.640> which<00:00:17.789> means<00:00:18.060> all<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.690> rods<00:00:18.840> are<00:00:19.050> nice

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
system which means all the rods are nice

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.929 
system which means all the rods are nice
and<00:00:19.470> close<00:00:19.650> together<00:00:19.859> that's<00:00:20.520> how<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.699> like

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
and close together that's how I like

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.609 
and close together that's how I like
them<00:00:21.150> they're<00:00:21.359> nine<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.810> half<00:00:21.840> inch<00:00:22.260> front

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
them they're nine and a half inch front

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.370 
them they're nine and a half inch front
and<00:00:22.949> eight<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.789> half<00:00:24.000> inch<00:00:24.269> backs<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:25.260> the

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
and eight and a half inch backs so the

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.740 
and eight and a half inch backs so the
reels<00:00:25.619> are<00:00:25.859> virtually<00:00:26.340> touching<00:00:26.849> there<00:00:27.060> there

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
reels are virtually touching there there

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.419 
reels are virtually touching there there
are<00:00:27.930> three<00:00:28.230> rod<00:00:28.439> versions<00:00:28.920> in<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.160> wider

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.429 
are three rod versions in a wider
fitting<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.359> your<00:00:30.539> reels<00:00:30.720> are<00:00:30.840> not<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.170> close

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
fitting so your reels are not so close

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.810 
fitting so your reels are not so close
together<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:32.099> there's<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.489> free<00:00:32.669> run

stop<00:02:13.800> sinking<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.370> then<00:02:14.460> I'll<00:02:14.580> know<00:02:14.760> from

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
stop sinking and then I'll know from

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.200 
stop sinking and then I'll know from
probably<00:02:15.450> I'd<00:02:16.140> say<00:02:16.200> thirty<00:02:16.740> yards<00:02:17.280> out<00:02:17.460> right

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
probably I'd say thirty yards out right

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.000 
probably I'd say thirty yards out right
the<00:02:18.330> way<00:02:18.450> out<00:02:18.570> to<00:02:18.690> my<00:02:18.810> spot<00:02:19.050> which<00:02:19.200> is<00:02:19.320> 120

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
the way out to my spot which is 120

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.650 
the way out to my spot which is 120
yards<00:02:20.160> that<00:02:20.520> line<00:02:20.790> is<00:02:21.030> hugging<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.510> bottom

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
yards that line is hugging the bottom

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.630 
yards that line is hugging the bottom
and<00:02:22.320> that<00:02:22.410> means<00:02:22.620> fish<00:02:22.860> can<00:02:23.040> come<00:02:23.250> in<00:02:23.430> from

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
and that means fish can come in from

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.610 
and that means fish can come in from
either<00:02:23.850> side<00:02:24.000> feed<00:02:24.870> over<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.230> top<00:02:25.410> of<00:02:25.530> the

either side feed over the top of the

area and not touch the line or see the
line<00:02:28.170> I<00:02:28.200> think<00:02:28.350> that's<00:02:28.620> really<00:02:28.920> important<00:02:29.400> on

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
the lines all completely sunk then I'll

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.730 
the lines all completely sunk then I'll
put<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.420> stove<00:02:36.690> bobbin<00:02:37.050> on<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.380> because<00:02:37.590> it's

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
put the stove bobbin on and because it's

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.420 
put the stove bobbin on and because it's
semi<00:02:37.980> fixed<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.520> line<00:02:39.920> getting<00:02:40.920> loads<00:02:41.220> of

sliding through it it's actually semi
fixed<00:02:45.570> to<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.750> so<00:02:46.080> you're<00:02:46.260> having<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.620> pull<00:02:46.920> the

fixed to it so you're having to pull the

whole bobbing up and that makes the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.870 
whole bobbing up and that makes the

of these has been brilliant about the

of these has been brilliant about the

range<00:02:54.510> it's<00:02:54.810> pulling<00:02:55.110> up<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.470> top<00:02:55.710> because

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
range it's pulling up to the top because

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.740 
range it's pulling up to the top because
the<00:02:56.100> line<00:02:56.340> is<00:02:56.370> slack<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:57.180> then<00:02:57.570> I<00:02:57.690> know

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
the line is slack and then I know

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.000 
the line is slack and then I know
there's<00:02:58.050> a<00:02:58.110> bream<00:02:58.320> on<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.590> end<00:02:58.710> it's<00:02:58.860> not

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
pulling forwards at all so I know

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.510 
pulling forwards at all so I know
there's<00:03:00.990> a<00:03:01.050> bream<00:03:01.230> on<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.530> end<00:03:01.680> I'm<00:03:02.040> up<00:03:02.160> into

there's a bream on the end I'm up into
it<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:03.060> replacing<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.630> again<00:03:03.870> on<00:03:04.020> a<00:03:04.050> tight

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
it and replacing it again on a tight

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
there so it's a popular misconception

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.290 
there so it's a popular misconception
that<00:03:13.800> tight<00:03:14.280> lines<00:03:14.550> give<00:03:14.820> you<00:03:14.910> better<00:03:15.090> bar

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
that tight lines give you better bar

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.450 
that tight lines give you better bar
indication<00:03:15.840> or<00:03:15.960> I<00:03:15.990> think<00:03:16.080> a<00:03:16.470> semi<00:03:16.920> slack<00:03:17.250> line

that<00:03:17.700> I've<00:03:17.820> got<00:03:18.000> here<00:03:18.240> is<00:03:18.750> much<00:03:19.050> better<00:03:19.320> for

that I've got here is much better for

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.370 
bobbing right up at the top the fish is

out<00:03:44.810> wait<00:03:45.810> until<00:03:46.020> it<00:03:46.110> goes<00:03:46.230> really<00:03:46.560> tight<00:03:46.800> lift

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220

out wait until it goes really tight lift
up<00:03:47.430> into<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.820> fish<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:48.240> then<00:03:48.330> I'm<00:03:48.450> side

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
up into the fish and then I'm side

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.870 
up into the fish and then I'm side
straining<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.440> fish<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:49.950> trying<00:03:50.430> to<00:03:50.490> take<00:03:50.700> it

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
straining the fish and trying to take it

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
away from the baited area if you pull up

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.490 
away from the baited area if you pull up
the<00:03:53.580> fish<00:03:53.760> tend<00:03:54.060> to<00:03:54.180> go<00:03:54.300> further<00:03:54.570> out<00:03:54.930> if<00:03:55.380> you

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
the fish tend to go further out if you

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.080 
the fish tend to go further out if you
side<00:03:55.710> strain<00:03:56.130> they<00:03:56.370> tend<00:03:56.610> to<00:03:56.670> kite<00:03:56.940> the

side strain they tend to kite the

side strain they tend to kite the
opposite<00:03:57.450> way<00:03:57.600> so<00:03:58.200> here<00:03:58.500> are<00:03:58.680> besides

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
opposite way so here are besides

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.280 
opposite way so here are besides
straining<00:03:59.460> right<00:03:59.640> if<00:03:59.850> I<00:03:59.970> can<00:04:00.240> try<00:04:00.900> to<00:04:00.930> get<00:04:01.170> them
