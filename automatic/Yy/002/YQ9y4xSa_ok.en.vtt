kind<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.879> hesitant<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.600> want<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.050> put<00:00:58.199> my<00:00:58.320> heart

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
kind of hesitant to want to put my heart

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.930 
kind of hesitant to want to put my heart
into<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:58.800> fight<00:00:58.980> because<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.399> been<00:00:59.579> agreed

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940
