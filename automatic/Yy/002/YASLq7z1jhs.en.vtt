00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.760
 and 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.340
 how about friends of hers and producer 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:10.010
 puntocom in this video we will see a 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.049
 update of basic equipment that 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.049
 we need in our home studio to 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:18.200
 start producing also why not 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.510
 to take the online courses or 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.700
 face- to- face that we offer through 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.580
 our web of you and producer dotcom 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.530
 well let's see briefly what it is 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.000
 what we need to start what 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.740
 first our computer 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.329
 this is where practically everything is 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.940
 our virtual studio the processor 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.550
 At least we can already pull towards a 5 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.730
 or a and 7 of 4 cores a good amount 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.990
 ram memory 8 16 or 32 gb and very good 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.400
 hard disk space to be able 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.050
 work in high quality without 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.850
 lose storage capacity 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.100
 I highly recommend that you have an SSD disk 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.020
 since these are very fast at the time 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.420
 of working it is clear that it is preferable 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.630
 that is a mac however if we work 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.640
 under windows is very useful and very 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.590
 important to have all the drivers of 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.320
 our peripherals as controllers 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.729
 or updated sound card if it is 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.649
 with mac we also need to have 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.119
 some updated drivers however 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:09.500
 things get a little easier 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.630
 logically inside 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.790
 computer we have to have our av 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.600
 in this case I spoke with live logic pro 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.950
 efe the study that you see reason or that of 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.080
 our preference to the one we know best 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.580
 master interface audio interface 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.750
 audio or sound card is very 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.820
 important is also going to us 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.130
 allow to connect our monitors 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.920
 listen to the studio speakers in addition 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.660
 of having an appropriate entrance for 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.390
 microphones for us to record 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.330
 audio externally in my case I have 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.790
 the cpl crimson which is a very model 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.229
 recent the robust audio interface and 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.700
 it's very good from previous other 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.250
 recommended interfaces as per 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.200
 example the motorcycle aubry mk3 focusrite 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.360
 scarlett about a higher price is 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.770
 the rm that is one of the best this already 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.360
 It depends on our budget throughout 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.340
 case our website you can find 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.289
 a post that talks about the interface of 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.330
 audio or sound card suitable for 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.410
 our study the monitoring basically 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.509
 this is where we are going to listen to the 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.340
 result of what we produce in this 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.080
 case those that we have here in the study 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.270
 and that I also recommend are the series 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.180
 Alpha of the renowned French brand 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.620
 focal size depends on and varies from 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.660
 study that we have of the great thing that 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.160
 I also recommend the adam the m 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.840
 audio to start are very well 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.940
 the k from here that are very popular for 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.580
 its with yellow the keyboard driver 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.830
 it is very important that if we want to create 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.450
 melodies and let's make music we can 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.950
 see the notes no matter the number of 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.930
 octaves that we have apart from this 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.450
 we can also have more drivers 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.730
 advanced like the push or a machine a 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.320
 apex here or a you do not see jon between 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.060
 others a good studio microphone 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.530
 It is also important that this depends 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.630
 the external recordings that we make 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.580
 are very good a very good help for 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.290
 when we go to record is this screen 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.460
 acoustic for the microphone and if we want 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.830
 hardware instruments like 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.450
 synthesizers or drum machines we have 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.610
 many options in the market for 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.220
 example the new roland air series o 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.810
 Volcano series CORK a very good 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.490
 price has everything you need to 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.920
 start producing and another of the things 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.350
 fundamentals is apart from monitoring 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.880
 our headphones or studio headphones 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.600
 and our website we have an article 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.280
 about the headphones that we can choose 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.600
 when it comes to working I work with 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:17.630
 these sony that are the mdr 75 06 of all 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.190
 life to the standard of studies that 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.690
 they are very good and are very flat to the 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.190
 time to produce so as not to make noise 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.170
 very good friends I hope you have them 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.570
