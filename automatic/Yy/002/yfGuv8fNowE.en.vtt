to<00:04:01.510> speed<00:04:01.750> it<00:04:01.870> up<00:04:01.990> and<00:04:02.230> to<00:04:02.740> develop<00:04:03.100> our

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
to speed it up and to develop our

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.860 
to speed it up and to develop our
ability<00:04:03.790> of<00:04:03.940> coordination

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
ability of coordination

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.510 
ability of coordination
I<00:04:04.900> recommend<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:05.890> following<00:04:06.040> three

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
I recommend the following three

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.270 
I recommend the following three
exercises<00:04:07.240> the<00:04:07.870> first<00:04:08.110> one<00:04:08.380> works<00:04:08.830> with<00:04:09.040> four

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
exercises the first one works with four

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.530 
exercises the first one works with four
notes<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:11.680> you<00:04:11.800> play<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.130> first<00:04:12.340> Lord<00:04:13.030> three

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
notes and you play the first Lord three

00:04:13.540 --> 00:05:04.150 
notes and you play the first Lord three
times<00:04:24.480> then<00:04:25.480> you<00:04:25.630> triple<00:04:25.960> the<00:04:25.990> second<00:04:26.410> one

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.000 

then<00:05:05.160> you<00:05:05.340> have<00:05:05.490> a<00:05:05.520> group<00:05:05.790> of<00:05:05.940> three<00:05:06.240> nodes<00:05:07.010> and

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
then you have a group of three nodes and

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.470 
then you have a group of three nodes and
work<00:05:08.910> with<00:05:09.120> it

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
work with it

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:23.650 
work with it
similarly<00:05:10.050> we<00:05:11.040> double<00:05:11.580> the<00:05:11.910> first<00:05:12.210> one

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:49.300 

then<00:05:24.050> we<00:05:24.500> double<00:05:24.860> the<00:05:24.980> second<00:05:25.310> one<00:05:47.890> it<00:05:48.890> is<00:05:49.040> very

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
then we double the second one it is very

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.610 
then we double the second one it is very
important<00:05:49.970> that<00:05:50.390> you<00:05:50.570> find<00:05:50.810> the<00:05:50.930> right<00:05:51.020> temple

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
important that you find the right temple

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.970 
important that you find the right temple
for<00:05:51.830> you<00:05:52.180> never<00:05:53.180> play<00:05:53.690> faster<00:05:54.380> than<00:05:54.410> you<00:05:54.740> can

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:54.980 
for you never play faster than you can

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.300 
for you never play faster than you can
think<00:05:55.540> if<00:05:56.540> there's<00:05:56.810> anything<00:05:57.110> you<00:05:57.830> don't<00:05:57.860> have

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
think if there's anything you don't have

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.710 
think if there's anything you don't have
under<00:05:58.760> control<00:05:59.180> you<00:05:59.810> are<00:05:59.840> playing<00:06:00.200> too<00:06:00.530> fast

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
under control you are playing too fast

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.380 
under control you are playing too fast
make<00:06:02.720> sure<00:06:02.960> that<00:06:03.560> your<00:06:03.740> fingers<00:06:04.090> come<00:06:05.090> before

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 
make sure that your fingers come before

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.760 
make sure that your fingers come before
the<00:06:05.900> bow<00:06:06.110> comes<00:06:07.660> finally<00:06:08.660> you<00:06:09.260> have<00:06:09.410> the<00:06:09.560> group

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
the bow comes finally you have the group

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:25.549 
the bow comes finally you have the group
of<00:06:09.980> two<00:06:10.310> and<00:06:10.690> practice<00:06:11.690> them<00:06:11.960> like<00:06:12.530> that

00:06:25.549 --> 00:06:25.559 

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:29.059 

and<00:06:26.009> the<00:06:26.639> other<00:06:26.759> way<00:06:26.909> around
