00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.510 
I think that's why I see Steve making
the<00:01:24.330> same<00:01:24.479> play<00:01:24.659> oh<00:01:25.009> there's<00:01:26.009> line<00:01:26.130> up<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.340> top

the same play oh there's line up the top

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.580 
the same play oh there's line up the top
which<00:01:26.700> allows<00:01:27.030> Jonathan<00:01:27.929> to<00:01:28.020> play<00:01:28.229> dragon

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
which allows Jonathan to play dragon

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.230

impact tremors on the board at six life

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.709 
impact tremors on the board at six life
it<00:05:21.830> is<00:05:22.099> going<00:05:22.759> to<00:05:22.879> be<00:05:22.969> hard<00:05:23.210> from<00:05:23.419> the<00:05:23.449> piece

00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:23.719 
it is going to be hard from the piece

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:27.070 
it is going to be hard from the piece
together<00:05:25.000> plays<00:05:26.000> that<00:05:26.300> can<00:05:26.419> win<00:05:26.569> this<00:05:26.719> it

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
together plays that can win this it

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.390 
together plays that can win this it
would<00:05:27.199> start<00:05:27.439> with<00:05:27.469> him<00:05:27.650> top<00:05:27.800> taking<00:05:28.099> a<00:05:28.189> rose

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
would start with him top taking a rose

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.610 
would start with him top taking a rose
yeah<00:05:28.729> that's<00:05:28.909> what<00:05:29.000> I<00:05:29.030> think<00:05:29.120> too<00:05:29.620> just

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
yeah that's what I think too just

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.600 
yeah that's what I think too just
getting<00:05:30.800> the<00:05:30.860> siege<00:05:30.979> right<00:05:31.129> off<00:05:31.250> the<00:05:31.340> table

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
getting the siege right off the table

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:32.890 
getting the siege right off the table
and<00:05:31.669> then<00:05:31.819> you<00:05:32.000> know<00:05:32.120> you<00:05:32.180> saw<00:05:32.419> mance<00:05:32.629> cry<00:05:32.840> the

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
and then you know you saw mance cry the

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.330 
and then you know you saw mance cry the
top<00:05:33.080> card<00:05:33.229> to<00:05:33.319> the<00:05:33.409> bottom<00:05:33.680> so<00:05:33.860> then<00:05:34.190> you<00:05:34.250> have

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
top card to the bottom so then you have

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.709 
top card to the bottom so then you have
to<00:05:34.430> hope<00:05:34.550> that<00:05:34.580> Steve<00:05:34.819> just<00:05:35.060> kind<00:05:35.479> of<00:05:35.509> draws

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:35.719 
to hope that Steve just kind of draws

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:37.809 
to hope that Steve just kind of draws
pretty<00:05:35.960> poorly<00:05:36.229> yeah<00:05:36.830> Carillo<00:05:37.370> draws<00:05:37.550> roast

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:37.819 
pretty poorly yeah Carillo draws roast

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:39.309 
pretty poorly yeah Carillo draws roast
then<00:05:38.060> maybe<00:05:38.210> draws<00:05:38.419> hardly<00:05:38.719> an<00:05:38.780> outburst<00:05:38.840> now

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:39.319 
then maybe draws hardly an outburst now

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:43.059 
then maybe draws hardly an outburst now
we're<00:05:39.469> talking<00:05:39.830> like<00:05:39.979> he<00:05:40.099> has<00:05:40.219> a<00:05:40.250> shot<00:05:40.490> yeah<00:05:42.069> to
