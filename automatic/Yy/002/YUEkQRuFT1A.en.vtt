p600<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.170> same<00:00:46.410> design<00:00:46.590> like<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.129> P<00:00:47.340> 530

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
p600 is the same design like the P 530

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.760 
p600 is the same design like the P 530
but<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.660> difference<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.379> has<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.559> very

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
but the difference is it has a very

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.040 
but the difference is it has a very
tangled<00:00:50.309> LCD<00:00:51.149> screen<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.629> button<00:00:51.870> placement

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
tangled LCD screen the button placement

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.389 
tangled LCD screen the button placement
is<00:00:52.289> pretty<00:00:52.469> much<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.739> same<00:00:52.860> thing<00:00:53.070> like<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.219> P

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
is pretty much the same thing like the P

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.729 
is pretty much the same thing like the P
530<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.300> only<00:00:54.510> thing<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.170> your<00:00:55.440> thumb

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
530 the only thing is that your thumb

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.560 
530 the only thing is that your thumb
has<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.160> go<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.309> little<00:00:56.520> higher<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.180> touch<00:00:57.360> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
has to go a little higher to touch the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.810 
has to go a little higher to touch the
viewfinder<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.680> has<00:00:58.800> an<00:00:58.980> extra<00:00:59.340> zoom<00:00:59.609> on

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
viewfinder and it has an extra zoom on

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.400 
viewfinder and it has an extra zoom on
the<00:00:59.940> left<00:01:00.120> side<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> camera<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:01.109> me<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
the left side of the camera to me the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.319 
the left side of the camera to me the
zoom<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.859> same<00:01:02.100> thing<00:01:02.340> like<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.640> P<00:01:02.820> 530

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
zoom is the same thing like the P 530

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.109 
zoom is the same thing like the P 530
but<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.049> only<00:01:04.199> difference<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.220> P<00:01:05.400> 530<00:01:05.850> has

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
but the only difference is the P 530 has

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.250 
but the only difference is the P 530 has
42<00:01:06.930> times<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.830> P<00:01:08.010> 600<00:01:08.640> has<00:01:08.880> 60<00:01:09.450> times<00:01:09.689> that

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
42 times the P 600 has 60 times that

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.190 
42 times the P 600 has 60 times that
makes<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.590> able<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:11.130> zoom<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.820> even<00:01:12.090> more<00:01:12.540> move

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
makes you able to zoom in even more move

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.609 
makes you able to zoom in even more move
no<00:01:13.799> more<00:01:14.720> the<00:01:15.720> video<00:01:15.960> quality<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> same

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
no more the video quality is the same

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.600 
no more the video quality is the same
thing<00:01:17.070> like<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.340> P<00:01:17.520> 530<00:01:18.259> 1080p<00:01:19.259> full-hd<00:01:19.650> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
thing like the P 530 1080p full-hd the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.190 
thing like the P 530 1080p full-hd the
only<00:01:20.850> difference<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.509> now<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.720> can<00:01:21.869> zoom

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
only difference is that now I can zoom

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.109 
only difference is that now I can zoom
in<00:01:22.380> even<00:01:22.530> further<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:23.580> main<00:01:23.759> thing<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.000> I
