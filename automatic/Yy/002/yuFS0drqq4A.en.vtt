than taste capisce part of that is

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.320 
than taste capisce part of that is
because<00:04:49.860> they've<00:04:50.220> rammed<00:04:50.610> all<00:04:50.880> this<00:04:51.000> into<00:04:51.300> a

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
because they've rammed all this into a

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.630 
because they've rammed all this into a

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
much shorter frame this kind of look is

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.130 
much shorter frame this kind of look is
carried<00:04:54.000> off<00:04:54.060> much<00:04:54.330> better<00:04:54.540> on<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:54.780> Sonata

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
carried off much better on the Sonata

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.630 
carried off much better on the Sonata
because<00:04:55.560> it's<00:04:55.740> got<00:04:55.890> a<00:04:55.920> little<00:04:56.100> more<00:04:56.340> length

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
because it's got a little more length

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.210 
because it's got a little more length
but<00:04:56.970> the<00:04:57.330> cardinal<00:04:57.900> sin<00:04:58.140> in<00:04:58.200> this<00:04:58.410> category<00:04:59.010> is

but the cardinal sin in this category is

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.910 
but the cardinal sin in this category is
to<00:04:59.640> look<00:04:59.850> like<00:05:00.090> a<00:05:00.120> Nakano<00:05:00.630> box<00:05:00.990> they<00:05:01.560> avoid
