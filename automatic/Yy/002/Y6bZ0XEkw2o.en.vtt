00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.590 
this glyph but some of that pipe might
be<00:00:36.870> fake<00:00:37.110> but<00:00:37.410> from<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.460> point<00:00:38.670> out<00:00:39.090> you're

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
be fake but from that point out you're

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.700 
be fake but from that point out you're
outside<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.200> map<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:42.320> yeah<00:00:43.320> it's<00:00:43.559> a

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
outside of the map and yeah it's a

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.200 
outside of the map and yeah it's a
pretty<00:00:43.980> cool<00:00:44.280> delish<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.820> haven't<00:00:45.059> been

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
pretty cool delish I haven't been

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.389 
pretty cool delish I haven't been
outside<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:45.780> map<00:00:45.989> but<00:00:46.289> by<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:46.980> looks<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.280> it

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
outside this map but by the looks of it

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.040 
outside this map but by the looks of it
and<00:00:47.579> there's<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.789> bunch<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.149> developer<00:00:48.809> looking

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
and there's a bunch of developer looking

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.290 
and there's a bunch of developer looking
room<00:00:49.610> such<00:00:50.610> as<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.030> blue<00:00:51.270> box<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.809> way<00:00:52.160> but

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
room such as that blue box in way but

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.970 
room such as that blue box in way but
there's<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.390> couple<00:00:54.750> more<00:00:55.050> glitches<00:00:55.379> on<00:00:55.710> here

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
there's a couple more glitches on here

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.840 
there's a couple more glitches on here
and<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.940> know<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.930> found<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.070> one<00:00:59.520> bounce

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
and I know that I found this one bounce

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.330 
and I know that I found this one bounce
and<00:01:00.329> I'm<00:01:00.750> gonna<00:01:00.989> try<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.469> do<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.770> again<00:01:02.010> but<00:01:02.219> it

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
and I'm gonna try and do it again but it

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.119 
and I'm gonna try and do it again but it
was<00:01:02.520> like<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:03.000> once-in-a-lifetime<00:01:03.600> thing<00:01:04.129> is

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
was like a once-in-a-lifetime thing is

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.450 
was like a once-in-a-lifetime thing is
actually<00:01:05.339> pretty<00:01:05.640> cool<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:06.060> do<00:01:06.240> because<00:01:06.810> I

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
actually pretty cool to do because I

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.370 
actually pretty cool to do because I
mean<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.850> don't<00:01:08.939> really<00:01:09.119> see<00:01:09.390> bounces<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.049> was

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380
