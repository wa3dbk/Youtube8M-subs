00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.670
 hobby let's get to know the wave be rb 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.740
 one of the segment leaders together 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.140
 with luisa in xtrail and made me 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.119
 Accompany by friends we are already on board 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.680
 of our crv there is he going to 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.750
 drive it a little to see how it is 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.640
 the performance is version from a point 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.520
 of view is the most rational why 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.800
 because it's the second model in the range and 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.030
 already has technology as against 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.250
 cruise control 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.079
 audio at the wheel a screen of 7 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.949
 inches with 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.559
 with bluetooth phone connection 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:53.649
 streaming and other information 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.750
 relevant we also find the 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.670
 crystals treated as well as headlights 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.730
 fog in this new generation in this 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.829
 2015 new version of meetings will be reviewed 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.989
 brand went a little further and apart from 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.550
 aesthetic changes such as headlights 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.560
 new new skulls some 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.450
 plastics like the new grill and 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.649
 some changes in the interior also 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.909
 we found mechanical changes 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:14.710
 substantial 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.409
 this version or this new headquarters has 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.630
 with 2.4 liter engine 185 horsepower 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.330
 strength with air train technology that 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.280
 along with the button and with do some 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.250
 modifications so that a 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.740
 less possible fuel too and such 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.530
 one of the most important is the 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.840
 incorporation of a cbt box 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.179
 advanced generation that helps reduce 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.950
 much consumption and that the truth is 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.080
 which from my point of view is one of 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.610
 the best applications of this type of 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.080
 transmissions since you do not feel for 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.330
 nothing slow like in some other models 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.310
 makes the handling quite agile and 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.160
 comfortable apart from the two and the consumptions 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.550
 of fuel the sub light 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:59.400
 characterized by a crb family approach 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.350
 has a 100% family focus has a 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.620
 Large cargo space has materials 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.210
 Resistant exist soft or hard are 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.760
 resistant so that with the 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.590
 over the years do not deteriorate in 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.480
 space is very wide for five 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.370
 people the floor in the back in 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.380
 the back stones practically 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.660
 flat so they do not exist 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.280
 obstructions and the third passenger or the 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.040
 passenger in the middle goes without any problem 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.560
 the trunk is also quite high and 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.540
 very deep what guarantees power 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.480
 count or travel with all the luggage that 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.900
 you need to part in question of 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.340
 I handle the truth is that it is a 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.500
 subsidy and light that really got 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.340
 feels light does not feel heavy 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.020
 reactions are quick for the kind of 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.030
 vehicle that is what we are 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.310
 speaking he has disc brakes on the 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.800
 four wheels 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.470
 At first, they tend to look like a 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.920
 little more reactive than I expected from 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.020
 what we expected when supposing 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.580
 immediately the and the pedal or the foot 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.489
 sorry about the brake pedal these 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.140
 they react energetically question of 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.420
 get used to the touch of them 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.220
 but well this paid the focus of 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.720
 security in guate finished security 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.860
 we have six airbags 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.150
 abs traction control and stability 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.459
 as well as braking assistance which 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.799
 guarantees the safety of your family 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.959
 as long as the driving is 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.239
 within the limits for those who are 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.670
 designed this type of vehicles the 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.840
 design from the point of view improvement 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.480
 with respect to the previous generation 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.120
 we found a little more modernity 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.400
 We have headlights with LED lights 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.170
 day lighting that give a touch 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.150
 more modern is something that suddenly 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.489
 you need Japanese brands that 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.130
 they tend to go a little for practicality 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.080
 more than for luxury they will understand 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.940
 that it is necessary to do it and good in 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.280
 this new version incorporates this 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.380
 characteristics and good let's meet 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.580
 a little more about space we remember 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.860
 which is a family vehicle 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.600
 and space is the most important thing to 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.700
 good mates we are already in the 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.710
 interior of the renovated of our headquarters 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.940
 revealed neither 15 can we see that in this 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.070
 digital version we have a 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.750
 7-inch screen apart from the one 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.040
 we have here in front we are going to light a 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.840
 little our vehicle 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.180
 for conclusions we have with darling 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.709
 links to iphone the top screen 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.199
 is the computer information of 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.759
 trip that we can control from a 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:21.109
 button on the steering wheel we can change it 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:23.410
 with a clock 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.150
 also information 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.190
 and good travel computaba we have 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.890
 our simple air conditioning and 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.630
 the finishes are very good we have a 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.700
 apparent seam on the plastic though 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.100
 it's not a real seam since everything is 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:39.220
 a single piece of plastic is a 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.110
 good contact plastic from here 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.210
 down is soft the dakar is a little more 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.970
 rigid and good we have to our 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.710
 flashing the steering wheel in this version 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.150
 also not covered in leather 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.090
 then it is also plastic 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.310
 contact control cruise controls 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.039
 audio control hands also to 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.840
 flyer and good some others 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:02.449
 tools to store objects 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.819
 our audio system our vision 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:07.729
 digital connects with phone 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:10.370
 we also have audio by bluetooth a 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:13.039
 consumer information system 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.840
 fuel controls these buttons 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:16.610
 They are a little small for my taste but 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.710
 that does not mean it's difficult to 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.599
 act what we simply miss them 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.909
 some elements a knob or something 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:24.470
 but outside of that does not generate any 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:26.750
 problem is actually an interior 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.569
 simple more not because of this austere has 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.490
 all the equipment we need but then 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:34.220
 if it gives the appearance of being 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.259
 and that a discreet interior especially 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.780
 we have this plastic of the finished type 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:41.330
 aluminum that gives our view a lot 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.099
 horns on the posts apart from the 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.800
 speakers on the doors 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:47.660
 We have an input and an output 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.639
 energy also here apart the one that 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.069
 we have inside our console 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:53.810
 central and in our table instruments 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:55.699
 we also have information through 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.770
 a screen and traditional watches 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:01.270
 this version before we say goodbye to them 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.620
 I want to comment costs 356 thousand 900 pesos 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.060
 It is not the most economical market 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.520
 there is a version that starts 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.889
 around 320 thousand as his 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.900
 competition but for the team and the 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:14.419
 Quality above all for quality 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.389
 proven brand it seems to me that it is a 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:21.409
 long- term investment or is a one 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:23.120
 purchase rather said that it will last longer than 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:24.530
 what we expect from part of the 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.199
 vehicles with greater resale in the 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:29.330
 then good market 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:31.220
 satisfaction is guaranteed maybe 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.639
 there are more sporty vehicles if you 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.740
 approach is more familiar 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:38.080
 Quiet handling fuel consumption 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.979
 undoubtedly reduced because it has reversed a 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.979
 of the options to consider 

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:51.600
 together with louis have extracted in their 

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:54.300
