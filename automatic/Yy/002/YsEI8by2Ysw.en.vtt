cardiac<00:00:18.600> life<00:00:18.779> support<00:00:19.039> CPR<00:00:20.039> so<00:00:21.000> there<00:00:21.150> was

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
cardiac life support CPR so there was

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.570 
cardiac life support CPR so there was
some<00:00:21.390> major<00:00:21.600> changes<00:00:21.720> in<00:00:22.260> october<00:00:23.010> november

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
some major changes in october november

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.240 
some major changes in october november
and<00:00:23.760> American<00:00:24.539> Heart<00:00:24.720> Association

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
and American Heart Association

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.470 
and American Heart Association
recommendations<00:00:26.250> for<00:00:26.609> basic<00:00:27.000> cardiac<00:00:27.330> life

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
recommendations for basic cardiac life

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.460 
recommendations for basic cardiac life
support<00:00:28.130> so<00:00:29.130> one<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.849> most<00:00:30.320> right<00:00:31.320> up

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
support so one of the most right up

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.400 
support so one of the most right up
front<00:00:31.769> near<00:00:31.920> face<00:00:32.160> changes<00:00:32.790> was<00:00:33.059> not<00:00:33.570> ABC

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
front near face changes was not ABC

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.150 
front near face changes was not ABC
anymore<00:00:35.040> it's<00:00:35.370> CA<00:00:36.300> B<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.860> it's<00:00:37.980> pretty

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
anymore it's CA B so it's pretty

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.750 
anymore it's CA B so it's pretty
interesting<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:39.059> airway<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:40.170> breathing<00:00:41.010> is

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
interesting so airway and breathing is

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.569 
interesting so airway and breathing is
not<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.300> priority<00:00:42.540> anymore<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.590> adults<00:00:44.190> of

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
not the priority anymore in adults of

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.690 
not the priority anymore in adults of
cardiac<00:00:45.210> arrest<00:00:45.860> so<00:00:46.860> remember<00:00:47.010> it's<00:00:47.219> adils<00:00:47.579> of

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
cardiac arrest so remember it's adils of

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.090 
cardiac arrest so remember it's adils of
cardiac<00:00:48.030> arrest<00:00:48.480> if<00:00:48.780> you're<00:00:49.410> approaching<00:00:49.950> a

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
cardiac arrest if you're approaching a

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.819 
cardiac arrest if you're approaching a
victim<00:00:50.730> on<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.000> floor<00:00:51.329> that's<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.350> cardiac

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
victim on the floor that's in cardiac

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.889 
victim on the floor that's in cardiac
arrest<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:54.059> first<00:00:54.300> thing<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.539> going<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.809> do

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
arrest the first thing you going to do

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.560 
arrest the first thing you going to do
is<00:00:55.110> take<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.320> good<00:00:55.590> look<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.160> when<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.180> look<00:00:57.210> at

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
is take a good look and when you look at

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.599 
is take a good look and when you look at
them<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.079> see<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.469> they're<00:00:58.680> really<00:00:59.430> not

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
them and you see that they're really not

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.090 
them and you see that they're really not
responsive<00:01:00.539> there<00:01:01.109> they<00:01:01.710> don't<00:01:01.920> look<00:01:02.039> like

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
responsive there they don't look like

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.429 
responsive there they don't look like
they're<00:01:02.399> breathing<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:03.629> are<00:01:03.780> going<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.290> go

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
they're breathing you are going to go

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.109 
they're breathing you are going to go
directly<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:06.330> circulation<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:08.070> c<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.670> for

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
directly to circulation so c is for

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.740 
directly to circulation so c is for
circulation<00:01:09.619> so<00:01:10.619> that's<00:01:10.830> first<00:01:11.159> now<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.909> then

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
circulation so that's first now and then

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.160 
circulation so that's first now and then
it's<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.680> B<00:01:14.010> airway<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.970> breathing<00:01:15.170> so

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
it's a and B airway and breathing so

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.140 
it's a and B airway and breathing so
they<00:01:16.350> say<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.740> adults<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.340> cardiac<00:01:17.670> arrest

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
they say the adults and cardiac arrest

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.410 
they say the adults and cardiac arrest
has<00:01:18.540> probably<00:01:19.250> close<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.280> ten<00:01:20.850> minutes<00:01:21.090> of

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
has probably close to ten minutes of

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.980 
has probably close to ten minutes of
oxygen<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:22.049> their<00:01:22.229> body<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.610> last<00:01:24.509> until

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
oxygen in their body to to last until

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.130 
oxygen in their body to to last until
maybe<00:01:25.560> 911<00:01:26.280> comes<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.570> know<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.930> first

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
maybe 911 comes so you know the first

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.080 
maybe 911 comes so you know the first
thing<00:01:28.290> we<00:01:28.470> really<00:01:28.650> do<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.220> phone<00:01:29.549> first<00:01:29.850> you

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
thing we really do is phone first you

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.510 
thing we really do is phone first you
need<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.390> get<00:01:30.869> 911<00:01:31.140> on<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.829> way<00:01:31.979> with<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.400> you

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
need to get 911 on the way with it you

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.310 
need to get 911 on the way with it you
know<00:01:32.549> emergency<00:01:33.150> equipment<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.960> they<00:01:33.990> can

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
know emergency equipment so they can

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.899 
know emergency equipment so they can
take<00:01:34.530> care<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.009> airway<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.549> breathing

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
take care of the airway in the breathing

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.719 
take care of the airway in the breathing
part<00:01:36.090> for<00:01:36.450> us<00:01:36.740> so<00:01:37.740> not<00:01:37.979> only<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.579> an

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
part for us so not only is this an

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.880 
part for us so not only is this an
advantage<00:01:39.240> for<00:01:39.509> us<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:40.110> know<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.560> street

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
advantage for us you know in the street

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.069 
advantage for us you know in the street
where<00:01:41.189> many<00:01:41.820> people<00:01:42.210> are<00:01:42.329> afraid<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.720> do

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
where many people are afraid to do

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.590 
where many people are afraid to do
mouth-to-mouth<00:01:43.290> on<00:01:43.979> victims<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.420> an

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
mouth-to-mouth on victims it is an

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.870 
mouth-to-mouth on victims it is an
advantage<00:01:45.899> for<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.649> victim<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.670> get

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
advantage for the victim to get

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.300 
advantage for the victim to get
compressions<00:01:48.570> done<00:01:48.869> right<00:01:49.110> away<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:50.189> know

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
compressions done right away to you know

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.700 
compressions done right away to you know
improve<00:01:50.790> or<00:01:51.119> increase<00:01:51.240> or<00:01:52.020> continue

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
improve or increase or continue

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.179 
improve or increase or continue
circulation<00:01:53.520> throughout<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.509> body<00:01:55.009> so<00:01:56.009> they

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
circulation throughout the body so they

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.100 
circulation throughout the body so they
really<00:01:56.399> are<00:01:56.700> downplaying<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.479> whole<00:01:57.689> look

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
really are downplaying that whole look

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.340 
really are downplaying that whole look
listen<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.040> feel<00:01:59.210> for<00:02:00.210> breathing<00:02:00.750> because<00:02:00.990> it

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
listen and feel for breathing because it

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.310 
listen and feel for breathing because it
takes<00:02:01.740> too<00:02:02.040> long<00:02:02.070> it's<00:02:02.729> very<00:02:03.360> difficult<00:02:03.689> and

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
takes too long it's very difficult and

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.800 
takes too long it's very difficult and
then<00:02:04.920> it's<00:02:05.040> even<00:02:05.280> difficult<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:06.149> find<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.540> pulse

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
then it's even difficult to find a pulse

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.960 
then it's even difficult to find a pulse
on<00:02:07.079> somebody<00:02:07.560> when<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:08.310> have<00:02:08.489> just<00:02:08.729> maybe

when<00:02:57.440> we<00:02:57.560> used<00:02:57.709> to<00:02:57.799> say<00:02:58.040> at<00:02:58.280> 100<00:02:58.819> now<00:02:59.390> it's<00:02:59.630> at

when we used to say at 100 now it's at

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.589 
when we used to say at 100 now it's at
least<00:03:00.130> remember<00:03:01.130> that<00:03:01.430> recoil<00:03:02.090> which<00:03:02.360> means

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
least remember that recoil which means

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.570 
least remember that recoil which means
coming<00:03:02.989> back<00:03:03.170> off<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.620> chest<00:03:03.890> is<00:03:04.160> probably

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
coming back off the chest is probably

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.920 
coming back off the chest is probably
the<00:03:04.700> most<00:03:04.730> important<00:03:05.360> part<00:03:05.569> of<00:03:05.690> chest

thrusts for the conscious choking victim
yes<00:03:57.590> that's<00:03:57.829> what<00:03:57.980> they<00:03:58.010> still<00:03:58.400> highly

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
yes that's what they still highly

yes that's what they still highly
recommend<00:03:59.359> and<00:04:00.200> that<00:04:00.410> is<00:04:00.560> probably<00:04:00.920> ninety

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
that is unsuccessful they even talk

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.120 
that is unsuccessful they even talk
about<00:04:12.859> adding<00:04:13.430> the<00:04:14.150> chest<00:04:14.889> compressions<00:04:15.889> in

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
about adding the chest compressions in

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.849 
about adding the chest compressions in
even<00:04:17.090> banging<00:04:17.510> on<00:04:17.600> the<00:04:17.780> somebody's<00:04:18.019> back<00:04:18.530> we

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
even banging on the somebody's back we

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.830 
even banging on the somebody's back we
know<00:04:19.010> everybody<00:04:19.580> talks<00:04:19.640> about<00:04:19.940> their<00:04:20.570> mother

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
know everybody talks about their mother

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.640 
know everybody talks about their mother
hitting<00:04:21.260> them<00:04:21.349> on<00:04:21.470> the

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
hitting them on the

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.650 
hitting them on the
back<00:04:21.799> and<00:04:22.040> that<00:04:22.160> works<00:04:22.430> so<00:04:23.090> American<00:04:23.419> Heart

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
back and that works so American Heart

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.260 
back and that works so American Heart
Association<00:04:23.930> recognizes<00:04:24.680> that<00:04:25.340> we<00:04:26.000> probably

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
Association recognizes that we probably

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.930 
Association recognizes that we probably
should<00:04:26.570> try<00:04:26.780> anything<00:04:27.139> possibly<00:04:28.040> to<00:04:28.610> get<00:04:28.820> the

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
should try anything possibly to get the

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.779 
should try anything possibly to get the
obstruction<00:04:29.660> out<00:04:30.220> abdominal<00:04:31.220> thrusts<00:04:31.490> first

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:31.789 
obstruction out abdominal thrusts first

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:33.670 
obstruction out abdominal thrusts first
because<00:04:32.570> I<00:04:32.660> think<00:04:32.900> that's<00:04:33.080> what<00:04:33.229> we<00:04:33.350> know<00:04:33.530> how

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
because I think that's what we know how

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.770 
because I think that's what we know how
to<00:04:33.740> do<00:04:33.979> and<00:04:34.250> I<00:04:34.370> think<00:04:34.400> that's<00:04:34.880> what<00:04:35.090> works<00:04:35.360> best

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
to do and I think that's what works best

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.800 
to do and I think that's what works best
if<00:04:36.229> this<00:04:37.220> does<00:04:37.430> not<00:04:37.460> work<00:04:37.759> you<00:04:38.419> know<00:04:38.600> your

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
if this does not work you know your

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.420 
if this does not work you know your
victim<00:04:39.259> that's<00:04:39.440> choking<00:04:39.710> will<00:04:40.070> become

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
victim that's choking will become

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.180 
victim that's choking will become
unconscious<00:04:41.330> will<00:04:42.289> glide<00:04:42.530> them<00:04:42.710> safely<00:04:43.100> to

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
unconscious will glide them safely to

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.060 
unconscious will glide them safely to
the<00:04:43.460> floor<00:04:43.850> and<00:04:44.120> begin<00:04:45.020> chest<00:04:45.440> compressions

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
the floor and begin chest compressions

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.760 
the floor and begin chest compressions
five<00:04:46.759> cycles<00:04:47.090> of<00:04:47.479> 32<00:04:48.050> to<00:04:48.229> until<00:04:48.680> the

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
five cycles of 32 to until the

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.670 
five cycles of 32 to until the
obstruction<00:04:49.280> comes<00:04:49.550> out<00:04:50.259> now<00:04:51.259> if<00:04:51.380> you<00:04:51.530> were<00:04:51.650> to

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
obstruction comes out now if you were to

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.680 
obstruction comes out now if you were to
come<00:04:52.009> across<00:04:52.400> somebody<00:04:52.669> that<00:04:53.509> was

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
come across somebody that was

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.409 
come across somebody that was
unconscious<00:04:54.440> on<00:04:54.620> the<00:04:54.650> ground<00:04:54.800> that<00:04:55.550> was

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
unconscious on the ground that was

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.570 
unconscious on the ground that was
choking<00:04:57.260> but<00:04:57.440> we<00:04:57.590> wouldn't<00:04:57.860> know<00:04:58.160> about<00:04:58.370> it

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
choking but we wouldn't know about it

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.900 
choking but we wouldn't know about it
you<00:04:59.510> would<00:04:59.750> begin<00:05:00.260> the<00:05:00.949> chest<00:05:01.280> compressions

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
you would begin the chest compressions

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.450 
you would begin the chest compressions
because<00:05:02.300> they<00:05:02.720> were<00:05:02.780> unconscious<00:05:03.740> their

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
because they were unconscious their

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.909 
because they were unconscious their
color<00:05:04.760> probably<00:05:05.270> wasn't<00:05:05.630> good<00:05:05.840> and<00:05:06.110> there

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
color probably wasn't good and there

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.400 
color probably wasn't good and there
wasn't<00:05:07.130> any<00:05:07.460> sign<00:05:07.850> of<00:05:08.330> movement<00:05:08.570> or<00:05:08.930> breathing

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
wasn't any sign of movement or breathing

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.040 
wasn't any sign of movement or breathing
so<00:05:10.160> we're<00:05:10.370> told<00:05:10.580> now<00:05:10.880> to<00:05:10.940> begin<00:05:11.389> chest

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
so we're told now to begin chest

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.589 
so we're told now to begin chest
compressions<00:05:12.710> so<00:05:13.669> when<00:05:13.820> you<00:05:13.940> do<00:05:14.180> finish<00:05:14.479> your

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:14.599 
compressions so when you do finish your

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:17.439 
compressions so when you do finish your
30<00:05:15.080> compressions<00:05:15.800> and<00:05:16.310> you<00:05:16.820> go<00:05:17.000> to<00:05:17.060> give<00:05:17.300> you

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:17.449 
30 compressions and you go to give you

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:20.110 
30 compressions and you go to give you
two<00:05:17.690> breaths<00:05:18.139> that's<00:05:18.979> when<00:05:19.280> you'll<00:05:19.430> recognize

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
two breaths that's when you'll recognize

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.749 
two breaths that's when you'll recognize
that<00:05:20.419> there's<00:05:20.630> an<00:05:20.720> obstruction<00:05:21.280> so<00:05:22.280> maybe<00:05:22.550> at

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:22.759 
that there's an obstruction so maybe at

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:25.900 
that there's an obstruction so maybe at
that<00:05:22.789> time<00:05:24.160> just<00:05:25.160> because<00:05:25.490> that's<00:05:25.639> what<00:05:25.820> we

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
that time just because that's what we

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.060 
that time just because that's what we
naturally<00:05:26.060> do<00:05:26.449> is<00:05:26.630> reposition<00:05:27.500> and<00:05:27.650> try<00:05:27.889> those

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
naturally do is reposition and try those

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.070 
naturally do is reposition and try those
two<00:05:28.310> breaths<00:05:28.580> again<00:05:28.970> you'll<00:05:29.750> certainly

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
two breaths again you'll certainly

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.050 
two breaths again you'll certainly
confirm<00:05:30.830> that<00:05:31.190> your<00:05:31.370> victim<00:05:31.699> has<00:05:31.940> an
