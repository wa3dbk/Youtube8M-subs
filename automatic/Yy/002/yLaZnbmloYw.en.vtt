00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.860 

oh<00:00:01.010> that's<00:00:02.010> the<00:00:02.220> stator<00:00:02.520> on<00:00:02.879> the<00:00:03.000> warrior<00:00:03.330> so

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
oh that's the stator on the warrior so

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.579 
oh that's the stator on the warrior so
you<00:00:03.959> pull<00:00:04.170> that<00:00:04.290> side<00:00:04.529> off<00:00:05.960> well<00:00:06.960> right<00:00:07.319> there

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
you pull that side off well right there

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.910 
you pull that side off well right there
is<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:07.919> sheared<00:00:08.189> key<00:00:08.809> and<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:10.019> flywheel<00:00:10.320> key

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
is the sheared key and the flywheel key

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.030 
is the sheared key and the flywheel key
was<00:00:11.820> on<00:00:12.150> pretty<00:00:13.139> much<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.380> bottom<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:13.980> the

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
was on pretty much the bottom of the

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.800 
was on pretty much the bottom of the
shaft<00:00:14.900> so<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:17.090> figure<00:00:18.090> out<00:00:18.210> how<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.390> dig<00:00:18.630> that

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
shaft so I figure out how to dig that

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:28.400 
shaft so I figure out how to dig that
key<00:00:19.080> out<00:00:20.600> that<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.840> one<00:00:22.199> very<00:00:22.650> broken<00:00:23.010> key<00:00:27.410> so

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
key out that is one very broken key so

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:36.520 
key out that is one very broken key so
if<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.830> can<00:00:29.240> let<00:00:30.240> me<00:00:30.330> just<00:00:30.539> get<00:00:30.660> my<00:00:30.720> screwdriver

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.840 

there's<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:37.739> much<00:00:37.890> metal<00:00:38.219> built<00:00:38.640> up<00:00:38.879> around<00:00:39.059> it

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
there's so much metal built up around it

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.549 
there's so much metal built up around it
from<00:00:41.850> when<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.120> was<00:00:42.149> dragging<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.260> look<00:00:43.440> at

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
from when it was dragging and look at

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:53.530 
from when it was dragging and look at
that<00:00:44.120> rag<00:00:45.120> doll<00:00:45.329> across<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.960> crankshaft

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.270 

yeah<00:00:54.540> that's<00:00:54.840> going<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.130> be<00:00:56.130> interesting

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
yeah that's going to be interesting

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.200 
yeah that's going to be interesting
figuring<00:00:57.000> out<00:00:57.060> how<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.210> get<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.540> out<00:00:59.210> that

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
figuring out how to get that out that

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.480 
figuring out how to get that out that
does<00:01:00.720> not<00:01:00.900> work<00:01:01.170> can't<00:01:01.800> get<00:01:01.950> down<00:01:02.130> in<00:01:02.340> there

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:02.490 
does not work can't get down in there

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.820 
does not work can't get down in there
far<00:01:02.820> enough<00:01:05.870> well<00:01:06.870> I'm<00:01:07.200> going<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.380> try<00:01:07.470> getting

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
far enough well I'm going to try getting

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.860 
far enough well I'm going to try getting
that<00:01:07.860> out<00:01:08.190> of<00:01:08.310> there<00:01:08.460> with<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> tiny<00:01:09.930> nail<00:01:10.580> and<00:01:11.870> a

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:12.870 
that out of there with a tiny nail and a

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.420 
that out of there with a tiny nail and a
little<00:01:13.110> hammer

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.270 

maybe<00:01:17.430> if<00:01:17.550> I<00:01:17.670> pound<00:01:17.940> right<00:01:18.150> on<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.390> key<00:01:19.280> circle

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
maybe if I pound right on the key circle

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.860 
maybe if I pound right on the key circle
back<00:01:21.500> hmm

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:33.200 

that<00:01:25.590> doesn't<00:01:25.950> seem<00:01:26.160> to<00:01:26.430> work<00:01:31.820> hey<00:01:32.820> there<00:01:33.090> we
