00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:02.470 

we've<00:00:01.140> done<00:00:01.290> a<00:00:01.319> little<00:00:01.620> quick<00:00:02.100> demonstration

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:02.480 
we've done a little quick demonstration

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.930 
we've done a little quick demonstration
of<00:00:03.480> painting<00:00:04.080> wet<00:00:04.200> rocks<00:00:04.500> for<00:00:05.400> our<00:00:05.490> website

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
of painting wet rocks for our website

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.870 
of painting wet rocks for our website
and<00:00:06.390> this<00:00:06.690> is<00:00:06.750> it<00:00:07.020> at<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.319> moment<00:00:07.799> we've<00:00:08.610> got

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
and this is it at the moment we've got

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.900 
and this is it at the moment we've got
the<00:00:09.870> sand<00:00:10.200> in<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.530> foreground<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.550> I've<00:00:11.670> done

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
the sand in the foreground and I've done

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.370 
the sand in the foreground and I've done
a<00:00:11.940> gradation<00:00:12.450> of<00:00:12.509> color<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.929> create<00:00:13.230> the

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
a gradation of color to create the

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.079 
a gradation of color to create the
illusion<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:14.009> receding<00:00:14.490> off<00:00:14.610> into<00:00:14.969> the

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
illusion of it receding off into the

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.080 
illusion of it receding off into the
distance<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:16.109> I've<00:00:16.830> used<00:00:17.130> some<00:00:17.369> tone<00:00:17.699> to

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
distance and I've used some tone to

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.220 
distance and I've used some tone to
create<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.960> rough<00:00:19.170> impression<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:19.980> form<00:00:20.789> and

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
create the rough impression of form and

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.470 
create the rough impression of form and
I've<00:00:22.230> also<00:00:22.439> just<00:00:23.310> very<00:00:23.519> quickly<00:00:23.789> blocked<00:00:24.240> in

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
I've also just very quickly blocked in

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.800 
I've also just very quickly blocked in
the<00:00:24.859> reflection<00:00:25.859> in<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.070> wet<00:00:26.220> sand<00:00:26.689> let<00:00:27.689> that

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
the reflection in the wet sand let that

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.189 
the reflection in the wet sand let that
dry<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.260> we'll<00:00:28.410> come<00:00:28.560> back<00:00:28.590> in<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.890> second<00:00:29.250> and

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
dry and we'll come back in a second and

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.359 
dry and we'll come back in a second and
I'll<00:00:31.199> put<00:00:31.380> some<00:00:31.529> highlights<00:00:31.710> on<00:00:32.099> it

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
I'll put some highlights on it

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.400 
I'll put some highlights on it
and<00:00:32.460> see<00:00:32.790> if<00:00:32.850> we<00:00:32.910> can<00:00:33.180> make<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:33.899> look<00:00:33.989> even<00:00:34.290> more

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
and see if we can make it look even more

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.370 
and see if we can make it look even more
realistic<00:00:35.059> now<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.450> dry<00:00:36.780> I'm<00:00:37.230> going

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
realistic now that this is dry I'm going

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.869 
realistic now that this is dry I'm going
to<00:00:37.469> create<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.860> illusion<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.460> rock<00:00:38.610> being

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
to create the illusion of the rock being

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.389 
to create the illusion of the rock being
wet<00:00:39.149> by<00:00:39.899> representing<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.770> sky<00:00:41.100> being

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
wet by representing the sky being

00:00:41.399 --> 00:01:29.390 
wet by representing the sky being
reflected<00:00:41.969> on<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.149> surface<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.690> it

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.620 

that<00:01:30.270> first<00:01:30.540> color<00:01:30.780> was<00:01:31.190> ultramarine<00:01:32.190> and

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
that first color was ultramarine and

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.020 
that first color was ultramarine and
white<00:01:33.630> that's<00:01:34.200> all<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.470> was<00:01:34.620> this<00:01:35.550> is<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.820> same

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
white that's all it was this is the same

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.760 
white that's all it was this is the same
thing<00:01:36.540> just<00:01:36.570> with<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.050> little<00:01:37.170> bit<00:01:37.350> more<00:01:37.500> white

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
thing just with a little bit more white

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:54.340 
thing just with a little bit more white
just

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.219 

so<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.380> used<00:01:55.650> ultramarine<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.670> white<00:01:57.229> to

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
so I used ultramarine and white to

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.859 
so I used ultramarine and white to
reflect<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.740> sky<00:01:59.009> up<00:01:59.250> here<00:01:59.549> but<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:00.689> back

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
reflect the sky up here but on this back

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.480 
reflect the sky up here but on this back
edge<00:02:01.110> here<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.409> want<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.710> different<00:02:02.100> part<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.369> the

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
edge here I want a different part of the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.550 
edge here I want a different part of the
sky<00:02:02.729> reflected<00:02:03.330> so<00:02:03.479> I've<00:02:03.570> used<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.869> cooler<00:02:04.200> blue

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
sky reflected so I've used a cooler blue

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.190 
sky reflected so I've used a cooler blue
I've<00:02:04.740> used<00:02:04.950> phthalo<00:02:05.430> blue<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.880> white<00:02:06.200> jazz

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
I've used phthalo blue and white jazz

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.770 
I've used phthalo blue and white jazz
Tajin<00:02:10.459> wet<00:02:11.459> rocks<00:02:11.700> obviously<00:02:12.300> are<00:02:12.420> very<00:02:12.450> shiny

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
Tajin wet rocks obviously are very shiny

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.970 
Tajin wet rocks obviously are very shiny
so<00:02:13.050> I'm<00:02:13.110> just<00:02:13.260> going<00:02:13.380> to<00:02:13.500> put<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.650> couple<00:02:13.860> of

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
so I'm just going to put a couple of

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.650 
so I'm just going to put a couple of
little<00:02:14.400> tiny<00:02:14.610> highlights<00:02:15.120> just<00:02:15.239> to<00:02:15.450> create

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
little tiny highlights just to create

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.330 
little tiny highlights just to create
the<00:02:15.930> impression<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.530> sunlight<00:02:16.769> bouncing

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
the impression of the sunlight bouncing

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:37.880 
the impression of the sunlight bouncing
off<00:02:17.489> them

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.900 

so<00:02:38.820> what<00:02:38.940> we've<00:02:39.060> done<00:02:39.150> here<00:02:39.390> is<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.570> very<00:02:39.900> quick

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
so what we've done here is a very quick

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.090 
so what we've done here is a very quick
version<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:42.180> a<00:02:42.240> wet<00:02:42.420> rock<00:02:42.660> but<00:02:43.350> we<00:02:43.380> used<00:02:43.710> the

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
version of a wet rock but we used the

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.540 
version of a wet rock but we used the
principles<00:02:44.670> that<00:02:44.760> we<00:02:45.030> spoke<00:02:45.330> about<00:02:45.390> on<00:02:45.900> our

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
principles that we spoke about on our

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.850 
principles that we spoke about on our
rock<00:02:47.550> painting<00:02:48.210> tutorial<00:02:48.870> page<00:02:49.110> so<00:02:49.680> that

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
rock painting tutorial page so that

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.180 
rock painting tutorial page so that
seems<00:02:50.070> time<00:02:50.310> swiftly<00:02:51.410> but<00:02:52.410> anyway<00:02:52.620> go<00:02:52.800> on<00:02:52.830> and

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
seems time swiftly but anyway go on and

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.860 
seems time swiftly but anyway go on and
have<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.370> look<00:02:53.430> there<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.270> you'll<00:02:54.390> see<00:02:54.630> that

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
have a look there and you'll see that

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.780 
have a look there and you'll see that
all<00:02:55.140> of<00:02:55.200> those<00:02:55.470> principles<00:02:55.860> are<00:02:56.250> explained<00:02:56.640> in

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
all of those principles are explained in

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.600 
all of those principles are explained in
little<00:02:57.000> bit<00:02:57.090> more<00:02:57.120> detail
