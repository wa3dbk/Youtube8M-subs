have to reverse the gear channel the

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.710 
have to reverse the gear channel the
reason<00:02:34.800> is<00:02:35.220> because<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:35.790> want<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.330> normal

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.250 
reason is because I want the normal
position<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:37.380> be<00:02:37.500> facing<00:02:38.489> down<00:02:38.810> instead<00:02:39.810> of<00:02:39.870> up

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
position to be facing down instead of up

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.210 
position to be facing down instead of up
so<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.280> reversed<00:02:41.550> at<00:02:41.940> first<00:02:43.040> okay<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.190> other

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
so I reversed at first okay the other

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.380 
so I reversed at first okay the other
requirement<00:02:45.060> is<00:02:47.480> at<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.570> endpoints<00:02:49.200> for

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
requirement is at the endpoints for

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:57.050 
requirement is at the endpoints for
channel<00:02:51.390> 6<00:02:51.600> which<00:02:52.050> is<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.260> pitch<00:02:52.650> channel<00:02:56.060> for

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
channel 6 which is the pitch channel for

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.590 
channel 6 which is the pitch channel for
the<00:02:57.239> mixing<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.870> work<00:02:58.580> about<00:02:59.580> that<00:02:59.970> I<00:03:00.150> have<00:03:00.390> to

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
the mixing to work about that I have to

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.759 
the mixing to work about that I have to
max<00:03:00.930> out<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.350> end<00:03:01.530> points<00:03:02.040> for<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.489> pitch<00:03:02.730> at

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
max out the end points for the pitch at

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:09.289 
max out the end points for the pitch at
220<00:03:04.769> percent<00:03:04.950> on<00:03:05.400> both<00:03:05.700> ends<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:07.220> a<00:03:08.269> lot<00:03:09.269> of

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
okay now here is the interesting part

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.830 
okay now here is the interesting part
how<00:04:19.700> do<00:04:19.760> you<00:04:20.000> set<00:04:20.209> up<00:04:20.330> the<00:04:20.660> mix<00:04:22.360> for<00:04:23.360> the<00:04:23.570> gear

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
how do you set up the mix for the gear

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.190 
how do you set up the mix for the gear
switch<00:04:24.140> to<00:04:24.980> do<00:04:25.130> the<00:04:25.280> failsafe<00:04:25.900> first<00:04:26.900> of<00:04:27.020> all

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
switch to do the failsafe first of all

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.690 
switch to do the failsafe first of all
you<00:04:27.350> go<00:04:27.500> to<00:04:27.530> ossuary<00:04:28.160> China

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
you go to ossuary China

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.090 
you go to ossuary China
that's<00:04:29.420> Channel<00:04:29.810> five<00:04:30.080> on<00:04:30.290> your<00:04:30.320> receiver<00:04:30.800> and

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
that's Channel five on your receiver and

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.870 
that's Channel five on your receiver and
your<00:04:31.550> neighbor<00:04:31.990> China<00:04:32.990> five<00:04:33.320> to<00:04:33.740> the<00:04:34.430> gear

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
your neighbor China five to the gear

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.010 
your neighbor China five to the gear
switch<00:04:35.360> yeah

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
switch yeah

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.840 
switch yeah
the<00:04:36.170> gear<00:04:36.410> switch<00:04:37.690> once<00:04:38.690> you've<00:04:38.870> done<00:04:39.080> that

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
the gear switch once you've done that

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.400 
the gear switch once you've done that
you<00:04:40.850> go<00:04:40.880> to<00:04:43.210> the<00:04:44.210> last<00:04:44.480> option<00:04:44.750> which<00:04:45.350> is

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
you go to the last option which is

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.360 
you go to the last option which is
programming<00:04:46.130> mix<00:04:46.520> one<00:04:46.940> two<00:04:47.150> three<00:04:48.070> so<00:04:49.070> I'm

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
programming mix one two three so I'm

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.710 
programming mix one two three so I'm
going<00:04:49.640> to<00:04:49.700> program<00:04:49.940> next<00:04:50.690> one<00:04:51.050> and<00:04:52.120> this<00:04:53.120> are

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
going to program next one and this are

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.400 
going to program next one and this are
the<00:04:53.870> settings<00:04:54.170> I<00:04:54.350> have<00:04:54.380> steak<00:04:55.220> active<00:04:56.410> master

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
the settings I have steak active master

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.760 
the settings I have steak active master
is<00:04:57.530> the<00:04:57.710> gear<00:04:58.100> slave<00:04:58.970> is<00:04:59.270> pitch<00:04:59.570> what<00:05:00.530> this

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
is the gear slave is pitch what this

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.550 
is the gear slave is pitch what this
means<00:05:01.070> is<00:05:01.310> I've<00:05:01.970> set<00:05:02.420> the<00:05:02.720> master<00:05:03.350> which<00:05:03.530> is

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
means is I've set the master which is

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.870 
means is I've set the master which is
the<00:05:03.710> gear<00:05:04.100> switch<00:05:05.230> to<00:05:06.230> offset<00:05:06.710> the<00:05:07.490> slave

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
the gear switch to offset the slave

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.220 
the gear switch to offset the slave
which<00:05:08.270> is<00:05:08.450> the<00:05:08.630> pitch<00:05:08.930> China<00:05:10.510> and<00:05:11.510> I<00:05:11.630> offset<00:05:11.810> it

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
which is the pitch China and I offset it

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.180 
which is the pitch China and I offset it
by<00:05:12.260> negative<00:05:12.920> forty<00:05:14.530> which<00:05:15.530> is<00:05:15.710> the<00:05:15.950> right

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
by negative forty which is the right

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:22.450 
by negative forty which is the right
value<00:05:16.670> for<00:05:17.090> it<00:05:17.210> to<00:05:17.510> switch<00:05:18.410> position<00:05:18.980> from<00:05:21.460> far

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
value for it to switch position from far

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.260 
value for it to switch position from far
more<00:05:22.640> to<00:05:22.910> feel<00:05:23.120> safe<00:05:23.390> you<00:05:25.000> could<00:05:26.000> try

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
more to feel safe you could try

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.390 
more to feel safe you could try
different<00:05:26.330> values<00:05:26.930> about<00:05:27.110> this<00:05:27.410> part<00:05:28.250> of

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
values that worked best for me yep

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.880 
values that worked best for me yep
that's<00:05:32.510> it<00:05:32.660> is<00:05:33.640> simple<00:05:35.169> or<00:05:36.169> you<00:05:36.230> can<00:05:36.500> set<00:05:36.680> it<00:05:36.800> up

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.890 
that's it is simple or you can set it up
