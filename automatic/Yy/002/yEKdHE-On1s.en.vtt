00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 good to all my name is rami and 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.520
 welcome to another video this time 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.490
 I bring an easter egg or steak 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.769
 museum map this easter egg makes 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.049
 reference to the game infinity blade in 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.570
 basically because it gives us the 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.240
 opportunity to catch the infinity sword 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.270
 blade the truth is that it is very cool and 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.619
 you will see it later on well for 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.619
 start the first thing we have to 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.650
 make will be with the gun firing towards 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.990
 a blue gem that is right there does not 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.690
 I know if you can see but hey you have to 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.079
 shoot him there is firing until he 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.079
 break 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.130
 there we see that it has been broken and now 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.940
 we continue towards another statue 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.680
 exactly what you are seeing now 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.260
 same that also has another small 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.580
 blue gem in that case more transparent 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.520
 I do not know if you can see it but good 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.480
 we shoot right there until it 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.480
 break as before 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.230
 there is already broken there is once broken already 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.540
 we are two and we need the third one 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.520
 it's just on the other side the same 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.860
 that before the same statue and the same 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.860
 the gem shoot until it breaks 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.360
 and once broken, now we have to go 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.790
 where the first statue exactly there 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.170
 and it will give us the opportunity to interact 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.170
 with an object we give 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.210
 and well then once this is done 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.550
 we will have to rebuild the sword 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.790
 infinity blade that we have to go inside 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.790
 of the museum say that there are several pieces 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.630
 I think about six does not matter the order 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.460
 where do we start I think but good here 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.950
 is the first one that is the handle of the 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.200
 sword vale let's destroy the crystal 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.680
 first and then with the gun you 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.680
 we shoot 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.799
 there you see that it has disappeared well 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.049
 a part of 6 is already complete so 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.479
 let's go for the next one that is 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:05.320
 exactly on a shelf exactly 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.630
 there we shot him and we already have two 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.399
 parts of six complete so now 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.550
 we are going towards the third one that is 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.820
 exactly where I'm going 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.770
 is here stuck first we destroy the 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.790
 crystal and then we shoot with the 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.790
 pistol towards the part of the sword 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.010
 and we already have three full parts of 6 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.519
 let's go for the fourth one here 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.519
 outside 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:36.580
 it's there we shoot it 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:40.680
 well we've been 4 now we're back inside 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.680
 of the museum for the fifth 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.000
 Here we go 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:51.410
 and this piece is a little hidden is 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.630
 inside a drawer there we shoot already 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.900
 we have five of six and we are going to 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.660
 the last one that is right here 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.630
 inside that showcase we shot at 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.270
 crystal and then to the sword 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.280
 and now we have complete six parts 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.970
 of six and notice what happens now 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.970
 here 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.020
 there you see the sword infinity blade and 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:21.780
 we can take it 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.580
 and then we have the infinity sword 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.770
 blade and the truth is that it is super 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.190
 cool at least for me I like 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.110
 very much and good because it is already complete 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.900
 the easter egg today this days of the 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.180
 museum map I do not know if something should be done 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.770
 more with the sword and I think I do not think 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.260
 that this is the easter egg the sword 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.400
 infinity blade and good here you go to 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.230

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.480
 I understand that you can go back 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.310
 against you kill yourself in this case as you go 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.130
 to see because I know it did not happen to me but I've 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.590
 seen 15 that sometimes you can go back 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.810
 against you the sword and kill you the 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.370
