surgery of millimeters dr. Rorick says

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.680 
surgery of millimeters dr. Rorick says
that<00:00:46.260> even<00:00:46.620> small<00:00:46.980> changes<00:00:47.280> can<00:00:47.940> make<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.329> big

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
that even small changes can make a big

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.930 
that even small changes can make a big
difference<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.500> patient<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.520> really

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
difference in a patient it really

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.150 
difference in a patient it really
requires<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.480> lot<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:52.140> preoperative<00:00:52.860> planning

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
requires a lot of preoperative planning

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.760 
requires a lot of preoperative planning
and<00:00:53.520> analysis<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.239> think<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:55.320> most

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
and analysis and I think the most

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.950 
and analysis and I think the most
important<00:00:56.340> thing<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:56.699> rhinoplasty<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.750> that

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
important thing in rhinoplasty is that

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.779 
important thing in rhinoplasty is that
you<00:00:58.140> really<00:00:58.410> have<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.739> accurately<00:00:59.160> diagnose

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
you really have to accurately diagnose

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.880 
you really have to accurately diagnose
what<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.449> patient's<00:01:01.050> problem<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.620> before

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
what the patient's problem is before

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.250 
what the patient's problem is before
surgery<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:02.969> have<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.420> have<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.809> roadmap

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
surgery so you have to have the roadmap

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.109 
surgery so you have to have the roadmap
so<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.220> operating<00:01:05.580> room<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:05.970> can

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
so that in the operating room you can

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.760 
so that in the operating room you can
follow<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.600> roadmap<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.350> be<00:01:07.530> able<00:01:07.619> to

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
follow that roadmap and be able to

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.160 
follow that roadmap and be able to
actually<00:01:08.340> you'd<00:01:08.970> be<00:01:09.030> deviated<00:01:09.689> if<00:01:09.810> there's<00:01:10.110> a

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
actually you'd be deviated if there's a

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.190 
actually you'd be deviated if there's a
detour<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.310> operating<00:01:11.700> room<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.960> best

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
detour in the operating room so the best

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.170 
detour in the operating room so the best
way<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.439> do<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:14.040> actually<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.670> have<00:01:14.850> a

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
way to do that is actually to have a

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.690 
way to do that is actually to have a
good<00:01:15.570> way<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.259> look<00:01:16.799> at<00:01:17.009> or<00:01:17.220> interoperative

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
good way to look at or interoperative

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.050 
good way to look at or interoperative
gps's<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:19.320> can<00:01:19.530> actually<00:01:19.920> open<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.909> nose

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
gps's so you can actually open the nose

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.429 
gps's so you can actually open the nose
it's<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.360> small<00:01:21.689> little<00:01:21.840> incision<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.380> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
it's a small little incision on the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.770 
it's a small little incision on the
bottom<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.979> nose<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.520> open<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.600> you

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
bottom of the nose and you open and you

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.600 
bottom of the nose and you open and you
actually<00:01:24.960> can<00:01:25.140> see<00:01:25.259> what<00:01:25.830> you're<00:01:26.009> doing<00:01:26.280> and

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
actually can see what you're doing and

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.090 
actually can see what you're doing and
you<00:01:26.820> can<00:01:27.000> then<00:01:27.180> restore<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.080> normal<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.829> area

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
you can then restore to normal the area

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.390 
you can then restore to normal the area
that's<00:01:29.220> deviated<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.210> reshape<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.170> nose

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
that's deviated and reshape the nose

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.010 
that's deviated and reshape the nose
using<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.490> patient's<00:01:32.909> own<00:01:33.119> tissue<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.930> I

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
using the patient's own tissue and I

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.929 
using the patient's own tissue and I
think<00:01:34.259> that's<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.979> beauty<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.369> open

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
think that's the beauty of open

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.450 
think that's the beauty of open
rhinoplasty<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.780> modern<00:01:37.500> rhinoplasty<00:01:38.250> is

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
nose we also improved her breathing by

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.260 
nose we also improved her breathing by
straightening<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.160> inside<00:02:50.459> of<00:02:50.610> her<00:02:50.700> septum

that's<00:02:51.570> where<00:02:51.750> form<00:02:52.110> and<00:02:52.380> function<00:02:52.860> mean

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
that's where form and function mean

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.670 
that's where form and function mean
because<00:02:54.209> you<00:02:54.360> could<00:02:54.540> improve<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.230> function

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
because you could improve the function

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.440 
because you could improve the function
by<00:02:55.950> doing<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.370> inside<00:02:56.700> of<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:56.940> nose<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.330> then

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
by doing the inside of the nose and then

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.600 
by doing the inside of the nose and then
the<00:02:57.840> form<00:02:58.200> on<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.530> outside<00:02:58.560> where<00:02:59.100> you<00:02:59.220> shape

the form on the outside where you shape

the form on the outside where you shape
the<00:03:00.180> nose<00:03:00.360> now<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:00.930> definitely<00:03:01.290> recommend<00:03:01.890> dr.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190
