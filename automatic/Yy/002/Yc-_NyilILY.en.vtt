what's<00:00:33.840> special<00:00:34.050> about<00:00:34.260> our<00:00:34.410> light<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.890> that

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
what's special about our light is that

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.850 
what's special about our light is that
it's<00:00:35.130> an<00:00:35.219> all-aluminum<00:00:35.880> body<00:00:36.440> and<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:37.710> it's

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
it's an all-aluminum body and so it's

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.670 
it's an all-aluminum body and so it's
very<00:00:38.040> impact<00:00:38.489> resistant<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.300> durable<00:00:39.719> it's

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
very impact resistant and durable it's

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.760 
very impact resistant and durable it's
also<00:00:40.860> USB<00:00:41.579> rechargeable<00:00:42.260> all<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.440> our<00:00:43.590> lights

are<00:00:44.600> we<00:00:45.600> use<00:00:46.200> high-powered<00:00:46.620> cree<00:00:47.520> leds<00:00:48.059> which

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
are we use high-powered cree leds which

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.810 
are we use high-powered cree leds which
are<00:00:48.930> very<00:00:49.110> very<00:00:49.379> efficient<00:00:49.800> leds<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.190> put

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
are very very efficient leds that put

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.910 
are very very efficient leds that put
