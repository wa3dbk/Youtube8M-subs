00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:11.809
 hi to all the boys and welcome back up 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.429
 those two on the server 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.610
 today we talk about a genre that does not 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.170
 we often deal with and it is the certain kind 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.560
 we have treated very few titles 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.200
 of this kind, however, today's game is 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.420
 rather important because it is a reboot 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.520
 of a rather famous saga we are 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.490
 talking very little about thief 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.599
 weeks ago and we could not exempt ourselves from the 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.850
 talk about 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.579
 Exactly, you know we have the game 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.090
 we have only tried it for a while 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.680
 finished however we got to 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.630
 test it and record something e 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.820
 these are our impressions a 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.350
 hot on what we expected 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.440
 be a crap 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.510
 in fact reading the criticism boella 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.309
 this game has been very heavy 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.989
 we also heard about layoffs 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.079
 en masse that were there after the release 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.870
 because we do not say this title 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.120
 reached the expectations of those 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.040
 title really expected him like us who 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.690
 we did n't care about anything though 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.100
 in short, we were intrigued by everything 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.720
 this fuss 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.200
 we must say that if square enix has 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.030
 sawed off of people for failure 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.130
 for failure to achieve 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.869
 expected quality level for this 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.360
 film we wonder what happened to them 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.060
 infinity ward developers for 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.070
 call of duty gossip is really me in 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.650
 effects indeed in playing this 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.510
 title is not taken as the magone 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.820
 often happens with shit games but 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.680
 I take that to close costs actually but 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.260
 we found a title graphically 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.119
 really really well done a 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.009
 gameplay that for lovers of the genre 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.189
 stealth does not present all of these 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.200
 goodies is a great setting now 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:51.320
 we are not talking about a game that you 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.090
 immediately catches the defects there 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.270
 they are and they catch the eye later either 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.509
 two hours of play though it is 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.020
 always of a game and in our opinion it is above 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.409
 average 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.759
 both as an invoice indeed the genre 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.360
 We don't all like experts 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:11.840
 be honest with ourselves say to me 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.280
 like to shoot me quickly maybe me 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.590
 like to do things a little more calmly 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.470
 that's who likes to do things calmly 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.110
 they are always less and for this they have 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.810
 had to somehow market 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.180
 this title commercialize among many 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.400
 quotation marks in the sense that we have found 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.920
 some aspects very similar to 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.950
 assassin's creed and it's the worst thing 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.380
 that can be done to a brand that aims 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.000
 on the difficulty and on the stealth because 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.250
 assassin's creed of stealth and no longer has 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.019
 a saw especially if we consider that 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.450
 in this team there is the damn guy 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.370
 system of movement with the trigger 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.579
 because if you hold down 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.650
 the flap of the game then climbs 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.690
 jump does it all by itself without even that 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.400
 you have to worry about making a choice 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.010
 time to jump at the right time 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.500
 to jump because it is not exalted in 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.340
 this game a choice that made us 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:07.220
 a little bit twist the nose let's say 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.410
 so also because we wanted to have the 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.000
 possibility also stand out since you have 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.060
 the possibility of shooting because not 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.579
 very nice to highlight the fact that yes 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.079
 can use different types of gadgets for 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.829
 least as far as we can get to 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.780
 to play 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.639
 we unlocked different types of arrows 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.190
 for our bow to the director are the 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:27.530
 pointed arrows soaked with water that 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.849
 they can turn off the fires at a distance 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.739
 to create shaded areas 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.450
 very interesting that we can 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.340
 crawl quickly from an area 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.690
 shadow of the other this system that is 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.620
 was also introduced in other games 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.200
 been like 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.720
 the last splinter cell boys in short 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.580
 it's a bit of a mess of what we've seen 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.680
 in the stern area and the last few years though 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.780
 made extremely commercial by 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.659
 extremely usable dynamics e 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.329
 above all extremely brace osÃ¨ 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:55.780
 also because you always have anyway 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:58.519
 the goal is the distance from the lens 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.409
 also because let's say it really would be 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.840
 difficult not to have this goal 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:05.209
 clear yes because however we are of 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.519
 facing a tunnel in fact not 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.010
 expect one by role or even less 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.290
 giant maps we are facing a 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.780
 tunnel but being structured on more 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.539
 levels as there is the possibility of 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.729
 climbing with grapples is not 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:22.760
 always clear where to go and for 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.530
 to do this comes to our aid a kind of 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.180
 command that is depopulating too 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.910
 this was the last tomb raider 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.110
 type of command just press it and the 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.979
 concentration 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.750
 now you will be here to say but the 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.240
 serve concentration because maybe 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.830
 stay stuck in one point though 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.510
 we always return did but where it is 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.520
 the difficulty in video games if there 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.340
 let's put concentration as well as 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.020
 the point where it has to come in effect there 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.880
 also the possibility to remove this one 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.400
 concentration playing mode 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.740
 expert though not expert mode there 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.590
 they are nice cocks to peel between 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.599
 quotes the difficulty modes 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.130
 can be customized a lot 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:03.560
 we can even remove the 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.030
 saves we can customize it as 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.870
 we like to make the game true and 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.300
 just nightmare 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.710
 however the fundamental point remains that is 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:15.289
 that the point where you have to go the 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.900
 maria p the various steps should 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:20.599
 be visible simply thanks to 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.300
 a good level design but it turns out 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:24.949
 very confused without these aids let's say 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.289
 that each ledge looks like another 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:29.180
 instead with a more careful level design 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:31.780
 all this could have been avoided 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.770
 tutorial to me making the game anyway 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.320
 intuitable by the player even from the 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.570
 player 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.820
 however we understood all the choices 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:41.700
 which were made from the square enix 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.950
 for which we repeat the title would be 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.360
 been virtually unsellable only for 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:49.320
 they had a niche in some 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:52.680
 way to market but it is a title that 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:55.740
 it is not that we did not like it indeed to say the least 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:58.800
 the truth is the first two hours of play 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.110
 quite enjoyable however it always depends 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.910
 from you if you are a very hectic type 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.550
 this game will hit you right away 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:08.960
 bales to begin to make the hand with the 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.960
 guards because they are fools
