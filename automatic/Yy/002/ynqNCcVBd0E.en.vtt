00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
look at NCIX

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.139 
look at NCIX
not<00:00:46.980> being<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.370> one<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.520> I'm<00:00:47.730> referring<00:00:48.120> to

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
not being the one that I'm referring to

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.160 
not being the one that I'm referring to
here<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.629> GTX<00:00:49.410> 690<00:00:49.920> can<00:00:50.100> go<00:00:50.190> for<00:00:50.399> as<00:00:50.520> much<00:00:50.670> as

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
here a GTX 690 can go for as much as

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.740 
here a GTX 690 can go for as much as
$1,200<00:00:52.170> which<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.530> almost<00:00:53.090> exactly<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.480> price

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
$1,200 which is almost exactly the price

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.670 
$1,200 which is almost exactly the price
of<00:00:55.020> Brie<00:00:55.770> GTX<00:00:56.520> 670<00:00:57.180> s<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.379> going<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.559> be

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
of Brie GTX 670 s so this is going to be

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.410 
of Brie GTX 670 s so this is going to be
a<00:00:58.710> head-to-head<00:00:59.190> comparison<00:00:59.489> in<00:01:00.090> my<00:01:00.210> most

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
and a single GTX 690 I think we all

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.330 
and a single GTX 690 I think we all
probably<00:01:15.150> know<00:01:15.540> which<00:01:15.750> one's<00:01:16.070> likely<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.189> win

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
probably know which one's likely to win

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.700 
probably know which one's likely to win
at<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.549> point<00:01:17.850> but<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.210> case<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.600> don't<00:01:18.900> that

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
at this point but in case you don't that

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.230 
at this point but in case you don't that
is<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.130> purpose<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.490> doing<00:01:20.610> these<00:01:20.850> kinds<00:01:21.180> of

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
is the purpose of doing these kinds of

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.670 
is the purpose of doing these kinds of
tests<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.630> don't<00:01:21.869> know<00:01:21.930> if<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.110> can<00:01:22.259> see<00:01:22.530> my

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
tests so I don't know if you can see my

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.649 
tests so I don't know if you can see my
fraps<00:01:23.070> meter<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.729> corner<00:01:24.060> look<00:01:24.390> at<00:01:24.450> that

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
fraps meter in the corner look at that

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.350 
fraps meter in the corner look at that
it's<00:01:24.900> like<00:01:25.110> exactly<00:01:25.950> where<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.000> light<00:01:27.180> is

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
it's like exactly where the light is

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.520 
it's like exactly where the light is
making<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.990> can't<00:01:28.290> see<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.470> or

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
making it so you can't see it or

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.840 
making it so you can't see it or
whatever<00:01:28.650> I'll<00:01:28.890> tell<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.130> what<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.340> says<00:01:29.490> so

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
whatever I'll tell you what it says so

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.760 
whatever I'll tell you what it says so
this<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.180> battlefield<00:01:30.630> 3<00:01:30.840> all<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.380> tests

however<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.409> did<00:01:50.100> notice<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.939> we<00:01:51.630> do<00:01:51.840> see

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
however I did notice that we do see

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.780 
however I did notice that we do see
scaling<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.829> some<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.220> games<00:01:53.369> that<00:01:53.700> I've

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
scaling in some of the games that I've

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.060 
scaling in some of the games that I've
tested<00:01:54.000> already<00:01:54.329> where<00:01:55.290> we're<00:01:55.530> seeing<00:01:55.740> more

as we're seeing with a single card so

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.560 
as we're seeing with a single card so
that<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.829> very<00:02:02.250> positive<00:02:02.700> indicator<00:02:03.360> I'm

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
that is a very positive indicator I'm

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.539 
that is a very positive indicator I'm

solutions<00:02:33.470> now<00:02:33.620> I<00:02:33.650> had<00:02:33.860> really<00:02:34.160> wanted<00:02:35.620> to

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
solutions now I had really wanted to

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.930 
solutions now I had really wanted to
test<00:02:37.870> four-way<00:02:38.870> SLI<00:02:39.440> but<00:02:40.160> I<00:02:40.190> actually<00:02:40.550> didn't

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
test four-way SLI but I actually didn't

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.030 
test four-way SLI but I actually didn't
realize<00:02:41.360> that<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:41.720> 670<00:02:42.230> does<00:02:42.380> not<00:02:42.560> support

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
realize that the 670 does not support

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.670 
realize that the 670 does not support
four-way<00:02:43.459> SLI<00:02:43.610> so<00:02:44.180> one<00:02:44.900> of<00:02:44.930> these<00:02:45.140> cards<00:02:45.560> is

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
four-way SLI so one of these cards is

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.080 
four-way SLI so one of these cards is
not<00:02:45.709> on<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.130> bench<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:46.520> we're<00:02:46.670> just<00:02:46.820> going

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
not on the bench and we're just going

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.370 
not on the bench and we're just going
with<00:02:47.270> these<00:02:47.510> three<00:02:47.810> so<00:02:47.959> I<00:02:47.989> have<00:02:48.110> my<00:02:48.200> reference

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
with these three so I have my reference

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.699 
with these three so I have my reference
card<00:02:48.860> my<00:02:49.370> galaxy<00:02:49.910> card<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.510> my<00:02:51.200> other<00:02:51.350> more

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
card my galaxy card and my other more

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.920 
card my galaxy card and my other more
different<00:02:52.040> galaxy<00:02:52.520> card<00:02:52.760> one<00:02:53.660> that<00:02:53.780> looks

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
different galaxy card one that looks

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.960 
different galaxy card one that looks
like<00:02:54.050> this<00:02:54.260> with<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.530> glowing<00:02:54.739> logo<00:02:55.190> P<00:02:55.940> sweet

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
like this with the glowing logo P sweet

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.940 
like this with the glowing logo P sweet
so<00:02:58.970> I'm<00:02:59.180> finished<00:02:59.510> my<00:02:59.660> testing<00:03:00.170> with<00:03:00.350> the<00:03:00.470> GTX

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
so I'm finished my testing with the GTX

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.620 
so I'm finished my testing with the GTX
690<00:03:01.640> so<00:03:01.820> in<00:03:01.910> case<00:03:02.090> you<00:03:02.239> guys<00:03:02.270> were<00:03:02.570> wondering

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
690 so in case you guys were wondering

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.470 
690 so in case you guys were wondering
what<00:03:03.500> a<00:03:03.560> gtx<00:03:04.070> 690<00:03:04.580> looks<00:03:04.790> like<00:03:05.000> on<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.270> test

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
what a gtx 690 looks like on the test

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.010 
what a gtx 690 looks like on the test
bench<00:03:05.920> it's<00:03:06.920> a<00:03:06.980> little<00:03:07.250> something<00:03:07.520> like<00:03:07.640> that

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
bench it's a little something like that

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.530 
bench it's a little something like that
it's<00:03:09.020> pretty<00:03:09.320> cool<00:03:10.150> start<00:03:11.150> off<00:03:11.239> the<00:03:11.360> lights

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
it's pretty cool start off the lights

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.570 
it's pretty cool start off the lights
you<00:03:11.690> can<00:03:11.900> see<00:03:12.020> the<00:03:12.140> glowing<00:03:12.380> GeForce<00:03:13.100> logo

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
you can see the glowing GeForce logo

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.900 
you can see the glowing GeForce logo
here<00:03:14.410> glows<00:03:15.410> very<00:03:15.620> strongly<00:03:16.190> that's<00:03:16.610> a<00:03:16.700> very

cards<00:03:56.660> but<00:03:56.810> I<00:03:57.079> was<00:03:57.560> only<00:03:57.680> running<00:03:57.829> three<00:03:58.130> of

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
cards but I was only running three of

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.560 
cards but I was only running three of
them<00:03:58.310> at<00:03:58.370> a<00:03:58.400> time<00:03:58.459> so<00:03:59.030> I'm<00:03:59.120> just<00:03:59.180> going<00:03:59.420> to<00:03:59.450> make

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
them at a time so I'm just going to make

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:00.640 
them at a time so I'm just going to make
up<00:03:59.690> my<00:03:59.810> little<00:03:59.959> graphs<00:04:00.170> and<00:04:00.320> then<00:04:00.440> we're<00:04:00.560> good

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
up my little graphs and then we're good

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.979 
up my little graphs and then we're good
to<00:04:00.680> go<00:04:00.769> after<00:04:01.519> I<00:04:01.760> tell<00:04:02.000> you<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:02.390> test<00:04:02.660> bench<00:04:02.840> of

to go after I tell you the test bench of

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.470 
to go after I tell you the test bench of

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
I actually have an upcoming video where

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.150 
I actually have an upcoming video where
I<00:04:53.070> plan<00:04:53.310> to<00:04:53.340> do<00:04:53.550> some<00:04:53.850> GTX<00:04:54.510> 670<00:04:54.990> versus<00:04:55.650> Radeon

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
I plan to do some GTX 670 versus Radeon

I plan to do some GTX 670 versus Radeon
7970<00:04:57.080> scaling<00:04:58.080> which<00:04:58.260> will<00:04:58.380> be<00:04:58.470> really<00:04:58.650> cool

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
7970 scaling which will be really cool

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.320 
7970 scaling which will be really cool
so<00:04:59.250> one<00:04:59.460> two<00:04:59.730> and<00:04:59.940> three<00:05:00.180> weight

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
so one two and three weight

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.480 
so one two and three weight
configurations<00:05:01.050> for<00:05:01.260> both<00:05:01.440> seeing<00:05:02.220> how<00:05:02.340> they

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
configurations for both seeing how they

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.190 
configurations for both seeing how they
compare<00:05:02.910> but<00:05:03.450> for<00:05:03.630> this<00:05:03.750> one<00:05:03.930> we're<00:05:04.170> just

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
compare but for this one we're just

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.920 
compare but for this one we're just
looking<00:05:04.710> at<00:05:04.830> three<00:05:05.100> x<00:05:05.340> GTX<00:05:05.850> 670<00:05:06.210> s<00:05:06.510> versus<00:05:06.900> a

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
looking at three x GTX 670 s versus a

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.680 
looking at three x GTX 670 s versus a
single<00:05:07.200> GTX<00:05:07.770> 690<00:05:08.340> what<00:05:08.970> is<00:05:09.090> the<00:05:09.240> better<00:05:09.420> better

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.600 
single GTX 690 what is the better better
value<00:05:10.050> proposition<00:05:10.680> so<00:05:10.830> you<00:05:10.920> can<00:05:11.100> see<00:05:11.310> here<00:05:11.520> in

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
value proposition so you can see here in

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.600 
value proposition so you can see here in

Crysis 2 the 3-way SLI configuration

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.990 
Crysis 2 the 3-way SLI configuration
actually<00:05:15.510> has<00:05:15.600> a<00:05:15.630> lower<00:05:15.930> overall<00:05:16.350> minimum<00:05:17.250> but

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
actually has a lower overall minimum but

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.210 
actually has a lower overall minimum but
a<00:05:18.030> higher<00:05:18.450> overall<00:05:18.900> average<00:05:19.590> but<00:05:19.800> not<00:05:19.920> by<00:05:20.040> much

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
a higher overall average but not by much

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.710 
a higher overall average but not by much
we're<00:05:20.490> talking<00:05:20.790> a<00:05:20.820> 5<00:05:21.030> percent<00:05:21.390> performance

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
we're talking a 5 percent performance

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.420 
we're talking a 5 percent performance

by<00:05:26.580> 670<00:05:27.270> solution<00:05:27.720> just<00:05:27.930> destroys<00:05:28.710> the<00:05:29.460> single

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
by 670 solution just destroys the single

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.330 
by 670 solution just destroys the single
690<00:05:30.450> so<00:05:30.600> this<00:05:30.750> is<00:05:30.960> excellent<00:05:31.530> scaling<00:05:32.190> that

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
690 so this is excellent scaling that

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.910 
690 so this is excellent scaling that
we're<00:05:32.460> seeing<00:05:32.670> in<00:05:32.850> this<00:05:33.000> particular<00:05:33.540> game<00:05:33.920> I

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
we're seeing in this particular game I

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.270 
we're seeing in this particular game I
mean<00:05:35.310> we've<00:05:35.490> got<00:05:35.670> an<00:05:35.880> additional<00:05:36.680> 25<00:05:37.680> to<00:05:38.010> 30

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
mean we've got an additional 25 to 30

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.190 
mean we've got an additional 25 to 30
percent<00:05:38.520> performance<00:05:39.120> probably<00:05:39.630> about<00:05:39.750> 25

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
percent performance probably about 25

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.110 
percent performance probably about 25
percent<00:05:40.560> performance<00:05:40.860> from<00:05:41.730> adding<00:05:42.000> that

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
percent performance from adding that

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.450 
percent performance from adding that
additional<00:05:42.390> GPU<00:05:43.230> so<00:05:43.440> that<00:05:43.590> is<00:05:43.770> a<00:05:43.800> pretty<00:05:44.250> good

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
additional GPU so that is a pretty good

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.270 
additional GPU so that is a pretty good
example<00:05:44.910> of<00:05:45.740> excellent<00:05:46.740> scaling<00:05:47.040> then<00:05:47.160> you

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
example of excellent scaling then you

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.680 
example of excellent scaling then you
can<00:05:47.400> see<00:05:47.490> the<00:05:47.640> minimum<00:05:47.850> is<00:05:48.150> even<00:05:48.390> higher

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
can see the minimum is even higher

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.280 
can see the minimum is even higher
that's<00:05:49.050> more<00:05:49.200> like<00:05:49.380> 40<00:05:49.680> percent<00:05:50.240> outstanding

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 
that's more like 40 percent outstanding

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.070 
that's more like 40 percent outstanding
skyrim<00:05:52.290> yeah<00:05:53.220> those<00:05:53.550> look<00:05:53.790> pretty<00:05:54.180> similar<00:05:54.630> to

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
skyrim yeah those look pretty similar to

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.230 
skyrim yeah those look pretty similar to
me<00:05:55.260> within<00:05:55.680> margin<00:05:56.220> of<00:05:56.310> error<00:05:56.490> on<00:05:56.670> this<00:05:57.000> side

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
me within margin of error on this side

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.930 
me within margin of error on this side
however<00:05:57.660> that<00:05:57.930> minimum<00:05:58.500> frame<00:05:58.770> rate<00:05:59.010> is<00:05:59.190> very

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
however that minimum frame rate is very

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.850 
however that minimum frame rate is very
different<00:06:00.420> so<00:06:00.570> the<00:06:00.690> GTX<00:06:01.110> 690<00:06:02.100> was<00:06:02.820> a<00:06:03.860> actual

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
different so the GTX 690 was a actual

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.310 
different so the GTX 690 was a actual
3-way<00:06:05.430> SLI<00:06:05.460> configuration<00:06:05.880> with<00:06:06.660> about<00:06:06.870> 35

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 
3-way SLI configuration with about 35

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.440 
3-way SLI configuration with about 35
percent<00:06:07.470> higher<00:06:07.860> than<00:06:07.890> the<00:06:08.130> GTX<00:06:08.400> 690<00:06:09.180> in<00:06:09.270> terms

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.450 
percent higher than the GTX 690 in terms

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.750 
percent higher than the GTX 690 in terms
of<00:06:09.600> minimum<00:06:10.020> fps<00:06:10.530> and<00:06:10.740> I<00:06:11.160> did<00:06:11.370> notice<00:06:11.580> that

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
of minimum fps and I did notice that

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.240 
of minimum fps and I did notice that
when<00:06:12.030> I<00:06:12.060> was<00:06:12.210> actually<00:06:12.630> using<00:06:12.810> it<00:06:13.220> Witcher<00:06:14.220> 2

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
when I was actually using it Witcher 2

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.200 
when I was actually using it Witcher 2
is<00:06:14.640> another<00:06:14.910> one<00:06:15.150> that<00:06:16.370> scaled<00:06:17.370> okay<00:06:17.880> in<00:06:18.060> terms

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
is another one that scaled okay in terms

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.720 
is another one that scaled okay in terms
of<00:06:18.450> averages<00:06:18.870> with<00:06:19.140> the<00:06:19.260> 3<00:06:19.470> by<00:06:19.620> GTX<00:06:20.340> 670

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:20.730 
of averages with the 3 by GTX 670

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.030 
of averages with the 3 by GTX 670
configuration<00:06:21.600> but<00:06:21.840> the<00:06:22.050> minimum<00:06:22.440> was<00:06:23.010> a

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.040 
configuration but the minimum was a

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.950 
configuration but the minimum was a
little<00:06:23.370> bit<00:06:23.520> lower<00:06:23.880> well<00:06:24.330> quite<00:06:24.570> a<00:06:24.600> bit<00:06:24.780> lower

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
little bit lower well quite a bit lower

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.360 
little bit lower well quite a bit lower
but<00:06:25.290> something<00:06:25.680> to<00:06:25.770> bear<00:06:25.920> in<00:06:25.950> mind<00:06:26.040> about

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
but something to bear in mind about

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:27.740 
but something to bear in mind about
these<00:06:26.520> minimums<00:06:26.910> is<00:06:27.030> sometimes<00:06:27.420> when<00:06:27.630> you

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
these minimums is sometimes when you

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.810 
these minimums is sometimes when you
benchmarking<00:06:28.380> your<00:06:28.590> frame<00:06:29.250> rates<00:06:29.460> will<00:06:29.610> dip

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:29.820 
benchmarking your frame rates will dip

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.680 
benchmarking your frame rates will dip
for<00:06:30.120> sort<00:06:30.630> of<00:06:30.750> no<00:06:31.590> reproducible<00:06:32.520> or<00:06:32.760> easily

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.690 
for sort of no reproducible or easily

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:35.150 
for sort of no reproducible or easily
explainable<00:06:34.140> reason

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 
explainable reason

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.980 
explainable reason
and<00:06:35.250> so<00:06:36.000> there's<00:06:36.180> a<00:06:36.240> little<00:06:36.390> bit<00:06:36.540> about<00:06:36.840> to

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990 
and so there's a little bit about to

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.420 
and so there's a little bit about to
bear<00:06:37.140> in<00:06:37.230> mind<00:06:37.260> as<00:06:37.530> well<00:06:37.680> personally<00:06:38.220> I<00:06:38.280> know

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
bear in mind as well personally I know

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.160 
bear in mind as well personally I know
minimums<00:06:38.970> are<00:06:39.120> important<00:06:39.570> to<00:06:39.810> a<00:06:39.840> lot<00:06:39.930> of

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:40.170 
minimums are important to a lot of

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:41.870 
minimums are important to a lot of
people<00:06:40.440> but<00:06:40.620> personally<00:06:41.070> I<00:06:41.100> put<00:06:41.430> more<00:06:41.640> weight

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 
people but personally I put more weight

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.300 
people but personally I put more weight
into<00:06:42.570> the<00:06:43.020> averages<00:06:43.500> especially<00:06:43.980> because<00:06:44.130> of

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:44.310 
into the averages especially because of

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.480 
into the averages especially because of
the<00:06:44.460> way<00:06:44.580> I'm<00:06:44.670> collecting<00:06:44.970> data<00:06:45.360> with<00:06:45.630> fraps

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:46.490 
the way I'm collecting data with fraps

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.460 
the way I'm collecting data with fraps
you<00:06:47.490> can<00:06:47.700> get<00:06:47.880> a<00:06:47.910> minimum<00:06:48.420> that<00:06:48.780> gets<00:06:49.020> you<00:06:49.350> know

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470 
you can get a minimum that gets you know

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.800 
you can get a minimum that gets you know
if<00:06:49.710> both<00:06:49.950> cards<00:06:50.310> dip<00:06:50.520> like<00:06:50.670> this<00:06:50.970> you<00:06:51.570> can<00:06:51.660> get

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:51.810 
if both cards dip like this you can get

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.090 
if both cards dip like this you can get
one<00:06:51.930> of<00:06:51.960> them<00:06:52.170> that<00:06:52.320> records<00:06:52.740> at<00:06:52.860> the<00:06:52.890> very

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.100 
one of them that records at the very

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.800 
one of them that records at the very
bottom<00:06:53.400> of<00:06:53.490> the<00:06:53.610> dip<00:06:53.790> because<00:06:54.270> it<00:06:54.420> happens<00:06:54.720> to

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:54.810 
bottom of the dip because it happens to

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.350 
bottom of the dip because it happens to
fall<00:06:54.900> on<00:06:55.080> that<00:06:55.380> split<00:06:56.250> second<00:06:56.670> and<00:06:56.880> one<00:06:57.270> of

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 
fall on that split second and one of

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.700 
fall on that split second and one of
them<00:06:57.450> that<00:06:57.570> falls<00:06:57.810> here<00:06:58.170> but<00:06:58.320> that<00:06:58.440> doesn't

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:58.710 
them that falls here but that doesn't

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.260 
them that falls here but that doesn't
mean<00:06:58.770> the<00:06:58.920> dip<00:06:59.100> didn't<00:06:59.370> happen<00:06:59.730> so<00:06:59.880> something

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:00.270 
mean the dip didn't happen so something

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.030 
mean the dip didn't happen so something
to<00:07:00.360> bear<00:07:00.480> in<00:07:00.570> mind<00:07:00.720> about<00:07:00.930> fraps<00:07:01.350> framerate

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:02.040 
to bear in mind about fraps framerate

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.950 
to bear in mind about fraps framerate
recording<00:07:02.640> so<00:07:03.120> thank<00:07:03.330> you<00:07:03.420> for<00:07:03.540> checking<00:07:03.690> out

performance<00:07:10.380> review<00:07:10.710> I<00:07:10.740> think<00:07:10.860> that<00:07:11.310> we<00:07:11.460> can

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:11.640 
performance review I think that we can

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.150 
performance review I think that we can
see<00:07:11.850> that<00:07:12.060> three<00:07:12.480> each<00:07:12.630> by<00:07:12.840> GTX<00:07:13.320> 670<00:07:13.680> is<00:07:13.920> a<00:07:14.010> very

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 
see that three each by GTX 670 is a very

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.770 
see that three each by GTX 670 is a very
viable<00:07:14.400> option<00:07:14.730> if<00:07:15.030> you<00:07:15.120> really<00:07:15.360> do<00:07:15.480> want<00:07:15.660> the

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:15.780 
viable option if you really do want the

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.570 
viable option if you really do want the
ultimate<00:07:15.870> performance<00:07:16.380> and<00:07:16.800> you<00:07:17.250> can't<00:07:17.490> get

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.580 
ultimate performance and you can't get
