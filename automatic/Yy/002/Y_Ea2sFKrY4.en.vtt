warfare<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.250> was<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.210> happy<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.869> know<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:30.990> was

because<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.229> think<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.520> most

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
because I think this is the most

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.300 
because I think this is the most
competitive<00:01:36.390> game<00:01:36.869> mode<00:01:37.170> aside<00:01:37.619> from<00:01:37.950> search

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
competitive game mode aside from search

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.679 
competitive game mode aside from search
and<00:01:38.430> destroy<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.820> find<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.270> search<00:01:39.540> and

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
and destroy I find that search and

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.289 
and destroy I find that search and
destroy<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.740> amount<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.040> strategy<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:41.759> skill

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
destroy the amount of strategy and skill

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.440 
destroy the amount of strategy and skill
that<00:01:42.329> search<00:01:42.780> takes<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.790> pretty<00:01:44.790> untouchable

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
that search takes is pretty untouchable

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.109 
that search takes is pretty untouchable
but<00:01:45.630> also<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.229> teamwork<00:01:46.640> and<00:01:47.640> everything

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119

that goes into hardpoint to win a hard
point<00:01:50.610> match<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.360> super<00:01:52.320> intense<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.640> that's

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099

obviously<00:03:33.930> guys<00:03:34.319> I<00:03:34.470> got<00:03:34.620> three<00:03:34.889> hours<00:03:35.010> of<00:03:35.160> play

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
obviously guys I got three hours of play

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.490 
obviously guys I got three hours of play
time<00:03:35.459> that's<00:03:36.389> definitely<00:03:36.870> not<00:03:37.019> enough<00:03:37.170> to

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
time that's definitely not enough to

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.500 
time that's definitely not enough to
like<00:03:37.680> play<00:03:38.040> test<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.549> spawn<00:03:38.819> system<00:03:39.090> and

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
like play test the spawn system and

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.479 
like play test the spawn system and
figure<00:03:39.780> out<00:03:39.840> what<00:03:40.170> triggers<00:03:40.410> spawns<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.340> what

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
figure out what triggers spawns and what

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.780 
figure out what triggers spawns and what
holds<00:03:41.880> fawns<00:03:42.150> certain<00:03:42.840> places<00:03:43.430> but<00:03:44.430> the<00:03:44.549> hard

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
holds fawns certain places but the hard

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.059 
holds fawns certain places but the hard
points<00:03:45.180> are<00:03:45.299> all<00:03:45.480> you<00:03:45.840> know<00:03:45.870> very<00:03:46.380> similar

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
points are all you know very similar

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.099 
points are all you know very similar
sizes<00:03:47.430> kind<00:03:48.000> of<00:03:48.090> in<00:03:48.269> these<00:03:48.420> like<00:03:48.660> small

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
sizes kind of in these like small

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.809 
sizes kind of in these like small
contained<00:03:49.560> rooms<00:03:49.799> you<00:03:49.950> can<00:03:49.980> obviously<00:03:50.190> see

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
contained rooms you can obviously see

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.110 
contained rooms you can obviously see
the<00:03:51.060> yellow<00:03:51.780> outline<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.549> hard<00:03:53.790> point<00:03:54.030> I

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
the yellow outline to the hard point I

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.819 
the yellow outline to the hard point I
actually<00:03:54.180> barely<00:03:54.780> noticed<00:03:55.349> the<00:03:55.530> yellow

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
actually barely noticed the yellow

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.039 
actually barely noticed the yellow
outline<00:03:56.069> while<00:03:57.000> I<00:03:57.030> was<00:03:57.209> playing<00:03:57.510> just<00:03:57.750> cuz<00:03:57.900> it

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
outline while I was playing just cuz it

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.300 
outline while I was playing just cuz it
just<00:03:58.440> took<00:03:59.010> so<00:03:59.340> much<00:03:59.549> going<00:03:59.970> on<00:04:00.109> but<00:04:01.109> I<00:04:01.680> really

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
just took so much going on but I really

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.770 
just took so much going on but I really
like<00:04:02.459> that<00:04:02.670> i<00:04:02.700> think<00:04:02.819> the<00:04:03.060> hardpoint<00:04:03.450> should

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
like that i think the hardpoint should

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.229 
like that i think the hardpoint should
be<00:04:03.930> kept<00:04:04.109> small<00:04:04.470> and<00:04:05.459> one<00:04:05.760> of<00:04:05.880> them<00:04:06.000> actually

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
be kept small and one of them actually

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.990 
be kept small and one of them actually
on<00:04:06.510> this<00:04:06.750> map<00:04:07.169> there's<00:04:08.130> a<00:04:08.190> hard<00:04:08.579> point<00:04:08.730> that's

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
on this map there's a hard point that's

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.849 
on this map there's a hard point that's
on<00:04:09.180> top<00:04:09.419> of<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:09.720> roof<00:04:10.019> which<00:04:10.410> is<00:04:10.620> actually

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
on top of the roof which is actually

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.680 
on top of the roof which is actually
insane<00:04:11.489> and<00:04:11.819> i<00:04:11.849> just<00:04:12.090> know<00:04:12.299> that's<00:04:12.480> gonna

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
insane and i just know that's gonna

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.640 
insane and i just know that's gonna
create<00:04:13.079> some<00:04:13.470> chaotic<00:04:14.069> gunfights<00:04:14.609> especial

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
create some chaotic gunfights especial

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.199 
create some chaotic gunfights especial
if<00:04:15.709> this<00:04:15.890> map<00:04:16.160> is<00:04:16.340> used<00:04:16.820> in<00:04:17.389> competitive<00:04:18.049> so<00:04:18.350> um

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
if this map is used in competitive so um

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.540 
if this map is used in competitive so um
for<00:04:20.209> as<00:04:20.600> far<00:04:20.870> as<00:04:20.989> like<00:04:21.169> anchors<00:04:21.739> and<00:04:21.949> spawns<00:04:22.250> go

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
for as far as like anchors and spawns go

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.950 
for as far as like anchors and spawns go

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
like test this phone system i can tell

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.550 
like test this phone system i can tell
you<00:04:28.250> that<00:04:28.520> i<00:04:28.850> don't<00:04:29.330> recall<00:04:29.539> a<00:04:29.810> time<00:04:30.259> where<00:04:30.530> i

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
you that i don't recall a time where i

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.529 
you that i don't recall a time where i
spawned<00:04:30.979> behind<00:04:31.490> somebody<00:04:31.910> or<00:04:32.120> somebody

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 
spawned behind somebody or somebody

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.960 
spawned behind somebody or somebody
spawn<00:04:32.810> behind<00:04:32.960> me<00:04:33.259> and<00:04:33.320> killed<00:04:33.590> me<00:04:33.740> i'm<00:04:34.669> hoping

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
spawn behind me and killed me i'm hoping

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.700 
spawn behind me and killed me i'm hoping
that<00:04:35.120> the<00:04:35.210> spawn<00:04:35.509> system<00:04:35.720> is<00:04:36.139> a<00:04:36.169> little<00:04:36.560> bit

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
that the spawn system is a little bit

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.560 
that the spawn system is a little bit
more<00:04:36.889> intricate<00:04:37.430> than<00:04:37.460> call<00:04:37.940> of<00:04:37.970> duty<00:04:38.240> ghosts

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
more intricate than call of duty ghosts

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.300 
more intricate than call of duty ghosts
because<00:04:38.630> they<00:04:38.900> did<00:04:39.139> get<00:04:39.410> an<00:04:39.530> entire<00:04:39.919> extra

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
because they did get an entire extra

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.029 
because they did get an entire extra
year<00:04:41.030> on<00:04:41.630> this<00:04:41.990> call<00:04:42.229> duty<00:04:42.410> so<00:04:42.650> I'm<00:04:42.770> expecting

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
year on this call duty so I'm expecting

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:45.550 
year on this call duty so I'm expecting
this<00:04:43.460> thing<00:04:43.520> to<00:04:43.759> be<00:04:44.030> streamlined<00:04:44.560> and
