00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
inlays I guess we could start in the D

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.890 
inlays I guess we could start in the D
string<00:00:14.930> which<00:00:15.170> is<00:00:15.200> going<00:00:15.350> to<00:00:15.530> be<00:00:15.709> e<00:00:16.039> a<00:00:16.640> D<00:00:17.390> third

can<00:00:38.180> try<00:00:38.390> heading<00:00:38.720> in<00:00:40.180> which<00:00:41.180> is<00:00:41.300> going<00:00:41.390> to<00:00:41.480> be

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.630 
can try heading in which is going to be

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.780 
can try heading in which is going to be
the<00:00:41.750> twelve<00:00:42.080> on<00:00:42.380> the<00:00:42.710> g<00:00:42.950> string<00:00:42.980> the<00:00:43.550> next

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
the twelve on the g string the next

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.210 
the twelve on the g string the next
highest<00:00:44.210> string<00:00:44.660> so<00:00:44.930> all<00:00:45.350> together<00:00:45.620> all<00:00:46.010> three

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
highest string so all together all three

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.590 
highest string so all together all three
notes<00:00:48.460> you<00:00:49.460> get<00:00:49.580> a<00:00:49.640> little<00:00:49.940> vibrato<00:00:50.090> by

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
notes you get a little vibrato by

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.210 
notes you get a little vibrato by
shaking<00:00:50.870> your<00:00:51.020> finger<00:00:51.410> on<00:00:51.440> that<00:00:51.710> now<00:00:51.890> so

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
shaking your finger on that now so

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.200 
shaking your finger on that now so
that's<00:00:52.790> a<00:00:52.910> real<00:00:53.090> kind<00:00:53.330> of<00:00:53.450> pentatonic<00:00:54.050> lick

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
that's a real kind of pentatonic lick

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.630 
that's a real kind of pentatonic lick
and<00:00:56.210> then<00:00:56.560> you<00:00:57.560> can<00:00:57.740> even<00:00:57.890> add<00:00:58.190> a<00:00:58.220> little<00:00:58.310> more

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
and then you can even add a little more

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:12.170 
and then you can even add a little more
to<00:00:58.850> it<00:00:58.880> so<00:00:59.090> we<00:00:59.180> could<00:00:59.330> practice<00:00:59.450> real<00:01:00.020> slow

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.010 

so<00:01:13.180> what<00:01:13.300> we<00:01:13.420> did<00:01:13.600> there<00:01:13.810> we<00:01:14.080> want<00:01:15.960> instead<00:01:16.960> of

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
so what we did there we want instead of

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:24.240 
so what we did there we want instead of
vibrating<00:01:17.650> bent<00:01:18.040> down<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.740> then<00:01:23.920> went<00:01:24.100> back

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
vibrating bent down and then went back

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.250 
vibrating bent down and then went back
to<00:01:24.369> our<00:01:24.490> second<00:01:24.940> note<00:01:25.090> and<00:01:25.270> use<00:01:25.720> the<00:01:25.869> vibrato

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
to our second note and use the vibrato

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:44.219 
to our second note and use the vibrato
in<00:01:26.560> there<00:01:26.770> so<00:01:27.810> two<00:01:28.830> three<00:01:30.600> four<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:43.229> that's

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
in there so two three four so that's

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.130 
in there so two three four so that's
just<00:01:44.410> a<00:01:44.590> little<00:01:44.770> kind<00:01:45.100> of<00:01:45.190> bluesy<00:01:45.580> like

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
just a little kind of bluesy like

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.889 
just a little kind of bluesy like

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
alright so here we go with the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.580 
alright so here we go with the
pentatonic<00:01:49.899> scale

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
pentatonic scale

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.859 
pentatonic scale

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
from the very top we'd hit 12 and

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.180 
from the very top we'd hit 12 and
instead<00:02:24.540> of<00:02:24.600> going<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:24.960> the<00:02:25.080> 14<00:02:25.500> we<00:02:25.770> go<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:25.980> the

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
instead of going to the 14 we go to the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:35.790 
instead of going to the 14 we go to the
15<00:02:26.610> which<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:26.820> a<00:02:26.970> dot<00:02:27.210> on<00:02:27.240> it<00:02:27.510> so

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800

let<00:02:36.580> me<00:02:36.670> just<00:02:36.940> start<00:02:37.330> it<00:02:37.420> from<00:02:37.480> scratch

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.369 

okay<00:02:49.519> and<00:02:49.879> if<00:02:50.480> we<00:02:50.599> want<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:50.810> continue<00:02:51.230> after

okay and if we want to continue after

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:56.620 
okay and if we want to continue after

that<00:02:57.590> was<00:02:57.710> our<00:02:57.830> last<00:02:57.980> note<00:02:58.310> so<00:02:58.460> now<00:02:58.610> we'd

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
that was our last note so now we'd

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.150 
that was our last note so now we'd
continue<00:02:58.910> on<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.270> twelve<00:02:59.830> and<00:03:00.830> instead<00:03:01.100> of

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
continue on the twelve and instead of

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.370 
continue on the twelve and instead of
going<00:03:01.310> to<00:03:01.430> fourteen<00:03:01.940> go<00:03:02.630> to<00:03:02.690> fifteen<00:03:03.140> just

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.670 
like the first top string so on and this
is<00:03:08.210> the<00:03:08.360> B<00:03:08.660> string<00:03:08.990> the<00:03:09.200> second-to-last

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
is the B string the second-to-last

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.450 
is the B string the second-to-last
string<00:03:11.500> same<00:03:12.500> thing<00:03:12.710> on<00:03:12.830> the<00:03:12.920> highest<00:03:13.100> string

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
string same thing on the highest string

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:27.200 
string same thing on the highest string
E<00:03:13.730> string

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.880 

so<00:03:28.210> that's<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:28.450> pentatonic<00:03:28.870> scale<00:03:29.320> all<00:03:29.710> right

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
so that's the pentatonic scale all right

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.110 
so that's the pentatonic scale all right
we're<00:03:30.010> gonna<00:03:30.100> go<00:03:30.310> over<00:03:30.400> hammer-ons<00:03:31.000> and

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
we're gonna go over hammer-ons and

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.210 
we're gonna go over hammer-ons and
pull-offs<00:03:31.210> real<00:03:31.750> quick<00:03:31.990> and<00:03:32.320> we<00:03:32.800> can<00:03:32.980> use<00:03:33.100> the

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
pull-offs real quick and we can use the

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.820 
pull-offs real quick and we can use the
last<00:03:33.430> exercise<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:34.150> pentatonic<00:03:34.630> to<00:03:35.590> kind<00:03:35.770> of

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
last exercise the pentatonic to kind of

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.830 
last exercise the pentatonic to kind of
show<00:03:36.010> how<00:03:36.160> that<00:03:36.310> works<00:03:36.550> basically<00:03:37.420> you're

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
show how that works basically you're

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.120 
show how that works basically you're
going<00:03:37.960> to<00:03:38.020> be<00:03:38.110> plucking<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.680> string<00:03:38.950> with

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
going to be plucking the string with

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.230 
going to be plucking the string with
your<00:03:39.250> pick<00:03:39.490> once<00:03:40.080> so<00:03:41.080> pick<00:03:41.350> and<00:03:42.040> then<00:03:42.880> using

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
your pick once so pick and then using

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.090 
your pick once so pick and then using
this<00:03:43.420> finger<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:44.110> strength<00:03:44.410> in<00:03:44.560> it<00:03:44.710> you<00:03:44.860> push

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
this finger the strength in it you push

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.270 
this finger the strength in it you push
to<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.340> higher<00:03:46.000> fret<00:03:46.680> so<00:03:47.680> in<00:03:47.770> this<00:03:47.860> case<00:03:48.070> the

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
to the higher fret so in this case the

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.490 
to the higher fret so in this case the
12<00:03:48.520> to<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:48.790> 14<00:03:49.210> on<00:03:49.390> the<00:03:49.420> a<00:03:49.540> so<00:03:50.230> ready<00:03:52.500> only

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
12 to the 14 on the a so ready only

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:01.260 
12 to the 14 on the a so ready only
hitting<00:03:53.710> it<00:03:53.890> once<00:03:54.100> for<00:03:54.400> this<00:03:54.520> note<00:04:00.270> alright

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
hitting it once for this note alright

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.930 
hitting it once for this note alright
and<00:04:01.680> you<00:04:02.680> could<00:04:02.800> do<00:04:02.860> the<00:04:02.980> opposite<00:04:03.280> of<00:04:03.400> that<00:04:03.550> by

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
and you could do the opposite of that by

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.910 
and you could do the opposite of that by
hitting<00:04:04.180> this<00:04:04.420> string<00:04:04.750> I<00:04:04.930> mean<00:04:05.560> hitting<00:04:05.740> this

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
hitting this string I mean hitting this

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.650 
hitting this string I mean hitting this
note<00:04:06.220> and<00:04:06.430> pulling<00:04:07.030> off<00:04:07.860> so<00:04:08.860> hitting<00:04:09.040> here

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
note and pulling off so hitting here

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:16.249 
note and pulling off so hitting here
only<00:04:10.660> once<00:04:11.310> pull<00:04:12.310> off

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:16.259 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:27.860 

so<00:04:17.259> hammer-on<00:04:17.739> pull-off

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.150 

all<00:04:28.870> right<00:04:28.990> you<00:04:29.140> can<00:04:29.290> use<00:04:29.440> that<00:04:29.620> on<00:04:29.740> the<00:04:29.860> scale

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
all right you can use that on the scale

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.610 
all right you can use that on the scale
first<00:04:30.520> starting<00:04:30.910> off<00:04:31.060> with<00:04:31.630> hammer<00:04:31.900> ons<00:04:32.170> on

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
first starting off with hammer ons on

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:40.650 
first starting off with hammer ons on
the<00:04:33.100> 12<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:33.550> pentatonic<00:04:39.360> then<00:04:40.360> we<00:04:40.450> could<00:04:40.600> do

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
the 12 the pentatonic then we could do

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:47.280 
the 12 the pentatonic then we could do
pull<00:04:40.870> offs<00:04:41.050> going<00:04:41.320> down<00:04:45.510> all<00:04:46.510> right<00:04:46.660> creates<00:04:47.230> a

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
pull offs going down all right creates a

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.350 
pull offs going down all right creates a
pretty<00:04:47.500> cool<00:04:47.710> effect<00:04:47.970> then<00:04:48.970> we<00:04:49.030> could<00:04:49.150> try<00:04:49.300> to

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
pretty cool effect then we could try to

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.140 
pretty cool effect then we could try to
pull<00:04:49.570> offs<00:04:49.780> going<00:04:50.380> down<00:04:53.880> and<00:04:54.880> then<00:04:55.030> the

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
pull offs going down and then the

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.360 
pull offs going down and then the
opposite<00:04:55.540> hammer<00:04:55.780> ons<00:04:55.960> going<00:04:56.230> up<00:04:59.220> so<00:05:00.220> try

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
opposite hammer ons going up so try

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.690 
opposite hammer ons going up so try
doing<00:05:00.400> that<00:05:00.760> scale<00:05:01.000> like<00:05:01.210> that<00:05:01.240> you<00:05:01.540> know
