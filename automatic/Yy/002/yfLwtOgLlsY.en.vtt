00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.990
 so here is this pattern number six 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.340
 here so this is his final series here 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.859
 so it looks like it is in the video itself 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:22.170
 there is portable but this is already specific 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:27.529
 which he is here made a little 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.529
 longer than the number the fifth kind of genus 6 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.000
 clamps directly under 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.660
 clamps specially made these 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.440
 dredging that is so ward i am pressing 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:46.309
 so the boxes are pressed in the form 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:56.550
 box of pricks or him boxed here 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:59.039
 clear up with stainless steel and a half 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.930
 millimeter but since it fastens on 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:12.290
 clamp I still stood here such 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:15.500
 extra option which needles stick out 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.700
 they mean they now 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.939
 screwed out that is here here is the level with 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.950
 hat and do not stick out here they do not stick out 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.820
 by sissy note a little bit in the side 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.390
 wrapped up 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.400
 and they perform a little bit for this 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.750
 to try and work her 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.299
 clamps and needles 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.860
 purely for general development for yourself then 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.180
 try not like it means on 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.090
 use clamps so it is done 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:46.530
 at the request of workers under 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.860
 18 cutter well, as it were, a comfortable bar under 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:54.060
 magnetic lock drove without removing cut 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.659
 the loop is the same that I use 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:02.090
 cuts 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:02.090
 battleships ska is also not 16 18 she has code 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.780
 cat 92 18 catalog that is possible 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:16.890
 everywhere in the search engine to dial the Internet 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:24.739
 prize encore 92 18 and and but all so 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:29.120
 bearing is used such a number 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:32.810
 608 outer 22 internally 8 exactly si 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.720
 covered with such rubber seals 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.220
 if there is still iron seals but 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.250
 which iron they are hammered very 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.930
 quickly these go on for a long time i mean i 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.610
 I work for half a year alone for a class I 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.819
 nothing or nothing is done to him without 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.819
 of problems 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:58.079
 so further in the cabin there is fair 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:59.519
 the contour is this internal that is that 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.640
 there is here specifically for you 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:08.970
 there is a mill 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:10.500
 it is now clear how the loop has such 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.530
 little leaf 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.910
 That is, you do not get a tie- in 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.090
 tight and to score 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.250
 loop then into the groove so you can not just 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.750
 do because the series will score in 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.760
 paste the edges near the milling can 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.609
 crack if we assume lacquered 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.650
 the surface is not easy and just chipped off 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.540
 veneer in this place so Peter seems to be 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.829
 walks freely 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:40.639
 but without critical colors and of course 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:43.620
 so adjustment to mismatch 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:46.860
 canvas thickness decided not a quarter 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:51.030
 the box is exactly the same as 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:54.120
 in template number five are exactly the same 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.240
 go to the minutes they are transitions here 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.060
 they have two types of thickness 1 thickness here 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:03.780
 the second thickness is half a point that is either so 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:09.210
 either turned over so that is like this 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:10.940
 and put on all leaning against the canvas 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.310
 and accordingly you have a loop 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:17.190
 moves away here or at such a distance 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:19.799
 or here at such a distance could at on 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:23.120
 choosing a teaser sensi some kind of trash not 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.120
 need to compensate 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:31.530
 Well, how would all this pattern number 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:34.110
 6 that is, there is 1 series 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.770
 pattern number six pattern number 3 and with 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:40.130
 angle number four they have configuration 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.660
 they are all the same therefore 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:46.800
 the above patterns are just different 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.810
 notch this is all a pattern 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:55.970
 number six under 100 songs 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:05:00.930
 loop pattern number 34 this is under 125 by 120 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:03.290
 Well, somehow had to the k to thanks for 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.290
 Attention
