there's one I can get in there yeah
they're<00:04:20.390> still<00:04:20.630> here<00:04:21.020> it's<00:04:21.260> just<00:04:21.470> that<00:04:21.620> we

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
they're still here it's just that we

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.250 
they're still here it's just that we
took<00:04:22.580> over<00:04:22.730> the<00:04:22.940> area<00:04:23.120> and<00:04:23.480> change<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:24.080> place

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
took over the area and change the place

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.250 
took over the area and change the place
around<00:04:24.410> a<00:04:24.650> little<00:04:24.770> bit<00:04:24.950> I<00:04:25.600> guess<00:04:26.600> we're<00:04:26.960> making

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
around a little bit I guess we're making

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.880 
around a little bit I guess we're making
I<00:04:28.270> don't<00:04:29.270> know<00:04:29.390> play<00:04:29.720> good<00:04:30.020> trees<00:04:30.290> I'm<00:04:30.710> not

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
I don't know play good trees I'm not

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.980 
I don't know play good trees I'm not
sure<00:04:31.100> really<00:04:31.490> what<00:04:31.640> we're<00:04:31.850> doing<00:04:32.090> there<00:04:32.240> and

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
sure really what we're doing there and

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.920 
sure really what we're doing there and
over<00:04:33.140> here<00:04:33.290> is<00:04:33.680> a<00:04:33.790> lowbie<00:04:34.790> questing<00:04:35.270> area<00:04:35.600> that

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
over here is a lowbie questing area that

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.470 
over here is a lowbie questing area that
pretty<00:04:36.560> much<00:04:36.710> is<00:04:36.920> unchanged<00:04:37.640> we<00:04:38.090> have<00:04:38.210> to<00:04:38.330> kill

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
pretty much is unchanged we have to kill

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.840 
pretty much is unchanged we have to kill
rogue<00:04:38.780> Undead<00:04:39.470> maybe<00:04:40.040> the<00:04:40.190> quests<00:04:40.580> here<00:04:40.730> are

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
rogue Undead maybe the quests here are

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.450 
rogue Undead maybe the quests here are
different<00:04:41.180> maybe<00:04:41.480> they're<00:04:41.810> still<00:04:42.250> undead<00:04:43.250> but

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
different maybe they're still undead but

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.790 
different maybe they're still undead but
I<00:04:43.520> guess<00:04:43.760> since<00:04:43.880> the<00:04:44.030> lich<00:04:44.180> king<00:04:44.210> is<00:04:44.960> out<00:04:45.770> of

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
I guess since the lich king is out of

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.790 
I guess since the lich king is out of
the<00:04:45.950> picture<00:04:46.600> maybe<00:04:47.600> i'm<00:04:48.140> not<00:04:48.290> sure<00:04:48.500> how<00:04:48.620> that

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
the picture maybe i'm not sure how that

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.070 
the picture maybe i'm not sure how that
works<00:04:49.090> so<00:04:50.090> be<00:04:50.210> a<00:04:50.240> little<00:04:50.420> different<00:04:50.570> I<00:04:50.900> don't

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
works so be a little different I don't

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.730 
works so be a little different I don't
know<00:04:52.480> there's<00:04:53.480> guy<00:04:53.690> just<00:04:53.960> chillin<00:04:54.410> on<00:04:54.530> his
