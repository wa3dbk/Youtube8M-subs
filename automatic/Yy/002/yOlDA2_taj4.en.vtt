00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:47.080 

she<00:00:41.620> dry<00:00:42.620> shampoo<00:00:42.980> is<00:00:43.160> usually<00:00:43.460> used<00:00:43.790> for<00:00:46.090> and

she dry shampoo is usually used for and

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.250 
she dry shampoo is usually used for and
I<00:00:47.210> think<00:00:47.450> this<00:00:47.540> is<00:00:47.660> still<00:00:47.840> going<00:00:47.990> to<00:00:48.080> be<00:00:48.140> the

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
I think this is still going to be the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.650 
I think this is still going to be the
case<00:00:48.470> in<00:00:48.710> the<00:00:48.770> hair<00:00:48.950> so<00:00:49.100> we<00:00:49.190> work<00:00:49.370> to<00:00:49.520> have<00:00:49.730> in

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
case in the hair so we work to have in

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.620 
case in the hair so we work to have in
sections<00:00:51.260> we've<00:00:52.160> got<00:00:52.280> fingertips<00:00:52.820> we're

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
sections we've got fingertips we're

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:54.910 
sections we've got fingertips we're
going<00:00:53.750> to<00:00:53.810> work<00:00:53.930> it<00:00:54.080> through<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.380> roots<00:00:54.560> first

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
going to work it through the roots first

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.160 
going to work it through the roots first
so<00:00:55.220> this<00:00:55.340> is<00:00:55.520> going<00:00:55.700> to<00:00:55.760> reform<00:00:56.090> any<00:00:56.300> oils<00:00:56.989> that

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170
