00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 so they have backbones 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.629
 poisonous passing the back and 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.440
 pectoral thorns running through the 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.360
 sides 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.150
 if another animal comes into contact with 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.830
 they and were stuck going to inject poison into the 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.990
 their fabric and will be an experience 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.900
 very unpleasant 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.430
 a lion fish is a great start but tom 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.310
 which was a lot of predatory fish 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.109
 Fans of his aquarium 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.810
 look at the fish no red face 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.580
 Wow, I love this fish for 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.050
 more cool than him, I do not think 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.940
 will be good for the tone aquarium 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.680
 because he is an ambush predator 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.870
 He likes to hide and attack his 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.879
 prey he's trying to m fish 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.920
 carnivores swallow the whole run or 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.079
 in pieces user who can see that he 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.149
 It's going to rock there and here. 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.680
 when the unsuspecting fish passes through it 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:52.829
 it was already the tone does not want a boring aquarium 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.610
 he wants to see a lot of fish swimming 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.379
 over there 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.300
 This means I need to tone the 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.399
 some predatory fish fish that 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.140
 be very colorful active in nothing by 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.640
 otherwise and are not eaten by the 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.379
 predators so what I need to do 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.150
 is to find some fish that have 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.710
 defense mechanisms so that they can 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.750
 guarantee against some predators 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.189
 This fish is cool as flame calls 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:18.150
 soap fish they secrete a very mucus 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.460
 poison that prevents the attack of predators 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.740
 fox face of fish has a 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.450
 Very cool feature are poisonous 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.970
 and has poisonous backbones and 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.770
 yellow and black color warns them 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.570
 that predators should move away 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.540
 because they are poisonous fish I do not 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.430
 makes them serious because of the 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.320
 characteristics of fox face 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.840
 I think I would be a good candidate not to 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.210
 preacher in an aquarium of predators 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.189
 these are some good options but not 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.750
 solve this riddle today I need 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.549
 think a little more and I'll make the choice 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.799
 end later if I do not explore the 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.020
 uncertain species all the fish that I 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.710
 put in a gift aquarium probably 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.539
 will die 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.810
 I totally hope you can 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.810
 solve 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:11.260
 we need to start aquarian reinforce 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.049
 coffee as soon as possible 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.280
 The first step is for the Pope to select 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:18.849
 the corals he wants 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.090
 was to show how you would like to see it 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.640
 we also have produced more than 250 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.519
 types of corals in different colors 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.049
 probably the most in this sector I think 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.870
 that the day will be impressed with the 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.849
 variety of choice that I will have 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.959
 eager to go there and see what you 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.000
 they are doing 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:41.650
 so come on now I'll leave the din 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.030
 com br is very cool right down here my 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.260
 project manager I totally trust 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.389
 in him 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.060
 he knows what we do and how we do it 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:50.620
 better than anyone else is. 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.850
 in great hands man we talk more 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.470
 late until later 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.880
 I can be last, there are things I want 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.799
 that are made and is very important 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.510
 may this project go well 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.579
 I know you've worked with clients who 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.530
 have different expectations so he 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:05.590
 you think it's legal that the 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.150
 Quality is good I'm very confident 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.069
 That the day will be happy. 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.780
 this is our coral room is where 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.090
 we do everything I want you to see all the 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.730
 different colors we have available 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.260
 I am director of company biology and 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.720
 my responsibility to ensure that 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.910
 these aquariums are spectacular 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.669
 I want it to look like an ocean of 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.019
 several on a lot of these you do 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:29.349
 some plate different from this 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.299
 these deals blue my god I do not 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.299
 I want it to look so false and so 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:36.280
 bright that it muse exact animated 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.919
 It's a good cartoon suit. 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.920
 those colors they know they would be 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:43.269
 on my do not list 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.249
 It would have been nice to know that money 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.219
 was trained in marine biology before 

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:50.079
 of this trip the corals and this color you 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:50.920
 that is, it seems from outer space 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.049
 very bright 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.480
 It's very bright yellow and I can not 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:58.060
 Look at him, I know I can use it on 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.099
 other places but this annoys me here 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.939
 this service just got more 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.310
 difficult 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:06.069
 If it can not be done let's cut the 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.900
 bait and then we're looking for someone else 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.669
 oding should be here watching the corals 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.069
 what he likes and now he's ready 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:14.500
 to hire another company the thing is not 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.269
 It's good, what matters to me is that the 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.130
 end product is what I want it 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.930
 business will not work 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.729
 one of my worries is that you 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.620
 they do not have taste a lot of variety 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:28.320
 if you want it to look real come on you need 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.570
 to follow what the value has already been 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.990
 this stuff is not meant to be used this 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.990
 way 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.120
 aquariums that reinforce coffee is in the 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.550
 asking to redo are horrible 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.620
 but we can not do anything without the dim 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.150
 own send us get it is 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.430
 combining by choosing the corals that he 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.350
 for a new one and if so far the 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.539
 things do not look good I'm not 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.330
 Wishing this is very bright 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:56.130
 I do not know how much is too false. 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.510
 some of these corals seem to have come 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.280
 of outer space 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.800
 I do not want to see very bright things. 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.620
 because these very bright pieces 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.870
 do the other means disappear 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.150
 I am forcing the fact that I know how the 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.039
 I am a specialist and I know 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.560
 what I want is what I can do 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:15.389
 in my opinion we make the reefs 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.050
 most incredible synthetic corals 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:17.850
 world 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.350
 We have some parts that most of the 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.300
 customers and life because they are not 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.639
 very alive but can be exactly 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.710
 asking is wanting this is a set 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:29.300
 very cool of what we do in relation to 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.300
 colors textures and sizes
