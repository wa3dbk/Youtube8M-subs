00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.680
 Thinking about friends today, let's talk about fleas 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.540
 pesticides as we know now the 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.950
 my hot season mission this is a 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:29.300
 topic much debated above all 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.220
 in using these substances or not 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.599
 toxic 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.250
 obviously there is no doubt that this 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.530
 new toxic substances to toxicity 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.449
 especially to avoid discussions 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.420
 important diseases with rickettsiosis 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.370
 closed in the wyglobal mafiosi he had 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.510
 said that these substances have their own 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.440
 toxicity 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.659
 the company not to take under fairs 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.460
 especially in those situations where 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:54.650
 subjects for example elderly subjects e 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.989
 subjects with heart disease the subjects who 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.519
 they have kidney diseases but also moments 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.799
 in subjects who have disorders 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:04.690
 immunological these substances can 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:07.670
 interfering powerful more or less 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.380
 creating many problems in these 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.930
 subjects 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.729
 because this because obviously when 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.340
 we are going to administer these 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.710
 substances through sebach selection 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.420
 to what is distributed over the whole 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.030
 body but I read a part of the 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.610
 absorbed immediately through the 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.020
 blood in fact exists indeed 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.880
 at the atomic hollywood are liver 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.700
 as also in subjects where this james 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.010
 dog but what is manual liver disease 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.630
 or subjects who have 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.140
 major heart disease insufficiency 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:45.200
 renal projects between the two logical friends 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.060
 you have to be very careful in the hotel a 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.980
 considered even more a very factor 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.780
 important that these substances are 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:57.730
 fall in the list is not here you can 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:02.470
 he himself and we say go to 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:05.960
 view that on the site of the Senate 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:09.200
 www.senato.it is included in the substances that 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.060
 are cataloged as interferers 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.959
 endocrine thing where you are at the center 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.269
 in nine they are substances that they simulate 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.400
 nation the hormones produced by the system 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:23.090
 in domino inducing reactions 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.760
 abnormal biochemistry and night blogs in the 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.980
 sectors of the cells that I recognize 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.109
 hormones therefore lawful I fill nalin 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.909
 preventing the normal action of hormones 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:34.790
 been able to endogenous system that 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:36.950
 I am the genius of the definition 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.010
 of these interferers of us pilots 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.650
 inter federdoc imi also acts on 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.719
 metabolism transport synthesis e 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.150
 excretion of natural hormones 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:49.430
 thus altering the concentration then 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.870
 have interference on the activity 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:56.420
 some hormonal to similar innovation 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.579
 estrogenic then go to say a 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.959
 best targeting especially the 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.510
 breast 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.099
 I obviously also think about the thyroid if 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.709
 we then think that these substances 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.540
 we are called custodians 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.550
 proper correspondence of organs 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.010
 important like the 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.300
 think of closeness when we do 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.610
 the spot on 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.710
 the proximity of the product in 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.780
 own correspondence of the thyroid plus 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.580
 the small dog plus this closeness e 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.520
 higher 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.620
 also considering that when 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.810
 we love to administer moved from 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.660
 There are very close to the head 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.040
 substances that loosen the 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.740
 sensitize those who are i 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.400
 neurons and therefore in a certain way 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.380
 they can set up subjects that they are 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.870
 predisposed to these diseases 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.520
 can trigger reactions 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.710
 epileptic at night may ignite 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.420
 also the nervous system are the subjects 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.280
 predisposed 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.840
 obviously there are those situations in 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.540
 which we cannot do without 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.340
 use these substances you are looking for 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.670
 especially in those situations where 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.170
 these diseases are the endemic face 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.090
 then in that case obviously you need to 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.240
 limit the use to which those in those 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.070
 periods and obviously associate the use of 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.900
 pesticides of substances e 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.360
 a diet that favors the 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.810
 drainage and eliminations are substances 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.669
 rates eliminate these substances favor 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.760
 then drainage elimination 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.830
 through feces and urine the 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.350
 substances such as the friend some 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.630
 fungi in mycotherapy help a 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.600
 eliminate heavy metals or anything but 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.240
 even the same macro toxic substances 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.580
 Carella are the weapons that helps 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.310
 eliminate these toxic substances no 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.340
 theme feeding bring more towards 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.870
 the alkalizing power that 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.300
 vegetable ratio 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.940
 centrifuged to promote diuresis 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.360
 to favor the water supply and 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.950
 try to limit the use of food 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.830
 buckets that do nothing but instead 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:00.710
 which below opens in liquids and therefore 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:02.630
 slow down the journey of the material 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.720
 fecal and consequently also for 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.530
 loosen those bile flow that 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.540
 fundamental of grace of these 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:12.020
 substances is the possibility of using 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.910
 of natural averages 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.550
 here too there are possibilities of 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:19.550
 associate more natural firsts with an oil 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.410
 of nuts among the oil and her titles there are 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.990
 other other essences that can be 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.630
 associate it with the vinegar of 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.010
 apples or in the substance it favors 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.620
 you the dissolution of the Quaestors 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.330
 essential and therefore through a 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.040
 innovation comes distribution 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.370
 daily of these of these essences 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:40.840
 we try to create a sort of action 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:43.880
 repellent preventing the building of 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:47.230
 settle breath but come on but that much 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.520
 often the mosquito for example goes to 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:52.280
 settle half native where everything is 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.870
 little hair therefore also for example in 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:59.750
 correspondence and truffle is an area on the 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:01.570
 sector where generally the analyzes of the 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.580
 place and therefore must 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:07.240
 I have to go now 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.240
 then there is the rest
