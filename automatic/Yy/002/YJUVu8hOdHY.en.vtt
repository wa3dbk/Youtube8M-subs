00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.710
 hello to all men 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.929
 finally a new video in this case 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.369
 a video you requested is a 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.680
 project that we showed up 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.359
 instagram n fortunately diets a 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.279
 fruit I'll show you how I got 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.340
 made the plates those of the 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.320
 light to turn on the switch at home 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.880
 of my pollutants I show a 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.910
 little the procedures of this 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.170
 hincapie the decoupage technique 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.600
 easy to do you can do 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.899
 we all say let's see immediately 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.620
 what you need for this project 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:45.870
 I will use over my plate 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.309
 of the big necklace they have to dilute 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.469
 with a little water a primer brush 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:55.770
 grasping and a protective varnish e 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.930
 obviously the image I want 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.760
 apply on my plate that can 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:05.250
 be a unique image or I can 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.409
 possibly compose it as the first one 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.780
 passage to be spread of the first 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.880
 clinging to my surface 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.850
 this is a key passage way 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.830
 such that if you choose to put 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.479
 of the color on the surface therefore a 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.369
 acrylic or as I do 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.400
 directly an image immediately 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:27.229
 will allow the surface to cling 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.229
 better the one you put on 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.570
 stand it anywhere and then let it dry 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.830
 so most of it has dried 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.230
 now I can go and spend 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:49.320
 my vinavil glue diluted with some 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:52.550
 of water where it must not be neither too much 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.290
 something in-between is not too dense or too liquid 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:02:03.060
 and then spread it over the whole 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:12.200
 plate before I do the part 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:12.200
 front in this way 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:24.410
 now I'm going to get the picture that 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:33.720
 I want to apply and wash them 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:41.160
 as you can see I have overturned the plate e 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:44.000
 I'm going to put the ball in two edges and 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.000
 now tv 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:03:01.079
 inward and to make the corner 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:05.920
 I'm going to do some sort of tip then 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:08.519
 I will ask inside and I will always stop 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.519
 with a little glue 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:22.000
 the same thing I do also for the 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:25.120
 others and now with cutting scissors 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:32.770
 the excess made make all the corners 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:34.900
 now I can go to open the 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.320
 small windows where they will go 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.320
 switches 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.030
 in this way 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:10.590
 and I do the same thing for the outside 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.590
 where the screws will then be inserted 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.490
 at this point let it dry and now 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:28.070
 I can go and apply my paint 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:29.570
 protective and also this time leaves 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.340
 to dry 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.460
 and here it is as you saw i 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.470
 passages are really simple you can 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.350
 do also with the various subjects and second 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.660
 maybe the room in which it is located 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.130
 I'll show you some photos of 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.320
 other models I made 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.139
 some have been used for 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.110
 one bathroom and the other for a form 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:52.460
 kitchen i hope you enjoy this 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.650
 project and that you do too 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.910
 let me know with a comment below 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.470
