00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.369
 second sheep is actually mine for me 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.410
 daily life because find it every day 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.270
 busy in the super with the border too 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.160
 so much can achieve it 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.870
 science is the basis for me 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.699
 everything around us is super interesting 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.410
 is fascinating for me 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:37.580
 trying to understand science 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.420
 just understand everything around you 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.280
 happens 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.050
 and then use that knowledge to own something 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.010
 to be made of your molar in the 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.379
 society 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.720
 science means to me to think 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.920
 about things and making sure their goal is 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.019
 but a fool reach where you lay 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.019
 can help people and society 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.000
 Here's who make things that sees everywhere 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.400
 when the youth would n't like it 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.320
 technology are everywhere i look there 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.970
 is somewhere somewhere behind this should be somewhere 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.470
 hiring then have made contact 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.400
 we have tested with that 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.400
 and that's why i am 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.300
 so something different than just going to every day 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.550
 come to school 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.380
 and then also see that putu is people 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.380
 maybe the late work really sing around 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.960
 I have to say I have a lot 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.530
 had preparatory work but like me now 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.479
 see how my students react 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.510
 I certainly want the accident on the Netherlands and 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.979
 fixed artis I did not mean it I 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.990
 enjoy these days because mine 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:00.570
 we don't see students so yes it is 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.860
 it is really super and apples and that you 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.380
 can seti handle the journey 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.350
 I say I note oh and very far 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.880
 I needed and thought we would 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.229
 may because then told next to it 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.360
 group of horeca times become difficult 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.770
 but also hears well helped with 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.870
 the ideal for market are as in 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.360
 pictures and so our students them 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.459
 really work very intention of it 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.620
 project that find it here and there one 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.330
 a bit difficult maybe but they are looking 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.660
 they stay them too and they find them 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.610
 answer well 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.610
 yes it works really well 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.260
 wonderful system to do 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.340
 students is in a spontaneous way with 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.930
 seeing things 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.540
 walk in rocks chance with you physically 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.129
 referred to series and parallel circuits 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.870
 but they are all much alone 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:52.049
 simpler and so 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.910
 worked light to something and it is 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.849
 just lots of woods on the mini too 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.230
 and there are usually also 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.690
 the class Jan tab is one here 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.060
 everyone is active 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.590
 come and see do this with your students 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.590
 when you see it works
