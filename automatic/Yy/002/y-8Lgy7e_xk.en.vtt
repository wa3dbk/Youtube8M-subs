00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
if I just a quick update I know some

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.450 
if I just a quick update I know some
people<00:00:03.300> that<00:00:03.510> are<00:00:03.629> really<00:00:03.750> against<00:00:04.259> this<00:00:04.460> this

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
people that are really against this this

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.089 
people that are really against this this
is<00:00:05.640> about<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.720> major<00:00:07.049> water<00:00:07.440> change<00:00:07.740> I<00:00:07.890> do<00:00:07.950> I

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
is about the major water change I do I

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.530 
is about the major water change I do I
don't<00:00:08.460> know<00:00:08.550> every<00:00:09.290> one<00:00:10.290> month<00:00:10.530> two<00:00:10.830> month<00:00:11.540> and

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
don't know every one month two month and

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.760 
don't know every one month two month and
then<00:00:12.660> what<00:00:12.780> I<00:00:12.809> do<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.230> take<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.410> brush<00:00:17.090> this

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
then what I do is I take a brush this

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.099 
then what I do is I take a brush this
pad<00:00:19.770> right<00:00:20.070> here<00:00:20.150> and<00:00:21.150> it's<00:00:21.330> so<00:00:21.570> much<00:00:21.810> easier

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
pad right here and it's so much easier

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.630 
pad right here and it's so much easier
to<00:00:23.060> scrub<00:00:24.060> when<00:00:24.269> there's<00:00:24.510> nothing<00:00:24.840> in<00:00:24.960> here

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
to scrub when there's nothing in here

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.509 
to scrub when there's nothing in here
and<00:00:26.640> just<00:00:26.789> get<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.119> clean<00:00:27.890> and<00:00:28.890> clean<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.340> back

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
and just get it clean and clean the back

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.749 
and just get it clean and clean the back
and<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.119> plants<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:31.410> know<00:00:31.500> they<00:00:31.619> get<00:00:31.769> low<00:00:32.009> so

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
and the plants you know they get low so

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.709 
and the plants you know they get low so
they<00:00:32.940> don't<00:00:33.260> get<00:00:34.260> in<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.440> way<00:00:34.590> as<00:00:34.770> well<00:00:35.570> and<00:00:36.570> it

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
they don't get in the way as well and it

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.330 
they don't get in the way as well and it
just<00:00:36.899> makes<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.230> easy<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.649> do<00:00:37.829> maintenance<00:00:39.079> I

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
just makes it easy to do maintenance I

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.440 
just makes it easy to do maintenance I
don't<00:00:41.340> have<00:00:41.430> any<00:00:41.579> fish<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:42.030> here

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
don't have any fish in here

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.220 
don't have any fish in here
it's<00:00:43.140> just<00:00:43.440> shrimp<00:00:43.800> they're<00:00:44.160> pretty<00:00:44.430> hearty

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
it's just shrimp they're pretty hearty

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.880 
it's just shrimp they're pretty hearty
and<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.559> other<00:00:46.770> thing<00:00:47.070> I'm<00:00:47.219> gonna<00:00:47.370> do<00:00:48.289> is<00:00:49.289> this

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890

and the other thing I'm gonna do is this
is<00:00:50.070> also<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.430> good<00:00:50.579> time<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.969> do<00:00:51.090> any<00:00:51.270> kind<00:00:51.480> of

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
is also a good time to do any kind of

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.569 
is also a good time to do any kind of
printing<00:00:52.039> and<00:00:53.600> I'm<00:00:54.600> just<00:00:54.780> gonna<00:00:54.899> put<00:00:55.370> Prime<00:00:56.370> in

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
printing and I'm just gonna put Prime in

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.439 
printing and I'm just gonna put Prime in
here<00:00:57.199> for<00:00:58.199> about<00:00:59.100> 33<00:00:59.550> gallons<00:00:59.969> which<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
here for about 33 gallons which is the

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.810 
here for about 33 gallons which is the
volume<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> tank<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.530> then<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.309> just<00:01:02.550> test

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
volume of the tank and then I just test

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.179 
volume of the tank and then I just test
the<00:01:02.969> water<00:01:03.180> before<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.650> throw<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.799> valve<00:01:04.979> and

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
the water before I throw the valve and

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.770 
the water before I throw the valve and
do<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.400> aqueon<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.180> I'm<00:01:06.270> done

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
do the aqueon and I'm done

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.469 
do the aqueon and I'm done
and<00:01:07.130> these<00:01:08.130> guys<00:01:08.340> will<00:01:08.549> be<00:01:08.640> happy<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.360> you

just want to show you all the activity

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.890 
just want to show you all the activity
in<00:01:14.369> here<00:01:14.630> somebody<00:01:15.630> was<00:01:15.930> unhappy<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.890> had

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
in here somebody was unhappy that I had

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.620 
in here somebody was unhappy that I had
Crystal<00:01:18.900> Reds<00:01:19.110> with<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.439> red<00:01:19.890> cherry<00:01:20.130> shrimp

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
Crystal Reds with a red cherry shrimp

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:27.429 
Crystal Reds with a red cherry shrimp
those<00:01:21.630> two<00:01:21.930> will<00:01:22.229> coexist<00:01:22.950> very<00:01:23.430> well<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.090> not

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.630 

and<00:01:28.439> not<00:01:28.619> genetically<00:01:31.250> mess<00:01:32.250> with<00:01:32.490> each

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
and not genetically mess with each

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.880 
and not genetically mess with each
other's<00:01:33.680> strains<00:01:35.750> and<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.990> just<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.380> just<00:01:37.680> read

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
other's strains and I just I just read

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.359 
other's strains and I just I just read
that<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:38.939> won't<00:01:39.500> you<00:01:40.500> won't<00:01:40.680> have<00:01:40.860> Crystal

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
that so you won't you won't have Crystal

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.960 
that so you won't you won't have Crystal
Reds<00:01:41.579> going<00:01:43.130> losing<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.020> white<00:01:46.229> stripes

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
Reds going losing the the white stripes

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.770 
Reds going losing the the white stripes
I<00:01:47.970> do<00:01:48.450> think<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.140> have<00:01:50.509> something<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.689> I

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
I do think I have something that I

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.100 
I do think I have something that I
thought<00:01:51.960> was<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.470> mono<00:01:52.799> shrimp<00:01:53.720> but<00:01:54.720> it's<00:01:54.869> not

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
thought was a mono shrimp but it's not

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.350 
thought was a mono shrimp but it's not
and<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.470> see<00:01:55.619> these<00:01:55.770> clear<00:01:56.100> shrimp<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:57.180> one

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
and you see these clear shrimp and one

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.069 
and you see these clear shrimp and one
thing<00:01:57.570> I've<00:01:57.689> noticed<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.290> if<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.890> do

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
thing I've noticed is that if you do

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.389 
thing I've noticed is that if you do
coexist<00:02:01.079> shrimp<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.649> probably<00:02:02.070> will

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
coexist shrimp that probably will

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.499 
coexist shrimp that probably will
genetically<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:03.619> come<00:02:04.619> out<00:02:04.740> with<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.040> better

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
genetically that come out with a better

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.419 
genetically that come out with a better
looking<00:02:06.509> trim<00:02:07.099> you'll<00:02:08.099> just<00:02:08.399> get<00:02:08.610> a

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
looking trim you'll just get a

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.800 
looking trim you'll just get a
the<00:02:10.330> zero<00:02:10.690> color<00:02:12.120> playing<00:02:13.120> linking<00:02:13.390> Tramp<00:02:13.659> but

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
the zero color playing linking Tramp but

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.830 
the zero color playing linking Tramp but
they<00:02:14.650> get<00:02:14.799> really<00:02:14.980> active<00:02:15.420> when<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.450> water<00:02:16.690> is

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
they get really active when the water is

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.240 
they get really active when the water is
low<00:02:16.870> they're<00:02:17.200> looking<00:02:17.440> for<00:02:17.590> places<00:02:17.769> to<00:02:17.950> hide

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
low they're looking for places to hide

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.680 
low they're looking for places to hide
and<00:02:18.280> they're<00:02:18.670> looking<00:02:18.940> for<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.209> water<00:02:19.390> flow

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
and they're looking for the water flow

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.680 
and they're looking for the water flow
and<00:02:20.230> if<00:02:20.890> anything<00:02:21.220> is<00:02:21.340> is<00:02:21.519> when<00:02:21.700> I<00:02:21.730> turn<00:02:22.480> this

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
and if anything is is when I turn this
