00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
just gonna take your pin stick it in the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.590 
just gonna take your pin stick it in the
hole<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.829> you're<00:02:04.950> gonna<00:02:05.040> hear<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.250> snap<00:02:05.600> it's

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
hole and you're gonna hear a snap it's

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.020 
hole and you're gonna hear a snap it's
gonna<00:02:06.719> snap<00:02:07.020> right<00:02:07.049> back<00:02:07.350> into<00:02:07.710> place<00:02:08.030> take

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
gonna snap right back into place take

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.720 
gonna snap right back into place take
your<00:02:09.179> white<00:02:09.450> connector<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.709> also<00:02:11.250> make<00:02:11.550> sure

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
your white connector and also make sure

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.160 
your white connector and also make sure
there's<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.060> rubber

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
there's a rubber

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.809 
there's a rubber
if<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.350> rubber<00:02:13.590> gasket<00:02:13.860> down<00:02:14.340> in<00:02:14.490> here<00:02:14.610> that

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
if a rubber gasket down in here that

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.100 
if a rubber gasket down in here that
goes<00:02:14.970> around<00:02:15.090> here<00:02:15.330> make<00:02:15.569> sure<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.810> put<00:02:15.960> that

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
goes around here make sure to put that

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.260 
goes around here make sure to put that
back<00:02:16.290> in<00:02:16.500> if<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.740> comes<00:02:16.920> out<00:02:17.130> or<00:02:17.730> if<00:02:17.850> it<00:02:17.940> doesn't

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
back in if it comes out or if it doesn't

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.400 
back in if it comes out or if it doesn't
have<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.450> replace<00:02:18.959> it<00:02:19.110> because<00:02:19.170> that's

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
have that replace it because that's

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.960 
have that replace it because that's
gonna<00:02:19.500> keep<00:02:19.709> water<00:02:20.040> out<00:02:20.190> of<00:02:20.340> getting<00:02:20.730> into

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
gonna keep water out of getting into

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.720 
gonna keep water out of getting into
your<00:02:21.120> wiring<00:02:21.510> connectors<00:02:22.050> but<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:23.040> then<00:02:23.250> this

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
your wiring connectors but and then this

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.330 
your wiring connectors but and then this
only<00:02:23.970> goes<00:02:24.120> on<00:02:24.270> one<00:02:24.330> way<00:02:24.690> so<00:02:24.920> you<00:02:25.920> can<00:02:26.040> see<00:02:26.220> the

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
only goes on one way so you can see the

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.800 
only goes on one way so you can see the
longer<00:02:26.670> tabs<00:02:26.910> on<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.240> bottom<00:02:27.390> they're<00:02:27.720> gonna

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
longer tabs on the bottom they're gonna

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.070 
longer tabs on the bottom they're gonna
go<00:02:28.080> in<00:02:28.260> like<00:02:28.440> this<00:02:29.570> snap<00:02:30.570> right<00:02:30.810> into<00:02:30.959> place

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
go in like this snap right into place

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.980 
go in like this snap right into place
and<00:02:31.350> that's<00:02:31.410> all<00:02:31.650> there<00:02:31.800> is<00:02:31.830> to<00:02:32.130> it<00:02:32.780> if<00:02:33.780> you're

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
and that's all there is to it if you're

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.290 
and that's all there is to it if you're
deepening<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.860> male<00:02:35.100> connector<00:02:35.310> this<00:02:36.180> is

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
deepening the male connector this is

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.820 
deepening the male connector this is
almost<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.810> exact<00:02:37.110> same<00:02:37.140> way<00:02:37.470> if<00:02:37.740> you're

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
almost the exact same way if you're

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.490 
almost the exact same way if you're
gonna<00:02:37.950> use<00:02:38.130> your<00:02:38.310> pliers<00:02:38.780> grab<00:02:39.780> on<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.380> this

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
gonna use your pliers grab on to this

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.979 
gonna use your pliers grab on to this
little<00:02:40.680> white<00:02:40.950> part<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:42.030> gently<00:02:42.810> pull<00:02:43.050> out

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
little white part and gently pull out

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.870 
little white part and gently pull out
and<00:02:45.989> it<00:02:46.080> pulls<00:02:46.320> right<00:02:46.470> out<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:47.580> like<00:02:47.730> I<00:02:47.820> said

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
and it pulls right out and like I said

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.210 
and it pulls right out and like I said
this<00:02:48.150> only<00:02:48.330> can<00:02:48.570> go<00:02:48.780> in<00:02:48.959> one<00:02:49.320> way<00:02:49.350> so<00:02:49.830> you<00:02:49.890> can't

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
this only can go in one way so you can't

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.479 
this only can go in one way so you can't
put<00:02:50.489> it<00:02:50.580> in<00:02:50.700> backwards<00:02:51.830> lay<00:02:52.830> that<00:02:53.010> at<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.220> side

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
put it in backwards lay that at the side

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.460 
put it in backwards lay that at the side
and<00:02:54.300> right<00:02:54.510> here<00:02:54.630> is<00:02:54.720> almost<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.140> exact<00:02:55.440> same

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
and right here is almost the exact same

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.949 
and right here is almost the exact same
thing<00:02:56.070> see<00:02:56.910> if<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:57.030> can<00:02:57.150> get<00:02:57.269> it<00:02:57.360> close<00:02:57.570> up<00:02:57.780> on

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
thing see if I can get it close up on

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.330 
thing see if I can get it close up on
that<00:02:59.269> yeah<00:03:00.269> and<00:03:00.810> so<00:03:01.140> you<00:03:01.170> can<00:03:01.410> see<00:03:01.620> on<00:03:01.739> top<00:03:01.769> of

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
that yeah and so you can see on top of

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.240 
that yeah and so you can see on top of
this<00:03:03.200> on<00:03:04.200> top<00:03:04.380> of<00:03:04.440> these<00:03:04.680> there's<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:05.010> little

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
this on top of these there's a little

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.310 
this on top of these there's a little
tab<00:03:05.489> holding<00:03:05.910> them<00:03:06.000> in<00:03:06.180> same<00:03:06.989> way<00:03:07.170> you're

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
tab holding them in same way you're

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:16.759 
tab holding them in same way you're
gonna<00:03:07.470> push<00:03:08.090> up<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:09.769> then<00:03:10.769> back<00:03:10.980> out<00:03:15.590> and<00:03:16.590> as

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
gonna push up and then back out and as

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.020 
gonna push up and then back out and as
simple<00:03:16.980> as<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:17.519> now<00:03:17.670> it's<00:03:17.790> just<00:03:17.880> gonna

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
simple as that and now it's just gonna

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.660 
simple as that and now it's just gonna
pull<00:03:18.299> off<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.600> back<00:03:19.040> and<00:03:20.040> that's<00:03:20.250> that's<00:03:20.489> it

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
pull off the back and that's that's it

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.370 
pull off the back and that's that's it
you're<00:03:20.880> gonna<00:03:20.970> dice<00:03:21.180> how<00:03:21.299> you<00:03:21.360> deepen<00:03:21.840> it<00:03:21.989> and

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
you're gonna dice how you deepen it and

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.350 
you're gonna dice how you deepen it and
to<00:03:22.980> pin<00:03:23.340> it<00:03:23.459> back<00:03:23.610> you're<00:03:23.850> just<00:03:23.970> gonna<00:03:24.060> put<00:03:24.269> it

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
to pin it back you're just gonna put it

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.580 
to pin it back you're just gonna put it
back<00:03:24.390> in<00:03:24.600> there<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.620> hear<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.640> snap<00:03:27.410> and<00:03:28.410> once

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
back in there and hear the snap and once

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.190 
back in there and hear the snap and once
you<00:03:28.680> hear<00:03:28.829> the<00:03:28.860> snap<00:03:29.510> you<00:03:30.510> got<00:03:30.660> it<00:03:30.780> into<00:03:30.959> place

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
you hear the snap you got it into place

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.400 
you hear the snap you got it into place
should<00:03:32.010> snap<00:03:32.250> right<00:03:32.280> back<00:03:32.730> into<00:03:32.910> place<00:03:33.410> and

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
should snap right back into place and

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.300 
should snap right back into place and
then<00:03:34.530> you're<00:03:34.620> gonna<00:03:34.709> take<00:03:34.890> your<00:03:34.950> white

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
then you're gonna take your white

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.699 
then you're gonna take your white
connector<00:03:35.850> you<00:03:36.750> can<00:03:36.780> always<00:03:37.019> know<00:03:37.350> which<00:03:37.530> way

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
connector you can always know which way

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.590 
connector you can always know which way
it<00:03:37.829> goes<00:03:38.070> because<00:03:38.370> there's<00:03:38.610> a<00:03:38.670> longer<00:03:39.000> tab<00:03:39.360> on

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
it goes because there's a longer tab on

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.690 
it goes because there's a longer tab on
the<00:03:39.720> bottom<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.799> it's<00:03:40.950> shorter<00:03:41.220> on<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.430> top

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
the bottom and it's shorter on the top

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.060 
the bottom and it's shorter on the top
the<00:03:42.540> longer<00:03:42.900> tab<00:03:43.110> is<00:03:43.350> gonna<00:03:43.530> go<00:03:43.709> into<00:03:43.950> these

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
the longer tab is gonna go into these

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.180 
the longer tab is gonna go into these
holes<00:03:44.370> on<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:44.850> bottom<00:03:45.000> so<00:03:45.950> you're<00:03:46.950> gonna<00:03:47.040> do

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
holes on the bottom so you're gonna do

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.259 
holes on the bottom so you're gonna do
that<00:03:48.019> put<00:03:49.019> it<00:03:49.110> back<00:03:49.200> in<00:03:49.380> there<00:03:50.060> snap<00:03:51.060> it<00:03:51.239> back

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
that put it back in there snap it back

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.560 
that put it back in there snap it back
into<00:03:51.540> place<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:52.049> hear<00:03:52.170> a<00:03:52.200> snap<00:03:52.700> so<00:03:53.700> that's<00:03:54.390> all
