expect<00:07:30.820> from<00:07:31.180> a<00:07:31.330> kit<00:07:31.509> kat<00:07:31.720> wrong<00:07:32.020> it<00:07:32.470> doesn't

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:32.830 
expect from a kit kat wrong it doesn't

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.469 
expect from a kit kat wrong it doesn't
have<00:07:32.919> a<00:07:32.979> whole<00:07:33.550> lot<00:07:33.580> of<00:07:33.880> options<00:07:34.210> but<00:07:34.330> the

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 
have a whole lot of options but the

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:36.390 
have a whole lot of options but the
science<00:07:34.810> and<00:07:34.930> more<00:07:35.020> options<00:07:35.349> are<00:07:35.500> there<00:07:35.830> so
