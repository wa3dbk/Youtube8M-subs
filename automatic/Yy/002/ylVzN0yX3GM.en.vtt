not my first q but that's my like
smallest<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:52.050> my<00:00:52.289> collection<00:00:52.590> my<00:00:53.160> mini<00:00:53.879> three

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
smallest of my collection my mini three

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.529 
smallest of my collection my mini three
by<00:00:54.510> three<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:55.430> spins<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.850> guess<00:00:57.059> okay<00:00:57.390> it's

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
by three it spins I guess okay it's

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.849 
by three it spins I guess okay it's
lubricated<00:00:57.930> with<00:00:58.079> like<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.289> tiny<00:00:58.530> bit<00:00:58.739> of

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
lubricated with like a tiny bit of

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.560 
lubricated with like a tiny bit of
Vaseline<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.629> it's<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:01.140> like<00:01:01.469> disintegrating

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
Vaseline and it's it like disintegrating

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.810 
Vaseline and it's it like disintegrating
just<00:01:03.570> pop<00:01:03.809> out<00:01:03.930> really<00:01:04.170> easily<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.650> I'm<00:01:05.280> think

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
just pop out really easily and I'm think

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.880 
just pop out really easily and I'm think
you<00:01:05.909> can<00:01:06.090> see<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.479> come<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.080> focus<00:01:07.350> there<00:01:07.770> you

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
you can see it come on focus there you

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.100 
you can see it come on focus there you
go<00:01:07.979> it's<00:01:08.580> sort<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:09.000> disintegrating<00:01:09.720> along<00:01:09.930> the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
go it's sort of disintegrating along the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.960 
go it's sort of disintegrating along the
side<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.409> little<00:01:10.590> bit<00:01:10.890> like<00:01:11.610> there's<00:01:11.820> other

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
side a little bit like there's other

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.020 
side a little bit like there's other
pieces<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.420> are<00:01:12.540> worse<00:01:12.689> but<00:01:13.729> yeah<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.880> then

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
pieces that are worse but yeah and then

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.670 
pieces that are worse but yeah and then
I<00:01:15.119> took<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.479> key<00:01:15.659> chain<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:15.960> off<00:01:16.380> right

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
I took the key chain that off right

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.700 
I took the key chain that off right
there<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.220> really<00:01:17.549> annoying<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.119> then<00:01:18.710> next

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
there is really annoying and then next

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.190 
there is really annoying and then next
year's<00:01:20.130> my<00:01:20.280> second<00:01:20.790> key<00:01:20.880> chain<00:01:21.119> team<00:01:21.390> spends<00:01:22.140> a

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
year's my second key chain team spends a

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.080 
year's my second key chain team spends a
lot<00:01:22.380> better<00:01:22.590> he's<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.770> lot<00:01:23.100> more<00:01:23.310> tolerance<00:01:23.580> for

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
lot better he's a lot more tolerance for

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.490 
lot better he's a lot more tolerance for
some<00:01:24.240> reason<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.600> thing<00:01:24.810> as<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.930> screw<00:01:25.229> spring

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
some reason this thing as a screw spring

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.649 
some reason this thing as a screw spring
structure<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.820> actually<00:01:27.180> can<00:01:27.299> tighten<00:01:27.600> and

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
structure and actually can tighten and

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.640 
structure and actually can tighten and
loosen<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.020> screws<00:01:28.229> that's<00:01:28.409> why<00:01:28.470> there's

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
loosen the screws that's why there's

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.880 
loosen the screws that's why there's
holes<00:01:28.950> on<00:01:29.130> every<00:01:29.310> side<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:30.530> it's<00:01:31.530> pretty<00:01:31.710> cool

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
holes on every side and it's pretty cool

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.130 
holes on every side and it's pretty cool
right<00:01:32.130> this<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.210> what<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.390> take<00:01:33.659> if<00:01:33.840> I'm<00:01:33.960> going

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
right this is what I take if I'm going

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.660
