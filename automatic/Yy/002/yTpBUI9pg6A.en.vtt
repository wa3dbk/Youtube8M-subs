00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
comment suggesting that they should make

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.150 
comment suggesting that they should make
it<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:42.030> power<00:02:42.660> weapon<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.470> make<00:02:43.799> like<00:02:43.980> the

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
it a power weapon and make like the

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.729 
it a power weapon and make like the
retros<00:02:44.640> hipfire<00:02:45.239> accuracy<00:02:45.599> like<00:02:46.200> limited

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
retros hipfire accuracy like limited

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.740 
retros hipfire accuracy like limited
because<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.610> mean<00:02:47.760> I<00:02:47.849> don't<00:02:48.030> have<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.180> problem<00:02:48.360> it

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
because I mean I don't have a problem it

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.410 
because I mean I don't have a problem it
is<00:02:48.900> overpowered<00:02:49.680> but<00:02:50.069> I<00:02:50.099> mean<00:02:50.370> it's<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.209> only

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
is overpowered but I mean it's the only

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.970 
is overpowered but I mean it's the only
thing<00:02:51.599> that<00:02:51.780> can<00:02:51.870> really<00:02:52.049> defend<00:02:52.470> against<00:02:52.769> the

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
thing that can really defend against the

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.640 
thing that can really defend against the
solid<00:02:53.370> off<00:02:53.489> so<00:02:53.880> if<00:02:54.450> you're<00:02:54.810> going<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:54.989> defend

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
solid off so if you're going to defend

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.349 
solid off so if you're going to defend
yourself<00:02:55.769> against<00:02:56.280> this<00:02:56.430> sawed-off<00:02:56.730> i<00:02:57.090> use

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
yourself against this sawed-off i use

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.690 
yourself against this sawed-off i use
the<00:02:57.510> retro<00:02:57.959> but<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.590> hipfire<00:02:58.829> on<00:02:59.340> it<00:02:59.519> just

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
the retro but the hipfire on it just

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.580 
the retro but the hipfire on it just
takes<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.090> down<00:03:00.269> too<00:03:00.569> fast<00:03:00.840> so<00:03:01.170> i<00:03:01.200> think<00:03:01.470> they

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
takes you down too fast so i think they

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.440 
takes you down too fast so i think they
should<00:03:01.799> tone<00:03:02.040> down<00:03:02.069> the<00:03:02.430> accuracy<00:03:03.000> on<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.269> hip

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
should tone down the accuracy on the hip

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.770 
should tone down the accuracy on the hip
fire<00:03:04.040> yeah<00:03:05.040> i<00:03:05.370> actually<00:03:05.579> had<00:03:06.420> something

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780

work in the druze montage and I don't

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.800 
work in the druze montage and I don't
have<00:05:19.920> any<00:05:20.100> doubt<00:05:20.310> at<00:05:20.520> my<00:05:20.640> montage<00:05:21.060> will<00:05:21.450> just

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
have any doubt at my montage will just

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.110 
have any doubt at my montage will just
be<00:05:21.990> just<00:05:22.320> as<00:05:22.560> well<00:05:22.590> edited<00:05:23.190> because<00:05:23.730> they're

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
be just as well edited because they're

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.810 
be just as well edited because they're
both<00:05:24.330> really<00:05:24.600> good<00:05:24.770> so<00:05:25.770> definitely<00:05:26.430> look

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
both really good so definitely look

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.550 
both really good so definitely look
forward<00:05:26.850> to<00:05:27.240> that<00:05:27.270> and<00:05:27.750> I<00:05:27.900> think<00:05:27.930> both<00:05:28.380> our

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
forward to that and I think both our

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.220 
forward to that and I think both our
trailers<00:05:29.070> have<00:05:29.250> got<00:05:29.790> ever<00:05:30.000> like<00:05:30.360> 10,000<00:05:31.050> views

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
trailers have got ever like 10,000 views

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.370 
trailers have got ever like 10,000 views
already<00:05:31.410> so<00:05:31.830> oh<00:05:32.120> yeah<00:05:33.120> our<00:05:33.450> montages

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
already so oh yeah our montages

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.530 
already so oh yeah our montages
definitely<00:05:34.950> have<00:05:35.130> the<00:05:35.400> hype<00:05:36.060> you<00:05:36.360> know<00:05:36.480> you

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540 
definitely have the hype you know you

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.020 
definitely have the hype you know you
need<00:05:36.840> in<00:05:37.020> order<00:05:37.140> for<00:05:37.500> montages<00:05:38.130> to<00:05:38.430> blow<00:05:38.790> up

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
need in order for montages to blow up

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.170 
need in order for montages to blow up
and<00:05:39.300> I<00:05:39.960> think<00:05:40.320> your<00:05:40.560> montage<00:05:41.100> got<00:05:41.520> about<00:05:41.790> or

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
and I think your montage got about or

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.450 
and I think your montage got about or
your<00:05:42.570> montage<00:05:43.080> trailer<00:05:43.530> got<00:05:43.890> thirteen

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
your montage trailer got thirteen

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.430 
your montage trailer got thirteen
thousand<00:05:44.970> views<00:05:45.150> or<00:05:45.270> something<00:05:45.660> and<00:05:46.080> I<00:05:46.170> think

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
thousand views or something and I think

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.530 
thousand views or something and I think
mine<00:05:46.650> got<00:05:46.920> about<00:05:47.130> 20<00:05:47.610> k<00:05:47.820> but<00:05:48.120> that's<00:05:48.360> only

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
mine got about 20 k but that's only

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.210 
mine got about 20 k but that's only
because<00:05:48.660> it<00:05:48.990> was<00:05:49.020> uploaded<00:05:49.410> the<00:05:49.740> agonies

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
because it was uploaded the agonies

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.350 
because it was uploaded the agonies
