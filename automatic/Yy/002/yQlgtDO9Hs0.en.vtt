this<00:00:09.600> is<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:10.020> test<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.470> cut<00:00:10.710> of<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.309> broadhead

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
this is to test the cut of the broadhead

a<00:02:20.940> little<00:02:21.180> bit<00:02:23.120> not<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.150> whole<00:02:24.390> lot<00:02:24.569> but<00:02:25.319> like<00:02:26.160> i

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
a little bit not a whole lot but like i

a little bit not a whole lot but like i
said<00:02:26.340> earlier<00:02:26.750> bottle<00:02:27.750> is<00:02:27.870> not<00:02:28.019> a<00:02:28.050> valid<00:02:28.290> test

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
said earlier bottle is not a valid test

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.470 
said earlier bottle is not a valid test
for<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:28.920> deer<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.730> way<00:02:29.850> these<00:02:29.970> things<00:02:30.030> are<00:02:30.330> made

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
for a deer the way these things are made

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.900 
for a deer the way these things are made
they<00:02:30.810> have<00:02:30.930> core<00:02:31.200> drilling<00:02:31.590> technology<00:02:32.220> it's

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
they have core drilling technology it's

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.940 
they have core drilling technology it's
a<00:02:33.180> something<00:02:33.780> that<00:02:33.930> I've<00:02:33.989> only<00:02:34.140> seen<00:02:34.380> in<00:02:34.530> n<00:02:34.650> AP

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
a something that I've only seen in n AP

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.949 
a something that I've only seen in n AP
and<00:02:35.819> what<00:02:35.940> it<00:02:36.030> does<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:36.360> they<00:02:36.450> put<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.750> blades

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
and what it does is they put the blades

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.440 
and what it does is they put the blades
off<00:02:37.140> set<00:02:37.380> so<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:37.830> spins<00:02:38.239> when<00:02:39.239> it<00:02:39.330> goes

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
off set so that it spins when it goes

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.420 
off set so that it spins when it goes
through<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.750> deer<00:02:40.140> creating<00:02:40.739> a<00:02:40.769> much<00:02:41.130> greater

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
through the deer creating a much greater

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.420 
through the deer creating a much greater
wound<00:02:41.760> channel<00:02:42.890> not<00:02:43.890> necessarily<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.340> barrier

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
wound channel not necessarily a barrier

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.039 
wound channel not necessarily a barrier
cutting<00:02:44.850> diameter<00:02:45.060> don't<00:02:45.390> confuse<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.900> two

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
cutting diameter don't confuse the two

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.650 
cutting diameter don't confuse the two
wound<00:02:46.350> channel<00:02:46.560> is<00:02:46.890> what<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:48.090> cut<00:02:48.390> through

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
wound channel is what the cut through

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.809 
wound channel is what the cut through
the<00:02:48.780> deer<00:02:48.959> is<00:02:48.989> a<00:02:49.410> cutting<00:02:49.799> diameter<00:02:50.160> is<00:02:50.519> how

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
the deer is a cutting diameter is how

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.370 
the deer is a cutting diameter is how
much<00:02:51.000> how<00:02:51.450> big<00:02:51.660> around<00:02:51.690> your<00:02:52.049> hole<00:02:52.170> is<00:02:52.260> going

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
much how big around your hole is going

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.220 
much how big around your hole is going
to<00:02:52.440> be<00:02:52.560> there's<00:02:53.190> there's<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.730> difference<00:02:54.230> the

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
to be there's there's a difference the

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.840 
to be there's there's a difference the
advantage<00:02:55.650> of<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.830> spiral<00:02:56.130> room<00:02:56.280> channel<00:02:56.549> and

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
advantage of the spiral room channel and

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.460 
advantage of the spiral room channel and
you<00:02:57.360> get<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.569> same<00:02:57.600> thing<00:02:57.900> with<00:02:58.019> single<00:02:58.350> bevel

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
you get the same thing with single bevel

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.780 
you get the same thing with single bevel
broadhead<00:02:59.239> the<00:03:00.239> advantage<00:03:00.600> of<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:00.930> is<00:03:01.790> since

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
broadhead the advantage of it is since

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.220 
broadhead the advantage of it is since
it's<00:03:02.940> rotating<00:03:03.480> it's<00:03:03.600> harder<00:03:03.840> for<00:03:03.870> that<00:03:04.049> wound

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
it's rotating it's harder for that wound

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.130 
it's rotating it's harder for that wound
channel<00:03:04.380> but<00:03:04.650> clothes<00:03:04.860> up<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.220> clogged<00:03:05.430> up<00:03:06.140> if

channel but clothes up and clogged up if

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.130 
channel but clothes up and clogged up if
it<00:03:07.350> clogs<00:03:07.530> up<00:03:07.769> less<00:03:08.100> blood<00:03:08.930> this<00:03:09.930> thing

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
it clogs up less blood this thing

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.660 
it clogs up less blood this thing
doesn't<00:03:10.320> cut<00:03:10.590> a<00:03:10.620> giant<00:03:10.980> cutting<00:03:11.220> diameter<00:03:11.400> to

doesn't cut a giant cutting diameter to

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.180 
doesn't cut a giant cutting diameter to
begin<00:03:11.880> with<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.299> think<00:03:13.019> it's<00:03:13.140> like<00:03:13.260> an<00:03:13.500> inch<00:03:13.829> and

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
begin with I think it's like an inch and

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.880 
begin with I think it's like an inch and
a<00:03:14.280> sixteenth<00:03:14.790> inch<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:15.269> 8<00:03:15.470> inch<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:16.739> three

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
a sixteenth inch and 8 inch and three

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.819 
a sixteenth inch and 8 inch and three
eighths<00:03:16.980> I<00:03:17.160> don't<00:03:17.370> really<00:03:17.820> know<00:03:18.120> for<00:03:18.150> sure<00:03:18.829> but

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
eighths I don't really know for sure but

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.460 
eighths I don't really know for sure but
the<00:03:20.280> advantage<00:03:20.459> does<00:03:20.880> have<00:03:21.150> is<00:03:21.450> that<00:03:22.320> it

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
the advantage does have is that it

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.620 
the advantage does have is that it
twists<00:03:23.010> makes<00:03:23.940> it<00:03:24.090> harder<00:03:24.299> for<00:03:24.329> that<00:03:24.480> wound

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
twists makes it harder for that wound

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.160 
twists makes it harder for that wound
channel<00:03:24.780> to<00:03:24.989> fog<00:03:25.200> up

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
channel to fog up

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.510 
channel to fog up
all<00:03:28.170> in<00:03:28.350> all<00:03:28.470> it's<00:03:28.680> a<00:03:28.710> pretty<00:03:28.890> solid<00:03:29.160> brought

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520
