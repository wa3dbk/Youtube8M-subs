00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:12.750
 the fantastic island of santa catarina and 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.340
 franklin barks that is basically is is 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.949
 against the 10 years of the meeting 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.060
 raised against and are different from 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.539
 different times 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.960
 they started the first point in 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:26.939
 1942 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.380
 only that it really solved is to make pride 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.430
 the book itself 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.940

 Catherine 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:49.070

00:00:46.410 --> 00:01:06.500
 correct 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:01:06.500

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.840
 witches themselves is not a thing of the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.259
 Azorean culture still says 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.110
 believe in one of the most 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.140
 interesting aspects of the team that also 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:30.479
 part of what we could believe 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:49.560
 It's the old lady 's boss who can be 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:53.960
