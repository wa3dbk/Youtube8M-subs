00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
while I'm showing off the pictures

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:33.880 
while I'm showing off the pictures
alright<00:01:25.380> see<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.830> later

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:02:26.110 

you

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120

so<00:02:26.570> my<00:02:26.720> final<00:02:26.930> thoughts<00:02:27.290> on<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.530> lens<00:02:27.830> it's

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
so my final thoughts on the lens it's

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.150 
so my final thoughts on the lens it's
not<00:02:28.340> a<00:02:28.370> bad<00:02:28.610> lens<00:02:28.940> it<00:02:29.500> for<00:02:30.500> what<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:30.620> need<00:02:30.830> a<00:02:30.860> for

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
not a bad lens it for what I need a for

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.280

it works it's replacing a DX lens that I
had<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:35.120> 55<00:02:35.890> 306<00:02:36.890> is<00:02:37.040> now<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.780> 70<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:38.930> 300

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
had the 55 306 is now the 70 to 300

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.050 
had the 55 306 is now the 70 to 300
this<00:02:40.910> one's<00:02:41.090> from<00:02:41.210> town<00:02:41.450> I'm<00:02:41.690> replacing<00:02:42.350> Nikon

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
this one's from town I'm replacing Nikon

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.370 
this one's from town I'm replacing Nikon
it's<00:02:44.060> a<00:02:44.350> decent<00:02:45.350> lens<00:02:45.500> on<00:02:46.120> cons<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.510> it<00:02:47.540> it<00:02:48.020> does

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
it's a decent lens on cons to it it does

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.949 
it's a decent lens on cons to it it does
have<00:02:48.590> chromatic<00:02:49.580> aberration<00:02:50.240> when<00:02:50.840> you're

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
have chromatic aberration when you're

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.240 
have chromatic aberration when you're
shooting<00:02:51.110> especially<00:02:51.650> against<00:02:51.830> a<00:02:51.920> go<00:02:52.100> a

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
shooting especially against a go a

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.520 
shooting especially against a go a
bright<00:02:53.060> sky<00:02:53.300> or<00:02:53.780> something<00:02:54.020> like<00:02:54.200> that<00:02:54.260> with

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
bright sky or something like that with

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.830 
bright sky or something like that with
some<00:02:54.770> trees<00:02:55.040> or<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.430> bird<00:02:55.730> or<00:02:55.940> something<00:02:55.970> it

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
some trees or a bird or something it

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.660 
some trees or a bird or something it
does<00:02:57.080> show<00:02:57.260> some<00:02:57.440> color<00:02:57.709> fringing<00:02:58.250> around<00:02:58.520> the

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
does show some color fringing around the

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.910 
does show some color fringing around the
edges<00:02:59.510> but<00:02:59.720> you<00:03:00.230> can<00:03:00.350> easily<00:03:00.470> take<00:03:00.709> that

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
edges but you can easily take that

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.290 
edges but you can easily take that
output<00:03:01.100> so<00:03:01.520> I<00:03:01.550> don't<00:03:01.760> really<00:03:01.820> have<00:03:02.000> too<00:03:02.180> much

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
output so I don't really have too much

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.250 
output so I don't really have too much
