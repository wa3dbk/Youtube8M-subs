sail<00:01:21.400> off<00:01:22.400> the<00:01:22.460> spark<00:01:23.000> so<00:01:23.740> I've<00:01:24.740> got<00:01:25.190> it<00:01:25.340> going

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
sail off the spark so I've got it going

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.690

them alright see how its talked enough
it's<00:01:58.580> actually<00:01:58.759> charging<00:01:59.360> that<00:01:59.540> and

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
it's actually charging that and

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.240 
it's actually charging that and
passenger<00:02:00.259> see<00:02:00.440> it<00:02:00.560> sparking<00:02:02.920> get<00:02:03.920> it<00:02:04.040> closed

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
passenger see it sparking get it closed

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.960 
passenger see it sparking get it closed
up<00:02:04.280> baby<00:02:04.729> and<00:02:06.280> show<00:02:07.280> it<00:02:07.429> towards<00:02:07.819> most<00:02:09.789> see<00:02:10.789> it

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
up baby and show it towards most see it

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.270 
up baby and show it towards most see it
sparking<00:02:11.209> in<00:02:11.540> there<00:02:11.720> and<00:02:12.380> it<00:02:12.530> will<00:02:12.650> charge<00:02:12.860> a

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
sparking in there and it will charge a

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:22.420 
sparking in there and it will charge a
little<00:02:13.490> bit<00:02:13.850> of<00:02:13.970> gas<00:02:14.150> per<00:02:14.390> horse<00:02:14.959> park<00:02:21.280> see<00:02:22.280> the

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
little bit of gas per horse park see the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.870 
little bit of gas per horse park see the
plane<00:02:23.230> see<00:02:24.230> that<00:02:24.410> gas<00:02:24.650> coming<00:02:24.980> off<00:02:25.510> now<00:02:26.510> I

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
plane see that gas coming off now I

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.030 
plane see that gas coming off now I
discovered<00:02:28.880> it<00:02:29.000> a<00:02:29.270> long<00:02:29.990> time<00:02:30.020> ago<00:02:30.380> whenever<00:02:30.830> I

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
discovered it a long time ago whenever I

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.559 
discovered it a long time ago whenever I
was<00:02:31.340> working<00:02:32.090> with<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.270> high-voltage

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
was working with the high-voltage

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.809 
was working with the high-voltage
transformer<00:02:33.020> that<00:02:33.590> if<00:02:33.800> you<00:02:34.040> slid<00:02:34.459> it<00:02:34.670> across

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
transformer that if you slid it across

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.270 
transformer that if you slid it across
the<00:02:35.420> table<00:02:35.630> and<00:02:35.959> it<00:02:36.080> was<00:02:36.230> barely<00:02:36.560> touching

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
the table and it was barely touching

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.620 
the table and it was barely touching
that<00:02:38.270> it<00:02:39.200> would<00:02:39.349> uh<00:02:39.610> you<00:02:40.610> know<00:02:40.760> sea<00:02:41.000> útil<00:02:41.390> on

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
that it would uh you know sea útil on

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.449 
that it would uh you know sea útil on
spark<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.260> that's<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.500> same<00:02:42.740> orange<00:02:43.130> port

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
spark and that's the same orange port

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.070 
spark and that's the same orange port
and<00:02:43.640> I'm<00:02:43.700> seeing<00:02:43.970> right<00:02:44.209> here<00:02:44.270> right<00:02:44.599> word

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
and I'm seeing right here right word

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.460

that that on spark right there that's

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:58.309 
that that on spark right there that's
the<00:02:48.590> same<00:02:48.830> thing<00:02:50.260> night

I must be about out of water because

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:15.860 
I must be about out of water because
