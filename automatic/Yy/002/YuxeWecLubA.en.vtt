00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.330 

I<00:00:00.060> feel<00:00:00.570> like<00:00:00.690> the<00:00:00.810> Gateway<00:00:01.140> and<00:00:01.319> ours<00:00:01.530> as<00:00:01.979> well

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
I feel like the Gateway and ours as well

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.090 
I feel like the Gateway and ours as well
the<00:00:02.700> help<00:00:03.120> with<00:00:03.270> stasis<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.990> lotta<00:00:04.650> units<00:00:04.920> being

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
the help with stasis a lotta units being

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.860 
the help with stasis a lotta units being
produced<00:00:05.759> up<00:00:05.970> but<00:00:06.120> I<00:00:06.180> really<00:00:06.420> feel<00:00:06.569> like<00:00:06.600> yeah

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
produced up but I really feel like yeah

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.020 
produced up but I really feel like yeah
the<00:00:06.930> macro<00:00:07.410> of<00:00:07.620> racquetball<00:00:08.610> I<00:00:08.700> think<00:00:08.940> he's

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
the macro of racquetball I think he's

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.610 
the macro of racquetball I think he's
just<00:00:09.179> got<00:00:09.389> more<00:00:09.599> gateways<00:00:09.870> down<00:00:10.260> right<00:00:10.469> now

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
just got more gateways down right now

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.830 
just got more gateways down right now
and<00:00:10.769> he's<00:00:10.889> just<00:00:11.070> maybe<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:12.059> little<00:00:12.509> bit<00:00:12.690> higher

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
and he's just maybe a little bit higher

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.900 
and he's just maybe a little bit higher
a<00:00:12.929> p.m.<00:00:13.290> but<00:00:13.469> no<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.099> take<00:00:14.370> it<00:00:14.490> back<00:00:14.610> Joe

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
a p.m. but no I take it back Joe

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.519 
a p.m. but no I take it back Joe
actually<00:00:15.240> has<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.389> higher<00:00:15.570> unit<00:00:15.900> count<00:00:16.049> so

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
actually has the higher unit count so

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.080 
actually has the higher unit count so
really<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.980> difference<00:00:17.070> in<00:00:17.400> here<00:00:17.640> has<00:00:17.850> been

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
really the difference in here has been

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.519 
really the difference in here has been
the<00:00:18.210> level<00:00:18.449> three<00:00:18.660> weapons<00:00:18.779> level<00:00:19.230> one<00:00:19.320> armor

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
the level three weapons level one armor

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.769 
the level three weapons level one armor
it's<00:00:19.619> been<00:00:19.770> all<00:00:20.039> upgrades<00:00:20.520> at<00:00:20.670> this<00:00:20.789> stage<00:00:21.029> and

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
it's been all upgrades at this stage and

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.320 
it's been all upgrades at this stage and
I<00:00:21.869> just<00:00:22.080> I'm<00:00:22.289> not<00:00:22.350> sure<00:00:22.740> where<00:00:22.980> jaws<00:00:23.820> forces

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
I just I'm not sure where jaws forces

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.089 
I just I'm not sure where jaws forces
are<00:00:24.480> really<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.230> tag<00:00:25.439> forces<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:25.949> just

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
are really is the tag forces it just

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.439 
are really is the tag forces it just
seems<00:00:26.250> like<00:00:26.460> he's<00:00:26.519> going<00:00:26.820> up<00:00:27.000> against<00:00:27.240> much

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
seems like he's going up against much

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.419 
seems like he's going up against much
larger<00:00:27.720> units<00:00:27.990> even<00:00:28.199> though<00:00:28.260> supply<00:00:28.590> count<00:00:28.830> is

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
larger units even though supply count is

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.339 
larger units even though supply count is
really<00:00:30.000> saying<00:00:30.269> differently<00:00:30.750> it's<00:00:30.929> right<00:00:31.230> now

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
really saying differently it's right now

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.410 
really saying differently it's right now
it's<00:00:31.500> at<00:00:31.619> 185<00:00:32.160> versus<00:00:32.520> 178<00:00:33.059> but<00:00:33.210> it's<00:00:33.300> just

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
it's at 185 versus 178 but it's just

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.299 
it's at 185 versus 178 but it's just
been<00:00:33.480> skeleton<00:00:33.899> crew<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.649> zealots<00:00:35.010> looks<00:00:35.190> like

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
been skeleton crew of zealots looks like

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.350 
been skeleton crew of zealots looks like
they've<00:00:35.430> mostly<00:00:35.550> been<00:00:35.730> sitting<00:00:36.059> in<00:00:36.120> front<00:00:36.239> of

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
they've mostly been sitting in front of

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.450 
they've mostly been sitting in front of
the<00:00:36.420> base<00:00:36.540> but<00:00:36.719> now<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:37.020> arbiter<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.500> out<00:00:37.680> to

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
the base but now that arbiter is out to

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.799 
the base but now that arbiter is out to
assist<00:00:38.700> alongside<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.270> arbiter<00:00:39.660> could

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
assist alongside this arbiter could

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.959 
assist alongside this arbiter could
really<00:00:40.020> be<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> game<00:00:40.590> shifter<00:00:40.950> looks<00:00:41.129> like<00:00:41.280> too

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
really be a game shifter looks like too

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.580 
really be a game shifter looks like too
many<00:00:42.059> units<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.570> really<00:00:42.809> salvage<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.350> twelve

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
many units to really salvage the twelve

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.959 
many units to really salvage the twelve
o'clock<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.010> can<00:00:44.250> go<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.610> squash<00:00:44.820> that

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
o'clock you can go and squash that

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.670 
o'clock you can go and squash that
attack<00:00:45.239> force<00:00:45.480> we'll<00:00:45.870> see<00:00:46.020> if<00:00:46.050> he<00:00:46.200> goes<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.559> for

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
attack force we'll see if he goes in for

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.220 
attack force we'll see if he goes in for
a<00:00:46.739> counter-attack<00:00:47.480> or<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.570> actually<00:00:48.690> goes<00:00:48.989> for

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
a counter-attack or it actually goes for

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.010 
a counter-attack or it actually goes for
this<00:00:49.320> reverse<00:00:49.680> heck<00:00:49.980> at<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.149> along<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.840> side

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
this reverse heck at the along the side

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.450 
this reverse heck at the along the side
of<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.170> basement<00:00:52.320> while<00:00:52.770> he's<00:00:52.980> cleaning<00:00:53.309> up

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
of the basement while he's cleaning up

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.220 
of the basement while he's cleaning up
the<00:00:53.550> twelve<00:00:53.730> o'clock<00:00:53.969> simultaneously<00:00:54.539> but

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
the twelve o'clock simultaneously but

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.600 
the twelve o'clock simultaneously but
yeah<00:00:55.379> this<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:55.770> twelve<00:00:56.010> o'clock<00:00:56.250> looks<00:00:56.460> like

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
yeah this this twelve o'clock looks like

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.029 
yeah this this twelve o'clock looks like
it's<00:00:56.760> absolutely<00:00:57.090> getting<00:00:57.270> ravaged<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:58.039> at

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
it's absolutely getting ravaged so at

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.860 
it's absolutely getting ravaged so at
least<00:00:59.190> in<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.460> short<00:00:59.730> term<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.149> looks<00:01:00.660> like

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
least in the short term it looks like

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.569 
least in the short term it looks like
that<00:01:01.620> racket<00:01:01.920> ball<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.160> going<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.340> take<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
that racket ball is going to take the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.860 
that racket ball is going to take the
lead<00:01:02.609> size<00:01:02.969> storm<00:01:03.210> going<00:01:03.359> off<00:01:03.510> those<00:01:03.719> your

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
lead size storm going off those your

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.850 
lead size storm going off those your

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.260 
zealots pressing up in proximity and I
don't<00:01:08.369> think<00:01:08.580> they<00:01:08.670> have<00:01:08.790> any<00:01:08.970> detection

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
don't think they have any detection

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.510 
don't think they have any detection

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
it looks like Reavers now being dropped

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.640 
it looks like Reavers now being dropped
to<00:03:05.330> that<00:03:05.450> bottom<00:03:05.600> right<00:03:05.810> corner<00:03:05.840> able<00:03:06.350> to<00:03:06.470> take

to that bottom right corner able to take
out<00:03:06.830> some<00:03:07.760> of<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:08.000> units<00:03:08.300> right<00:03:08.450> here<00:03:08.630> and<00:03:08.750> I'm

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810

up<00:03:10.670> in<00:03:10.790> here<00:03:10.970> so<00:03:11.390> it<00:03:11.540> looks<00:03:11.600> like<00:03:11.780> the<00:03:12.020> economic

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
up in here so it looks like the economic

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.810 
up in here so it looks like the economic
damage<00:03:12.920> has<00:03:13.040> been<00:03:13.070> at<00:03:13.310> least<00:03:13.430> someone

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
damage has been at least someone

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:14.979 
damage has been at least someone
equalized<00:03:14.300> because<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.600> six<00:03:14.810> o'clock

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
equalized because the six o'clock

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.010 
equalized because the six o'clock
location<00:03:15.920> no<00:03:16.430> longer<00:03:16.760> producing<00:03:17.239> and<00:03:17.870> we'll

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.210 
location no longer producing and we'll
see<00:03:18.170> what's<00:03:18.350> going<00:03:18.500> to<00:03:18.530> happen<00:03:18.770> in<00:03:18.860> still

Wow<00:03:20.780> excellent<00:03:21.080> fight<00:03:21.590> really<00:03:22.459> back<00:03:22.760> and

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
Wow excellent fight really back and

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.210 
Wow excellent fight really back and
forth<00:03:23.180> but<00:03:23.989> I<00:03:24.050> still<00:03:24.410> got<00:03:24.620> this<00:03:24.770> is<00:03:24.920> a<00:03:24.950> huge

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
forth but I still got this is a huge

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.510 
forth but I still got this is a huge
attack<00:03:25.459> force<00:03:25.700> almost<00:03:25.880> maxed<00:03:26.239> out<00:03:26.860> versus<00:03:27.860> 156

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
attack force almost maxed out versus 156

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.920 
attack force almost maxed out versus 156
and<00:03:28.640> again<00:03:28.970> I<00:03:29.000> feel<00:03:29.360> like<00:03:29.420> that<00:03:29.600> upgrades

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
and again I feel like that upgrades

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.810 
and again I feel like that upgrades
level<00:03:30.470> one<00:03:30.560> shield<00:03:30.860> kind<00:03:31.430> of<00:03:31.489> in<00:03:31.580> the<00:03:31.610> mix

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
level one shield kind of in the mix

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.820 
level one shield kind of in the mix
right<00:03:31.880> now<00:03:32.150> versus<00:03:32.900> level<00:03:33.170> three<00:03:33.380> weapons<00:03:33.530> and

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
right now versus level three weapons and

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.110 
right now versus level three weapons and
I<00:03:33.890> don't<00:03:34.070> see<00:03:34.220> any<00:03:34.430> additional<00:03:34.820> upgrades

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
I don't see any additional upgrades

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.180 
I don't see any additional upgrades
happening<00:03:35.510> across<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.470> board<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:36.739> I<00:03:36.800> think

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
happening across the board and I think

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.470 
happening across the board and I think
that<00:03:37.340> could<00:03:37.430> be<00:03:37.580> the<00:03:37.730> huge<00:03:38.000> difference<00:03:38.330> in

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
that could be the huge difference in

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.420 
that could be the huge difference in
this<00:03:38.630> match<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:39.440> Reavers<00:03:39.739> now<00:03:39.920> lifting<00:03:40.310> off

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
this match the Reavers now lifting off

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.160 
this match the Reavers now lifting off
they<00:03:40.610> weren't<00:03:40.790> able<00:03:40.880> to<00:03:41.030> take<00:03:41.750> everything<00:03:42.080> out

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
they weren't able to take everything out

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.660 
they weren't able to take everything out
but<00:03:42.290> keep<00:03:42.440> in<00:03:42.560> mind<00:03:42.590> this<00:03:43.070> is<00:03:43.130> still<00:03:43.459> higher

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
but keep in mind this is still higher

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.040 
but keep in mind this is still higher
production<00:03:44.030> that's<00:03:44.239> happening<00:03:44.600> at<00:03:44.690> that<00:03:44.720> six

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
production that's happening at that six

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.840 
production that's happening at that six
o'clock<00:03:45.350> but<00:03:46.130> it<00:03:46.280> looks<00:03:46.459> like<00:03:46.520> he's<00:03:46.700> going<00:03:46.790> to

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
o'clock but it looks like he's going to

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.280 
o'clock but it looks like he's going to
riga<00:03:47.150> it<00:03:47.270> looks<00:03:47.420> like<00:03:47.570> racquetball<00:03:48.020> is<00:03:48.170> going

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
riga it looks like racquetball is going

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.680 
riga it looks like racquetball is going
to<00:03:48.350> regather<00:03:48.650> re<00:03:49.550> hotkey<00:03:50.000> up<00:03:50.180> and<00:03:50.450> this<00:03:50.570> is

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
to regather re hotkey up and this is

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.540 
to regather re hotkey up and this is
going<00:03:50.810> to<00:03:50.870> be<00:03:50.959> the<00:03:51.200> full<00:03:51.440> eight<00:03:52.070> control

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
going to be the full eight control

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.130 
going to be the full eight control
grouping<00:03:52.880> observer<00:03:53.450> once<00:03:53.690> again<00:03:53.900> checking

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
grouping observer once again checking

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.810 
grouping observer once again checking
out<00:03:54.350> that<00:03:54.560> two<00:03:55.010> of<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:55.100> clock<00:03:55.280> location<00:03:55.730> to

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
out that two of the clock location to

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.490 
out that two of the clock location to
see<00:03:55.970> what's<00:03:56.150> there<00:03:56.300> and<00:03:56.540> once<00:03:57.080> again<00:03:57.170> i<00:03:57.290> feel

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
see what's there and once again i feel

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.540 
see what's there and once again i feel
like<00:03:57.620> the<00:03:57.739> unit's<00:03:58.010> completely<00:03:58.400> out<00:03:58.489> of

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
like the unit's completely out of

like the unit's completely out of
position<00:03:58.730> i<00:03:59.030> know<00:03:59.090> the<00:03:59.959> units<00:04:00.200> are<00:04:00.320> there<00:04:00.500> but

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
position i know the units are there but

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.740 
position i know the units are there but
they<00:04:00.920> just<00:04:01.459> kind<00:04:01.610> of<00:04:01.640> scattered<00:04:02.030> about<00:04:02.209> not

really in a defensible spot where you've

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.790 
really in a defensible spot where you've

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
damage so it looks like this twelve

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.360

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
additional forges getting a little bit

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:49.770 
additional forges getting a little bit
of<00:05:48.520> size<00:05:48.670> storm<00:05:48.940> across<00:05:49.090> there<00:05:49.420> though<00:05:49.600> and

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
of size storm across there though and

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.330 
of size storm across there though and
maybe<00:05:49.990> he<00:05:50.290> can<00:05:50.320> if<00:05:50.680> he<00:05:50.770> can<00:05:50.890> take<00:05:51.040> out<00:05:51.130> enough

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
maybe he can if he can take out enough

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.250 
maybe he can if he can take out enough
pylons<00:05:51.790> and<00:05:52.030> then<00:05:52.420> figure<00:05:52.660> out<00:05:52.750> a<00:05:52.870> way<00:05:53.050> to<00:05:53.110> stop

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 
pylons and then figure out a way to stop

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.430 
pylons and then figure out a way to stop
this<00:05:53.650> this<00:05:54.340> brunt<00:05:54.820> force<00:05:55.150> of<00:05:55.870> racket<00:05:56.230> balls

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
this this brunt force of racket balls

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.230 
this this brunt force of racket balls
that's<00:05:56.770> just<00:05:57.010> very<00:05:57.100> highly<00:05:57.610> upgraded<00:05:57.760> at<00:05:58.120> this

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
that's just very highly upgraded at this

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.670 
that's just very highly upgraded at this
stage<00:05:58.420> maybe<00:05:58.660> he<00:05:58.870> can<00:05:58.990> hold<00:05:59.110> on<00:05:59.260> to<00:05:59.380> this<00:05:59.470> match

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
stage maybe he can hold on to this match

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.940 
stage maybe he can hold on to this match
but<00:06:00.900> looks<00:06:01.900> like<00:06:01.990> actually<00:06:02.470> they're<00:06:02.590> starting

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:02.950 
but looks like actually they're starting

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.130 
but looks like actually they're starting
to<00:06:02.980> head<00:06:03.130> towards<00:06:03.460> that<00:06:03.580> bottom<00:06:03.790> right<00:06:03.910> corner

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.140 
to head towards that bottom right corner

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.450 
to head towards that bottom right corner
keep<00:06:05.140> in<00:06:05.260> mind<00:06:05.290> you<00:06:05.650> can<00:06:05.800> still<00:06:06.010> pull<00:06:06.220> off<00:06:06.280> on

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
keep in mind you can still pull off on

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.010 
keep in mind you can still pull off on
base<00:06:06.610> now<00:06:06.850> he's<00:06:06.910> yeah<00:06:07.540> he's<00:06:07.570> going<00:06:07.840> to<00:06:07.900> go<00:06:07.960> to

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
base now he's yeah he's going to go to

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.660 
base now he's yeah he's going to go to
that<00:06:08.140> upper<00:06:08.410> right<00:06:08.560> hand<00:06:08.770> looks<00:06:09.460> like<00:06:09.580> he's

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:09.670 
that upper right hand looks like he's

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.550 
that upper right hand looks like he's
kind<00:06:09.850> of<00:06:09.880> exploring<00:06:10.390> out<00:06:10.510> just<00:06:11.260> to<00:06:11.320> kind<00:06:11.500> of

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
kind of exploring out just to kind of

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.810 
kind of exploring out just to kind of
see<00:06:11.710> what's<00:06:11.890> going<00:06:12.130> on<00:06:12.250> making<00:06:12.550> sure<00:06:12.670> that

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:12.820 
see what's going on making sure that

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.160 
see what's going on making sure that
they're<00:06:12.970> on<00:06:13.090> any<00:06:13.300> additional<00:06:13.630> expansions<00:06:14.050> but

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:14.170 
they're on any additional expansions but

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:15.240 
they're on any additional expansions but
I<00:06:14.200> think<00:06:14.380> he's<00:06:14.470> going<00:06:14.590> to<00:06:14.650> regather<00:06:14.980> at<00:06:15.130> that

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
I think he's going to regather at that

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.160 
I think he's going to regather at that
stage<00:06:15.490> and<00:06:15.730> just<00:06:16.180> kind<00:06:16.330> of<00:06:16.360> finish<00:06:16.720> things<00:06:16.930> off

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:17.170 
stage and just kind of finish things off

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.080 
stage and just kind of finish things off
I<00:06:17.500> just<00:06:17.740> kind<00:06:17.830> of<00:06:17.950> brutalize<00:06:18.340> at<00:06:18.520> that<00:06:18.640> stage<00:06:18.880> I

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
I just kind of brutalize at that stage I

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.610 
I just kind of brutalize at that stage I
think<00:06:19.690> that<00:06:19.840> it<00:06:19.930> looks<00:06:20.080> like<00:06:20.140> there's<00:06:20.410> one

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
think that it looks like there's one

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.130 
think that it looks like there's one
Weaver<00:06:20.950> one<00:06:21.820> Weaver<00:06:22.120> left<00:06:22.360> alive<00:06:22.660> looks<00:06:22.990> like

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:23.140 
Weaver one Weaver left alive looks like

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.040 
Weaver one Weaver left alive looks like
an<00:06:23.260> observer<00:06:23.560> kind<00:06:23.830> of<00:06:23.920> up<00:06:24.340> along<00:06:24.610> this<00:06:24.790> side

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
an observer kind of up along this side

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.690 
an observer kind of up along this side
but<00:06:26.050> and<00:06:26.260> starting<00:06:26.860> to<00:06:26.950> push<00:06:27.130> in<00:06:27.310> actually<00:06:27.670> a

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:27.700 
but and starting to push in actually a

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.100 
but and starting to push in actually a
nice<00:06:28.090> little<00:06:28.240> sigh<00:06:28.450> storm<00:06:28.720> with<00:06:28.810> a<00:06:28.870> little<00:06:28.990> bit

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
nice little sigh storm with a little bit

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.870 
nice little sigh storm with a little bit
of<00:06:29.200> a<00:06:29.260> skeleton<00:06:29.710> crew<00:06:29.740> didn't<00:06:30.520> brunt<00:06:30.700> down

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 
of a skeleton crew didn't brunt down

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.220 
of a skeleton crew didn't brunt down
with<00:06:31.030> his<00:06:31.150> entire<00:06:31.300> attack<00:06:31.660> force<00:06:31.900> that<00:06:32.020> might

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:32.230 
with his entire attack force that might

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:33.780 
with his entire attack force that might
be<00:06:32.380> a<00:06:32.410> mistake<00:06:32.980> there's<00:06:33.370> no<00:06:33.490> observer

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:33.790 
be a mistake there's no observer

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.300 
be a mistake there's no observer
alongside<00:06:34.060> to<00:06:35.020> detect<00:06:35.380> these<00:06:35.500> club<00:06:35.800> units<00:06:36.130> now

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
alongside to detect these club units now

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.920 
alongside to detect these club units now
as<00:06:36.460> well

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930 
as well

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.440 
as well
and<00:06:37.930> I'm<00:06:38.230> not<00:06:38.380> seeing<00:06:38.830> the<00:06:38.980> observer<00:06:39.250> long<00:06:40.240> in

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:40.450 
and I'm not seeing the observer long in

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:41.850 
and I'm not seeing the observer long in
general<00:06:40.810> but<00:06:40.930> this<00:06:41.050> is<00:06:41.170> still<00:06:41.350> absolutely

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:41.860 
general but this is still absolutely

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.950 
general but this is still absolutely
epic<00:06:42.180> bottom<00:06:43.180> right-hand<00:06:43.360> base<00:06:43.690> getting

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 
epic bottom right-hand base getting

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.520 
epic bottom right-hand base getting
assailed<00:06:44.320> a<00:06:44.470> little<00:06:44.650> bit<00:06:44.800> but<00:06:44.950> racquetball

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:46.530 
assailed a little bit but racquetball

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.230 
assailed a little bit but racquetball
looks<00:06:47.530> like<00:06:47.650> another<00:06:47.860> attack<00:06:48.160> going<00:06:48.460> down

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 
looks like another attack going down

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.250 
looks like another attack going down
right<00:06:49.390> there<00:06:49.540> but<00:06:49.630> i<00:06:49.690> think<00:06:49.930> that<00:06:49.960> rever

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:50.260 
right there but i think that rever

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.870 
right there but i think that rever
wasn't<00:06:50.710> fat<00:06:50.860> killed<00:06:51.130> so<00:06:51.400> missed<00:06:51.730> that<00:06:51.850> a

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 
wasn't fat killed so missed that a

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.850 
wasn't fat killed so missed that a
little<00:06:52.180> bit<00:06:52.240> but<00:06:52.690> a<00:06:52.750> racquetball<00:06:53.170> continuing

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:53.860 
little bit but a racquetball continuing

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.680 
little bit but a racquetball continuing
to<00:06:53.950> a<00:06:53.980> push<00:06:54.250> forward<00:06:54.610> somehow<00:06:55.240> managed<00:06:55.630> to

to a push forward somehow managed to

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:56.970 
to a push forward somehow managed to
sneak<00:06:55.900> units<00:06:56.260> under<00:06:56.380> it<00:06:56.620> looks<00:06:56.770> like<00:06:56.890> he

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:56.980 
sneak units under it looks like he

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.130 
sneak units under it looks like he
sneaked<00:06:57.280> units<00:06:57.850> underneath<00:06:58.180> the<00:06:58.720> short<00:06:58.990> leg
