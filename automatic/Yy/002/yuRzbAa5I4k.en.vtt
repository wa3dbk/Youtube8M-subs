00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
come so now taking a look at this image

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.860 
come so now taking a look at this image
we<00:02:46.920> can<00:02:47.040> see<00:02:47.100> a<00:02:47.250> letter<00:02:47.640> on<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.390> bottom<00:02:48.750> of

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
we can see a letter on the bottom of

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.780 
we can see a letter on the bottom of
this<00:02:49.110> image<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.710> this<00:02:50.130> looks<00:02:50.370> like<00:02:50.550> it's

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
this image and this looks like it's

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.850 
this image and this looks like it's
going<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:51.060> be<00:02:51.150> an<00:02:51.240> e<00:02:51.480> or<00:02:51.690> an<00:02:52.020> F<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.470> me<00:02:52.620> it

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
going to be an e or an F to me it

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.680 
going to be an e or an F to me it
definitely<00:02:53.550> looks<00:02:53.760> like<00:02:53.820> something<00:02:53.970> along

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
definitely looks like something along

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.360 
definitely looks like something along
those<00:02:54.870> lines<00:02:55.230> because<00:02:55.440> you<00:02:55.710> have<00:02:55.920> a<00:02:56.100> line

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
those lines because you have a line

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.490 
those lines because you have a line
going<00:02:56.670> across<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:57.090> top<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.540> also<00:02:57.990> down<00:02:58.260> on

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
going across the top and also down on

that this is citron this looks like
citron<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.370> at<00:03:17.460> first<00:03:17.700> I<00:03:18.030> was<00:03:18.330> the<00:03:18.360> same<00:03:18.720> but

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
citron and at first I was the same but

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.750 
citron and at first I was the same but
then<00:03:19.320> I<00:03:19.410> thought<00:03:19.680> we've<00:03:20.340> already<00:03:20.520> seen

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
looks like yes we don't know his

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.330 
looks like yes we don't know his
abilities<00:03:25.230> but<00:03:25.680> we're<00:03:25.830> not<00:03:25.950> going<00:03:26.100> to<00:03:26.190> be<00:03:26.280> able

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
abilities but we're not going to be able

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.130

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
from an image we will need some gameplay

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.970

image now I'm thinking if this is citron
this<00:03:38.310> is<00:03:38.400> going<00:03:38.580> to<00:03:38.670> be<00:03:38.790> one<00:03:38.970> of<00:03:39.150> these

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
this is going to be one of these

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.690 
this is going to be one of these
variants<00:03:39.750> as<00:03:39.930> we<00:03:40.320> know<00:03:40.530> you<00:03:40.590> get<00:03:41.010> variants<00:03:41.490> in

getting variants of citron as well now

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.500 
getting variants of citron as well now
this<00:03:46.890> could<00:03:47.040> be<00:03:47.100> citron<00:03:47.610> could<00:03:47.940> be<00:03:48.030> a<00:03:48.060> variant

this could be citron could be a variant
of<00:03:48.630> citron<00:03:48.990> or<00:03:49.170> it<00:03:49.260> could<00:03:49.380> be<00:03:49.440> something

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
of citron or it could be something

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
completely different this could be

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.510 
completely different this could be
something<00:03:51.810> like<00:03:51.930> a<00:03:52.050> boss<00:03:52.380> in<00:03:52.710> graveyard<00:03:53.370> ops

game<00:04:34.800> and<00:04:35.070> I'm<00:04:35.280> super<00:04:35.610> excited<00:04:35.700> to<00:04:36.060> find<00:04:36.360> more

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
game and I'm super excited to find more

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.810 
game and I'm super excited to find more
information<00:04:37.110> out<00:04:37.230> about<00:04:37.440> it<00:04:37.830> now<00:04:38.460> with<00:04:38.670> this

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
information out about it now with this

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.210 
information out about it now with this
image<00:04:39.030> it<00:04:39.450> looks<00:04:39.510> like<00:04:39.900> bananas<00:04:40.590> for<00:04:41.040> some

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
image it looks like bananas for some

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.440 
image it looks like bananas for some
reason<00:04:41.580> but<00:04:41.670> I'm<00:04:41.760> thinking<00:04:42.090> this<00:04:42.210> may<00:04:42.390> be

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
reason but I'm thinking this may be

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.290 
reason but I'm thinking this may be
something<00:04:42.900> related<00:04:42.990> to<00:04:43.440> kernel<00:04:44.100> corn<00:04:44.400> and<00:04:44.730> I'm

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
something related to kernel corn and I'm

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.360 
something related to kernel corn and I'm
thinking<00:04:45.810> maybe<00:04:46.440> this<00:04:46.680> could<00:04:46.830> be<00:04:46.950> some<00:04:47.160> sort

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
thinking maybe this could be some sort

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.670 
thinking maybe this could be some sort
of<00:04:47.490> a<00:04:47.580> Gatling<00:04:48.000> or<00:04:48.150> turret<00:04:48.780> defense<00:04:49.200> mode<00:04:49.500> and

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
of a Gatling or turret defense mode and

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.580 
of a Gatling or turret defense mode and
as<00:04:50.400> you<00:04:50.700> know<00:04:50.820> the<00:04:51.000> pea<00:04:51.150> shooter<00:04:51.180> berries<00:04:52.170> he's

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
as you know the pea shooter berries he's

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.860 
as you know the pea shooter berries he's
he's<00:04:53.100> roots<00:04:53.580> into<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:54.180> ground<00:04:54.420> and<00:04:54.570> the<00:04:54.690> Sun

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
he's roots into the ground and the Sun

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.900 
he's roots into the ground and the Sun
flow<00:04:55.050> does<00:04:55.290> as<00:04:55.500> well<00:04:55.770> maybe<00:04:56.400> this<00:04:56.670> could<00:04:56.850> be

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
flow does as well maybe this could be

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.660 
flow does as well maybe this could be
the<00:04:57.120> kernel<00:04:57.510> corn<00:04:57.780> like<00:04:58.410> smashing<00:04:59.220> his<00:04:59.400> feet

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
the kernel corn like smashing his feet

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.700 
the kernel corn like smashing his feet
onto<00:04:59.970> the<00:05:00.270> ground<00:05:00.630> to<00:05:00.960> go<00:05:01.110> into<00:05:01.350> this<00:05:01.410> kind<00:05:01.650> of

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
onto the ground to go into this kind of

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.650 
onto the ground to go into this kind of
defense<00:05:02.100> mode<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:02.550> that<00:05:02.910> is<00:05:02.970> the<00:05:03.180> reason<00:05:03.480> why

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
defense mode and that is the reason why

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.450 
defense mode and that is the reason why
the<00:05:03.720> earlier<00:05:04.260> of<00:05:04.350> the<00:05:04.500> glass<00:05:04.860> on<00:05:05.130> mirror

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
the earlier of the glass on mirror

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.120 
the earlier of the glass on mirror
around<00:05:05.760> him<00:05:06.030> has<00:05:06.450> shattered<00:05:06.990> now<00:05:07.560> also<00:05:07.770> this

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
around him has shattered now also this

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.920 
around him has shattered now also this
could<00:05:08.280> be<00:05:08.400> something<00:05:08.730> like<00:05:08.760> a<00:05:09.030> grown<00:05:09.360> smash<00:05:09.720> or

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
could be something like a grown smash or

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.200 
could be something like a grown smash or
something<00:05:10.590> related<00:05:11.010> to<00:05:11.040> that<00:05:11.160> and<00:05:11.760> that<00:05:11.790> is

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
something related to that and that is

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.970 
something related to that and that is
why<00:05:12.480> the<00:05:12.540> earlier<00:05:12.990> around<00:05:13.260> him<00:05:13.440> has<00:05:13.650> cracked

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:13.980 
why the earlier around him has cracked

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.070 
why the earlier around him has cracked
as<00:05:14.160> well<00:05:14.430> I<00:05:14.640> have<00:05:14.970> no<00:05:15.150> idea<00:05:15.180> but<00:05:15.600> I'm<00:05:15.720> thinking

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
as well I have no idea but I'm thinking

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.380 
as well I have no idea but I'm thinking
this<00:05:16.170> may<00:05:16.410> be<00:05:16.470> related<00:05:16.770> to<00:05:17.640> some<00:05:17.880> sort<00:05:18.150> of

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
this may be related to some sort of

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.720 
this may be related to some sort of
ability<00:05:19.230> that<00:05:19.710> has<00:05:19.800> been<00:05:19.980> used<00:05:20.220> and<00:05:20.430> it<00:05:20.550> makes

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:20.730 
ability that has been used and it makes

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.490 
ability that has been used and it makes
the<00:05:20.850> ground<00:05:21.090> early<00:05:21.270> around<00:05:21.720> it<00:05:21.900> smash<00:05:22.230> or

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
the ground early around it smash or

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.440 
the ground early around it smash or
break<00:05:22.860> or<00:05:23.130> maybe<00:05:23.790> this<00:05:24.000> could<00:05:24.150> be<00:05:24.240> some<00:05:24.420> sort

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
break or maybe this could be some sort

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.020 
break or maybe this could be some sort
of<00:05:24.780> like<00:05:24.960> I<00:05:25.110> said<00:05:25.290> graveyard<00:05:25.770> boss<00:05:25.980> again<00:05:26.430> who

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
of like I said graveyard boss again who
