00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
them in the regular way so you can see

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.590 
them in the regular way so you can see
like<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:37.130> loops<00:03:37.310> turn<00:03:37.520> and<00:03:37.670> ice<00:03:37.790> and<00:03:38.120> stuff<00:03:38.270> so

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
like the loops turn and ice and stuff so

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
mean I live in Chicago so the hair store

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.550 
mean I live in Chicago so the hair store
had<00:05:49.940> it<00:05:50.120> here<00:05:50.420> so<00:05:50.600> I<00:05:50.630> didn't<00:05:50.840> have<00:05:50.930> a<00:05:50.990> issue<00:05:51.230> at

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
had it here so I didn't have a issue at

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.910 
had it here so I didn't have a issue at
all<00:05:52.480> but<00:05:53.480> I<00:05:53.660> would<00:05:53.930> suggest<00:05:54.110> going<00:05:54.470> to<00:05:54.620> like<00:05:54.890> a

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:54.920 
all but I would suggest going to like a

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.590 
all but I would suggest going to like a
larger<00:05:55.340> hair<00:05:55.520> store<00:05:55.760> that<00:05:55.910> has<00:05:56.030> like<00:05:56.300> a<00:05:56.330> lot<00:05:56.570> of

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 
larger hair store that has like a lot of

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.510 
larger hair store that has like a lot of
different<00:05:56.720> hair<00:05:58.870> products<00:05:59.870> and<00:06:00.020> stuff<00:06:00.290> so<00:06:00.560> you

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
different hair products and stuff so you

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.920 
different hair products and stuff so you
go<00:06:01.670> to<00:06:01.730> a<00:06:01.910> larger<00:06:02.180> hair<00:06:02.300> store<00:06:02.570> they're<00:06:02.720> more

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
go to a larger hair store they're more

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.980 
go to a larger hair store they're more
likely<00:06:03.110> to<00:06:03.230> have<00:06:03.530> it<00:06:03.770> it's<00:06:04.550> not<00:06:04.760> Amazon<00:06:05.630> has<00:06:05.810> it

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
likely to have it it's not Amazon has it

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.210 
likely to have it it's not Amazon has it
so<00:06:06.140> you<00:06:06.200> can<00:06:06.350> do<00:06:06.440> that<00:06:06.650> I<00:06:06.770> used<00:06:08.290> three<00:06:09.290> and<00:06:09.920> a

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
so you can do that I used three and a

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.270 
so you can do that I used three and a
half<00:06:10.430> packs<00:06:10.730> I<00:06:11.000> bought<00:06:11.180> 5<00:06:11.420> packs<00:06:11.920> but<00:06:12.920> that<00:06:13.100> was

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
half packs I bought 5 packs but that was

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.220 
half packs I bought 5 packs but that was
way<00:06:13.460> five<00:06:13.850> pencils<00:06:14.180> way<00:06:14.390> too<00:06:14.450> much<00:06:14.750> for<00:06:14.990> me

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:15.230 
way five pencils way too much for me

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.250 
way five pencils way too much for me
so<00:06:15.950> he's<00:06:16.130> like<00:06:16.280> three<00:06:16.580> and<00:06:16.670> a<00:06:16.760> half<00:06:16.940> packs<00:06:17.210> or<00:06:17.990> 3

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260 
so he's like three and a half packs or 3

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.350 
so he's like three and a half packs or 3
packs<00:06:18.410> k-member

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
packs k-member

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.840 
packs k-member
