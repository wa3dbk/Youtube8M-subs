 trend today we talk about the new 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.210
 15-inch model acer aspire v5 573 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.199
 developed on the new intel platform 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.789
 haswell 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.010
 this laptop is remarkable not only 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.329
 outwardly and has excellent 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.370
 performance design nouta 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.320
 modern and not out of the general 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.329
 style models asa times even 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.059
 surface and rounded corners housing 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.629
 thin and light just 21 millimeter at 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.460
 a mass of 2.2 kilograms for tag is 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.340
 very good on sale are available two 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.770
 laptop colors black and gray it is assembled 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.289
 very high quality plastic cover with 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.180
 brushed aluminum finish by the way 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.699
 at first it seems that it is he and 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.649
 the back of the base is extended and on 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.229
 this bumpers fixed display unit 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.570
 loop tugovat so with one hand new 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.030
 don't open a corner big work keeping 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.920
 laptop on your lap can it be weird 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.140
 Looks like the power key which is here 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.030
 on the left side it is small painted in 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.030
 body tone and almost no stand out 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.900
 to find it by touch is very difficult 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.670
 may i 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.920
 but if you decide to return to the scheme in 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.560
 which most ports are located 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.870
 on the back face and the most used 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.970
 distributed on the sides with a pair of usb2 0 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.770
 combo audio jack and connector 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.870
 there was a place behind the ports of type 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.780
 stuck and forgot the socket for the power supply 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:43.630
 network connector video output hdmi and 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.760
 displayport and one usb 30 keyboard 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.870
 good but with its own characteristics 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.400
 firstly split enter key 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.530
 which will need to get used 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.420
 and secondly, a very small move of buttons around 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.430
 one millimeter which is not always convenient 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.990
 when typing the truth of such 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.850
 solutions are both opponents and 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.090
 advocates so bad or good 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.890
 you decide for the rest no questions she 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.320
 well fixed substrate not 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:09.100
 pressed keys work softly 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.270
 it's a pity there is no backlighting no touchpad large 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.700
 and recessed into the work surface 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.920
 the touch field has the same coverage 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.750
 as on the work surface management 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.090
 clear a sense of supports multitouch 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.580
 and gestures windows 8 there are two 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.700
 modifications of this notebook differ 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.220
 screen type and 1 used touch 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.000
 display with ips-matrix and full hd 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.980
 and in the second the usual so-called. with permission 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.050
 1366 by 768 points 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.280
 we just got the second option 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.200
 which, in principle, not bad 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.670
 color rendering but talk about big 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.440
 viewing angles do not have to 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.380
 the maximum level of brightness is also not 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.730
 hits just 188 kandel per meter 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.890
 square and glossy finish 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.519
 sunny day or under a bright lamp 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.519
 will glare 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.360
 the laptop is built on the basis of new 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.100
 energy efficient intel core processors 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.440
 fourth generation 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.380
 the amount of memory in the base 4 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.940
 gigabyte but available extension up to 12 in 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.400
 This model uses hard drives 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.200
 max by 1 terabyte as for 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.330
 video adapters in the basic version for 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.519
 Graphics meets the built-in intel hd 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.560
 graphics 4400 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:18.410
 and in more advanced versions worth 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.700
 nvidia discrete map geforce gt 720m 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.610
 I have in my hands the basic version 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.490
 processor core i3 40 10th 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.680
 with four gigabytes of air and without 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.450
 discrete graphics card and even in such 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.370
 picking his performance 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.680
 will suit most users 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.810
 Naturally this is not a gaming laptop but in 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.820
 you can play the same world of tanks on 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.390
 medium settings it gives out about 30 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.070
 fps 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.260
 and if you shy to put 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.120
 minimum then you can squeeze all 50 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.100
 happy and decent autonomy here 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.580
 lithium polymer battery installed 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.440
 capacity of 3000 650 milliampere hours with 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.360
 which laptop lasted three hours in 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.670
 high load mode in economy 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.980
 the mode he will last nine hours 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:04.490
 which is very good even for an ultrabook on 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.900
 my view acer aspire v5 573 not 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.120
 perfect laptop its price 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.810
 categories but very close to that 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.690
 status 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.700
 he has excellent performance 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:16.700
 nice and strong body and generally laptop 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.400
 thin and light and if you take the option 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:22.190
 sensory with matrix on questions in general 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.560
 does not arise this is a great choice for 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.170
 human to whom autonomy is important and 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.790
 power with you was light don't forget
