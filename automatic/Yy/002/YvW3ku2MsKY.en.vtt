00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
spinning drum that sits in the middle of

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.219 
spinning drum that sits in the middle of
big<00:01:50.399> cast<00:01:50.670> iron<00:01:50.880> thing<00:01:51.270> or<00:01:51.390> solid<00:01:51.720> steel<00:01:51.960> thing

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
big cast iron thing or solid steel thing

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.319 
big cast iron thing or solid steel thing
on<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.439> floor<00:01:52.790> this<00:01:53.790> were<00:01:53.909> actually<00:01:53.970> weighs

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
on the floor this were actually weighs
