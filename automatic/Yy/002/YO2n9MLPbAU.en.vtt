what<00:00:28.050> happens<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:28.740> we<00:00:29.640> are<00:00:29.699> mining<00:00:30.060> stone

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
what happens so we are mining stone

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.749 
what happens so we are mining stone
currently<00:00:31.109> with<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.439> silk<00:00:31.949> touch<00:00:32.099> pickaxe<00:00:32.489> and

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
currently with a silk touch pickaxe and

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.690 
currently with a silk touch pickaxe and
it<00:00:33.270> just<00:00:33.600> broke<00:00:33.870> but<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:35.160> was<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.550> problem

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
it just broke but that was the problem

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.690 
it just broke but that was the problem
because<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.600> new<00:00:36.989> one<00:00:37.140> was<00:00:37.350> dispensed<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.070> we

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
because a new one was dispensed and we

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.540 
because a new one was dispensed and we
instantly<00:00:39.239> picked<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.840> up<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.320> we<00:00:40.920> continue

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
instantly picked it up and we continue

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.790 
instantly picked it up and we continue
mining<00:00:43.489> so<00:00:44.489> let's<00:00:44.789> say<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.870> pickaxe<00:00:46.410> here

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
mining so let's say this pickaxe here

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.639 
mining so let's say this pickaxe here
breaks<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.520> we<00:00:48.480> just<00:00:48.660> going<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.960> drop<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.530> and

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.310 
so we mined five stone for sick -
pickets<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.619> also<00:01:25.619> send<00:01:26.580> cobblestone<00:01:27.360> with

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
pickets and also send cobblestone with

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.190

the normal pickaxe

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.020 
the normal pickaxe
alright<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:32.009> cool<00:01:32.250> thing<00:01:32.280> about<00:01:32.610> this

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
alright and the cool thing about this

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.749 
alright and the cool thing about this
design<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.689> there's<00:01:34.590> infinite<00:01:35.250> storage

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
design is that there's infinite storage

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.300 
design is that there's infinite storage
so<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.360> can<00:01:36.720> store<00:01:37.020> as<00:01:37.259> many<00:01:37.590> stone<00:01:38.070> and

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
so you can store as many stone and

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.700 
so you can store as many stone and
cobblestone<00:01:38.729> as<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.210> need<00:01:39.420> as<00:01:39.720> well<00:01:40.290> as<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
cobblestone as you need as well as the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.450 
cobblestone as you need as well as the
pickaxe<00:01:41.100> s<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:42.140> here<00:01:43.140> we<00:01:43.320> have<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:43.920> infant

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
pickaxe s so here we have this infant

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.609 
pickaxe s so here we have this infant
storage<00:01:44.729> for<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.000> pickaxes<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:46.439> can

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
storage for the pickaxes and you can

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.639 
storage for the pickaxes and you can
just<00:01:46.829> stack<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:48.119> chests<00:01:48.689> mine<00:01:49.020> cards<00:01:49.439> and

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
just stack the chests mine cards and

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.440 
just stack the chests mine cards and
yeah<00:01:50.610> we<00:01:50.820> are<00:01:50.880> going<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.119> get<00:01:51.210> anything

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
yeah we are going to get anything

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.420 
yeah we are going to get anything
storage<00:01:53.810> all<00:01:54.810> right<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.439> now<00:01:55.710> for<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.159> stone

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
storage all right so now for the stone

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.480 
storage all right so now for the stone
generator<00:01:56.759> it's<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.960> pretty<00:01:58.290> odd<00:01:58.680> design<00:01:59.189> it's

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
generator it's a pretty odd design it's

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.969 
generator it's a pretty odd design it's
almost<00:01:59.969> two<00:02:00.299> years<00:02:00.479> old<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.500> was<00:02:01.680> made<00:02:01.950> by

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
almost two years old and it was made by

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.410 
almost two years old and it was made by
fork<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:04.070> nonetheless<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.579> still<00:02:05.880> works<00:02:06.090> very

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
fork and nonetheless it still works very

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.639 
fork and nonetheless it still works very
viable<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.649> yes<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:08.819> Christ<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.390> him

to build the stone generator without the
FK<00:02:33.030> fing<00:02:34.129> so<00:02:35.129> yeah<00:02:35.609> let's<00:02:35.970> move<00:02:36.299> on<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.689> how<00:02:37.230> to

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
FK fing so yeah let's move on to how to

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.559 
FK fing so yeah let's move on to how to

build it all right so here you have Fox

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.490 
build it all right so here you have Fox
design<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.500> at<00:02:44.340> tunnel<00:02:44.909> so<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:46.019> first<00:02:46.260> thing

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500

him out because this form will be
possible<00:07:07.870> without<00:07:08.050> his<00:07:08.470> stone<00:07:08.800> generator

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:09.100 
possible without his stone generator

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.180 
possible without his stone generator
which<00:07:09.640> works<00:07:10.120> reliably<00:07:10.510> even<00:07:11.050> after<00:07:11.860> two
