00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.980
 there was already early on the third day of the tournament 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.919
 the first highlight in the hall 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.320
 Münsterland 96 riders 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.139
 went into this first qualification for 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.780
 the winner's prize of the middle tour next to 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.369
 the winner of the big prize of 2011 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.619
 hans thorben rüder also the 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:24.449
 last year winner of the count k cup thomas 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.430
 Voss in the saddle with starting number 23 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.580
 a young wilder went into the course 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.130
 And that is very positive maurice 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.290
 tebbel the son of rene tebbel practiced 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:40.710
 already powerful pressure on the 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:43.290
 competition from temple with a lot of tempo the 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.860
 shortest way and at the end with zero 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.070
 penalty points and a period of 49 4 4 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.070
 seconds 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.660
 Of course at that time the 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:09.340
 leadership but 73 participants should yes 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:11.260
 followed by jan gerd brügging 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.420
 always good for a front 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.580
 Placement is the Dutchman with 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:20.340
 white vest but then five 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.340
 seconds slower than Maurice Tebbel 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.630
 the field until I am at the leading time 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.700
 the teeth out so too tim 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.700
 rieskamp-goedeking last year 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.009
 winner of the championate of Münster also 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.140
 rieskamp goedeking without fault points 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.830
 but a time difference of almost eight 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:43.540
 seconds on maurice tebbel that was 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:46.090
 already madness dear spectator I take 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.320
 it anticipates the young fashion is apple let 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.729
 the victory of this first one 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.610
 qualification for the middle tour 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.320
 take no more at the end, he referred 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.819
 toni haßmann and markus merschformann 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.319
 on the places two or three 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:01.179
 ultimately the same jump the layman 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.069
 have swapped and have already 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.500
 trying to be over time crippling 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:08.080
 now many victorious whites do not have 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.759
 calculated I wanted to go inside 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.670
 I wanted to prepare for the last one 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.790
 that we did not succeed but it did 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.790
 enough
