00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
looking at the clock right which I think

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.849 
looking at the clock right which I think
I<00:04:15.609> am<00:04:16.169> there<00:04:17.169> we<00:04:17.260> go<00:04:17.440> and<00:04:17.789> put<00:04:18.789> back<00:04:19.530> it's<00:04:20.530> two

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
I am there we go and put back it's two

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.610 
I am there we go and put back it's two
minutes<00:04:20.979> in<00:04:21.370> three<00:04:21.880> seconds<00:04:22.389> or<00:04:22.660> eight

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
minutes in three seconds or eight

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.930 
minutes in three seconds or eight
seconds<00:04:24.099> I'm<00:04:24.220> not<00:04:24.370> sure<00:04:24.490> if<00:04:24.550> that's<00:04:24.639> a<00:04:24.760> nadir

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
seconds I'm not sure if that's a nadir

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.610 
seconds I'm not sure if that's a nadir
of<00:04:25.060> three<00:04:25.419> I<00:04:25.660> think<00:04:25.870> it's<00:04:25.990> an<00:04:26.080> eight<00:04:26.199> just

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
of three I think it's an eight just

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.409 
of three I think it's an eight just
other<00:04:26.979> clocks<00:04:27.250> a<00:04:27.370> little<00:04:27.520> bit<00:04:27.639> wrong<00:04:27.820> so<00:04:28.270> we'll

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419
