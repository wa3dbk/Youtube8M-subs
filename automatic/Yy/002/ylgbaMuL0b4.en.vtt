involved in many of the different plot
lines<00:01:04.290> which<00:01:05.070> gives<00:01:05.339> me<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.700> lot<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:05.939> space<00:01:06.270> to

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
lines which gives me a lot of space to

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:09.230 
lines which gives me a lot of space to
be<00:01:07.049> free<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.950> don't<00:01:08.369> know<00:01:08.460> explore<00:01:09.060> those

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
be free and I don't know explore those

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.240 
be free and I don't know explore those
different<00:01:09.719> parts<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.439> her<00:01:10.590> character<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.100> her

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
different parts of her character and her

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.790 
different parts of her character and her
personality

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.090 

I<00:01:16.890> think<00:01:17.490> Morgan<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.030> character<00:01:18.890> evolves<00:01:19.890> as

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
I think Morgan is character evolves as

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.520 
I think Morgan is character evolves as
the<00:01:20.400> story<00:01:20.700> develops<00:01:21.060> she<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.230> think<00:01:22.290> she

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
the story develops she I think she

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.160 
the story develops she I think she
starts<00:01:22.980> out<00:01:23.130> more<00:01:23.430> innocently<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.600> part<00:01:25.020> of

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
starts out more innocently and part of

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.780 
starts out more innocently and part of
her<00:01:25.550> Celtic<00:01:27.680> 15<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.830> her<00:01:28.950> being<00:01:29.160> a<00:01:29.310> priestess

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
her Celtic 15 of her being a priestess

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.300 
her Celtic 15 of her being a priestess
and<00:01:30.090> as<00:01:30.300> it<00:01:30.570> develops<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.470> she<00:01:31.620> has<00:01:31.800> her<00:01:31.830> son

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
and as it develops and she has her son

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.330 
and as it develops and she has her son
who<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.240> rejected<00:01:34.110> by<00:01:34.290> Arthur<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.920> think<00:01:35.160> she

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
who is rejected by Arthur I think she

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.830 
who is rejected by Arthur I think she
becomes<00:01:35.730> more<00:01:37.130> vengeful<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.370> her<00:01:39.300> character

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
becomes more vengeful and her character

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.810 
becomes more vengeful and her character
becomes<00:01:40.230> a<00:01:40.440> little<00:01:40.590> bit<00:01:40.830> more<00:01:41.040> evil<00:01:41.670> and

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
becomes a little bit more evil and

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.220 
becomes a little bit more evil and
manipulative<00:01:42.450> as<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.990> story<00:01:43.290> goes<00:01:43.380> on<00:01:45.230> the

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 
manipulative as the story goes on the

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.110

story<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.680> arthur<00:01:47.160> and<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:48.300> unity<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:48.960> britain

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
story of arthur and the unity of britain

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.970 
story of arthur and the unity of britain
can<00:01:51.120> be<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> very<00:01:51.480> visual<00:01:51.780> thing<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.530> know<00:01:52.650> to

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 
can be a very visual thing you know to

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.160

celebration and to have them torn apart

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.300 
celebration and to have them torn apart
that's<00:01:57.270> like<00:01:57.510> a<00:01:57.540> very<00:01:57.900> physical<00:01:58.560> thing<00:01:59.160> you

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
that's like a very physical thing you

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.980 
that's like a very physical thing you
know<00:01:59.430> everyone's<00:01:59.850> part<00:02:00.150> of<00:02:00.270> society<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.870> a

destruction<00:02:04.080> in<00:02:04.260> that<00:02:05.480> dance<00:02:06.480> can<00:02:06.810> make<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.110> a

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
destruction in that dance can make it a

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.169 
destruction in that dance can make it a
very<00:02:07.320> physical<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:07.980> a<00:02:08.070> very<00:02:08.310> visual<00:02:08.640> thing

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
very physical and a very visual thing

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.490 
very physical and a very visual thing
and<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.510> think<00:02:09.540> that's<00:02:09.929> going<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.200> be<00:02:10.290> something

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
and I think that's going to be something

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.390 
and I think that's going to be something
really<00:02:10.740> spectacular<00:02:11.070> to<00:02:11.700> see<00:02:11.880> on<00:02:12.030> stage<00:02:13.400> for

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
really spectacular to see on stage for

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.920 
really spectacular to see on stage for

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
this version of King Arthur I think

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.540 
this version of King Arthur I think
francois<00:02:16.410> r<00:02:16.440> is<00:02:16.590> using<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:17.160> lot<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.460> different

each individual event that happens in

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.460 
each individual event that happens in
the<00:02:25.650> beginning<00:02:26.100> things<00:02:26.520> are<00:02:26.760> very

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
the beginning things are very

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.470 
the beginning things are very
ritualistic<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:29.070> tribal<00:02:29.610> so<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:29.970> movements

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
ritualistic and tribal so the movements

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.270 
ritualistic and tribal so the movements
are<00:02:30.600> much<00:02:30.750> more<00:02:31.020> grounded<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.680> earthy<00:02:32.130> and

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
are much more grounded and earthy and

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.610 
are much more grounded and earthy and
then<00:02:32.730> once<00:02:32.910> they<00:02:33.090> kind<00:02:33.300> of<00:02:33.360> move<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:34.020> the

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
then once they kind of move to the

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.870 
then once they kind of move to the
kingdom<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.130> when<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.370> kingdom<00:02:35.730> was

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
kingdom and when the kingdom was

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.699 
kingdom and when the kingdom was
successful<00:02:36.480> things<00:02:37.110> are<00:02:37.230> more<00:02:37.350> extravagant

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
successful things are more extravagant

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.520 
successful things are more extravagant
and<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.310> movement<00:02:38.760> is<00:02:38.880> much<00:02:39.150> more<00:02:39.450> like<00:02:40.170> royal

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
and the movement is much more like royal

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.699 
and the movement is much more like royal
and<00:02:40.890> so<00:02:41.400> there's<00:02:41.610> a<00:02:41.670> very<00:02:41.940> specific

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
and so there's a very specific

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.900 
and so there's a very specific
difference<00:02:43.709> like<00:02:43.980> as<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.370> ballet<00:02:44.550> moves

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
difference like as the ballet moves

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.320 
difference like as the ballet moves
