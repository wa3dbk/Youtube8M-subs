00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
there's not a ton of stuff that I was

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.010 
there's not a ton of stuff that I was
able<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:19.980> bring<00:02:20.280> aside<00:02:21.210> from<00:02:21.360> some<00:02:21.600> markers

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
able to bring aside from some markers

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.600 
able to bring aside from some markers
and<00:02:22.290> stickers<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.130> stuff

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
and stickers and stuff

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.210 
and stickers and stuff
I<00:02:23.750> pretty<00:02:24.750> much<00:02:24.860> consolidated<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:25.980> lot<00:02:26.190> of

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
I pretty much consolidated to a lot of

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.100 
I pretty much consolidated to a lot of
things<00:02:26.520> I<00:02:26.760> mean<00:02:26.790> multiply<00:02:27.540> screen<00:02:27.810> printing

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
things I mean multiply screen printing

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.740 
things I mean multiply screen printing
stuff<00:02:29.000> there<00:02:30.000> was<00:02:30.060> no<00:02:30.210> way<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.360> was<00:02:30.540> bringing

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
stuff there was no way I was bringing

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.860 
stuff there was no way I was bringing
here<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:31.850> that<00:02:32.850> was<00:02:33.120> probably<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.750> most

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
here so that was probably the most

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.480 
here so that was probably the most
spacious<00:02:34.170> of<00:02:34.470> my<00:02:34.560> stuff<00:02:34.800> I<00:02:34.980> didn't<00:02:35.190> bring<00:02:35.310> any

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
spacious of my stuff I didn't bring any

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.290 
spacious of my stuff I didn't bring any
spray<00:02:36.000> paint<00:02:36.210> either<00:02:36.360> just<00:02:37.350> cause<00:02:37.620> of<00:02:38.300> policy

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
spray paint either just cause of policy

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.530 
spray paint either just cause of policy
and<00:02:39.540> also<00:02:40.170> maybe<00:02:41.130> we'll<00:02:41.280> get<00:02:41.700> some<00:02:41.940> in<00:02:42.150> later

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
and also maybe we'll get some in later

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.420 
and also maybe we'll get some in later
but<00:02:42.870> right<00:02:43.590> now<00:02:43.650> it's<00:02:43.980> just<00:02:44.160> pretty<00:02:44.370> much

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
but right now it's just pretty much

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.120 
but right now it's just pretty much
stickers<00:02:44.820> and<00:02:44.940> stuff<00:02:45.060> so<00:02:45.450> we<00:02:46.290> got<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.470> nice

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
stickers and stuff so we got a nice

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.040 
stickers and stuff so we got a nice
stack<00:02:47.340> of<00:02:47.460> blanks<00:02:47.790> here<00:02:47.970> they'll<00:02:48.750> keep<00:02:48.990> me

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
stack of blanks here they'll keep me

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.190 
stack of blanks here they'll keep me
busy<00:02:49.370> we<00:02:50.370> got<00:02:50.520> some<00:02:50.760> just<00:02:51.450> printed<00:02:51.750> on<00:02:51.870> stuff

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
life I guess hit me up I've been here

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.420 
life I guess hit me up I've been here
for<00:03:57.209> a<00:03:57.480> couple<00:03:57.959> weeks<00:03:58.080> now<00:03:58.320> so<00:03:58.739> I<00:03:58.770> figured<00:03:59.280> I'd

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
for a couple weeks now so I figured I'd

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.400 
for a couple weeks now so I figured I'd
not<00:03:59.970> post<00:04:00.209> this<00:04:00.360> the<00:04:00.540> first<00:04:00.750> day<00:04:00.900> but<00:04:01.110> rather<00:04:01.230> a

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
not post this the first day but rather a

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.590 
not post this the first day but rather a
couple<00:04:01.920> days<00:04:02.040> down<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.370> road<00:04:02.400> so<00:04:02.850> I've<00:04:03.390> got<00:04:03.570> a

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
couple days down the road so I've got a

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.810 
couple days down the road so I've got a
grasp<00:04:03.870> on<00:04:04.080> things<00:04:04.350> and<00:04:04.650> I've<00:04:05.100> settled<00:04:05.459> in<00:04:05.670> as

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
grasp on things and I've settled in as

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.360 
grasp on things and I've settled in as
much<00:04:06.470> once<00:04:07.470> again<00:04:07.650> this<00:04:07.770> is<00:04:07.950> definitely<00:04:08.160> not

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
much once again this is definitely not

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.540 
much once again this is definitely not
as<00:04:08.489> clean<00:04:08.700> as<00:04:08.790> it<00:04:08.880> was<00:04:09.030> ten<00:04:09.750> minutes<00:04:09.989> ago<00:04:10.170> I<00:04:10.550> had

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
as clean as it was ten minutes ago I had

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.540 
as clean as it was ten minutes ago I had
to<00:04:11.700> pick<00:04:11.880> everything<00:04:12.120> up<00:04:12.450> so<00:04:13.130> this<00:04:14.130> probably

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
to pick everything up so this probably

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.909 
to pick everything up so this probably
will<00:04:14.670> turn<00:04:15.120> into<00:04:15.239> disaster<00:04:15.600> once<00:04:16.020> again<00:04:16.290> as<00:04:16.470> I

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
will turn into disaster once again as I

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.190 
will turn into disaster once again as I
get<00:04:17.070> back<00:04:17.190> to<00:04:17.400> some<00:04:17.549> work<00:04:17.760> so<00:04:18.090> if<00:04:18.359> you<00:04:18.989> have<00:04:19.080> any
