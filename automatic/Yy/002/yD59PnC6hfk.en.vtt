years<00:01:18.780> what<00:01:19.259> was<00:01:19.380> your<00:01:19.500> hardware<00:01:19.770> like<00:01:19.950> not

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
years what was your hardware like not

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.399 
years what was your hardware like not
nearly<00:01:20.850> as<00:01:20.970> good<00:01:21.150> as<00:01:21.270> what<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.479> have<00:01:21.630> now<00:01:21.780> so

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
nearly as good as what you have now so

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.870 
nearly as good as what you have now so
it<00:01:22.619> really<00:01:22.799> pushes<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.250> hardware<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.700> max

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
it really pushes the hardware to the max

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.429 
it really pushes the hardware to the max
and<00:01:24.060> honestly<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.509> freezes<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.020> lot<00:01:25.170> because

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
and honestly it freezes it a lot because

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.410 
and honestly it freezes it a lot because
it's<00:01:25.770> just<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.009> framerate<00:01:26.220> drops<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.909> it's

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
it's just the framerate drops and it's

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.840 
it's just the framerate drops and it's
just<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:27.780> don't<00:01:28.680> even<00:01:28.920> bother<00:01:29.189> air<00:01:29.579> sphere

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
just it's don't even bother air sphere

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.270 
just it's don't even bother air sphere
unless<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.329> love<00:01:30.630> jets<00:01:31.409> if<00:01:31.590> jess<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.159> all

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
unless you love jets if jess is that all

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.679 
unless you love jets if jess is that all
it's<00:01:32.460> all<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.700> care<00:01:32.880> about<00:01:32.909> then<00:01:33.479> go<00:01:33.659> for

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
it's all you care about then go for

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.149 
it's all you care about then go for
otherwise<00:01:34.079> don't<00:01:34.380> even<00:01:34.500> bother<00:01:34.680> getting<00:01:34.890> into

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
otherwise don't even bother getting into

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.890 
otherwise don't even bother getting into

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
couple games that I play but like I said

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.170 
couple games that I play but like I said
I<00:02:04.560> failed<00:02:05.040> right<00:02:05.219> there<00:02:05.369> got<00:02:05.549> myself<00:02:05.729> shot<00:02:05.880> in

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
I failed right there got myself shot in

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.460 
I failed right there got myself shot in
the<00:02:06.240> face<00:02:06.420> about<00:02:07.200> 44<00:02:07.770> but<00:02:09.020> how<00:02:10.020> are<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.259> maps

the face about 44 but how are the maps

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.260 
the face about 44 but how are the maps

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
that only shoots four of them so they're

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:08.180 
that only shoots four of them so they're
pretty<00:04:07.470> powerful<00:04:07.739> when<00:04:07.890> it<00:04:07.950> comes<00:04:08.070> to

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
pretty powerful when it comes to

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.280 
pretty powerful when it comes to
infantry<00:04:08.489> any<00:04:08.640> it<00:04:08.850> will<00:04:09.000> take<00:04:09.360> infantry<00:04:10.140> out

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290

what game mode you're gonna play but in

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.990

the<00:04:42.120> team<00:04:42.270> win<00:04:42.330> I<00:04:42.780> think<00:04:43.350> that's<00:04:43.500> where<00:04:43.680> it

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
the team win I think that's where it

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.980 
the team win I think that's where it
takes<00:04:44.220> on<00:04:44.400> a<00:04:44.430> different<00:04:44.520> look<00:04:45.120> it's<00:04:45.720> very

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
takes on a different look it's very

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.540 
takes on a different look it's very
similar<00:04:46.290> to<00:04:46.410> Omer<00:04:46.770> kill<00:04:47.010> in<00:04:47.130> a<00:04:47.190> sense<00:04:47.430> of

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
similar to Omer kill in a sense of

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.670 
similar to Omer kill in a sense of
engineer<00:04:48.150> is<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:48.510> primary<00:04:48.840> class<00:04:49.290> to<00:04:49.500> play

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
engineer is the primary class to play

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.200

capture the flag is fun but it's a

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.160
