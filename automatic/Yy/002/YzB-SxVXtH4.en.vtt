00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.700

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.770 
actually during the PD AC in Toronto and
we<00:00:13.799> had<00:00:13.950> an<00:00:14.040> interesting<00:00:14.250> conversation<00:00:14.780> about

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
we had an interesting conversation about

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.689 
we had an interesting conversation about
the<00:00:15.929> London<00:00:16.109> gold<00:00:16.440> fix<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:16.980> its<00:00:17.070> credibility

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
the London gold fix and its credibility

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.490 
the London gold fix and its credibility
and<00:00:17.850> recently<00:00:18.270> our<00:00:18.660> last<00:00:18.869> week<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.140> had<00:00:19.289> John

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
and recently our last week I had John

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.650 
and recently our last week I had John
Hathaway<00:00:19.980> on<00:00:20.130> who<00:00:20.760> said<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.270> fix<00:00:21.480> is

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
Hathaway on who said that the fix is

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.019 
Hathaway on who said that the fix is
archaic<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.529> should<00:00:23.189> even<00:00:23.310> maybe<00:00:23.550> be

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
archaic and should even maybe be

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.330 
archaic and should even maybe be
overhauled<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.900> was<00:00:25.320> wondering<00:00:25.830> what<00:00:26.130> your

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
overhauled I was wondering what your

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.519 
overhauled I was wondering what your
sentiment<00:00:26.939> wasn't<00:00:27.210> reverse<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.930> think

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
sentiment wasn't reverse this I think

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.859 
sentiment wasn't reverse this I think
that<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.920> fix<00:00:29.369> could<00:00:29.640> be<00:00:29.789> overhauled<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.630> think

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
that the fix could be overhauled I think

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.720 
that the fix could be overhauled I think
it<00:00:30.960> could<00:00:31.050> be<00:00:31.080> modernized<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:32.040> could<00:00:32.250> be<00:00:32.399> even

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
it could be modernized it could be even

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.670 
it could be modernized it could be even
be<00:00:33.090> computerized<00:00:33.600> I'm<00:00:34.020> not<00:00:34.200> sure<00:00:34.380> about<00:00:34.469> the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
be computerized I'm not sure about the

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.780 
be computerized I'm not sure about the
computerization<00:00:35.100> thing<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:36.890> I<00:00:37.890> think<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.610> you

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
computerization thing I I think that you

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.389 
computerization thing I I think that you
need<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.500> price<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.710> can<00:00:40.860> be<00:00:40.950> used<00:00:41.190> in

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
need a price that can be used in

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.150 
need a price that can be used in
settling<00:00:42.120> contracts<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.469> fix<00:00:43.710> has<00:00:43.890> done

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
settling contracts and the fix has done

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.819 
settling contracts and the fix has done
that<00:00:44.340> for<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.820> hundred<00:00:45.030> years<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.530> worry

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
that for a hundred years and I worry

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.000 
that for a hundred years and I worry
about<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.610> rash<00:00:48.000> move<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.200> something<00:00:49.440> else<00:00:49.680> that

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
about a rash move to something else that

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.400 
about a rash move to something else that
could<00:00:50.160> be<00:00:50.219> even<00:00:51.000> more<00:00:51.210> opaque<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.899> even<00:00:52.199> we

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
could be even more opaque and even we

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.630 
could be even more opaque and even we
more<00:00:52.949> open<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:54.860> influences<00:00:55.860> by<00:00:56.160> one<00:00:56.489> or<00:00:56.610> two

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
more open to influences by one or two

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.090 
more open to influences by one or two
large<00:00:56.969> participants<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:58.230> think<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.680> lot<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.039> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
large participants I think a lot of the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.950 
large participants I think a lot of the
people<00:00:59.280> who<00:00:59.489> are<00:00:59.609> criticizing<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.449> fixes

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
people who are criticizing the fixes

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.770 
people who are criticizing the fixes
don't<00:01:01.379> really<00:01:01.680> understand<00:01:02.190> how<00:01:02.430> they<00:01:02.640> are<00:01:02.969> and

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
don't really understand how they are and

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
there could be a good growth story here

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.760 
there could be a good growth story here
for<00:01:16.049> platinum<00:01:16.409> well<00:01:17.750> yes<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.960> no<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.170> mean<00:01:19.500> what

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
for platinum well yes and no I mean what

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.950 
for platinum well yes and no I mean what
we're<00:01:19.979> saying<00:01:20.280> right<00:01:20.670> now<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.540> we<00:01:21.930> think

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
we're saying right now is that we think

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.020 
we're saying right now is that we think
that<00:01:22.259> platinum<00:01:22.799> plating<00:01:23.250> prices<00:01:23.610> will<00:01:23.790> rise

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
that platinum plating prices will rise

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.850 
that platinum plating prices will rise
in<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.330> longer<00:01:24.750> run<00:01:24.780> but<00:01:25.409> they're<00:01:25.590> vulnerable

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
in the longer run but they're vulnerable

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.600 
in the longer run but they're vulnerable
to<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.850> spike<00:01:27.600> down<00:01:27.930> when<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.950> South<00:01:29.159> African

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
to a spike down when the South African

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.190 
to a spike down when the South African
strike<00:01:29.880> settles<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.450> mean<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.720> fact<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.049> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
strike settles I mean the fact that the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.859 
strike settles I mean the fact that the
prices<00:01:31.619> have<00:01:31.799> not<00:01:31.979> risen<00:01:32.280> sharply<00:01:32.700> during<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
prices have not risen sharply during the

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.319 
prices have not risen sharply during the
strike<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.740> extremely<00:01:35.460> worrisome<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.150> lot

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
strike is extremely worrisome to a lot

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.569 
strike is extremely worrisome to a lot
of<00:01:36.360> people<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.869> PGM<00:01:37.350> markets<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.280> you've

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
of people in the PGM markets so you've

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.640 
of people in the PGM markets so you've
seen<00:01:38.880> people<00:01:39.119> sell<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.780> metal<00:01:39.960> with<00:01:40.619> the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
seen people sell the metal with the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.770 
seen people sell the metal with the
expectation<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.490> once<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.270> strike<00:01:42.540> is

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
expectation that once the strike is

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.960 
expectation that once the strike is
settled<00:01:42.960> they'll<00:01:43.350> be<00:01:43.500> spiked<00:01:43.860> down<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.460> then

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
settled they'll be spiked down and then

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.389 
settled they'll be spiked down and then
they'll<00:01:45.180> reposition<00:01:46.170> at<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.350> lower<00:01:46.560> price<00:01:46.890> and

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
they'll reposition at a lower price and

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.639 
they'll reposition at a lower price and

Jeff let's look at the gold front now I

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.920 
Jeff let's look at the gold front now I
just<00:01:49.829> came<00:01:50.250> off<00:01:50.399> your<00:01:50.610> presentation<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.540> you

just came off your presentation and you

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.420 
just came off your presentation and you
were<00:01:52.049> saying<00:01:52.320> look<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.710> likelihood<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.250> a

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
were saying look the likelihood of a

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.030 
were saying look the likelihood of a
recession<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.119> u.s.<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:55.560> hundred

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
recession in the u.s. is a hundred

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.520 
recession in the u.s. is a hundred
percent<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.850> will<00:01:56.969> happen<00:01:57.320> would<00:01:58.320> this

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
percent that it will happen would this

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.679 
percent that it will happen would this
ultimately<00:01:59.040> be<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.280> bullish<00:01:59.640> factor<00:02:00.090> for<00:02:00.450> the

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
ultimately be a bullish factor for the

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.139 
ultimately be a bullish factor for the
metals<00:02:00.990> especially<00:02:01.649> gold<00:02:01.799> well<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.640> clarify<00:02:02.850> I

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
metals especially gold well to clarify I

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.380 
metals especially gold well to clarify I
said<00:02:03.570> look<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:04.110> know<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:05.390> probability

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
said look you know the the probability

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.510 
said look you know the the probability
of<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.600> future<00:02:06.930> recession<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.560> 1%<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.190> question

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
of a future recession is 1% the question

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.540 
of a future recession is 1% the question
is<00:02:08.640> when

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
is when

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.450 
is when

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
and recessions and gold prices don't

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.360 
and recessions and gold prices don't
necessarily<00:02:13.120> mix<00:02:13.390> sometimes<00:02:13.900> you'll<00:02:14.770> see<00:02:15.070> a

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
market the equity markets are moving

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:24.810 
market the equity markets are moving
strength<00:03:24.220> to<00:03:24.370> strength

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
strength to strength

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.730 
strength to strength
so<00:03:25.209> one<00:03:25.990> of<00:03:26.080> the<00:03:26.200> things<00:03:26.350> that<00:03:26.500> we're<00:03:26.650> looking

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 
so one of the things that we're looking

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.440 
so one of the things that we're looking
for<00:03:26.920> we<00:03:27.220> think<00:03:27.459> gold<00:03:27.700> prices<00:03:27.910> could<00:03:28.209> rise

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
for we think gold prices could rise

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.410 
for we think gold prices could rise
September<00:03:29.140> October<00:03:29.260> November<00:03:29.620> and<00:03:30.310> and<00:03:30.970> we

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
September October November and and we

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.690 
September October November and and we
one<00:03:32.110> of<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.260> reasons<00:03:32.320> why<00:03:32.709> we<00:03:32.890> think<00:03:33.070> that<00:03:33.370> is

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
one of the reasons why we think that is

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.760 
one of the reasons why we think that is
because<00:03:34.090> we<00:03:34.209> think<00:03:34.420> that<00:03:34.600> the<00:03:34.840> stock<00:03:35.350> market

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
because we think that the stock market

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.500 
because we think that the stock market
will<00:03:35.920> be<00:03:36.070> strong<00:03:36.400> until<00:03:36.880> September<00:03:37.360> October

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
will be strong until September October

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.600 
will be strong until September October
and<00:03:37.990> you'll<00:03:38.410> be<00:03:38.530> that<00:03:38.709> much<00:03:38.740> higher<00:03:39.130> you<00:03:39.520> know

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
and you'll be that much higher you know

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.100 
and you'll be that much higher you know
I<00:03:39.640> wouldn't<00:03:39.880> be<00:03:39.970> surprised<00:03:40.360> to<00:03:40.420> see<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:40.750> S&amp;P

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
October November so you know the idea of

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.440 
October November so you know the idea of
a<00:03:50.380> stock<00:03:50.770> market<00:03:51.010> continuing<00:03:51.760> to<00:03:52.000> distract

a stock market continuing to distract

a stock market continuing to distract

investors away from gold for now and

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.270 
investors away from gold for now and

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
then when the stock market does come off

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.300 
then when the stock market does come off
could<00:03:58.120> give<00:03:58.300> up<00:03:58.450> 15<00:03:58.870> or<00:03:58.990> 20<00:03:59.290> percent<00:03:59.470> and<00:03:59.860> that

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
could give up 15 or 20 percent and that

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.010 
could give up 15 or 20 percent and that
could<00:04:00.670> be<00:04:00.880> the<00:04:01.060> stimulus<00:04:01.540> for<00:04:01.720> a<00:04:01.750> lot<00:04:01.900> of

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 
could be the stimulus for a lot of

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.500 
could be the stimulus for a lot of
investors<00:04:02.470> to<00:04:02.680> cycle<00:04:03.070> back<00:04:03.190> into<00:04:03.520> gold<00:04:03.700> Jeff
