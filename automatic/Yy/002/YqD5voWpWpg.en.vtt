and again until the second step as with
the<00:00:03.659> fourth<00:00:03.929> step<00:00:04.220> you'll<00:00:05.220> want<00:00:05.430> to<00:00:05.549> practice

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
the fourth step you'll want to practice

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.820 
the fourth step you'll want to practice
this<00:00:06.120> approach<00:00:06.480> over<00:00:06.750> and<00:00:07.080> over<00:00:07.319> again<00:00:07.440> until

this approach over and over again until

this approach over and over again until
it<00:00:08.490> becomes<00:00:08.550> second<00:00:09.269> nature<00:00:09.650> the<00:00:10.650> approach<00:00:10.980> is

it becomes second nature the approach is

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.249 
it becomes second nature the approach is
a<00:00:11.219> very<00:00:11.519> personal<00:00:11.820> thing<00:00:12.150> everybody<00:00:12.780> develops

there<00:00:24.210> are<00:00:24.300> some<00:00:24.480> key<00:00:24.689> issues<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.350> the

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
there are some key issues and the

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.519 
there are some key issues and the
biggest<00:00:26.369> one<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:26.760> they're<00:00:27.449> in<00:00:27.689> good<00:00:27.900> time

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
biggest one is that they're in good time

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.910 
biggest one is that they're in good time
they're<00:00:28.650> never<00:00:30.080> very<00:00:31.080> late<00:00:31.349> with<00:00:31.529> their<00:00:31.710> push

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
they're never very late with their push

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.590 
they're never very late with their push
away<00:00:32.130> or<00:00:32.430> real<00:00:32.640> early<00:00:32.850> with<00:00:33.120> their<00:00:33.270> push<00:00:33.450> away

away or real early with their push away

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.120 
away or real early with their push away
or<00:00:33.960> when<00:00:34.350> they<00:00:34.469> get<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.920> foul<00:00:35.100> line

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
or when they get to the foul line

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.160 
or when they get to the foul line
they're<00:00:35.550> very<00:00:35.730> solid<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.329> ball<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.780> coming

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
they're very solid the ball is coming

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.170 
they're very solid the ball is coming
through<00:00:37.410> as<00:00:37.800> they're<00:00:38.129> finishing<00:00:38.520> their<00:00:38.850> slide

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
through as they're finishing their slide

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.240 
through as they're finishing their slide
and<00:00:39.510> they're<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.200> right<00:00:40.379> positions<00:00:40.980> they

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
and they're in the right positions they

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.979 
and they're in the right positions they
may<00:00:41.430> do<00:00:41.579> some<00:00:41.790> strange<00:00:42.120> things<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.660> get<00:00:42.809> to

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
may do some strange things to get to

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.350 
may do some strange things to get to
that<00:00:43.140> spot<00:00:43.500> but<00:00:43.980> they<00:00:44.579> all<00:00:44.760> have<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.149> one

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
that spot but they all have that one

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.000 
that spot but they all have that one
thing<00:00:45.629> in<00:00:45.780> common<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.200> that's<00:00:46.320> their<00:00:46.620> solid

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
thing in common and that's their solid

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.680 
thing in common and that's their solid
at<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.219> foul<00:00:47.399> line<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.120> average<00:00:48.300> bowler

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
at the foul line that the average bowler

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.529 
at the foul line that the average bowler
tends<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.200> slide<00:00:49.469> straight<00:00:50.430> or<00:00:50.730> too<00:00:51.120> slightly

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
tends to slide straight or too slightly

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.510 
tends to slide straight or too slightly
to<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.809> left<00:00:52.020> if<00:00:52.289> you're<00:00:52.440> right-handed<00:00:52.680> and

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
to the left if you're right-handed and

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.860 
to the left if you're right-handed and
what<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.850> happens<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.390> with<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.690> bowling

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
what that happens is with the bowling

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.959 
what that happens is with the bowling
ball<00:00:55.110> pulling<00:00:55.530> through<00:00:55.829> they<00:00:56.340> fall<00:00:56.610> off<00:00:56.789> to

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
ball pulling through they fall off to

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.090 
ball pulling through they fall off to
the<00:00:57.090> right<00:00:57.270> now<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.109> correct<00:00:58.500> way<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.680> do<00:00:58.949> it

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
the right now the correct way to do it

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.819 
the right now the correct way to do it
would<00:00:59.219> be<00:00:59.280> as<00:00:59.640> as<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.780> slide<00:01:01.109> starts<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.680> hit

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
would be as as the slide starts to hit

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.889 
would be as as the slide starts to hit
the<00:01:01.949> approach<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.579> want<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.820> slide<00:01:03.149> slightly

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
the approach you want to slide slightly

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.380 
the approach you want to slide slightly
to<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.260> right<00:01:04.589> if<00:01:04.920> you're<00:01:05.129> right-handed<00:01:05.430> that

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
to the right if you're right-handed that

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.240 
to the right if you're right-handed that
way<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.659> keeps<00:01:06.840> all<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.350> weight<00:01:07.560> behind<00:01:07.799> you

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
way it keeps all the weight behind you

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.980 
way it keeps all the weight behind you
it<00:01:08.670> keeps<00:01:08.909> all<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.270> weight<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.630> center<00:01:09.930> of

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
it keeps all the weight in the center of

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.649 
it keeps all the weight in the center of
your<00:01:10.049> body<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.619> your<00:01:11.490> slide<00:01:11.790> foot<00:01:12.060> will<00:01:12.360> end

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
your body and your slide foot will end

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.350 
your body and your slide foot will end
up<00:01:12.869> directly<00:01:13.380> underneath<00:01:13.770> your<00:01:14.010> chin<00:01:14.240> one<00:01:15.240> of

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
up directly underneath your chin one of

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.600 
up directly underneath your chin one of
the<00:01:15.450> benefits<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.140> found<00:01:16.470> by<00:01:17.100> going<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.580> a

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
the benefits that I found by going to a

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.520 
the benefits that I found by going to a
five-step<00:01:18.270> approach<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.110> helps<00:01:19.380> to

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
five-step approach is it helps to

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.109 
five-step approach is it helps to
increase<00:01:19.860> your<00:01:20.009> ball<00:01:20.220> speed<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:21.060> is

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
increase your ball speed this is

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.510 
increase your ball speed this is
something<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.810> had<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.140> do<00:01:22.439> for<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.280> drier

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
something that I had to do for the drier

play as as the lanes a break down you'll

want to try to increase your ball speed
it's<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.189> good<00:01:32.340> idea<00:01:32.460> if<00:01:32.700> maybe<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.060> try<00:01:33.270> a

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
it's a good idea if maybe to try a

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.539 
it's a good idea if maybe to try a
five-step<00:01:33.869> approach<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.740> move<00:01:34.920> back<00:01:35.189> on<00:01:35.430> the

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
five-step approach you move back on the

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.130

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
okay why don't you demonstrate that for

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.350 
okay why don't you demonstrate that for
an<00:02:33.010> essential<00:02:34.010> component<00:02:34.190> of<00:02:34.670> your<00:02:34.880> delivery

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
an essential component of your delivery

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.990 
an essential component of your delivery
is<00:02:35.540> a<00:02:36.110> consistently<00:02:36.920> straight<00:02:37.310> arm<00:02:37.580> swing

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
is a consistently straight arm swing

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.560 
is a consistently straight arm swing
like<00:02:38.720> a<00:02:38.750> pendulum<00:02:39.230> on<00:02:39.500> a<00:02:39.560> clock<00:02:39.980> a<00:02:40.570> straight

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.930 
know firsthand that when I started
bowling<00:05:32.349> I<00:05:32.500> started<00:05:33.009> throwing<00:05:33.250> a<00:05:33.400> backup<00:05:33.759> ball

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
bowling I started throwing a backup ball

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.879 
bowling I started throwing a backup ball
it<00:05:34.120> wasn't<00:05:34.479> until<00:05:34.690> I<00:05:34.750> was<00:05:35.020> into<00:05:35.320> bowling<00:05:35.500> for<00:05:35.830> a

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
it wasn't until I was into bowling for a

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:37.560 
it wasn't until I was into bowling for a
year<00:05:36.190> or<00:05:36.280> two<00:05:36.460> that<00:05:36.639> I<00:05:36.669> started<00:05:37.150> to<00:05:37.270> actually

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
year or two that I started to actually

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.510 
year or two that I started to actually
try<00:05:38.020> to<00:05:38.050> hook<00:05:38.620> the<00:05:38.830> ball<00:05:38.979> and<00:05:39.279> it<00:05:39.370> was

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
try to hook the ball and it was

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.060 
try to hook the ball and it was
something<00:05:39.880> that<00:05:39.909> did<00:05:40.180> not<00:05:40.210> come<00:05:40.659> now

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
something that did not come now

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.580 
something that did not come now
I<00:05:41.430> know<00:05:41.940> throwing<00:05:42.420> a<00:05:42.570> backup<00:05:42.990> all<00:05:43.170> was<00:05:43.350> very

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
I know throwing a backup all was very

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.590 
I know throwing a backup all was very
natural<00:05:44.130> for<00:05:44.280> me<00:05:44.430> to<00:05:44.610> do<00:05:44.820> so<00:05:45.120> I<00:05:45.150> really

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 
natural for me to do so I really

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.410 
natural for me to do so I really
empathize<00:05:46.470> with<00:05:46.500> many<00:05:47.070> women<00:05:47.400> that<00:05:48.060> try<00:05:48.270> and

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:48.420 
empathize with many women that try and

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.870 
empathize with many women that try and
try<00:05:48.840> and<00:05:48.870> try<00:05:49.080> to<00:05:50.010> start<00:05:50.280> hooking<00:05:50.460> the<00:05:50.730> ball

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
try and try to start hooking the ball

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.880 
try and try to start hooking the ball
and<00:05:51.120> may<00:05:51.210> get<00:05:51.420> very<00:05:51.630> frustrated<00:05:52.320> because<00:05:52.440> they

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
and may get very frustrated because they

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.740 
and may get very frustrated because they
can't<00:05:52.920> I<00:05:53.670> have<00:05:54.210> to<00:05:54.240> believe<00:05:54.480> that<00:05:54.600> something

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
can't I have to believe that something

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.470 
can't I have to believe that something
in<00:05:55.260> the<00:05:55.380> way<00:05:55.530> our<00:05:55.710> arms<00:05:56.130> are<00:05:56.340> made<00:05:56.880> and<00:05:57.180> the

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:57.480 
in the way our arms are made and the

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.600 
in the way our arms are made and the
difference<00:05:57.870> between<00:05:57.960> a<00:05:58.350> man<00:05:58.710> and<00:05:58.920> woman's<00:05:59.280> arm

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
difference between a man and woman's arm

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.670 
difference between a man and woman's arm
that<00:06:00.150> or<00:06:00.360> else<00:06:00.480> it's<00:06:00.690> the<00:06:00.840> physical<00:06:01.320> strength

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
that or else it's the physical strength

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.560 
that or else it's the physical strength
that<00:06:01.830> a<00:06:01.890> man<00:06:02.100> can<00:06:02.310> just<00:06:02.340> overpower<00:06:03.120> the<00:06:03.360> ball

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
that a man can just overpower the ball

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.110 
that a man can just overpower the ball
going<00:06:04.230> counterclockwise<00:06:04.910> versus<00:06:05.910> going

going counterclockwise versus going

going counterclockwise versus going
clockwise<00:06:07.310> probably<00:06:08.310> the<00:06:08.600> main<00:06:09.600> reason<00:06:09.930> why

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
clockwise probably the main reason why

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.620 
clockwise probably the main reason why
you<00:06:10.110> want<00:06:10.350> to<00:06:10.410> throw<00:06:10.590> a<00:06:10.620> hook<00:06:10.860> is<00:06:11.130> the<00:06:12.060> the

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 
you want to throw a hook is the the

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.690 
you want to throw a hook is the the
great<00:06:12.840> difference<00:06:13.200> in<00:06:13.320> pin<00:06:13.530> action<00:06:13.710> straight

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
great difference in pin action straight

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.720 
great difference in pin action straight
ball<00:06:14.970> is<00:06:15.930> usually<00:06:16.320> what<00:06:16.440> an<00:06:16.590> average<00:06:16.740> the

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:17.730 
ball is usually what an average the

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.250 
ball is usually what an average the
beginning<00:06:18.090> bowler<00:06:18.270> usually<00:06:18.750> learns<00:06:18.960> because

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:19.260 
beginning bowler usually learns because

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.090 
beginning bowler usually learns because
you<00:06:19.590> know<00:06:19.710> it's<00:06:19.890> easiest<00:06:20.220> to<00:06:20.370> throw<00:06:20.670> and<00:06:22.100> but

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.100 
you know it's easiest to throw and but

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.900 
you know it's easiest to throw and but
you're<00:06:23.220> not<00:06:23.310> gonna<00:06:23.400> throw<00:06:23.580> a<00:06:23.610> lot<00:06:23.760> of<00:06:23.790> strikes

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:23.910 
you're not gonna throw a lot of strikes

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.520 
you're not gonna throw a lot of strikes
that<00:06:24.330> way<00:06:24.450> you<00:06:24.750> have<00:06:24.870> to<00:06:24.930> be<00:06:25.080> very<00:06:25.350> very

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.530 
that way you have to be very very

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.610 
that way you have to be very very
accurate<00:06:26.300> and<00:06:27.300> the<00:06:27.540> reason<00:06:27.870> why<00:06:27.990> the<00:06:28.470> best

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
accurate and the reason why the best

bowlers in the world throw a hook is a

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.540 
bowlers in the world throw a hook is a
tremendous<00:06:30.810> pin<00:06:31.020> action<00:06:31.380> they<00:06:31.500> get<00:06:31.740> caused<00:06:32.370> by

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
tremendous pin action they get caused by

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.460 
tremendous pin action they get caused by
the<00:06:32.610> hook<00:06:32.880> angle<00:06:33.390> the<00:06:33.840> ball<00:06:34.020> makes<00:06:34.260> on<00:06:34.440> the

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.470 
the hook angle the ball makes on the

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.430 
the hook angle the ball makes on the

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 
back end of the lane and it's probably

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.320 
back end of the lane and it's probably
the<00:06:37.500> most<00:06:37.680> misunderstood<00:06:38.490> part<00:06:38.790> of<00:06:38.910> bowling

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
the most misunderstood part of bowling

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.410 
the most misunderstood part of bowling
on<00:06:39.750> exactly<00:06:40.560> how<00:06:40.800> to<00:06:40.830> throw<00:06:41.190> a<00:06:41.220> hook<00:06:41.490> but<00:06:42.300> the

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:42.420 
on exactly how to throw a hook but the

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.450 
on exactly how to throw a hook but the
benefits<00:06:42.930> are<00:06:43.620> tremendous<00:06:43.830> you<00:06:44.220> don't<00:06:44.370> have

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 
benefits are tremendous you don't have

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.450 
benefits are tremendous you don't have
to<00:06:44.580> be<00:06:44.700> as<00:06:44.790> accurate<00:06:45.140> you<00:06:46.140> can<00:06:46.290> per<00:06:46.890> say<00:06:47.070> open

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 
to be as accurate you can per say open

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.630 
to be as accurate you can per say open
the<00:06:47.550> lane<00:06:47.790> up<00:06:48.030> and<00:06:49.040> the<00:06:50.040> pins<00:06:50.280> just<00:06:50.460> fly

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:50.640 
the lane up and the pins just fly

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.180 
the lane up and the pins just fly
everywhere<00:06:51.060> the<00:06:51.930> release<00:06:52.200> very<00:06:52.800> much<00:06:53.010> like

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:53.190 
everywhere the release very much like

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.080 
everywhere the release very much like
the<00:06:53.340> approach<00:06:53.700> is<00:06:53.910> very<00:06:54.030> personal<00:06:54.840> it<00:06:56.090> based

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.090 
the approach is very personal it based

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.810 
the approach is very personal it based
on<00:06:57.300> your<00:06:57.540> body<00:06:57.780> size<00:06:58.200> how<00:06:58.890> tall<00:06:59.220> you<00:06:59.460> are<00:06:59.490> how

00:06:59.810 --> 00:06:59.820 
on your body size how tall you are how

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.450 
on your body size how tall you are how

long your arm is how muscular or lack of

long your arm is how muscular or lack of

muscle that you might have you're going

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.400 
muscle that you might have you're going
to<00:07:05.040> develop<00:07:05.310> your<00:07:05.550> own<00:07:05.670> style<00:07:05.870> it's<00:07:06.870> you<00:07:07.290> know

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:07.410 
to develop your own style it's you know

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.020 
to develop your own style it's you know
you<00:07:07.470> want<00:07:07.740> to<00:07:07.830> try<00:07:08.010> to<00:07:08.070> generate<00:07:08.280> some<00:07:08.520> power

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:09.030 
you want to try to generate some power

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.150 
you want to try to generate some power
in<00:07:09.300> the<00:07:09.390> release<00:07:09.690> but<00:07:10.020> today's<00:07:10.440> balls<00:07:10.800> that

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.160 
in the release but today's balls that

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.770 
in the release but today's balls that
will<00:07:11.340> generate<00:07:11.700> a<00:07:11.760> lot<00:07:11.940> of<00:07:12.090> that<00:07:12.210> power<00:07:12.450> so

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:12.780 
will generate a lot of that power so

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.090 
will generate a lot of that power so
it's<00:07:13.020> most<00:07:13.290> important<00:07:13.800> that<00:07:13.830> you<00:07:13.950> get<00:07:14.040> a

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:14.100 
it's most important that you get a

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.650 
it's most important that you get a
release<00:07:14.370> that's<00:07:14.610> comfortable<00:07:15.060> that<00:07:15.270> doesn't

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:15.660 
release that's comfortable that doesn't
