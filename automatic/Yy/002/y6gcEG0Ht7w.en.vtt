00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.080
 away from the castle 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.760
 the essential thing to be is what 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.880
 first thing to do is hold 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.520
 well the piece to a press either a 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:28.570
 press of the bank press text what 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.400
 next is the initial end where 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.960
 let's make the plating we're going to 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.719
 place 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.719
 this element in this way 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.890
 flush 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.730
 with the surface of the board where 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.730
 Let's sing 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.030
 we push 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.900
 this in order to be able to hold the 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.410
 singing at the beginning 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.239
 this piece of aluminum so that this one does not 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.190
 slip do not slide when we're 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.260
 working with the machine this 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.350
 we can use with this element that 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.680
 comes included with the machine or also 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.680
 with a 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.229
 man alone for better firmness and 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.979
 greater support and also for greater 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.979
 ease and speed in letting go 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.770
 once we have located this we are going to 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.430
 put the piece on the press 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.430
 fixed well 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.430
 use 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.550
 next step is that in singing 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:48.150
 entered free how much we are going to take the 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:51.120
 distances that we're going to sing and we're going to 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.340
 trim the singing strip 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.920
 in this case we are going to leave you also 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.890
 until the beginning of the surface and 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.719
 adding the 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.920
 centimeters that has the dilated in 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.920
 especially in the form of him 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.200
 we take our singing bagger 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.270
 seers 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.010
 by the top on roller in the 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.800
 Top is where the singing will go 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.739
 flexible or over edge and in the part 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.590
 lower is where the singing will go 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:29.349
 rigid both 22 millimeters and by which 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.349
 let's insert the pull here 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.170
 we skip our singing and with this 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:42.400
 element 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.930
 let's make them imprison without being left 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.750
 firmly subject but without having a 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.300
 free passage simply in order to 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.819
 keep us from moving the change 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.500
 of the plating process with these 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.520
 elements with these tools that the 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:01.280
 we will release to open or close the 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.260
 jaws of the plug-in these jaws 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.400
 they should go according to the size of the 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.489
 board that we are going to plug 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.959
 not that we will be very pressured 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.860
 but not that we will be very 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:17.099
 I loose the width of the board simply 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.739
 that is guiding the machine on the 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:22.720
 board that we go to the short we are going to 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.480
 make the song come out 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.240
 and this part the beginning of this part is 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.950
 what are we going to do to put the 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.680
 bra 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.140
 at the beginning of the bra 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.280
 let's grade the jaws simply 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.280
 we look at the knob 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.930
 of the pair 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.129
 leaving him free and we can fix ourselves with 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.129
 those top screws 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.129
 we take the division page 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.830
 and we hold it 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.810
 my mind 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.810
 to prevent them from moving 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.930
 next process is then let's 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.930
 tilt the machines a little 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.480
 we plug into the current and turn on 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:26.660
 machine 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.990
 taking it from front to back of the 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.990
 piece 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.030
 and we have sapag left on our surface
