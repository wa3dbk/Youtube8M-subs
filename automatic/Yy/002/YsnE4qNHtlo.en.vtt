but laneige is the first BB cushion that
I<00:00:22.710> kind<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.220> heard<00:00:23.460> about<00:00:23.760> these<00:00:24.330> are<00:00:24.570> really

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
I kind of heard about these are really

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.359 
I kind of heard about these are really
convenient<00:00:25.170> because<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:25.920> comes<00:00:26.130> with<00:00:26.340> a

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
convenient because it comes with a

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.790 
convenient because it comes with a
sponge<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.869> product<00:00:28.289> inside<00:00:28.740> is

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
sponge and the product inside is

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.220 
sponge and the product inside is
actually<00:00:29.400> soaked<00:00:29.699> in<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:29.910> sponge<00:00:30.240> so<00:00:30.630> you're

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
actually soaked in the sponge so you're

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.260 
actually soaked in the sponge so you're
basically<00:00:31.380> applying<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.309> sponge<00:00:32.640> on<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.880> sponge

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
basically applying a sponge on a sponge

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.660 
basically applying a sponge on a sponge
so<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.809> ensures<00:00:34.200> really<00:00:34.920> light<00:00:35.100> coverage

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
so that ensures really light coverage

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.520 
so that ensures really light coverage
and<00:00:36.030> another<00:00:36.809> great<00:00:37.050> thing<00:00:37.170> about<00:00:37.320> this

flattering<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:57.899> far<00:00:58.140> but<00:00:58.440> i<00:00:58.469> think<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.829> true

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
flattering so far but i think the true

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.400 
flattering so far but i think the true
test<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.579> the<00:01:00.090> quality<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.660> product<00:01:00.989> and

test of the quality of this product and
the<00:01:01.590> color<00:01:01.800> match<00:01:02.129> because<00:01:02.460> there<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.030> only

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
the color match because there is only

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.020 
the color match because there is only
three<00:01:03.420> shades<00:01:03.930> at<00:01:04.140> target<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:05.610> go<00:01:05.850> outside

get a feel for the color and texture

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.160

once<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.119> on<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.299> skin<00:01:15.479> pretty<00:01:15.780> well<00:01:15.990> it

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
once it on the skin pretty well it

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
doesn't have any bumpiness to it so it's

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:30.990 
doesn't have any bumpiness to it so it's
a<00:01:19.290> pretty<00:01:19.439> smooth<00:01:19.890> product

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.360 

just<00:01:32.000> apply<00:01:32.180> the<00:01:32.300> lineage<00:01:32.750> BB<00:01:33.050> cushion<00:01:33.500> and<00:01:33.830> my

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
just apply the lineage BB cushion and my

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.150 
just apply the lineage BB cushion and my
skin<00:01:34.640> kind<00:01:34.940> of<00:01:35.030> has<00:01:35.240> a<00:01:35.630> sticky<00:01:35.960> tacky<00:01:36.500> texture

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
skin kind of has a sticky tacky texture

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.700 
skin kind of has a sticky tacky texture
so<00:01:37.760> I<00:01:37.790> guess<00:01:38.240> in<00:01:38.660> a<00:01:38.930> way<00:01:38.960> that<00:01:39.320> makes<00:01:39.350> it

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
so I guess in a way that makes it

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.740 
so I guess in a way that makes it
hydrating<00:01:40.340> but<00:01:40.850> I<00:01:40.880> feel<00:01:41.120> like<00:01:41.180> it<00:01:41.390> also

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
hydrating but I feel like it also

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.720 
hydrating but I feel like it also
accentuate<00:01:42.230> the<00:01:42.470> dryness<00:01:42.710> in<00:01:42.980> my<00:01:43.040> face<00:01:43.310> so<00:01:43.580> I'd

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 
accentuate the dryness in my face so I'd

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.820 
accentuate the dryness in my face so I'd
recommend<00:01:43.880> to<00:01:44.450> moisturizing<00:01:45.200> forehand<00:01:45.620> I

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
recommend to moisturizing forehand I

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.710 
recommend to moisturizing forehand I
understand<00:01:46.520> this<00:01:46.640> doubles<00:01:47.030> up<00:01:47.180> because<00:01:47.540> it's

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
understand this doubles up because it's

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.480

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
feel like this is a really convenient

throughout<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.650> day<00:01:57.830> you<00:01:57.860> can<00:01:58.010> and<00:01:58.550> I<00:01:59.150> heard

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
throughout the day you can and I heard

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.030 
throughout the day you can and I heard
when<00:01:59.570> people<00:01:59.990> apply<00:02:00.410> it<00:02:00.530> throughout<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:00.950> day

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
when people apply it throughout the day

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.860 
when people apply it throughout the day
it<00:02:01.250> doesn't<00:02:01.340> build<00:02:01.730> up<00:02:01.910> and<00:02:02.120> create<00:02:02.450> a<00:02:02.510> sticky

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
it doesn't build up and create a sticky

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.080 
it doesn't build up and create a sticky
residue<00:02:02.900> but<00:02:03.590> if<00:02:03.710> you<00:02:03.800> look<00:02:03.950> at<00:02:04.160> the<00:02:04.190> product

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
residue but if you look at the product

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.330 
residue but if you look at the product
in<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.330> pan<00:02:05.600> and<00:02:05.960> see<00:02:06.560> how<00:02:06.770> it<00:02:06.890> matches<00:02:07.010> on<00:02:07.280> my

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
in the pan and see how it matches on my

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.220 
in the pan and see how it matches on my
face<00:02:07.580> it<00:02:07.760> doesn't<00:02:07.850> really<00:02:08.119> deposit<00:02:08.930> this

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:09.230 
face it doesn't really deposit this

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:12.460 
face it doesn't really deposit this
brown<00:02:10.100> color<00:02:10.580> on<00:02:10.880> my<00:02:11.090> skin<00:02:11.510> so<00:02:11.870> that's<00:02:12.200> a<00:02:12.320> good

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
brown color on my skin so that's a good

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.650 
brown color on my skin so that's a good
thing<00:02:12.530> one<00:02:13.250> downside<00:02:13.490> to<00:02:13.850> this<00:02:13.940> method<00:02:14.180> is

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
thing one downside to this method is

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.870 
thing one downside to this method is
this<00:02:15.050> sponge<00:02:15.320> gets<00:02:15.680> dirty<00:02:16.130> really<00:02:16.400> easily

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
this sponge gets dirty really easily

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.270 
this sponge gets dirty really easily
because<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:18.170> can<00:02:18.350> see<00:02:18.530> some<00:02:18.770> of<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:18.920> product

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
because you can see some of the product

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.920 
because you can see some of the product
is<00:02:19.370> already<00:02:19.610> transferred<00:02:20.090> onto<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.690> back<00:02:20.900> of

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
is already transferred onto the back of

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.500 
is already transferred onto the back of
it<00:02:21.260> but<00:02:21.470> I<00:02:21.500> do<00:02:21.650> like<00:02:21.920> this<00:02:22.250> convenient<00:02:23.000> compact

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
it but I do like this convenient compact

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.500 
it but I do like this convenient compact
and<00:02:23.810> everything<00:02:24.290> and<00:02:24.560> since<00:02:25.430> there<00:02:25.700> is<00:02:25.880> a<00:02:26.150> lid

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
and everything and since there is a lid

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.720 
and everything and since there is a lid
over<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:27.020> actual<00:02:27.200> product<00:02:27.920> it<00:02:28.130> helps<00:02:28.460> to

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
over the actual product it helps to

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.750 
over the actual product it helps to
preserve<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:30.110> formula<00:02:30.890> and<00:02:31.100> make<00:02:31.490> sure<00:02:31.520> it

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
preserve the formula and make sure it

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.790 
preserve the formula and make sure it
doesn't<00:02:31.940> dry<00:02:32.209> out<00:02:32.240> on<00:02:32.630> you<00:02:32.810> to<00:02:33.230> be<00:02:33.320> honest<00:02:33.680> I

I

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.930 
I
feel<00:02:59.590> like<00:02:59.830> this<00:03:00.010> is<00:03:00.160> a<00:03:00.190> lighter<00:03:00.460> formula<00:03:01.060> I

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610
