00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:19.170
 Hi, I'm a manresa ladder and today we're going to 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.170
 make a sardine escabechina 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.640
 We are going to present the ingredients of 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:27.190
 today naturally a scab 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.930
 Sardine needs its sardine then 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:33.700
 we continue with the olive oil 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:37.200
 vinegar flour cinnamon a few teeth of 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:41.470
 garlic laurel some coffee granites 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:45.220
 red pepper salt a little pepper 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:48.519
 sugar a lime zest a skin 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.080
 lemon and a good orange skin what 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.420
 first thing we're going to do is take the 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.220
 fresh sardines from the fish market and 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.320
 we are going to clean 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.479
 the best thing would be to spend a little water 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.130
 so that he lost a little bit of the 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:03.830
 flake we clean them in water 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.890
 and once cleaned in water with a 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.000
 knife we ​​cut his head 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.550
 obviously if you have confidence with the 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.380
 You can do it for her but in 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.720
 cases of haste and rapidity 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.440
 it is best to catch the sardine cut it in 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.020
 diagonally the head and she herself already 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.510
 takes apart from the gut then the 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.240
 open on the side and with the same 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:35.150
 knife that we just pulled out all the 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:38.180
 gut inside we have cleaned all the 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:41.020
 sardines and now what we're going to do is 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.020
 fill the 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.120
 well the truth is that we could 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.190
 guess or not align the sardines myself 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.640
 normally the salt and not because then the 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.020
 oil as a thickness a texture that 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.460
 the flour thickens 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.910
 we could after removing the 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.690
 sardines put a little bit of thickener 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:12.450
 to the sauce or not that will taste for 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.000
 taste colors and fry them in oil 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.440
 olive we are going to put the liter of oil 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.440
 olive in the pan 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.540
 and it is already we have them are already fried 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.580
 let's go pulling one by one and 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.110
 putting them in a clay pot 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.820
 We can also make them very important 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.260
 the clay pot but as the 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.390
 modern kitchens have only 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.460
 ceramic hob we have to make them a 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.970
 can not fry too much 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:56.100
 because if they will not be too dry and it is not 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.790
 the question has to be fleshy and 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.980
 good is sardine is tiny then 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.170
 we have the big ones are usually more 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.080
 from Galicia from here of the Mediterranean ' 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.840
 we have these of that magnificent size 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.330
 that is neither big nor small we are going to 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.370
 make a nice one to make the needles 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.370
 of the watch or watch 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.820
 what good good sardines we are already 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.400
 we have the fried sardines in their 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:31.390
 magnificent clay pot and the clock does not 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.730
 mark the hours and we start giving him the 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.980
 oil we already have it hot we have a 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.900
 little thick is always oil 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.380
 virgin olive we will not play with others 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.870
 oils that is to preserve 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.670
 ok and from here here we have to 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.810
 put all ingredients the order is 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.810
 totally the same does not matter 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.090
 this is taking shape and is catching 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.750
 low form of taste the oil goes 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.150
 absorbing all the flavors that you 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.030
 we have put and when we give you a 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.340
 little that comes to the boil 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.410
 that everything starts to consolidate 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.500
 we toss paprika paprika to taste 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.299
 a spoonful of paprika there is no 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.280
 leave it a long time boiling then we are 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.709
 would burn and give us a taste not 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.820
 Pleasant to the palate immediately 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.620
 after the moment we will throw the 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.590
 vinegar the vinegar has to be the 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.870
 half of the oil if we put to fry 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.760
 for example a liter of olive oil 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.150
 we will put half a liter in good vinegar 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.820
 As you know , pickle has always been 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.980
 to preserve things formerly 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.840
 there are many theories but in the past 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.400
 there were refrigerators then say good what 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.020
 we make with so much sardine that we have 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.050
 what do we do with the things that 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.600
 they have left to pickle, it 's good 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.370
 pickled nation we can save 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.500
 sardines any type of fish 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.870
 meats anything and now when 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.240
 is the boil that we are going to give the 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.790
 let's go cover it up well we've already 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.390
 made the pickle you can see 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:05.990
 in its little color its thickness its odor cillo 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:08.220
 maximum one and remember that this can not 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.430
 eat it now and you would like but not 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.140
 until tomorrow punished can not be 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.110
 try until tomorrow so that really 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:19.080
 the sardine will make me good we already have 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.030
 the sardines at their point have rested 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.670
 good we to golden five minutes 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.350
 but good as I said they have to 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.670
 rest until tomorrow and you have to eat 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.440
 what we will do to eat them 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.910
 obviously they get caught putting on a 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.850
 dish but I would like to give it a 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.530
 quality touch to the subject then look at 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.350
 the fridge and I found a can of 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:40.830
 tomatoes and I 'm going to make a tartar of 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:43.420
 tomato as easy we cut the tomato 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:46.380
 he is very very very little 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.380
 it is not very think 

00:05:47.809 --> 00:05:53.929
 vinegar and it gives us strength 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:53.929
 then I had some toast 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:00.350
 you had barbecue and you're out there and we're going to 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:03.250
 making a little arm invention 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.250
 toast 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:09.969
 and we are going to put this tomato tartar 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:12.489
 on top of the toast 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:14.289
 what a beautiful color is where there is a 

00:06:12.489 --> 00:06:15.750
 good tomato 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:19.940
 good 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.940
 and we are going to take a pan and there 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.490
 other 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:43.520
 and I think that now obviously that 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.760
 I would make a sardine without his parsley 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.390
 to put the little detail 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.160
 and here they have signs 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.930
 Well, we have made a scab 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.370
 sardines I am oscar manresa the 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.590
