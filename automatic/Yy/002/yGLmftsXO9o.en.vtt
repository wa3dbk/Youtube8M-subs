lot<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.770> time<00:01:43.860> teaching<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.460> player<00:01:44.640> the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
lot of time teaching the player the

stake out right out here it's your first
opportunity<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:49.049> really<00:01:49.229> use<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.560> scanner

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
opportunity to really use the scanner

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.160 
opportunity to really use the scanner
what<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.549> allows<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.909> player<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.119> do<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.750> get

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
what it allows the player to do is get

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.230 
what it allows the player to do is get
up<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> high<00:01:52.650> vantage<00:01:52.950> point<00:01:53.400> and<00:01:53.640> look

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
up to a high vantage point and look

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.170 
up to a high vantage point and look
around<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.960> tag<00:01:55.260> enemies<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.100> zoom<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:57.030> on

them get an idea of what their position
is<00:01:59.010> and<00:01:59.310> even<00:01:59.640> use<00:01:59.939> drop<00:02:00.210> on<00:02:00.390> them

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
is and even use drop on them

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.550 
is and even use drop on them
you've<00:02:02.170> got<00:02:02.320> five<00:02:02.590> minutes<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:05.140> hardline

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
you've got five minutes in hardline

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.590 
you've got five minutes in hardline
there's<00:02:05.800> always<00:02:06.220> a<00:02:06.250> strategic<00:02:06.850> choice<00:02:06.880> in<00:02:07.390> any

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
there's always a strategic choice in any

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.940 
there's always a strategic choice in any
mode<00:02:07.840> that<00:02:07.990> you're<00:02:08.110> playing<00:02:08.320> you're<00:02:08.710> less

inclined<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:09.940> run<00:02:10.720> into<00:02:10.930> a<00:02:10.960> space<00:02:11.230> and<00:02:11.410> just

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
inclined to run into a space and just

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.020 
inclined to run into a space and just
start<00:02:11.740> shooting<00:02:11.950> we've<00:02:12.460> balanced<00:02:12.820> the<00:02:12.910> game

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
start shooting we've balanced the game

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.520 
start shooting we've balanced the game
to<00:02:13.150> make<00:02:13.240> it<00:02:13.390> much<00:02:13.540> more<00:02:13.690> non-lethal<00:02:14.320> this

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
to make it much more non-lethal this

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.510 
to make it much more non-lethal this
area<00:02:14.800> up<00:02:14.920> here<00:02:14.950> is<00:02:15.190> where<00:02:15.310> we<00:02:15.340> teach

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
area up here is where we teach

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.190 
area up here is where we teach
distraction<00:02:16.150> it's<00:02:16.360> not<00:02:16.630> necessarily<00:02:17.170> a

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
distraction it's not necessarily a

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.360 
distraction it's not necessarily a
weapons<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:17.740> don't<00:02:17.860> get<00:02:17.950> a<00:02:17.980> targeting

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
weapons you don't get a targeting

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.130 
weapons you don't get a targeting
reticle<00:02:18.490> so<00:02:19.240> we<00:02:19.360> have<00:02:19.540> to<00:02:19.660> do<00:02:19.780> a<00:02:19.810> lot<00:02:19.990> of<00:02:20.020> things

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
reticle so we have to do a lot of things

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.140 
reticle so we have to do a lot of things
to<00:02:20.680> teach<00:02:21.220> them<00:02:21.520> where<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:21.970> actual

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
to teach them where the actual

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.030 
to teach them where the actual
distraction<00:02:22.750> shell<00:02:22.930> casing<00:02:23.230> is<00:02:23.320> going<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.530> go

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.740 

these<00:02:27.040> are<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.400> spawners<00:02:27.730> for<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.120> guys<00:02:28.300> and

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
these are the spawners for the guys and

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.300 
these are the spawners for the guys and
this<00:02:29.200> is<00:02:29.350> a<00:02:29.380> process<00:02:29.590> that<00:02:29.800> took<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.070> long<00:02:30.250> time

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
this is a process that took a long time

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.400 
this is a process that took a long time
figuring<00:02:31.030> out<00:02:31.330> exactly<00:02:31.480> where<00:02:32.050> your<00:02:32.230> partner

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
figuring out exactly where your partner

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.070 
figuring out exactly where your partner
kai<00:02:32.800> would<00:02:33.100> position<00:02:33.370> herself<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:34.810> that<00:02:34.840> the

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
kai would position herself so that the

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.620 
kai would position herself so that the
player<00:02:35.290> new<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.740> move<00:02:35.890> forwards<00:02:36.370> and<00:02:36.670> exactly

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
player new to move forwards and exactly

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.480 
player new to move forwards and exactly
where<00:02:37.870> to<00:02:37.959> stand<00:02:38.200> it<00:02:38.380> to<00:02:38.470> separate<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:39.310> take

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
where to stand it to separate and take

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.699 
where to stand it to separate and take
down<00:02:39.670> using<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.300> distract<00:02:40.750> these<00:02:41.230> really<00:02:41.530> add

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
down using the distract these really add

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.560 
down using the distract these really add
to<00:02:41.740> the<00:02:42.040> fantasy<00:02:42.370> of<00:02:42.490> hardline<00:02:42.940> they<00:02:43.209> give<00:02:43.360> a

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
to the fantasy of hardline they give a

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.600 
to the fantasy of hardline they give a
much<00:02:43.810> more<00:02:44.080> fight<00:02:44.530> on<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:44.860> streets<00:02:45.160> feeling

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
much more fight on the streets feeling

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.130 
much more fight on the streets feeling
to<00:02:45.760> everything<00:02:46.120> that's<00:02:46.240> going<00:02:46.570> on<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:47.050> they

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
to everything that's going on and they

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.870 
to everything that's going on and they
also<00:02:47.320> add<00:02:47.650> to<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:48.190> strategy<00:02:48.459> of<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:48.820> game

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
also add to the strategy of the game

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.610 
also add to the strategy of the game
because<00:02:49.390> again<00:02:49.690> using<00:02:50.230> some<00:02:50.440> of<00:02:50.470> these

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
because again using some of these

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.199 
because again using some of these
non-lethal<00:02:51.220> weapons<00:02:51.550> can<00:02:51.820> get<00:02:52.090> you

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
non-lethal weapons can get you

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:53.370 
non-lethal weapons can get you
information<00:02:52.510> that<00:02:52.810> you<00:02:53.020> couldn't<00:02:53.290> have

information that you couldn't have

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.080 
information that you couldn't have
gotten<00:02:53.530> otherwise<00:02:53.830> it<00:02:54.490> was<00:02:54.580> an<00:02:54.700> opportunity

gotten otherwise it was an opportunity
for<00:02:55.180> us<00:02:55.360> to<00:02:55.420> move<00:02:55.690> away<00:02:55.840> from<00:02:56.020> the<00:02:56.740> shooting

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
for us to move away from the shooting

opportunity to slow down and think about

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.860 
opportunity to slow down and think about
how<00:03:03.610> they're<00:03:03.850> going<00:03:03.940> to<00:03:04.000> approach<00:03:04.240> a<00:03:04.420> scenario

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
how they're going to approach a scenario

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.330 
how they're going to approach a scenario
you're<00:03:05.350> going<00:03:05.470> to<00:03:05.530> be<00:03:05.620> doing<00:03:05.709> a<00:03:05.920> lot<00:03:05.950> of<00:03:06.100> stuff

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
you're going to be doing a lot of stuff

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.620 
you're going to be doing a lot of stuff
in<00:03:06.430> hardline<00:03:06.790> that<00:03:06.940> you<00:03:07.030> haven't<00:03:07.360> done<00:03:07.480> in

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
in hardline that you haven't done in

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.910 
in hardline that you haven't done in
battlefield<00:03:08.050> before<00:03:08.170> but<00:03:08.590> I<00:03:08.650> think<00:03:08.800> it's

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
battlefield before but I think it's

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.500 
battlefield before but I think it's
going<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.070> be<00:03:09.190> super<00:03:09.430> cool<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:09.760> super<00:03:09.940> fun<00:03:10.390> and

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
going to be super cool and super fun and

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.880 
going to be super cool and super fun and
it's<00:03:10.690> going<00:03:10.780> to<00:03:10.840> feel<00:03:11.080> a<00:03:11.110> bit<00:03:11.350> more<00:03:11.530> Street

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
it's going to feel a bit more Street
