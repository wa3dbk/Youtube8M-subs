00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.809
 well my life normally begins at 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.940
 6 in the morning when my alarm clock 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.619
 sounds and then the truth is that nothing 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.520
 I'm going to lie, I'm one of the people 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.290
 that does not cost them so much work 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.540
 get up even if my face says what 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.890
 totally the opposite and the first thing that 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.330
 I do is go to the bathroom to do my 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.330
 morning needs 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.989
 after I do my needs 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.230
 tomorrow what I do is wash my face 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.740
 with an Avignon soap and cream 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.860
 clinic that is my favorite 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.860
 ah 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.150
 then I put on my slippers 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.960
 victories and I think they are super comfortable 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:57.470
 I grabbed my cell phone and went down to the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.470
 kitchen 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.340
 Believe it or not, I'm the one who prepares 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.620
 breakfast in this house so I know that 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.880
 I 'm not a professional chef but the 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.220
 truth is that the products of 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.830
 tupperware mind only work padrÃ­simo 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.930
 I put them in the microwave and it's ready 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.410
 and then I'm taking all the 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.450
 ingredients for my super breakfast and what 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.330
 what I use are egg whites that 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.400
 I put a half cup in this 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.430
 tupperware container that is 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:40.720
 special for egg and I also put 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:44.080
 provolone cheese and turkey breast and 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.160
 also like toast and fruit in this 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.160
 case it was a melon 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.430
 sometimes when I want to give myself the luxury of 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.400
 feel good here fancy what they want 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:59.470
 this little bit of this double express 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.470
 to be you that are delicious 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.990
 let's pretend that I already had breakfast because 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.240
 I recorded this as two o'clock in the afternoon 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:18.350
 then let's say that it was not time for 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:21.910
 have breakfast I take my star box and I 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.910
 I go up to fix my room 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.170
 to be able to make up this first 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.570
 brush my hair a little and I grab it 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.910
 in a chongo so as not to have anything of the 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.830
 hair on the face and then if they want 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.320
 make a tutorial as more detailed 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.420

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.540
 see me the comments and with pleasure what 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.540
 I will do 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.700
 The truth is that I do not do much for myself 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.380
 hair just brush it one more time and 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.610
 I put a little oil so that it 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.610
 see more luminous 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.310
 in my school uniform use but the 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.829
 truth is that I'm not going to show you my 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.540
 uniform there are very rare people in the 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:05.150
 internet so I'm just going to go to 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.099
 pretend not to use and well that's me 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.159

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:13.010
 edition and I'm wearing a blouse of 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:14.389
 pacsa and a branding skirt I forget 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.989

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:20.449
 super comfortable and believe it or not I 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.250
 I make my canvas and I'm an expert 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:25.539
 it's usually a little more undone than 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.539
 what you can see right now 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.439
 at the end of my bed again he entered 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.960

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:39.969
