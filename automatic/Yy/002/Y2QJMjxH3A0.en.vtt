00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hi girls and guys how are you 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.370
 Welcome to the new day and in today's 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.140
 let's continue with the theme that 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.269
 we started on Monday on the blog that was 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.769
 special the eyes of the one who sounded and everything 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.170
 what they give of themselves the eyes included me 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.089
 I'm seeing this tattoo that I have here 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.830
 and you think it's real or it's false 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.180
 well it 's a real tattoo that 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.310
 It also goes on the topic I am from 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.140
 true not false that you are also on the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.939
 good eye theme I'll leave for the 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.710
 link of the brand that gave it to me clarifies 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.150
 that has some very funny tattoos of 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.920
 done we have treated the whole family 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.650
 we are going to act of all good 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.050
 I will tell you without more today we are going to do 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.100
 a special about that bag of 15 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.880
 let's start with the materials 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.880
 we need 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.989
 we are going to need a bag in which 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.520
 let's draw that eye some pebbles and 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.440
 paint what we're going to do basically 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.239
 it's about this little bag that is a little bag 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.700
 A canvas fabric is easier for 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.379
 paint I will do with the help of a 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.790
 brush and following these drawings the 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.949
 designs of the eyes that I will leave you for 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.170
 here as a reference today in the first place 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.550
 to paint in what is the eye first thing 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.840
 We are going to decide how we are going to 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.810
 make that design and for that I'm going to 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.400
 place here over the bag and I'll 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.229
 to take them all for certain that he has the 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.550
 bag to make it as flat as possible 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.680
 if I had a filling moments too 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.420
 take it off then a first one I'm going to 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.479
 put these little stones that are the 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.780
 that are going to imitate that kind of sparks 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.979
 not that it comes out at the top and the 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.300
 truth is that it gives a lot of play is 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.830
 spiritist you can find them in 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.440
 wonderland sanz you already know that I have a 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.930
 stone kit then you put them like this 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.580
 to calculate more or less how it's going to be 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.619
 the eye that we are going to draw here is not 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.390
 so much to prevent it from happening to the other 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.729
 side let's put a sheet of paper 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.560
 that we are going to put it in this bag just 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.700
 between you know how I'm doing I think 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.020
 that you have not seen what was 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.190
 doing but good done the same as 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.590
 I have previously created first 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.689
 a line like this paragraph line 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.759
 corresponds to the paragraph of the eye is more 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.250
 chubby that this first line is 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.009
 just the eyebrow line and the 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.750
 I'm doing a little thicker 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.790
 giving small touches 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.370
 with this brush that is a brush as I have 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.250
 said pixelated that has thus pum has 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.380
 a little bit like torn we say before 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.420
 let's first that first line that 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.330
 is the one that will guide us 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.560
 let's do it for example and that 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.560
 close here in the sea 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.720
 with again we are going to turn a little bit 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.450
 so we can this simpler let's go 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.650
 giving them small taps we collect 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.040
 a little more paint and we're going to 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.989
 do the same in this other side 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.849
 we make a small line that's how 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.519
 this eye is staying and now comes a 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:37.340
 part that is no less complicated that is 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.870
 the one to create the iris of the eye then 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.269
 let's do the same with the brush 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.549
 with the brush means we're going to create 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.280
 that eye shape starting for example 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:49.250
 from here we are going to make that first line 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:52.069
 very carefully and here is another line 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.109
 what are we going to do like this 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.629
 up to the top we will start to fill 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.280
 that eye once we have the eye already 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.959
 painted finished I'm going to add those 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.969
 little droplets that you have like in the 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.849
 part below those little tear dots 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:07.459
 I do not know what to call them really is an eye 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.170
 a little abstract the one that draws us that 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.180
 did but well let's do it as well as 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.189
 a kind of tear drops once 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.780
 we have painted the eye what we are going to 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:16.549
 do is start to get those 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.840
 small pebbles before you start 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.280
 I recommend you to put them 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.980
 this situation and with the help of a chalk 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.689
 marquis is the place where they go because 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.819
 then the and I tell you the truth to sew 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:27.709
 you are going to have to lift the bag and 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.299
 then you will not be able to maintain them and 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.819
 these pieces come with two little holes 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:34.040
 one and two and here two others when the 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.750
 things instead of in a straight line this 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.699
 I want to pass it through here and return it to 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.439
 another side and the one on top so you have to 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:41.030
 cross it from the top to the bottom and from 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:42.409
 down to the top if it's not going to be almost 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.060
 as impossible then because I carry a 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.829
 trying, I hope you understand 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.469
 I score a hole above the 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:50.659
 needle and I take them out not by the one who is 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:53.180
 parallel to its height but by the 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:54.590
 from below you see the bottom one but 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.540
 here you can see how I'm staying 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.400
 this cheese eye 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.110
 the crystallites up down the paint 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.540
 and mentally do not doubt it maybe 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.519
 but I'm afraid to spoil everything 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.689
 a few small strokes of white 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.760
 up here 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:09.530
 chin chin chin chin to make it more 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.170
 original that I do I dare not dare 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.170
 I do it it will be a chapucilla come I'll 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.970
 do it and if they rise we're going to do 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.410
 that I think I can give you a 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.120
 original touch we are going to catch you we are going to 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.850
 make small little ones 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.910
 very small touches so as not to force it 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.810
 here for example 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:31.360
 well just like some triangles 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:34.950
 that you think one here and for example 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.950
 let's give another one here 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:42.660
 as well as if it were a triangular 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.250
 well now we have put an end to 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.530
 this day and as you see here we have 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.630
 our little purse with the air set 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.010
 the eye in the style of which I hope you 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.470
 have already liked it is very simple 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.240
 you always need a bag 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.890
 paintings and some pebbles to decorate 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.380
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.890
 in the next video until next time 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.890
 I rest up
