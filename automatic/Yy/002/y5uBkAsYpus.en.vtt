know<00:01:01.920> logically<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.850> course<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:04.260> first<00:01:04.500> fight

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830

in which he did win and Timothy Bradley

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.740 
in which he did win and Timothy Bradley
was<00:01:08.720> running<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.380> Bell<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.920> guess<00:01:11.580> it's<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:12.510> sort

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
was running the Bell I guess it's a sort

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.859 
was running the Bell I guess it's a sort
of<00:01:12.810> mad<00:01:13.080> karma<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.490> way<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.600> was

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
of mad karma in a way so this it was

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.679 
of mad karma in a way so this it was
never<00:01:16.080> going<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.380> hand<00:01:16.680> them<00:01:16.979> Bradley<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
never going to hand them Bradley the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.929 
never going to hand them Bradley the
bell<00:01:18.930> he<00:01:19.320> his<00:01:19.650> only<00:01:19.920> chance<00:01:20.130> really<00:01:20.580> was<00:01:20.759> to

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
bell he his only chance really was to

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.810 
bell he his only chance really was to
knock<00:01:21.119> out<00:01:21.330> back<00:01:22.110> here<00:01:22.320> but<00:01:23.159> anyway<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.670> was<00:01:23.790> a

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
knock out back here but anyway it was a

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.499

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
know I hate on the brother he did well I

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.560 
know I hate on the brother he did well I
think<00:01:39.000> he's<00:01:40.009> on<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.250> slide<00:01:41.579> but<00:01:42.299> that's<00:01:42.479> just

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
think he's on the slide but that's just

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.810 
think he's on the slide but that's just
my<00:01:42.780> personal<00:01:43.290> thing<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.369> don't<00:01:44.579> think<00:01:44.729> he's

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
my personal thing I don't think he's

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.780

badly<00:01:45.149> badly<00:01:45.540> on<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.990> slide<00:01:46.290> but<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.829> think<00:01:47.640> if

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
badly badly on the slide but I think if

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.580 
badly badly on the slide but I think if
he<00:01:48.000> was<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.360> fight<00:01:48.600> mayweather<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.439> would

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
he was to fight mayweather that would

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.539 
he was to fight mayweather that would
possibly<00:01:49.920> be<00:01:50.520> his<00:01:51.060> last<00:01:51.329> fight<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:52.159> a<00:01:53.159> boxing

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
possibly be his last fight in a boxing

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.270 
possibly be his last fight in a boxing
ring<00:01:53.610> at<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.390> level<00:01:54.659> anyway

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
watch it obviously I watched it a couple

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.080 
watch it obviously I watched it a couple
of<00:03:21.709> times<00:03:21.769> I<00:03:22.130> watched<00:03:22.340> a<00:03:22.459> group<00:03:22.640> without<00:03:22.880> a

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
of times I watched a group without a

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.319 
of times I watched a group without a
sound<00:03:23.480> and<00:03:23.720> I<00:03:23.840> was<00:03:24.140> saying<00:03:24.410> I<00:03:25.340> could<00:03:26.000> see<00:03:26.150> where

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
sound and I was saying I could see where

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.500 
sound and I was saying I could see where
people<00:03:26.480> sort<00:03:27.079> of<00:03:27.430> make<00:03:28.430> a<00:03:28.459> case<00:03:28.790> for<00:03:28.819> Bradley

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
people sort of make a case for Bradley

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.069 
people sort of make a case for Bradley
probably<00:03:29.989> nicking<00:03:30.410> it<00:03:31.690> by<00:03:32.690> a<00:03:32.720> couple<00:03:32.750> of

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
probably nicking it by a couple of

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.430 
probably nicking it by a couple of
points<00:03:33.500> but<00:03:33.709> I<00:03:34.010> think<00:03:34.910> Manny<00:03:35.600> Pacquiao<00:03:36.079> was

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
points but I think Manny Pacquiao was

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.890 
points but I think Manny Pacquiao was
just<00:03:37.340> finished<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:38.000> strip<00:03:38.329> the<00:03:38.420> stronger<00:03:38.870> of

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
the two in some of the key rounds and

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.289 
the two in some of the key rounds and
that's<00:03:44.180> it<00:03:44.420> basically<00:03:44.660> you<00:03:45.530> know<00:03:46.120> it<00:03:47.120> was<00:03:47.269> a

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
that's it basically you know it was a

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.210 
that's it basically you know it was a
good<00:03:47.540> flight<00:03:47.840> we<00:03:48.230> were<00:03:48.350> treated<00:03:48.769> to<00:03:48.769> it<00:03:49.040> I

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
good flight we were treated to it I

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.780 
good flight we were treated to it I
don't<00:03:49.700> want<00:03:49.819> to<00:03:49.880> see<00:03:50.060> a<00:03:50.090> third<00:03:51.079> fight<00:03:51.790> between
