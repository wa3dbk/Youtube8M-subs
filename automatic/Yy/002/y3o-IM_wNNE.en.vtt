hey there guys this is the new mo you
haul<00:00:02.429> on<00:00:02.669> in<00:00:02.939> it's<00:00:03.360> pretty<00:00:03.780> good<00:00:04.200> so<00:00:05.130> this<00:00:05.250> is

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
haul on in it's pretty good so this is

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.010 
haul on in it's pretty good so this is
the<00:00:05.490> latest<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:05.970> greatest<00:00:06.180> three<00:00:06.540> by<00:00:06.720> three

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
the latest and greatest three by three

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.830 
the latest and greatest three by three
released<00:00:07.379> from<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.859> mo<00:00:08.040> you<00:00:08.099> company<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.030> it

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
released from the mo you company and it

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.620 
released from the mo you company and it
is<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.260> way<00:00:10.469> long<00:00:10.650> version<00:00:11.040> 3<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:12.330> think

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
is the way long version 3 and I think

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.770 
is the way long version 3 and I think
you'll<00:00:12.780> find<00:00:13.080> that<00:00:13.290> it<00:00:13.440> has<00:00:13.620> some<00:00:14.009> using

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
you'll find that it has some using

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.630 
you'll find that it has some using
similarities<00:00:15.780> in<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.080> as<00:00:16.260> well<00:00:16.340> this<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.460> what

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
similarities in it as well this is what

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.340 
similarities in it as well this is what
the<00:00:17.730> pieces<00:00:18.180> look<00:00:18.359> like<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.750> Walla<00:00:18.990> long<00:00:19.199> is

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
the pieces look like the Walla long is

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.019 
the pieces look like the Walla long is
directly<00:00:19.740> in<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.010> middle<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.670> can<00:00:20.789> see<00:00:20.970> it

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
directly in the middle you can see it

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.910 
directly in the middle you can see it
has<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.359> open<00:00:21.750> corner<00:00:22.109> design<00:00:22.380> like<00:00:22.769> the

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
has the open corner design like the

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.759 
has the open corner design like the
Ewing<00:00:23.369> here<00:00:23.580> on<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.850> right<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:25.050> edge<00:00:25.230> is

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
Ewing here on the right and the edge is

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.970 
Ewing here on the right and the edge is
very<00:00:26.699> similar<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.510> second<00:00:28.410> version<00:00:28.590> of

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
very similar to the second version of

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.490 
very similar to the second version of
the<00:00:29.130> way<00:00:29.250> long<00:00:29.460> which<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.210> left<00:00:30.500> it

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
the way long which is on the left it

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.440 
the way long which is on the left it
doesn't<00:00:32.040> have<00:00:32.189> nearly<00:00:32.489> as<00:00:32.700> blocky<00:00:33.000> as<00:00:33.239> of

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
doesn't have nearly as blocky as of

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.450 
doesn't have nearly as blocky as of
design<00:00:33.899> with<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.350> using<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.070> also<00:00:35.219> has

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
design with the using and it also has

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.639 
design with the using and it also has
the<00:00:35.940> three-piece<00:00:36.570> corner<00:00:36.930> design<00:00:37.140> which<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.620> a

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
the three-piece corner design which is a

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.490 
the three-piece corner design which is a
lot<00:00:37.890> better<00:00:38.239> they<00:00:39.239> did<00:00:39.420> make<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.660> corner

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
lot better they did make the corner

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.060 
lot better they did make the corner
stock<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:41.129> bit<00:00:41.370> thicker<00:00:41.730> which<00:00:42.469> helps<00:00:43.469> with<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
stock a bit thicker which helps with the

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.540 
stock a bit thicker which helps with the
corner<00:00:44.610> twisted<00:00:45.270> problem<00:00:46.219> they<00:00:47.219> gave<00:00:47.399> the

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
corner twisted problem they gave the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.389 
corner twisted problem they gave the
edge<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:48.000> bit<00:00:48.030> more<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.629> curviness<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.129> as

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
edge a bit more of a curviness to it as

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.150 
edge a bit more of a curviness to it as
opposed<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.570> more<00:00:52.140> straight<00:00:52.620> versions

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
opposed to the more straight versions

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.090 
opposed to the more straight versions
that<00:00:53.399> they've<00:00:53.610> been<00:00:53.910> going<00:00:54.360> with<00:00:54.660> before

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
that they've been going with before

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.010 
that they've been going with before
returning<00:00:56.100> on<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:57.059> little<00:00:57.480> bit<00:00:57.690> on<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
returning on it is a little bit on the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.200 
returning on it is a little bit on the
fast<00:00:58.320> side<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.920> was<00:00:59.160> uncontrollable<00:00:59.850> at

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
fast side and was uncontrollable at

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.490 
fast side and was uncontrollable at
first<00:01:00.449> after<00:01:00.719> added<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.140> little<00:01:01.289> bit<00:01:01.410> of

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
first after added a little bit of

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.039 
first after added a little bit of
Education<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.219> was<00:01:02.399> fine<00:01:02.760> though<00:01:03.049> all

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
Education that was fine though all

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.200 
Education that was fine though all
around<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.619> like<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.220> turning<00:01:05.430> style<00:01:05.850> very

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
around I like the turning style very

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.469 
around I like the turning style very
much<00:01:06.450> on<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:07.880> found<00:01:08.880> for<00:01:09.119> one-handed

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
much on it I found for one-handed

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.240 
much on it I found for one-handed
solving<00:01:09.960> even<00:01:10.229> though<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.500> bigger<00:01:10.830> than<00:01:11.040> my

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
solving even though it is bigger than my

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.429 
solving even though it is bigger than my
main<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.850> can<00:01:12.420> still<00:01:12.659> control<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.200> pretty

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
main I can still control it pretty

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.719 
main I can still control it pretty
decently<00:01:15.799> the<00:01:16.799> quarter<00:01:17.100> cutting<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.520> this

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
decently the quarter cutting on this

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.630 
decently the quarter cutting on this
with<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.270> open<00:01:18.659> hole<00:01:18.960> design<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.650> pretty<00:01:20.400> nice

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
with the open hole design is pretty nice

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.350 
with the open hole design is pretty nice
does<00:01:21.210> quite<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.840> bit<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.409> reverse<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.729> good<00:01:24.240> as

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
does quite a bit and reverse is good as

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.149 
does quite a bit and reverse is good as
well<00:01:24.390> because<00:01:24.840> it's<00:01:25.020> got<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.680> curved

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
well because it's got the curved

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.020 
well because it's got the curved
underneath<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.750> open<00:01:28.320> part<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.040> helps<00:01:29.880> it

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
underneath the open part so it helps it

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.060 
underneath the open part so it helps it
to<00:01:30.240> do<00:01:30.390> better<00:01:30.689> reverse<00:01:31.079> corner-cutting<00:01:31.619> then

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
to do better reverse corner-cutting then

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.520 
to do better reverse corner-cutting then
the<00:01:32.189> yu<00:01:32.369> yang<00:01:32.670> does<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.270> think<00:01:34.110> with<00:01:34.259> all<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
the yu yang does I think with all the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.620 
the yu yang does I think with all the
tribes<00:01:34.799> mo<00:01:35.070> has<00:01:35.400> taken<00:01:35.850> at<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.030> similar<00:01:36.450> design

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
tribes mo has taken at a similar design

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.390 
tribes mo has taken at a similar design
service<00:01:37.229> whether<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.650> be<00:01:37.799> with<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.100> two

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
service whether it be with the two

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.670 
service whether it be with the two
versions<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.939> way<00:01:39.090> lungs<00:01:39.329> or<00:01:39.600> how<00:01:39.780> long<00:01:40.020> they

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
versions of way lungs or how long they

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.080 
versions of way lungs or how long they
really<00:01:40.950> nailed<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.340> with<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.610> one<00:01:41.670> and

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
really nailed it with this one and

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.789 
really nailed it with this one and
there's<00:01:42.299> not<00:01:42.509> too<00:01:42.750> much<00:01:42.899> they're<00:01:43.200> going<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.649> be

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
there's not too much they're going to be

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.100 
there's not too much they're going to be
able<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.250> improve<00:01:44.579> after<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.270> think<00:01:45.540> you

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
able to improve after this I think you

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.109 
able to improve after this I think you
can<00:01:46.290> get<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:46.530> cubic<00:01:46.860> use<00:01:47.130> your<00:01:47.340> speed<00:01:47.549> comet

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
can get this cubic use your speed comet

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.789 
can get this cubic use your speed comet
