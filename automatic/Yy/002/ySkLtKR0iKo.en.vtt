concealment big mistake on day ticket

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:53.860 
concealment big mistake on day ticket
fisheries<00:00:52.039> is<00:00:52.190> that<00:00:52.940> the<00:00:53.030> lying<00:00:53.210> concealment

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
fisheries is that the lying concealment

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.569 
fisheries is that the lying concealment
is<00:00:54.020> not<00:00:54.320> really<00:00:54.590> for<00:00:54.770> about<00:00:54.800> at<00:00:55.160> all<00:00:55.340> and

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
is not really for about at all and

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:56.979 
is not really for about at all and
people<00:00:55.820> are<00:00:56.030> fishing<00:00:56.149> with<00:00:56.300> either<00:00:56.570> slack

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
people are fishing with either slack

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.439 
people are fishing with either slack
lines<00:00:58.000> tight<00:00:59.000> lines<00:00:59.329> or<00:01:00.879> semi<00:01:01.879> slack<00:01:02.180> lines

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
lines tight lines or semi slack lines

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.570 
lines tight lines or semi slack lines
but<00:01:02.930> no<00:01:03.079> one's<00:01:03.320> really<00:01:03.410> pinning<00:01:04.070> the<00:01:04.399> line

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
but no one's really pinning the line

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.520 
but no one's really pinning the line
down<00:01:04.910> there<00:01:05.239> we<00:01:05.390> know<00:01:05.539> that<00:01:05.720> with<00:01:05.840> tungsten

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
down there we know that with tungsten

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.120 
down there we know that with tungsten
tubing<00:01:07.190> this<00:01:07.820> part<00:01:08.119> of<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.300> line<00:01:08.770> it's<00:01:09.770> down

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
tubing this part of the line it's down

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.559 
tubing this part of the line it's down
so<00:01:10.819> the<00:01:10.940> last<00:01:11.119> sort<00:01:11.420> of<00:01:11.479> 1820<00:01:12.470> inches<00:01:12.590> is<00:01:12.920> down

00:01:13.559 --> 00:01:13.569 
so the last sort of 1820 inches is down

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:15.699 
so the last sort of 1820 inches is down
what<00:01:14.569> we're<00:01:14.660> going<00:01:14.780> to<00:01:14.840> show<00:01:14.990> you<00:01:15.050> now<00:01:15.289> is<00:01:15.649> how

00:01:15.699 --> 00:01:15.709 
what we're going to show you now is how

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:18.040 
what we're going to show you now is how
to<00:01:15.979> conceal<00:01:16.520> this<00:01:16.729> line<00:01:17.000> and<00:01:17.420> guarantee<00:01:17.630> that

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
to conceal this line and guarantee that

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.760 
to conceal this line and guarantee that
this<00:01:18.200> is<00:01:18.380> sinking<00:01:18.890> and<00:01:19.990> undetectable<00:01:20.990> so<00:01:21.229> into

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
this is sinking and undetectable so into

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.980 
this is sinking and undetectable so into
the<00:01:21.860> little<00:01:22.069> tackle<00:01:22.340> bag<00:01:22.490> and<00:01:22.940> we've<00:01:23.539> got<00:01:23.720> a

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
the little tackle bag and we've got a

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.309 
the little tackle bag and we've got a
heavy<00:01:24.860> metal

00:01:26.309 --> 00:01:26.319 
heavy metal

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:30.100 
heavy metal
unlike<00:01:27.319> other<00:01:27.590> putties<00:01:28.270> it's<00:01:29.270> not<00:01:29.539> shiny

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
unlike other putties it's not shiny

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.949 
unlike other putties it's not shiny
it's<00:01:30.890> full<00:01:31.160> of<00:01:31.190> tungsten<00:01:31.550> and<00:01:32.300> it's<00:01:32.509> very<00:01:32.780> very

00:01:32.949 --> 00:01:32.959 
it's full of tungsten and it's very very

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:33.839 
it's full of tungsten and it's very very
heavy

00:01:33.839 --> 00:01:33.849 
heavy

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:37.839 
heavy
it's<00:01:34.849> the<00:01:35.060> plug<00:01:35.649> put<00:01:36.649> that<00:01:36.800> back<00:01:37.039> and<00:01:37.610> what<00:01:37.759> we

00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:37.849 
it's the plug put that back and what we

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:40.240 
it's the plug put that back and what we
do<00:01:37.970> is<00:01:38.660> we<00:01:38.840> just<00:01:39.050> get<00:01:39.229> the<00:01:39.319> heavy<00:01:39.470> metal<00:01:39.860> and

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
do is we just get the heavy metal and

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.710 
do is we just get the heavy metal and
you<00:01:40.340> have<00:01:40.489> to<00:01:40.610> work<00:01:40.789> with<00:01:41.000> it<00:01:41.149> so<00:01:41.330> we're

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
you have to work with it so we're

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.529 
you have to work with it so we're
putting<00:01:42.380> it<00:01:42.560> between<00:01:42.800> our<00:01:43.039> fingers<00:01:43.280> and<00:01:44.179> we're

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
putting it between our fingers and we're

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.930 
putting it between our fingers and we're
pulling<00:01:44.780> it<00:01:45.020> apart<00:01:45.140> and<00:01:45.649> what<00:01:45.830> that<00:01:45.979> does<00:01:46.190> it's

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
pulling it apart and what that does it's

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.690 
pulling it apart and what that does it's
like<00:01:47.149> a<00:01:47.590> explosion<00:01:48.590> of<00:01:48.890> tungsten<00:01:49.130> in<00:01:49.520> there

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
like a explosion of tungsten in there

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.180 
like a explosion of tungsten in there
and<00:01:49.910> they're<00:01:50.690> moving<00:01:51.080> it<00:01:51.200> around<00:01:51.319> and<00:01:51.800> it's

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
and they're moving it around and it's

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.249 
and they're moving it around and it's
making<00:01:52.399> it<00:01:52.640> a<00:01:52.670> little<00:01:52.849> bit<00:01:53.060> sticky<00:01:53.450> so<00:01:54.170> the

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
making it a little bit sticky so the

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.729 
making it a little bit sticky so the
more<00:01:54.440> you<00:01:54.590> work<00:01:54.800> it<00:01:55.099> the<00:01:55.459> more<00:01:55.670> sticky<00:01:56.119> it<00:01:56.239> gets

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:56.739 
more you work it the more sticky it gets

00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:59.109 
more you work it the more sticky it gets
and<00:01:57.739> what<00:01:57.890> we<00:01:57.950> do<00:01:58.069> is<00:01:58.369> we<00:01:58.580> break<00:01:58.759> a<00:01:58.789> little<00:01:59.000> bit

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
and what we do is we break a little bit

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.050 
and what we do is we break a little bit
off<00:01:59.830> stick<00:02:00.830> that<00:02:00.860> on<00:02:01.039> a<00:02:01.160> plastic<00:02:01.610> box<00:02:01.789> so<00:02:01.970> we

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
off stick that on a plastic box so we

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.900 
off stick that on a plastic box so we
don't<00:02:02.090> lose<00:02:02.420> it<00:02:03.039> and<00:02:04.039> then<00:02:04.099> we<00:02:04.399> get<00:02:04.520> a<00:02:04.580> little

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
don't lose it and then we get a little

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.240 
don't lose it and then we get a little
bit<00:02:05.000> of<00:02:05.060> putty<00:02:05.410> we<00:02:06.410> come<00:02:06.619> up<00:02:06.739> a<00:02:06.830> few<00:02:07.069> inches

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
bit of putty we come up a few inches

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.900 
bit of putty we come up a few inches
from<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:08.780> tubing<00:02:09.200> and<00:02:09.410> we<00:02:10.399> just<00:02:10.610> press<00:02:10.789> it

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
from the tubing and we just press it

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.140 
from the tubing and we just press it
onto<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.270> line<00:02:11.739> and<00:02:12.739> in<00:02:13.010> a<00:02:13.070> motion<00:02:13.520> we<00:02:13.940> just

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
onto the line and in a motion we just

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.070 
onto the line and in a motion we just
roll<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.600> onto<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:15.410> line<00:02:15.620> like<00:02:15.890> that

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
roll it onto the line like that

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.490 
roll it onto the line like that
now<00:02:17.260> this<00:02:17.620> is<00:02:17.740> where<00:02:17.950> we<00:02:18.070> get<00:02:18.220> creative<00:02:19.500> we

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
now this is where we get creative we

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.140 
now this is where we get creative we
just<00:02:20.740> work<00:02:21.070> that<00:02:21.760> party<00:02:22.300> on<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.710> the<00:02:23.800> line<00:02:24.150> and

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
just work that party on to the line and

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.030 
just work that party on to the line and
as<00:02:25.420> you<00:02:25.510> can<00:02:25.630> see<00:02:25.690> it's<00:02:25.960> starting<00:02:26.170> now<00:02:26.560> to

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
as you can see it's starting now to

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.840 
as you can see it's starting now to
stretch<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:27.700> expand<00:02:28.600> and<00:02:29.190> it's<00:02:30.190> clinging<00:02:30.670> to

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
stretch and expand and it's clinging to

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.760 
stretch and expand and it's clinging to
the<00:02:30.940> line<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.900> reason<00:02:32.200> it<00:02:32.320> clings<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.740> the

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
the line the reason it clings to the

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.210 
the line the reason it clings to the
line<00:02:33.010> is<00:02:33.310> that<00:02:34.120> this<00:02:34.300> is<00:02:34.510> just<00:02:34.860> such<00:02:35.860> a<00:02:35.890> good

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
line is that this is just such a good

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.390 
line is that this is just such a good
putty<00:02:36.520> and<00:02:37.480> it<00:02:37.690> doesn't<00:02:38.080> slide<00:02:38.410> up<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.220> line

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
putty and it doesn't slide up the line

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.680 
putty and it doesn't slide up the line
at<00:02:39.640> all<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:40.600> here<00:02:40.810> we<00:02:40.930> are<00:02:41.670> as<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:43.180> can<00:02:43.510> see

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
at all and here we are as you can see

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:44.850 
at all and here we are as you can see
it's<00:02:43.930> as<00:02:44.080> easy<00:02:44.230> as<00:02:44.500> that

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
it's as easy as that

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.010 
it's as easy as that
and<00:02:45.040> suddenly<00:02:45.430> we've<00:02:45.970> applied<00:02:46.270> a<00:02:46.330> very<00:02:46.690> thin

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
and suddenly we've applied a very thin

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.250 
and suddenly we've applied a very thin
coating<00:02:47.620> of<00:02:47.800> heavy<00:02:48.460> metal<00:02:48.820> to<00:02:49.240> our<00:02:49.360> line<00:02:49.540> then

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
coating of heavy metal to our line then

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.230 
coating of heavy metal to our line then
we<00:02:50.350> just<00:02:50.530> pull<00:02:50.770> it<00:02:51.510> off<00:02:52.590> like<00:02:53.590> that<00:02:53.830> and<00:02:54.310> now<00:02:54.580> we

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
we just pull it off like that and now we

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.270 
we just pull it off like that and now we
can<00:02:55.420> work<00:02:55.630> it<00:02:55.870> down<00:02:56.110> and<00:02:56.560> we<00:02:56.680> can<00:02:56.709> virtually

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
can work it down and we can virtually

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.670 
can work it down and we can virtually
get<00:02:57.490> it<00:02:57.640> so<00:02:58.360> it's<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:58.630> spinners<00:02:59.080> align<00:02:59.410> it's

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
get it so it's a spinners align it's

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.980 
get it so it's a spinners align it's
just<00:02:59.890> sort<00:03:00.100> of<00:03:00.190> coating<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.850> line<00:03:01.030> and<00:03:01.870> what

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
just sort of coating the line and what

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.660 
just sort of coating the line and what
that's<00:03:02.140> going<00:03:02.320> to<00:03:02.380> do<00:03:02.530> is<00:03:03.130> that's<00:03:03.280> going<00:03:03.490> to<00:03:03.580> go

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
that's going to do is that's going to go

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.620 
that's going to do is that's going to go
into<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.060> light<00:03:04.240> onto<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:05.230> bottom<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:05.890> sink

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
into the light onto the bottom and sink

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.510 
into the light onto the bottom and sink
and<00:03:07.630> we're<00:03:07.720> going<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:07.930> repeat<00:03:08.230> this<00:03:08.380> process

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
and we're going to repeat this process

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.220 
and we're going to repeat this process
because<00:03:09.520> we<00:03:09.610> want<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:09.820> sink<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.630> last<00:03:10.870> few

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
because we want to sink the last few

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.620 
because we want to sink the last few
yards<00:03:11.560> of<00:03:11.950> line<00:03:12.070> not<00:03:12.370> just<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.940> 20<00:03:13.270> inches

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
yards of line not just the 20 inches

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:20.130 
yards of line not just the 20 inches
with<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:15.090> party<00:03:16.090> with<00:03:16.570> the<00:03:16.720> GB<00:03:17.260> model<00:03:19.140> again

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
with the party with the GB model again

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.220 
with the party with the GB model again
we've<00:03:20.500> put<00:03:20.709> it<00:03:20.800> on

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
we've put it on

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.020 
we've put it on
we<00:03:23.230> then<00:03:23.380> roll<00:03:23.620> it<00:03:23.890> so<00:03:24.459> there<00:03:24.610> it<00:03:24.730> is<00:03:24.850> it's

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
we then roll it so there it is it's

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.800 
we then roll it so there it is it's
secure<00:03:25.390> now

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
secure now

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.840 
secure now
and<00:03:26.200> now<00:03:26.350> again<00:03:26.500> we<00:03:26.920> work<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:27.910> process<00:03:29.850> there

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
and now again we work the process there

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:31.470 
and now again we work the process there
we<00:03:31.060> go

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
we go

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.990 
we go
we're<00:03:31.720> just<00:03:31.930> working<00:03:32.830> it<00:03:33.250> keeping<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:33.760> line

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
we're just working it keeping the line

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.020 
we're just working it keeping the line
tight<00:03:37.739> and<00:03:38.739> this<00:03:38.860> time<00:03:39.160> I<00:03:39.430> kind<00:03:39.730> of<00:03:39.820> put<00:03:40.000> a

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
tight and this time I kind of put a

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.290 
tight and this time I kind of put a
little<00:03:40.209> bit<00:03:40.360> on<00:03:40.420> here<00:03:41.550> keeping<00:03:42.550> a<00:03:42.610> gap<00:03:42.820> between

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
little bit on here keeping a gap between

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.670 
little bit on here keeping a gap between
the<00:03:43.630> line<00:03:45.390> so<00:03:46.390> there<00:03:46.570> we<00:03:46.690> are<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:47.440> I've<00:03:47.650> a

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
the line so there we are and I've a

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.620 
the line so there we are and I've a
little<00:03:47.830> bit<00:03:48.450> on<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.930> line<00:03:51.300> so<00:03:52.300> that's<00:03:52.390> all

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
little bit on the line so that's all

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.420 
little bit on the line so that's all
gonna<00:03:52.810> night<00:03:53.080> now<00:03:53.410> life<00:03:53.650> left<00:03:53.920> you<00:03:54.130> didn't<00:03:54.310> get

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
gonna night now life left you didn't get

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.030 
gonna night now life left you didn't get
the<00:03:54.489> final<00:03:54.850> piece

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.949 

again<00:03:59.730> press<00:04:00.569> it<00:04:00.689> onto<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:01.019> line<00:04:02.780> secure<00:04:03.780> it

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
again press it onto the line secure it

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.399 
again press it onto the line secure it
to<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.170> line<00:04:04.409> and<00:04:04.680> now<00:04:05.250> we<00:04:05.310> work<00:04:05.670> it<00:04:06.170> onto<00:04:07.170> the

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:07.409 
to the line and now we work it onto the

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:16.340 
to the line and now we work it onto the
line<00:04:07.590> and<00:04:12.980> as<00:04:13.980> you<00:04:14.099> can<00:04:14.220> see<00:04:15.019> we're<00:04:16.019> stretching

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
line and as you can see we're stretching

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.930 
line and as you can see we're stretching
it<00:04:17.449> and<00:04:18.449> molding<00:04:18.930> it<00:04:19.549> all<00:04:20.549> around<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.299> line

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
it and molding it all around the line

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.879 
it and molding it all around the line
and<00:04:23.940> takes<00:04:24.270> a<00:04:24.419> few<00:04:24.630> minutes<00:04:24.870> it's<00:04:25.410> not<00:04:25.620> a<00:04:25.650> long

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
and takes a few minutes it's not a long

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.120 
and takes a few minutes it's not a long
process<00:04:26.510> but<00:04:27.510> the<00:04:27.990> extra<00:04:28.289> concealment<00:04:29.039> it

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
process but the extra concealment it

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.570 
process but the extra concealment it
gives<00:04:30.470> can<00:04:31.470> really<00:04:31.710> give<00:04:31.889> you<00:04:32.010> an<00:04:32.130> edge<00:04:32.250> on

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
gives can really give you an edge on

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.760 
gives can really give you an edge on
these<00:04:33.300> die<00:04:33.510> ticket<00:04:33.900> warts<00:04:34.229> that<00:04:34.289> are<00:04:34.440> totally

these die ticket warts that are totally

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.740 
these die ticket warts that are totally
underrated<00:04:35.039> by<00:04:35.610> many<00:04:35.850> anglers<00:04:36.240> because<00:04:36.630> they

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
underrated by many anglers because they

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.070 
underrated by many anglers because they
see<00:04:36.810> carp<00:04:37.350> anglers<00:04:37.740> every<00:04:38.669> single<00:04:39.180> die<00:04:39.419> all

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
see carp anglers every single die all

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.990 
see carp anglers every single die all
fish<00:04:40.410> in<00:04:40.440> different<00:04:40.979> styles<00:04:41.490> different

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
fish in different styles different

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.900 
fish in different styles different
tactics<00:04:42.720> and<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:42.990> fish<00:04:43.229> are<00:04:43.919> totally<00:04:44.460> totally

fistful<00:04:45.720> all<00:04:45.900> the<00:04:46.199> time<00:04:46.380> so<00:04:47.250> there<00:04:47.430> we've<00:04:47.580> got

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039 
fistful all the time so there we've got

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:53.090 
fistful all the time so there we've got
the<00:04:50.039> heavy<00:04:50.250> metal<00:04:50.610> applied<00:04:51.470> in<00:04:52.470> three<00:04:52.770> stages

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
the heavy metal applied in three stages

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.770 
the heavy metal applied in three stages
now<00:04:54.060> if<00:04:54.570> you<00:04:54.720> can<00:04:54.870> imagine<00:04:55.080> that<00:04:55.320> my<00:04:55.530> legs<00:04:56.750> at<00:04:57.750> a

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
now if you can imagine that my legs at a

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.159 
now if you can imagine that my legs at a
light<00:04:57.990> bottom<00:04:59.180> we<00:05:00.180> can<00:05:00.300> see<00:05:00.510> that<00:05:00.630> that<00:05:00.750> sinks

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
light bottom we can see that that sinks

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:06.560 
light bottom we can see that that sinks
we<00:05:01.380> know<00:05:01.530> that<00:05:03.440> we<00:05:04.440> then<00:05:05.120> do<00:05:06.120> that<00:05:06.300> with<00:05:06.479> the

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
we know that we then do that with the

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.050 
we know that we then do that with the
line<00:05:06.750> and<00:05:07.050> as<00:05:07.289> you<00:05:07.440> can<00:05:07.590> see<00:05:07.860> the<00:05:08.460> heavy<00:05:08.669> metal

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
line and as you can see the heavy metal

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.439 
line and as you can see the heavy metal
and<00:05:09.419> the<00:05:09.570> line<00:05:10.250> will<00:05:11.250> lie<00:05:11.430> on<00:05:11.460> the<00:05:11.669> bottom<00:05:11.940> like

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
and the line will lie on the bottom like

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:16.640 
and the line will lie on the bottom like
that<00:05:12.570> son<00:05:13.080> so<00:05:13.979> we've<00:05:14.789> added<00:05:14.940> another<00:05:15.530> sort<00:05:16.530> of

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
that son so we've added another sort of

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.150 
that son so we've added another sort of
foot<00:05:17.180> to<00:05:18.180> the<00:05:18.270> anti-tangle<00:05:18.660> tubing<00:05:19.110> now<00:05:19.530> the

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
foot to the anti-tangle tubing now the

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.790 
foot to the anti-tangle tubing now the
next<00:05:20.630> secret<00:05:21.630> tip<00:05:21.990> we're<00:05:22.260> going<00:05:22.289> to<00:05:22.440> give<00:05:22.620> you

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
is the leg clip 90% of anglers use the

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:32.320 
is the leg clip 90% of anglers use the
leg<00:05:28.320> clip<00:05:28.560> especially<00:05:29.370> on<00:05:29.460> day<00:05:29.639> ticket<00:05:30.060> waters

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
leg clip especially on day ticket waters

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.260 
leg clip especially on day ticket waters
so<00:05:33.330> we've<00:05:33.780> put<00:05:33.960> our<00:05:34.110> leg<00:05:34.260> clip<00:05:34.500> on<00:05:34.710> and<00:05:35.270> it

rubber there's the lid there's the

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.580 
rubber there's the lid there's the
tubing<00:05:46.370> now<00:05:47.370> on<00:05:47.849> many<00:05:48.090> died<00:05:48.240> ticket<00:05:48.599> was<00:05:48.780> the

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
tubing now on many died ticket was the

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.700 
tubing now on many died ticket was the
fish<00:05:49.800> see<00:05:50.039> this<00:05:50.250> day<00:05:50.669> in<00:05:50.880> day<00:05:51.210> out<00:05:51.500> they<00:05:52.500> pick

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
fish see this day in day out they pick

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.460 
fish see this day in day out they pick
up<00:05:52.860> the<00:05:52.949> bite<00:05:53.159> they<00:05:54.150> then<00:05:54.330> use<00:05:54.599> that<00:05:54.630> to<00:05:55.110> pivot

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
up the bite they then use that to pivot

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.279 
up the bite they then use that to pivot
and<00:05:55.830> we<00:05:56.310> know<00:05:56.550> and<00:05:56.940> we've<00:05:57.510> we've<00:05:57.870> discovered

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289 
and we know and we've we've discovered

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:01.040 
and we know and we've we've discovered
that<00:05:58.470> I<00:05:58.650> then<00:05:58.860> shed<00:05:59.820> the<00:05:59.970> hook<00:06:00.150> by<00:06:00.510> using<00:06:00.750> the

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
that I then shed the hook by using the

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.629 
that I then shed the hook by using the
lid<00:06:01.260> to<00:06:01.650> do<00:06:01.800> that<00:06:03.050> here's<00:06:04.050> the<00:06:04.199> trick<00:06:04.550> when<00:06:05.550> the

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 
lid to do that here's the trick when the

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:09.469 
lid to do that here's the trick when the
fish<00:06:05.789> picks<00:06:06.060> up<00:06:06.240> this<00:06:06.889> particular<00:06:07.889> bite

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 
fish picks up this particular bite

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:13.519 
fish picks up this particular bite
the<00:06:10.020> line<00:06:10.199> comes<00:06:10.559> out<00:06:12.199> because<00:06:13.199> what<00:06:13.379> we've

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:13.529 
the line comes out because what we've

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:15.140 
the line comes out because what we've
done<00:06:13.620> is<00:06:13.740> replace<00:06:14.189> the<00:06:14.340> size<00:06:14.580> eight<00:06:14.909> wings

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
done is replace the size eight wings

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.659 
done is replace the size eight wings
drivel<00:06:15.479> very<00:06:15.870> very<00:06:16.080> simply<00:06:16.409> with<00:06:17.009> a<00:06:17.039> size<00:06:17.279> 11

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669 
drivel very very simply with a size 11

wings shovel for those of you out there

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.890 
wings shovel for those of you out there
the<00:06:19.889> size<00:06:20.039> 11<00:06:20.249> ring<00:06:20.699> swivel<00:06:20.909> is<00:06:21.389> what<00:06:21.629> a<00:06:21.659> lot<00:06:21.870> of

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
the size 11 ring swivel is what a lot of

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.689 
the size 11 ring swivel is what a lot of
people<00:06:22.050> use<00:06:22.379> for<00:06:22.620> chod<00:06:23.189> rigs<00:06:23.430> on<00:06:23.610> the

so<00:06:24.930> by<00:06:25.080> scaling<00:06:25.680> down<00:06:25.830> the<00:06:26.009> size<00:06:26.249> of<00:06:26.610> the

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:26.969 
so by scaling down the size of the

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:31.189 
so by scaling down the size of the
swivel<00:06:27.650> we<00:06:28.650> then<00:06:28.830> allow<00:06:29.569> for<00:06:30.569> a<00:06:30.599> little<00:06:30.719> bit<00:06:31.050> of

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 
swivel we then allow for a little bit of

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:37.670 
swivel we then allow for a little bit of
running<00:06:32.449> tension<00:06:33.770> there<00:06:36.199> that<00:06:37.199> will<00:06:37.349> fold<00:06:37.559> a

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 
running tension there that will fold a

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.110 
running tension there that will fold a
car<00:06:37.889> so<00:06:38.430> there<00:06:38.580> you<00:06:38.669> go<00:06:38.819> two<00:06:39.689> really<00:06:40.259> easy
