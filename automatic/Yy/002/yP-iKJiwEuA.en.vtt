the motherboard so we'll go to the
camera<00:01:28.459> this<00:01:29.179> is<00:01:29.439> the<00:01:30.439> actual<00:01:30.950> face<00:01:31.520> of<00:01:31.549> it<00:01:31.999> it

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
camera this is the actual face of it it

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.760 
camera this is the actual face of it it
pops<00:01:32.810> off<00:01:33.079> with<00:01:33.380> these<00:01:33.560> little<00:01:34.090> clips<00:01:35.770> okay

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
pops off with these little clips okay

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.179 
pops off with these little clips okay
and<00:01:37.039> then<00:01:37.670> there<00:01:37.969> is<00:01:38.209> like<00:01:38.240> some<00:01:39.189> double-sided

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
and then there is like some double-sided

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.309 
and then there is like some double-sided
tape<00:01:40.399> in<00:01:40.849> there<00:01:41.090> which<00:01:41.689> you<00:01:42.049> might<00:01:42.259> think

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
tape in there which you might think

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:44.589 
tape in there which you might think
you're<00:01:42.679> going<00:01:42.829> to<00:01:42.889> break<00:01:43.069> something<00:01:43.130> but<00:01:43.880> if

00:01:44.589 --> 00:01:44.599 
you're going to break something but if

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:46.839 
you're going to break something but if
you<00:01:45.109> actually<00:01:45.319> look<00:01:45.560> at<00:01:45.889> the<00:01:46.009> camera<00:01:46.459> there's

00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:46.849 
you actually look at the camera there's

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:52.330 
you actually look at the camera there's
nothing<00:01:47.389> to<00:01:47.630> really<00:01:47.869> break<00:01:50.289> and<00:01:51.289> it's<00:01:51.979> kind<00:01:52.249> of

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
nothing to really break and it's kind of

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.169 
nothing to really break and it's kind of
still<00:01:52.639> damp<00:01:53.950> well<00:01:54.950> that's<00:01:55.490> probably<00:01:55.700> a<00:01:55.880> finger

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
still damp well that's probably a finger

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.389 
still damp well that's probably a finger
print<00:01:56.389> actually<00:01:56.599> and<00:01:57.049> then<00:01:57.590> there's<00:01:57.889> the<00:01:58.159> four

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
print actually and then there's the four

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.339 
print actually and then there's the four
screws<00:01:58.789> just<00:01:59.119> four<00:01:59.569> screws<00:02:00.189> be<00:02:01.189> careful<00:02:02.349> this

00:02:03.339 --> 00:02:03.349 
screws just four screws be careful this

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:06.519 
screws just four screws be careful this
thing<00:02:04.060> kind<00:02:05.060> of<00:02:05.149> moves<00:02:05.329> around<00:02:05.450> free<00:02:05.989> after

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:06.529 
thing kind of moves around free after

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:09.850 
thing kind of moves around free after
you<00:02:06.979> get<00:02:07.130> it<00:02:07.219> apart<00:02:07.549> you<00:02:07.909> can<00:02:08.090> kind<00:02:08.330> of<00:02:08.740> lift<00:02:09.740> it

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
you get it apart you can kind of lift it

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.640 
you get it apart you can kind of lift it
up<00:02:10.510> so<00:02:11.510> you<00:02:11.600> want<00:02:11.750> to<00:02:11.810> be<00:02:11.900> careful<00:02:12.170> with<00:02:12.380> that

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
up so you want to be careful with that

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.559 
up so you want to be careful with that
you<00:02:13.280> can

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
you can

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.119 
you can
kind<00:02:13.719> of<00:02:13.810> flop<00:02:14.049> it<00:02:14.200> around<00:02:14.379> it's<00:02:14.590> not<00:02:14.709> too<00:02:14.950> bad

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
kind of flop it around it's not too bad
