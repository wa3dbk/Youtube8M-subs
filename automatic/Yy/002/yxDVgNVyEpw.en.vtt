00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.170 
sad however there's nothing we can do
about<00:00:59.320> it<00:00:59.469> it's<00:01:00.190> because<00:01:00.520> of<00:01:00.610> the<00:01:00.699> shortages

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180

again<00:01:01.539> and<00:01:01.780> Samsung<00:01:02.379> saying<00:01:02.890> that<00:01:03.070> is<00:01:03.219> because

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
again and Samsung saying that is because

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.850 
again and Samsung saying that is because
of<00:01:03.670> last<00:01:04.000> minute<00:01:04.299> unprecedented<00:01:05.199> demand

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
of last minute unprecedented demand

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.919 
of last minute unprecedented demand
apparently<00:01:06.670> but<00:01:07.179> what<00:01:07.329> I<00:01:07.359> think<00:01:07.779> is<00:01:07.899> that

00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:07.929 
apparently but what I think is that

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:09.690 
apparently but what I think is that
they're<00:01:08.229> actually<00:01:08.619> favoring<00:01:09.249> the<00:01:09.279> US

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
they're actually favoring the US

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.330 
they're actually favoring the US
citizens<00:01:10.539> they're<00:01:10.719> actually<00:01:11.079> gonna<00:01:11.310> what<00:01:12.310> I

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
citizens they're actually gonna what I

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.889 
citizens they're actually gonna what I
think<00:01:12.700> is<00:01:12.880> just<00:01:13.060> what<00:01:13.270> I<00:01:13.299> think<00:01:13.569> is<00:01:13.719> that

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
think is just what I think is that

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:16.349 
think is just what I think is that
something's<00:01:14.469> just<00:01:15.039> shipping<00:01:15.490> as<00:01:15.670> much<00:01:15.909> fun<00:01:16.149> as

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:16.359 
something's just shipping as much fun as

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:18.809 
something's just shipping as much fun as
they<00:01:16.479> possibly<00:01:16.689> can<00:01:17.139> to<00:01:17.319> US<00:01:17.619> carriers<00:01:18.069> into

00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:18.819 
they possibly can to US carriers into

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:21.059 
they possibly can to US carriers into
the<00:01:19.029> USA<00:01:19.509> so<00:01:19.539> that<00:01:19.929> they<00:01:20.289> could<00:01:20.469> get<00:01:20.649> the<00:01:20.770> US

00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:21.069 
the USA so that they could get the US

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:23.279 
the USA so that they could get the US
market<00:01:21.310> tied<00:01:21.639> down<00:01:21.849> and<00:01:22.090> kind<00:01:22.869> of<00:01:23.020> do<00:01:23.170> the

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
market tied down and kind of do the

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:25.559 
market tied down and kind of do the
Canadian<00:01:23.709> market<00:01:23.829> stepper<00:01:24.490> and<00:01:24.700> after<00:01:25.450> that

00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:25.569 
Canadian market stepper and after that

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:28.169 
Canadian market stepper and after that
so<00:01:25.810> I<00:01:25.840> guess<00:01:26.079> that's<00:01:26.349> the<00:01:26.469> kind<00:01:27.099> of<00:01:27.189> what<00:01:28.029> they

00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:28.179 
so I guess that's the kind of what they

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:30.419 
so I guess that's the kind of what they
had<00:01:28.389> to<00:01:28.630> what<00:01:29.170> they<00:01:29.289> were<00:01:29.409> thinking<00:01:29.619> of<00:01:29.979> when

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
had to what they were thinking of when

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:31.949 
had to what they were thinking of when
they<00:01:30.520> were<00:01:30.579> making<00:01:30.729> this<00:01:30.969> in<00:01:31.149> this<00:01:31.569> decision

00:01:31.949 --> 00:01:31.959 
they were making this in this decision

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:34.289 
they were making this in this decision
obviously<00:01:32.579> doing<00:01:33.579> it<00:01:33.729> all<00:01:33.939> the<00:01:33.969> way<00:01:34.179> around

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
obviously doing it all the way around

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:35.730 
obviously doing it all the way around
won't<00:01:34.630> be<00:01:34.779> beneficial<00:01:35.349> to<00:01:35.380> them<00:01:35.590> because

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
won't be beneficial to them because

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.159 
won't be beneficial to them because
obviously<00:01:36.069> US<00:01:36.490> market<00:01:36.819> is<00:01:36.939> a<00:01:37.179> much<00:01:37.539> larger

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:38.169 
obviously US market is a much larger

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:40.709 
obviously US market is a much larger
than<00:01:38.319> the<00:01:38.439> Canadian<00:01:38.859> market<00:01:39.009> so<00:01:39.369> it<00:01:40.270> is<00:01:40.419> kind

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:40.719 
than the Canadian market so it is kind

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:42.330 
than the Canadian market so it is kind
of<00:01:40.779> fairly<00:01:41.049> sad<00:01:41.229> news<00:01:41.380> i<00:01:41.560> live<00:01:41.740> in<00:01:41.799> canada<00:01:41.979> too
