your<00:01:54.869> varial<00:01:55.289> kickflip<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.250> same<00:01:56.520> way<00:01:56.700> you

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
your varial kickflip is the same way you

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.270 
your varial kickflip is the same way you
catch<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.240> pop<00:01:57.479> shove-it<00:01:57.929> you<00:01:58.530> keep<00:01:58.740> your<00:01:58.920> front

foot<00:01:59.369> close<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.299> board<00:02:00.600> just<00:02:01.380> kind<00:02:01.619> of

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
foot close to the board just kind of

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.740 
foot close to the board just kind of
hovering<00:02:02.039> over<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.700> then<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.299> catch<00:02:03.569> it

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
hovering over it and then you catch it

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.080 
hovering over it and then you catch it
with<00:02:03.929> your<00:02:03.959> front<00:02:04.289> foot<00:02:04.440> and<00:02:04.909> then<00:02:05.909> obviously

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
with your front foot and then obviously

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.330 
with your front foot and then obviously
the<00:02:06.630> better<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:07.140> have<00:02:07.319> your<00:02:07.560> kick<00:02:07.799> flips<00:02:08.100> down

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
the better you have your kick flips down

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.729 
the better you have your kick flips down
the<00:02:09.060> easier<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.690> trick<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.080> going<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.319> be<00:02:10.470> for

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
the easier the trick is going to be for

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.460 
the easier the trick is going to be for
you<00:02:10.890> as<00:02:11.069> well<00:02:11.390> your<00:02:12.390> kick<00:02:12.569> flips<00:02:12.840> did<00:02:13.049> not<00:02:13.230> look

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
you as well your kick flips did not look

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.920 
you as well your kick flips did not look
bad<00:02:13.799> like<00:02:14.580> you're<00:02:14.880> flicking<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.450> quite<00:02:15.720> well

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
bad like you're flicking it quite well

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.140 
bad like you're flicking it quite well
you<00:02:16.500> could<00:02:16.709> work<00:02:16.920> on<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.250> catch<00:02:17.519> a<00:02:17.730> little<00:02:17.970> bit

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
you could work on the catch a little bit

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.570 
you could work on the catch a little bit
better<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:19.200> seems<00:02:19.470> like<00:02:19.680> on<00:02:19.890> all<00:02:20.130> of<00:02:20.459> the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
better it seems like on all of the

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.270 
better it seems like on all of the
tricks<00:02:20.910> your<00:02:21.299> catches<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:21.959> little<00:02:22.470> bit<00:02:22.680> lacking

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
tricks your catches a little bit lacking

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.030 
tricks your catches a little bit lacking
and<00:02:23.519> if<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.750> just<00:02:24.989> improve<00:02:25.380> catching<00:02:25.920> the

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
and if you just improve catching the

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.580 
and if you just improve catching the
board<00:02:26.340> which<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.299> can<00:02:27.450> practice<00:02:27.930> by<00:02:28.110> popping

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
board which you can practice by popping

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.289 
board which you can practice by popping
it<00:02:28.709> and<00:02:28.890> stepping<00:02:29.250> off<00:02:29.370> with<00:02:29.549> one<00:02:29.760> foot<00:02:29.790> I

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
it and stepping off with one foot I

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.380 
it and stepping off with one foot I
think<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:30.840> really<00:02:30.870> improve<00:02:31.739> it<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.239> mean<00:02:33.239> you

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
think that really improve it I mean you

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.420 
think that really improve it I mean you
don't<00:02:33.630> need<00:02:33.959> to<00:02:34.170> get<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.560> point<00:02:34.890> where

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
don't need to get to the point where

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.949 
don't need to get to the point where
you're<00:02:35.519> doing<00:02:35.790> kickflip<00:02:36.239> front<00:02:36.510> nose<00:02:36.690> grind

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
you're doing kickflip front nose grind

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.080 
you're doing kickflip front nose grind
nollie<00:02:37.140> flip-out<00:02:37.680> in<00:02:37.859> the<00:02:37.950> middle<00:02:38.220> but<00:02:38.910> that's

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
nollie flip-out in the middle but that's

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.140 
nollie flip-out in the middle but that's
fine<00:02:39.410> you're<00:02:40.410> getting<00:02:40.769> there<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:41.250> you<00:02:41.910> do

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
fine you're getting there and you do

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.610 
fine you're getting there and you do

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
have those tricks well enough to do

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.910 
have those tricks well enough to do
varial<00:02:44.280> kick<00:02:44.489> flips<00:02:44.760> which<00:02:45.420> is<00:02:45.600> good<00:02:45.810> this<00:02:46.739> is

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
varial kick flips which is good this is

varial kick flips which is good this is
the<00:02:47.100> full<00:02:47.370> lineup<00:02:47.880> of<00:02:48.239> tricks<00:02:48.570> that<00:02:48.750> I<00:02:48.840> suggest

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
the full lineup of tricks that I suggest

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.949 
the full lineup of tricks that I suggest
learning<00:02:49.650> before<00:02:49.799> varial<00:02:50.459> kick<00:02:50.670> flips<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.209> it

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
learning before varial kick flips and it

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.270 
learning before varial kick flips and it
looks<00:02:52.109> like<00:02:52.170> you<00:02:52.410> may<00:02:52.620> have<00:02:52.650> those<00:02:53.070> down

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
looks like you may have those down

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.060 
looks like you may have those down
pretty<00:02:53.579> well<00:02:54.290> cool<00:02:55.290> so<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.530> wanted<00:02:55.799> to<00:02:55.890> point

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
pretty well cool so I wanted to point

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.789 
pretty well cool so I wanted to point
out<00:02:56.250> on<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.519> varial<00:02:56.940> kickflip<00:02:57.359> after<00:02:58.320> you<00:02:58.470> pop

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
out on the varial kickflip after you pop

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.280 
out on the varial kickflip after you pop
and<00:02:59.100> flip<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.519> board<00:02:59.790> you<00:03:00.329> put<00:03:00.600> both<00:03:00.900> of<00:03:00.930> your

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
and flip the board you put both of your

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.759 
and flip the board you put both of your
feet<00:03:01.560> really<00:03:02.040> close<00:03:02.310> together<00:03:02.549> that<00:03:03.680> is<00:03:04.680> going

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
feet really close together that is going

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.550 
feet really close together that is going
to<00:03:05.040> make<00:03:05.190> it<00:03:05.220> super<00:03:06.209> hard<00:03:06.510> to<00:03:06.720> get<00:03:06.900> consistent

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
to make it super hard to get consistent

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.039 
to make it super hard to get consistent
at<00:03:07.680> this<00:03:07.890> trick<00:03:08.220> super<00:03:09.180> hard<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.630> catch<00:03:09.840> your

catching it with your front foot it's
literally<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.579> same<00:03:26.970> catch<00:03:27.480> that<00:03:27.780> you're

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
literally the same catch that you're

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.759 
literally the same catch that you're
going<00:03:28.079> to<00:03:28.139> do<00:03:28.440> for<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.970> pop<00:03:30.540> shove-it<00:03:31.019> but

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
going to do for the pop shove-it but

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.229 
going to do for the pop shove-it but
obviously<00:03:31.889> you<00:03:32.340> have<00:03:32.489> to<00:03:32.639> have<00:03:32.790> your<00:03:32.940> foot

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239

obviously you have to have your foot
above<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.690> board<00:03:34.200> long<00:03:34.799> enough<00:03:34.980> so<00:03:35.790> that<00:03:35.819> it

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
above the board long enough so that it

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.960 
above the board long enough so that it
can<00:03:36.269> cause<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.750> kickflip<00:03:37.139> rotation<00:03:37.859> and<00:03:38.130> then

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
can cause the kickflip rotation and then

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.879 
can cause the kickflip rotation and then
you<00:03:39.180> can<00:03:39.359> drop<00:03:39.630> your<00:03:39.870> front<00:03:40.169> foot<00:03:40.229> down<00:03:40.590> and

well<00:04:45.030> enough<00:04:45.360> you<00:04:46.110> just<00:04:46.139> gotta<00:04:46.470> practice

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
well enough you just gotta practice

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:49.100 
well enough you just gotta practice
keeping<00:04:47.280> your<00:04:47.639> feet<00:04:47.880> spread<00:04:48.479> far<00:04:48.930> enough

keeping your feet spread far enough
apart<00:04:49.289> to<00:04:49.650> catch<00:04:50.039> it<00:04:50.310> and<00:04:50.460> then<00:04:50.550> land<00:04:52.220> the

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
apart to catch it and then land the

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.650 
apart to catch it and then land the
other<00:04:53.340> thing<00:04:53.639> that<00:04:53.669> I<00:04:53.789> wanted<00:04:54.150> to<00:04:54.210> point<00:04:54.479> out

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
other thing that I wanted to point out

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.730 
other thing that I wanted to point out
about<00:04:54.930> consistency<00:04:55.710> is<00:04:56.130> that<00:04:57.120> it's<00:04:57.740> usually

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
about consistency is that it's usually

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.860 
about consistency is that it's usually
not<00:04:58.770> like<00:04:59.010> you<00:04:59.639> just<00:04:59.910> learn<00:05:00.120> the<00:05:00.330> trick<00:05:00.570> once

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
not like you just learn the trick once

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.500 
not like you just learn the trick once
and<00:05:01.169> then<00:05:01.289> you're<00:05:01.500> consistent<00:05:02.370> at<00:05:02.490> it<00:05:02.669> it

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
and then you're consistent at it it
