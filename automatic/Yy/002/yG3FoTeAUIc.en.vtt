an unboxing or review and a test on the
D<00:00:34.170> capac<00:00:35.210> so<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.270> guess<00:00:36.450> I'll<00:00:36.630> start<00:00:37.110> opening<00:00:37.500> it

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.890 

so<00:00:40.200> here<00:00:40.560> i<00:00:40.590> have<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.829> box<00:00:41.220> it's<00:00:42.090> kind<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.450> bent

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
so here i have the box it's kind of bent

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:49.850 
so here i have the box it's kind of bent
up<00:00:43.110> but<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.340> was<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.480> mail<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:46.430> that's<00:00:47.430> okay

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.490 

everything<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.580> the<00:00:50.670> box<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:51.390> have<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.080> manual<00:00:52.620> I

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
everything in the box I have a manual I

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:01.190 
everything in the box I have a manual I
have<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:56.160> deca<00:00:56.520> pack<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.620> a<00:00:58.640> strap<00:00:59.960> so<00:01:00.960> now<00:01:01.170> i

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
have the deca pack and a strap so now i

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.290 
have the deca pack and a strap so now i
think<00:01:01.560> i'm<00:01:01.890> actually<00:01:02.190> going<00:01:02.700> to<00:01:02.880> put<00:01:03.060> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
think i'm actually going to put the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.760 
think i'm actually going to put the
camera<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.050> case<00:01:05.510> so<00:01:06.510> open<00:01:07.170> up<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:08.180> seal<00:01:09.180> I

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
camera in the case so open up the seal I

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.610 
camera in the case so open up the seal I
guess<00:01:10.770> I'll<00:01:11.010> first<00:01:11.400> take<00:01:11.700> off<00:01:11.940> the<00:01:12.420> strap<00:01:13.350> off

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
guess I'll first take off the strap off

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.080 
guess I'll first take off the strap off
the<00:01:13.680> camera<00:01:14.600> all<00:01:15.600> right<00:01:15.870> I<00:01:15.990> got<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.350> strap<00:01:16.680> off

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
the camera all right I got the strap off

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.620 
the camera all right I got the strap off
so<00:01:18.090> now<00:01:18.470> without<00:01:19.470> further<00:01:19.740> ado<00:01:20.310> I'm<00:01:20.910> going<00:01:20.970> to

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
so now without further ado I'm going to

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.350 
so now without further ado I'm going to
put<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.990> camera<00:01:22.410> in<00:01:22.440> the<00:01:22.740> case<00:01:24.530> let's<00:01:25.530> get<00:01:25.710> a

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.880 

uh-oh<00:02:18.790> looks<00:02:19.629> like<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.989> camera<00:02:20.349> zooms<00:02:20.650> in

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
uh-oh looks like the camera zooms in

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
uh-oh looks like the camera zooms in
pretty<00:02:21.160> far<00:02:21.900> like<00:02:22.900> past<00:02:23.230> this<00:02:23.650> thing<00:02:23.980> hope

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
pretty far like past this thing hope

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.390 
pretty far like past this thing hope
that<00:02:25.090> doesn't<00:02:25.420> create<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.690> problem<00:02:26.280> but<00:02:27.280> it

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
that doesn't create a problem but it

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.729 
that doesn't create a problem but it
looks<00:02:27.550> like<00:02:27.670> i<00:02:28.090> can<00:02:28.269> still<00:02:28.780> pretty<00:02:29.230> well

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
looks like i can still pretty well

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.350 
looks like i can still pretty well
operate<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.730> camera<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:32.700> even<00:02:33.700> zooming<00:02:34.209> I

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
operate the camera and even zooming I

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.460 
operate the camera and even zooming I
was<00:02:34.630> a<00:02:34.660> little<00:02:35.170> I<00:02:35.410> was<00:02:36.099> a<00:02:36.130> little<00:02:36.430> iffy<00:02:36.580> on<00:02:36.730> that

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
was a little I was a little iffy on that

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:52.850 
was a little I was a little iffy on that
but<00:02:38.470> so<00:02:39.340> now<00:02:40.150> I<00:02:40.180> will<00:02:40.510> screw<00:02:41.140> it<00:02:41.230> back<00:02:41.349> on<00:02:49.470> nope

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.520 

so<00:02:53.490> this<00:02:53.880> camera<00:02:54.240> has<00:02:54.360> seven<00:02:54.900> times<00:02:55.170> zoom

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
so this camera has seven times zoom

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.060 
so this camera has seven times zoom
let's<00:02:55.830> see<00:02:55.980> how<00:02:56.100> if<00:02:56.520> it<00:02:56.730> can<00:02:56.910> actually<00:02:57.120> oh<00:02:58.070> man

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
let's see how if it can actually oh man

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:05.810 
let's see how if it can actually oh man
lens<00:02:59.610> error<00:02:59.940> is<00:03:00.240> what<00:03:00.450> it<00:03:00.570> says<00:03:02.360> sheep<00:03:04.820> well

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
lens error is what it says sheep well

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.540 
lens error is what it says sheep well

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
that's why I'm taking the tests on that

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.630 
that's why I'm taking the tests on that
and<00:03:09.120> I'll<00:03:09.240> turn<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.540> camera<00:03:09.870> off<00:03:10.370> then<00:03:11.370> on

and I'll turn the camera off then on

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.760 
and I'll turn the camera off then on
again<00:03:13.910> whenever<00:03:14.910> i<00:03:15.000> zoom<00:03:15.360> in<00:03:15.600> yeah<00:03:16.110> look<00:03:16.530> the

in<00:04:30.510> a<00:04:30.630> towel<00:04:31.490> get<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:32.670> lens<00:04:33.470> the<00:04:34.470> lens<00:04:34.500> is

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
in a towel get the lens the lens is

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.480 
in a towel get the lens the lens is
where<00:04:35.070> water<00:04:35.520> hides<00:04:35.910> I<00:04:36.710> think<00:04:37.710> if<00:04:37.800> Bartok<00:04:38.250> were

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
where water hides I think if Bartok were

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.950 
where water hides I think if Bartok were
to<00:04:38.700> get<00:04:38.850> in<00:04:39.030> he<00:04:39.210> would<00:04:39.330> get<00:04:39.510> in<00:04:39.630> through<00:04:39.840> the

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
to get in he would get in through the

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.440 
to get in he would get in through the
lens<00:04:40.280> because<00:04:41.280> you<00:04:41.400> got<00:04:41.610> just<00:04:41.940> gotta<00:04:42.210> make

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
lens because you got just gotta make

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.470 
lens because you got just gotta make
sure<00:04:42.510> that<00:04:42.960> you<00:04:43.320> screwed<00:04:43.710> on<00:04:43.980> tight<00:04:44.280> because<00:04:45.090> I

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
sure that you screwed on tight because I

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.600 
sure that you screwed on tight because I
can<00:04:45.660> easily<00:04:46.230> see<00:04:46.500> that<00:04:46.740> if<00:04:47.010> you<00:04:47.190> didn't<00:04:47.430> screw

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
can easily see that if you didn't screw

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.370 
can easily see that if you didn't screw
this<00:04:47.820> on<00:04:48.030> tight<00:04:48.330> enough<00:04:48.540> it<00:04:48.810> would<00:04:49.020> leak<00:04:50.180> um

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
this on tight enough it would leak um

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:59.180 
this on tight enough it would leak um

it's worked really nicely and it's
proven<00:05:04.950> itself<00:05:05.250> to<00:05:05.430> be<00:05:05.580> a<00:05:05.730> very<00:05:06.180> strong<00:05:06.840> and

proven itself to be a very strong and
reliable<00:05:07.440> underwater<00:05:08.250> case<00:05:08.580> like<00:05:09.210> I<00:05:09.360> said<00:05:09.420> at

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.910 
the beginning of the video I was really
nervous<00:05:11.490> to<00:05:11.850> use<00:05:12.240> it<00:05:12.450> but<00:05:13.110> now<00:05:13.530> I'm<00:05:13.710> not

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
nervous to use it but now I'm not

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
anymore I trust it completely and I

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.740

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.510 
give is this make sure you screw the
lens<00:05:26.160> cap<00:05:26.310> on<00:05:26.640> and<00:05:27.030> zip<00:05:27.750> up<00:05:27.870> the<00:05:28.050> bag<00:05:28.080> and<00:05:28.520> just

lens cap on and zip up the bag and just

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.460 
lens cap on and zip up the bag and just
make<00:05:29.790> sure<00:05:29.820> it's<00:05:30.270> all<00:05:30.420> closed<00:05:30.750> up<00:05:30.960> before<00:05:31.350> you

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
make sure it's all closed up before you

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.830 
make sure it's all closed up before you
use<00:05:31.710> it<00:05:31.740> but<00:05:32.490> as<00:05:32.700> long<00:05:33.000> as<00:05:33.030> you<00:05:33.270> do<00:05:33.420> that<00:05:33.450> you
