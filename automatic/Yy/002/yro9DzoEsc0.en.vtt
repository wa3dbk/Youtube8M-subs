00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.770
 Welcome to another profile, welcome 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.170
 of the spirit of the channel and today I go 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.410
 show you the subscriber's pc 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.440
 lucas inÃ¡cio and the number 36 follows the 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.440
 specifications 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:28.829
 the first image you see there in the 

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:31.019
 the cabinet with the side cover 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:33.449
 open we can see that an action of this 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.010
 cabinet is not the best because he 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:36.000
 does not have those entries intended 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.010
 put the cables 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.570
 this makes it difficult for a little housekeeping 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.000
 he made it possible for him to be able 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.980
 organize the cables as we can see 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.230
 in the back of the cabinet he 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.359
 mounted all the cables and tried to make a 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.730
 housekeeping that will not 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:53.339
 so the airflow in this image have 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.199
 there is pride and the processor that as 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.179
 you have seen the general investigations 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.569
 This is a phenom ii x6 which is a 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:03.239
 version of the old fc 300 and the two combs 

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:04.409
 of color memory serve people of 1,600 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.030
 mega hair 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.070
 we can also see that since this 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.960
 cabinet in basic cabinet must have 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.780
 I mounted that there were three black he did not 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.729
 has hd drawers support and this 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.280
 disrupts further storage of the 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.729
 cabling and there is the video card r 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.159
 9 280 x modeler of ms has like 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.960
 cooling system in the next sentence 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.040
 with 2 tablespoons to make 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.479
 heat dissipation 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.610
 he removed her from the lots but did not 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.229
 need to do this is a very good board 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.869
 does not allow you to play most 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.820
 games with the frames in that image are 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.759
 picking up the source that the model in color 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.539
 sure of s600 can fix all 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.159
 brass and active pfc said very good and that 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.920
 Turn around and I'm showing in some 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.140
 staff members and the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.460
 that there were three black of thermaltake the 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.680
 which has a very high airflow. 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.719
 good and a weak point of it is undoubtedly the 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.039
 cables since it does not have any 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:58.229
 those tickets for us to be able to 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.490
 hide the hair then it is if you 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.009
 liked to click on the knee leaving 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.479
