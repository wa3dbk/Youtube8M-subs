 not like hi and we're back after 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:26.030
 a long pause side values ​​and there we 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:29.150
 will put in the account of the need of you 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:34.760
 so here we are in a bio mountain and 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:36.890
 an extract miles and and comedians and 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.840
 our will be installed so we will 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.700
 plan a little bit of all that we think 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.620
 to make the house the right in the corner where 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.010
 there is the entrance but not to enter the 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:49.160
 mountain ride Jenin and opens to 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.880
 half out well and is an aircraft 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.310
 then 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.350
 then there will be plenty of two tunnels 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.000
 who will join a lot of sales in the 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.750
 Mountain 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.610
 there will be held and between 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.360
 mountains of fontrailles that's it 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.820
 could be funny 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.060
 So that's what we learned in the meantime 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.620
 big bowl of gold found it the tro bo one 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.140
 because that's the symbol of the word takes 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.140
 he was I explored but the sporting 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.620
 18 diamond 21 with the trap that the 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.389
 science and that's it and everything serves 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.530
 basically maybe want to me 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:26.330
 we'll go get them 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:26.330
 as to show their has the resources 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:34.440
 I think both spoke to each other 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.120
 by the breakthroughs and I think we're going 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.050
 to make a mine to fetch the 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.630
 pole because we want we are really 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.310
 good cowboy theft Cobol and we will 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.450
 also have to wood so we had one 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:48.090
 will get you stoned at the same time that the ball has 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:52.280
 for now we're good and it's a 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:54.540
 beautiful, empty location and location 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.950
 so for those who may still be 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.290
 in Iran patients probably because I 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.169
 believe that it's not panic about 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:08.250
 ranks pressure it took me two 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:12.889
 today my dad builds the 17 10 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.889
 Saturday, November 10, 2011 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:20.100
 the 1.4.4 inversion realizes a mushroom 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:23.729
 replaced by felipe 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:26.460
 no it's like that and we're going to make a 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:29.340
 series a video a week on on this 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:33.510
 special server has the keys of youtube 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:36.840
 hits a video a week at the club 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.310
 I chains people will be in 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:50.360
 the description to the dimension 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:50.360
 personal and that that actually creates 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.870
 here we are going to do a series she sees herself 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.850
 there we will show that some non 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:06.660
 not everything after show something of 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:08.670
 more interesting but logical of us 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:13.110
 two others so we will manage transferred 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:16.140
 at the same time will stop it lasts but as 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:21.360
 you are not looking for a lode of 64 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:22.530
 see more of that stuff of coal and I 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.340
 the exploit of a bitch on time but it 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:28.020
 do not end up with a little difference 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.760
 if you noticed a difference in his 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.080
 improvement of a quality there we are sure 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.480
 same balloon but on the model of 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.310
 redwood 6 compared to skype 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.660
 it's better we would say as 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.720
 that we go in the future we can take to 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:42.600
 know mumble for the renault video that 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.220
 would be fine but in my opinion it 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.940
 microphone that he kisses and I'm sorry 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:51.230
 but I will soon kind of buy a 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:53.370
 Here it must eat normally 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:56.000
 I hope this little video you 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.780
 will please that this new adventure 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:10.490
 while to us because we for 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:10.490
 the moment we are already hi
