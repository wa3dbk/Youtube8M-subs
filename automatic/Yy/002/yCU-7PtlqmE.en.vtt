00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
what you wanna do is once you've been

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.329 
what you wanna do is once you've been
stored<00:00:33.449> into<00:00:33.720> block<00:00:33.930> 100<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.410> course<00:00:34.710> what<00:00:35.250> you

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:35.339

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:37.759 
stored into block 100 of course what you
want<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.550> do<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.760> get<00:00:35.910> obsidian<00:00:36.559> so<00:00:37.559> what<00:00:37.680> doe

obsidian<00:00:38.160> what<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.339> wanna<00:00:38.460> do<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.820> build<00:00:39.059> a

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
obsidian what you wanna do is build a

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:41.509 
obsidian what you wanna do is build a
portal<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:39.900> it<00:00:40.260> can<00:00:40.379> be<00:00:40.500> one<00:00:40.710> over<00:00:40.860> size<00:00:41.250> so

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:41.519 
portal so it can be one over size so

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:42.619 
portal so it can be one over size so
we're<00:00:41.640> just<00:00:41.670> going<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.910> actually<00:00:42.269> build<00:00:42.510> it

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
we're just going to actually build it

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.959 
we're just going to actually build it
really<00:00:42.899> massive<00:00:43.260> because<00:00:43.590> why<00:00:43.800> not<00:00:43.910> so<00:00:44.910> you

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
really massive because why not so you

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.490 
really massive because why not so you
can't<00:00:45.180> actually<00:00:45.300> just<00:00:45.600> build<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.809> like<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.110> PC

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
can't actually just build it like the PC

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.709 
can't actually just build it like the PC
version<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.250> exact<00:00:47.610> blocks<00:00:47.940> just<00:00:48.210> make<00:00:48.600> it

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
version the exact blocks just make it

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.350 
version the exact blocks just make it
more<00:00:49.100> realistic<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.460> guess<00:00:50.699> but<00:00:51.000> I'm<00:00:51.210> gonna

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
more realistic I guess but I'm gonna

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.060 
more realistic I guess but I'm gonna
show<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.660> an<00:00:51.750> example<00:00:52.079> later<00:00:52.410> on<00:00:52.739> in<00:00:52.949> this

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
show you an example later on in this

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.520 
show you an example later on in this
video<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.520> show<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.809> does<00:00:54.989> work<00:00:55.199> with

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
video to show you that it does work with

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.380 
video to show you that it does work with
different<00:00:55.980> designs<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.760> we're<00:00:57.180> just<00:00:57.210> gonna

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
different designs so we're just gonna

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.420 
different designs so we're just gonna
build<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:57.840> one<00:00:58.109> massive<00:00:58.410> portal<00:00:58.980> because

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
build this one massive portal because

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.520 
build this one massive portal because
why<00:01:00.180> not<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.660> look<00:01:00.840> at<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.050> that's<00:01:01.199> one

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
why not so look at that that's one

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.590 
why not so look at that that's one
that's<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.890> portal<00:01:02.309> there<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:03.269> we're<00:01:03.449> going<00:01:03.570> to

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
that's a portal there and we're going to

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.290 
that's a portal there and we're going to
spawn<00:01:04.199> on<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.470> block<00:01:04.680> here<00:01:05.090> so<00:01:06.090> we're<00:01:06.180> just

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
spawn on this block here so we're just

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.120 
spawn on this block here so we're just
going<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.479> place<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.660> down<00:01:06.810> there<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.440> what

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
going to place it down there and what

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.070 
going to place it down there and what
you<00:01:08.190> wanna<00:01:08.310> do<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.580> type<00:01:08.759> in<00:01:08.789> a<00:01:08.940> command<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.899> the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
you wanna do is type in a command so the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.469 
you wanna do is type in a command so the
command<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.560> slash<00:01:11.250> portal<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.210> we're<00:01:12.390> going

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
command is slash portal so we're going

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.660 
command is slash portal so we're going
to<00:01:12.539> do<00:01:12.660> that<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.110> as<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.009> can<00:01:14.130> see<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.490> has<00:01:14.640> its

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
to do that and as you can see it has its

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.010 
to do that and as you can see it has its
stuff<00:01:15.030> there<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.540> think<00:01:15.750> that's<00:01:15.900> in

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
stuff there and I think that's in

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.539 
stuff there and I think that's in
Spanish<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:16.590> don't<00:01:16.830> actually<00:01:16.979> understand

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
Spanish so don't actually understand

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.060 
Spanish so don't actually understand
what<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.759> says<00:01:17.970> there<00:01:18.210> but<00:01:18.659> anyways<00:01:19.320> um<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.979> do

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
what it says there but anyways um I do

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.120 
what it says there but anyways um I do
believe<00:01:20.640> it's<00:01:21.060> correct<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.680> what<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.950> want<00:01:23.070> to

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
believe it's correct so what you want to

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.830 
believe it's correct so what you want to
do<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.310> just<00:01:23.430> run<00:01:23.670> into<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.119> portal<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.600> jump

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
do is just run into the portal and jump

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.260 
do is just run into the portal and jump
into<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.560> you'll<00:01:25.920> spawn<00:01:26.280> where<00:01:26.880> we<00:01:27.030> type

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
into it and you'll spawn where we type

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.120 
into it and you'll spawn where we type
that<00:01:27.299> command<00:01:27.869> which<00:01:28.049> was<00:01:28.200> slash<00:01:28.500> portal<00:01:28.979> so

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
that command which was slash portal so

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.740 
that command which was slash portal so
we're<00:01:29.250> just<00:01:29.280> going<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.520> jump<00:01:29.759> into<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.060> like

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
we're just going to jump into it like

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.530 
we're just going to jump into it like
this<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.290> we<00:01:31.610> spawn<00:01:32.610> here<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.060> it's<00:01:33.210> really

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
this and we spawn here so it's really

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.450 
this and we spawn here so it's really
really<00:01:33.900> cool<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.439> can<00:01:34.650> like<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.040> said<00:01:35.159> you

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
really cool so you can like I said you

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.429 
really cool so you can like I said you
can<00:01:35.579> build<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.880> like<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.090> PC<00:01:36.450> version<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.990> think

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
can build it like the PC version I think

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.530 
can build it like the PC version I think
it's<00:01:37.530> like<00:01:37.619> five<00:01:37.860> blocks<00:01:38.159> or<00:01:39.060> something<00:01:39.450> like

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
it's like five blocks or something like

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.319 
it's like five blocks or something like
that<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.049> four<00:01:40.500> blocks<00:01:40.740> high<00:01:41.119> something<00:01:42.119> like

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
that and four blocks high something like

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.069 
that and four blocks high something like
that

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
that

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.359 
that
I<00:01:43.110> think<00:01:43.560> I'm<00:01:43.680> building<00:01:43.829> this<00:01:44.009> right<00:01:44.250> I'm

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
I think I'm building this right I'm

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.249 
I think I'm building this right I'm
actually<00:01:44.640> not<00:01:44.909> sure<00:01:45.240> but<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.840> can<00:01:45.990> build<00:01:46.140> it

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
actually not sure but you can build it

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.590 
actually not sure but you can build it
whatever<00:01:46.439> design<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.310> if<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.880> guys<00:01:48.030> wanted

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
whatever design and if you guys wanted

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.710 
whatever design and if you guys wanted
not<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.020> like<00:01:49.950> spawn<00:01:50.280> here<00:01:50.549> again<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.600> can

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
not to like spawn here again you can

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.600 
not to like spawn here again you can
just<00:01:51.869> type<00:01:52.079> in<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.259> command<00:01:52.350> which<00:01:52.740> was<00:01:52.920> slash

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
just type in a command which was slash

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.959 
just type in a command which was slash
remover<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:55.280> there<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.340> go<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:56.790> we're<00:01:56.939> just

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
remover and there you go so we're just

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.429 
remover and there you go so we're just
gonna<00:01:57.149> we're<00:01:57.630> just<00:01:57.719> gonna<00:01:57.899> jump<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.320> there

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
gonna we're just gonna jump in there

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.469 
gonna we're just gonna jump in there
again<00:01:58.649> just<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.280> test<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.670> it's<00:01:59.880> not<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.360> our

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
again just to test that it's not so our

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.179 
again just to test that it's not so our
spawning<00:02:00.810> on<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.259> block<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:01.950> it's<00:02:02.100> gonna

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
spawning on that block so it's gonna

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.800 
spawning on that block so it's gonna
jump<00:02:02.490> there<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.939> as<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.149> can<00:02:03.240> see<00:02:03.509> we're<00:02:03.719> not

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
jump there and as you can see we're not

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.719 
jump there and as you can see we're not
spawning<00:02:04.140> anymore<00:02:04.619> until<00:02:05.250> we<00:02:05.340> type<00:02:05.579> in<00:02:05.700> the

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
spawning anymore until we type in the

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.620 
spawning anymore until we type in the
command<00:02:06.090> again

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
command again

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.930 
command again
so<00:02:06.840> as<00:02:07.140> we<00:02:07.530> can<00:02:07.680> ya<00:02:08.160> see<00:02:08.429> it's<00:02:08.579> not<00:02:08.670> actually

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
so as we can ya see it's not actually

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.639 
so as we can ya see it's not actually
working<00:02:09.119> so<00:02:09.600> we're<00:02:09.750> going<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.899> type<00:02:10.170> in<00:02:10.320> slash

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
working so we're going to type in slash

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.370 
working so we're going to type in slash
portal<00:02:11.100> again<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.269> we're<00:02:12.959> just<00:02:13.079> going<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.260> go

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
portal again and we're just going to go

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.199 
portal again and we're just going to go
at<00:02:13.500> that<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.519> we're<00:02:14.610> gonna<00:02:14.700> spawn<00:02:14.940> right

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
at that and so we're gonna spawn right

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.330 
at that and so we're gonna spawn right
here<00:02:15.510> like<00:02:15.959> right<00:02:16.290> here<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:16.829> we're<00:02:17.280> just

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
gonna jump into this one and of course

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.800 
gonna jump into this one and of course
it<00:02:19.709> works<00:02:19.889> as<00:02:20.220> well<00:02:20.609> as<00:02:20.820> this<00:02:21.180> portal<00:02:21.570> over

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
it works as well as this portal over

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.790 
it works as well as this portal over
here<00:02:21.959> so<00:02:22.919> yeah<00:02:23.130> that's<00:02:23.340> pretty<00:02:23.400> cool

gonna show you guys an example so you
actually<00:02:28.690> can<00:02:29.110> just<00:02:29.320> use<00:02:29.500> one<00:02:29.800> block<00:02:30.130> if<00:02:30.310> you

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
actually can just use one block if you

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.220 
actually can just use one block if you
guys<00:02:30.550> wanted<00:02:30.880> to<00:02:30.940> you<00:02:31.450> don't<00:02:31.660> actually<00:02:31.870> have

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
guys wanted to you don't actually have

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.600 
guys wanted to you don't actually have
to<00:02:32.290> build<00:02:32.560> it<00:02:32.740> like<00:02:32.860> this<00:02:33.040> but<00:02:33.250> if<00:02:33.370> you<00:02:33.490> guys

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
to build it like this but if you guys

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.370 
to build it like this but if you guys
wanted<00:02:33.910> to<00:02:33.970> make<00:02:34.360> it<00:02:34.480> more<00:02:34.600> realistic<00:02:34.960> you<00:02:35.200> can

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
wanted to make it more realistic you can

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.440 
wanted to make it more realistic you can
but<00:02:36.130> we're<00:02:36.400> just<00:02:36.520> gonna<00:02:36.610> spawn<00:02:36.880> one<00:02:37.240> block

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
but we're just gonna spawn one block

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.350 
but we're just gonna spawn one block
here<00:02:37.920> one<00:02:38.920> block<00:02:39.160> of<00:02:39.310> obsidian<00:02:39.640> and<00:02:40.030> we're

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
here one block of obsidian and we're

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.520 
here one block of obsidian and we're
just<00:02:40.480> gonna<00:02:40.660> spawn<00:02:40.900> on<00:02:41.050> this<00:02:41.200> block<00:02:41.380> here

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
just gonna spawn on this block here

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.290 
just gonna spawn on this block here
because<00:02:41.860> why<00:02:41.980> not<00:02:42.100> and<00:02:42.640> we're<00:02:43.000> just<00:02:43.060> going<00:02:43.210> to

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
because why not and we're just going to

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.860 
because why not and we're just going to
type<00:02:43.660> in<00:02:43.840> slash<00:02:44.290> portal<00:02:44.800> and<00:02:45.450> if<00:02:46.450> we<00:02:46.570> were<00:02:46.720> to

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
type in slash portal and if we were to

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.810 
type in slash portal and if we were to
jump<00:02:47.080> on<00:02:47.230> this<00:02:47.320> one<00:02:47.560> block<00:02:47.800> of<00:02:48.040> obsidian<00:02:48.400> will

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
jump on this one block of obsidian will

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.520 
jump on this one block of obsidian will
spawn<00:02:49.150> right<00:02:49.390> there<00:02:49.660> so<00:02:49.870> we're<00:02:49.990> gonna<00:02:50.170> jump<00:02:50.410> on

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
spawn right there so we're gonna jump on

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.890 
spawn right there so we're gonna jump on
it<00:02:50.650> and<00:02:51.000> we<00:02:52.000> spawn<00:02:52.240> there<00:02:52.450> so<00:02:52.630> that<00:02:52.780> is

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
it and we spawn there so that is

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.300 
it and we spawn there so that is
basically<00:02:53.080> it<00:02:53.320> for<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.590> mod<00:02:53.740> it's<00:02:53.920> really

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
basically it for the mod it's really

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.110 
basically it for the mod it's really
really<00:02:54.730> cool

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
really cool

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.970

so if you guys like like I said you can

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.250 
so if you guys like like I said you can

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
spawn it like you can make it realistic

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.770 
spawn it like you can make it realistic
like<00:02:59.800> the<00:02:59.920> PC<00:03:00.250> version<00:03:00.700> or<00:03:01.060> you<00:03:01.390> can<00:03:01.540> just<00:03:01.660> have

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.530 
like the PC version or you can just have
a<00:03:01.840> block<00:03:02.140> or<00:03:02.350> one<00:03:02.770> massive<00:03:03.250> for<00:03:03.460> loop<00:03:03.700> like<00:03:04.360> I

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
a block or one massive for loop like I

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.300 
a block or one massive for loop like I
did<00:03:04.750> over<00:03:05.020> here<00:03:05.050> because<00:03:05.650> it's<00:03:05.680> just
