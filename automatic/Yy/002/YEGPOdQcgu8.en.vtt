lippmann<00:02:43.430> it<00:02:43.700> was<00:02:44.209> kind<00:02:44.419> of<00:02:44.480> expensive<00:02:44.810> but

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
lippmann it was kind of expensive but

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.869 
lippmann it was kind of expensive but
it's<00:02:45.169> like<00:02:45.319> they're<00:02:45.500> gel<00:02:45.859> it's<00:02:46.579> supposed<00:02:46.790> to

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
it's like they're gel it's supposed to

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.369 
it's like they're gel it's supposed to
give<00:02:47.120> you<00:02:47.299> basically<00:02:47.629> like<00:02:47.840> gel<00:02:48.109> nails

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
give you basically like gel nails

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.619 
give you basically like gel nails
without<00:02:48.680> having<00:02:49.250> to<00:02:49.370> use<00:02:49.549> like<00:02:49.760> UV<00:02:50.120> light<00:02:50.359> and

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
without having to use like UV light and

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.629 
without having to use like UV light and
it's<00:02:51.079> a<00:02:51.169> base<00:02:51.319> coat<00:02:51.680> right<00:02:51.950> here<00:02:52.220> and<00:02:52.459> then<00:02:52.609> a

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:52.639 
it's a base coat right here and then a

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.149 
it's a base coat right here and then a
topcoat<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.359> I<00:02:54.169> think<00:02:54.590> it<00:02:54.709> gives<00:02:54.950> a<00:02:55.129> really

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 
topcoat and I think it gives a really

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.479 
topcoat and I think it gives a really
nice<00:02:55.430> shine<00:02:55.760> um<00:02:56.469> is<00:02:57.469> it<00:02:57.620> as<00:02:57.739> good<00:02:57.769> as<00:02:58.010> gel<00:02:58.250> nails

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
nice shine um is it as good as gel nails

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.750 
nice shine um is it as good as gel nails

you should be able to wear all of these
colors<00:05:30.590> just<00:05:30.919> because<00:05:31.190> your<00:05:31.310> skin<00:05:31.490> is<00:05:31.550> really

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
colors just because your skin is really

and<00:05:35.830> let<00:05:36.830> me<00:05:36.949> swatch<00:05:37.219> that<00:05:37.430> for<00:05:37.699> you<00:05:37.909> I<00:05:38.180> thought

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
and let me swatch that for you I thought

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.330 
and let me swatch that for you I thought
that<00:05:39.080> was<00:05:39.320> probably<00:05:39.680> the<00:05:39.860> one<00:05:40.070> that<00:05:40.219> would

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
that was probably the one that would

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.249 
that was probably the one that would
make<00:05:40.580> that<00:05:40.940> would<00:05:41.090> just<00:05:41.270> look<00:05:41.360> to<00:05:41.419> vampy<00:05:42.020> maybe

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:42.259 
make that would just look to vampy maybe

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:45.850 
make that would just look to vampy maybe
but<00:05:43.009> it<00:05:43.130> actually<00:05:43.340> isn't<00:05:43.909> bad<00:05:44.180> it's<00:05:44.659> not<00:05:45.380> that

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
but it actually isn't bad it's not that

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.800

changes<00:06:18.889> the<00:06:18.919> finish<00:06:19.400> of<00:06:19.639> the<00:06:19.789> lipstick<00:06:20.240> when

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:20.389 
changes the finish of the lipstick when

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:22.300 
changes the finish of the lipstick when
you<00:06:20.479> were<00:06:20.569> underneath<00:06:21.080> the<00:06:21.409> lipstick<00:06:21.830> the<00:06:22.039> lip

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
you were underneath the lipstick the lip

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.830 
you were underneath the lipstick the lip
liners<00:06:22.669> of<00:06:22.849> course<00:06:23.120> because<00:06:23.449> the<00:06:23.569> Urban<00:06:23.810> Decay

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840
