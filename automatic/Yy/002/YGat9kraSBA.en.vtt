00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:03.740 

so<00:00:02.399> the<00:00:02.610> Centennial<00:00:03.000> Challenges<00:00:03.300> program<00:00:03.360> is

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
so the Centennial Challenges program is

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.329 
so the Centennial Challenges program is
really<00:00:03.959> focused<00:00:04.529> on<00:00:04.620> trying<00:00:04.859> to<00:00:05.009> advance

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
really focused on trying to advance

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.340 
really focused on trying to advance
technologies<00:00:06.029> not<00:00:06.240> only<00:00:06.420> for<00:00:06.600> NASA<00:00:06.810> but<00:00:07.230> the

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
technologies not only for NASA but the

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.589 
technologies not only for NASA but the
nation<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:07.919> way<00:00:08.519> we<00:00:08.700> do<00:00:08.940> that<00:00:09.120> is<00:00:09.179> we<00:00:09.330> will

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
nation and the way we do that is we will

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.680 
nation and the way we do that is we will
put<00:00:09.780> up<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:09.960> prize<00:00:10.230> purse<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:11.340> create<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.480> create

our technology road it's like like

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.420 
our technology road it's like like
anything<00:00:31.470> when<00:00:31.590> you're<00:00:31.679> doing<00:00:31.830> exploration

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
anything when you're doing exploration

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.680 
anything when you're doing exploration
you<00:00:32.820> want<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.090> know<00:00:33.180> have<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.420> general

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
you want to know have a general

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.299 
you want to know have a general
direction<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.989> where<00:00:34.110> you're<00:00:34.260> going<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.739> what

direction of where you're going and what
you're<00:00:35.430> going<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.610> need<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.820> get<00:00:36.000> there<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.360> so

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
you're going to need to get there and so

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.420 
you're going to need to get there and so

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
technology we're looking at

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.890 
technology we're looking at
and<00:01:19.340> as<00:01:19.790> well<00:01:20.000> we're<00:01:20.180> looking<00:01:20.450> at<00:01:20.660> new

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
and as well we're looking at new

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.570 
and as well we're looking at new
technologies<00:01:21.080> so<00:01:21.680> up-and-coming<00:01:22.310> things

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
technologies so up-and-coming things

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.370 
technologies so up-and-coming things
like<00:01:22.730> additive<00:01:23.120> manufacturing<00:01:23.210> so<00:01:24.080> we<00:01:24.260> need

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
like additive manufacturing so we need

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.380 
like additive manufacturing so we need
3d<00:01:24.770> print<00:01:25.100> something<00:01:25.370> or<00:01:25.700> you<00:01:25.910> additively

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
3d print something or you additively

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.280 
3d print something or you additively
manufacturing<00:01:27.430> there's<00:01:28.430> a<00:01:28.490> lot<00:01:28.730> of<00:01:28.760> unique

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
manufacturing there's a lot of unique

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.940 
manufacturing there's a lot of unique
solutions<00:01:30.290> that<00:01:30.380> can<00:01:30.500> be<00:01:30.590> done<00:01:30.740> with<00:01:30.890> that

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
solutions that can be done with that

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.220 
solutions that can be done with that
technology<00:01:31.310> in<00:01:31.730> architectural<00:01:32.510> seems<00:01:32.690> so<00:01:33.110> if

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
technology in architectural seems so if

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.930 
technology in architectural seems so if
we're<00:01:33.380> going<00:01:33.530> to<00:01:33.590> try<00:01:33.710> to<00:01:33.740> 3d<00:01:34.130> print<00:01:34.160> a<00:01:34.460> habitat

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
we're going to try to 3d print a habitat
