follow mad anak through this door I was
lucky<00:00:40.890> enough<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.219> have<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.640> save<00:00:42.030> point<00:00:42.450> right

here<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.530> think<00:00:43.710> he<00:00:44.100> actually<00:00:44.879> auto-saves

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
here I think he actually auto-saves

here I think he actually auto-saves
around<00:00:46.230> here<00:00:46.620> or<00:00:46.890> somewhere<00:00:47.460> near<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:48.210> you
