and you see that I am now connected well

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.570 
and you see that I am now connected well
that's<00:03:17.060> great<00:03:17.330> we<00:03:18.260> want<00:03:18.410> to<00:03:18.500> connect<00:03:18.830> to<00:03:19.190> our

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
that's great we want to connect to our

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.330 
that's great we want to connect to our
public<00:03:20.450> address<00:03:20.650> okay<00:03:21.650> so<00:03:21.709> instead<00:03:22.160> of

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
public address okay so instead of

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.479 
public address okay so instead of
connecting<00:03:22.819> to<00:03:23.140> the<00:03:24.140> dot<00:03:24.319> 15<00:03:24.709> machine<00:03:25.040> from

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
connecting to the dot 15 machine from

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.040 
connecting to the dot 15 machine from
let's<00:03:25.790> say<00:03:28.600> 192.168.1.1<00:03:29.600> to<00:03:29.690> actually

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
let's say 192.168.1.1 to actually

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.800 
let's say 192.168.1.1 to actually
connect<00:03:30.410> from<00:03:30.800> the<00:03:30.890> dot<00:03:31.160> 16<00:03:31.700> address<00:03:32.090> to<00:03:32.540> our

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
connect from the dot 16 address to our

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.990 
connect from the dot 16 address to our
public<00:03:33.200> address<00:03:33.400> so<00:03:34.400> let's<00:03:34.580> see<00:03:34.700> how<00:03:34.790> to<00:03:34.850> do

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
public address so let's see how to do

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.479 
public address so let's see how to do
that<00:03:35.260> all<00:03:36.260> right<00:03:36.500> if<00:03:36.620> you're<00:03:36.770> like<00:03:36.920> me<00:03:37.160> and

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
that all right if you're like me and

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.120 
that all right if you're like me and
like<00:03:37.790> most<00:03:38.000> users<00:03:38.480> on<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:38.900> internet<00:03:39.230> you<00:03:39.920> do

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
like most users on the internet you do

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.479 
like most users on the internet you do
not<00:03:40.280> have<00:03:40.489> a<00:03:40.519> fixed<00:03:40.790> IP<00:03:41.000> address<00:03:41.540> so<00:03:42.500> if<00:03:43.069> you

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
not have a fixed IP address so if you

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.220 
not have a fixed IP address so if you
want<00:03:43.670> to<00:03:43.730> connect<00:03:44.030> to<00:03:44.120> a<00:03:44.239> fixed<00:03:44.660> IP<00:03:44.750> address

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
want to connect to a fixed IP address

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.930 
want to connect to a fixed IP address
you<00:03:45.410> need<00:03:45.500> to<00:03:45.620> pay<00:03:45.769> for<00:03:45.980> that<00:03:46.100> or<00:03:46.340> you<00:03:46.370> can<00:03:46.730> use

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
you need to pay for that or you can use

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.800 
you need to pay for that or you can use
something<00:03:47.330> like<00:03:47.480> no<00:03:48.050> IP<00:03:48.260> comm<00:03:48.800> and<00:03:49.390> as<00:03:50.390> your<00:03:50.630> IP

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
something like no IP comm and as your IP

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.199 
something like no IP comm and as your IP
address<00:03:51.200> changes<00:03:51.230> because<00:03:52.190> you<00:03:52.459> lease<00:03:52.790> out<00:03:53.000> an

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
address changes because you lease out an

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.979 
address changes because you lease out an
IP<00:03:53.450> address<00:03:53.569> from<00:03:54.110> your<00:03:54.530> ISP<00:03:55.340> as<00:03:55.850> it<00:03:56.480> changes

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
IP address from your ISP as it changes

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.920 
IP address from your ISP as it changes
it<00:03:57.530> will<00:03:57.860> actually<00:03:58.489> match<00:03:58.670> up<00:03:58.730> and<00:03:59.239> you<00:03:59.720> can

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
it will actually match up and you can

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.680 
it will actually match up and you can
connect<00:04:00.290> to<00:04:00.440> that<00:04:00.590> using<00:04:01.489> a<00:04:01.700> hostname<00:04:02.030> so

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
connect to that using a hostname so

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.550 
connect to that using a hostname so
instead<00:04:02.959> of<00:04:03.019> having<00:04:03.200> a<00:04:03.380> type<00:04:03.560> out<00:04:03.799> like<00:04:04.580> 24.1

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
instead of having a type out like 24.1

instance your name dot d dns net so it's

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.050

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.630 
much easier and as your IP address
changes<00:04:17.780> you<00:04:18.320> will<00:04:18.500> still<00:04:18.799> be<00:04:19.100> able<00:04:19.220> to<00:04:19.459> reach

your<00:04:19.760> network<00:04:20.120> so<00:04:20.900> you<00:04:20.959> would<00:04:21.109> just<00:04:21.260> sign<00:04:21.410> up

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
your network so you would just sign up

now let's go back to my connection for
my<00:04:48.110> iPhone<00:04:48.669> all<00:04:49.669> right<00:04:49.789> now<00:04:49.850> I<00:04:49.880> want<00:04:50.000> to

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
my iPhone all right now I want to

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.270 
my iPhone all right now I want to
connect<00:04:50.300> using<00:04:50.630> the<00:04:50.720> new<00:04:50.870> IP<00:04:51.050> dot-com<00:04:51.919> account

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
connect using the new IP dot-com account

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.130 
connect using the new IP dot-com account
so<00:04:52.910> now<00:04:53.060> instead<00:04:53.240> of<00:04:53.390> having<00:04:53.510> to<00:04:53.780> type<00:04:53.960> out

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
so now instead of having to type out

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.860 
so now instead of having to type out
this<00:04:54.470> long<00:04:54.650> IP<00:04:54.950> address<00:04:55.430> all<00:04:56.150> I<00:04:56.210> have<00:04:56.450> to<00:04:56.570> do<00:04:56.720> is

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
this long IP address all I have to do is

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.850 
this long IP address all I have to do is
type<00:04:57.080> out<00:04:57.350> my<00:04:57.770> host<00:04:57.950> name<00:04:58.190> Jessi<00:04:59.000> 4<00:04:59.210> 6<00:04:59.450> 9<00:04:59.590> dot<00:05:00.590> d

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
type out my host name Jessi 4 6 9 dot d

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.969 
type out my host name Jessi 4 6 9 dot d
DNS<00:05:01.340> net<00:05:02.030> so<00:05:02.570> as<00:05:02.720> the<00:05:02.870> IP<00:05:03.050> address<00:05:03.500> changes

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
DNS net so as the IP address changes

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:06.820 
DNS net so as the IP address changes
I'll<00:05:04.250> still<00:05:04.850> be<00:05:04.940> able<00:05:05.090> to<00:05:05.180> connect<00:05:05.479> to<00:05:05.810> my<00:05:06.050> dot

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
I'll still be able to connect to my dot

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.580 
I'll still be able to connect to my dot
