00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.410
 so I understand 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:13.799
 true st 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:21.849
 World Wide Web 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.189
 injured 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.189
 because 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:29.189
 the 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.189
 for the bitter German 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.600
 then succeeded 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.560
 he is clinically suspected 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.370
 anyway but now I didn't want 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.370
 so she does 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.070
 a couple of days 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.050
 it is necessary as it is not just for them though on the roads 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.100
 areas 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.200
 now only very good 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.130
 prepares a project 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.130
 Further 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.180
 according to rar 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.550
 in the second period co-host performance 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.210
 Vitaly Salenko 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.210
 in his speech can not be 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.800
 Khetaguri 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.680
 even after rehabilitation course 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.930
 disabled 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.620
 when higher 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.560
 Now 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.450
 came to such conclusions 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.450
 so if back in may export 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.830
 minimum interest rate 1 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.050
 recall 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.670
 Then Governor Alexey Gordeyev 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.670
 after project approval 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.910

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.530
 lifeguard players 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.560
 especially its data in the frame first 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.440
 queue it comes to selling any 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.520
 assets 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.029
 more fans 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:11.299
 unity 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:16.589

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:23.469
 00 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:27.639
 in another school 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.629

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.449
 2011 m 

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:41.449
 Of course not 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.769
 then two more times 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.689
 need today 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:49.459
 in may 2007 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.659
 but if we play since the breakup 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:52.549
 country 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.699
 choosing the surrounding area 

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:58.419
