00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
today I'm gonna be changing out of the

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.990 
today I'm gonna be changing out of the
making<00:00:16.260> handles<00:00:16.710> with<00:00:16.950> the<00:00:17.130> ceramic<00:00:17.790> disc

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
making handles with the ceramic disc

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.690 
making handles with the ceramic disc
cartridge<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:19.529> this<00:00:19.860> particular<00:00:20.160> unit<00:00:20.610> I'm

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:20.700 
cartridge and this particular unit I'm

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.790 
cartridge and this particular unit I'm
gonna<00:00:20.820> be<00:00:20.939> turning<00:00:21.090> off<00:00:21.360> the<00:00:21.599> water<00:00:21.630> at<00:00:22.529> the

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
gonna be turning off the water at the

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.710 
gonna be turning off the water at the
mean<00:00:22.950> water<00:00:23.279> shut<00:00:23.520> off<00:00:23.610> on<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.000> side<00:00:24.210> so

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
mean water shut off on the side so

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.470 
mean water shut off on the side so
there's<00:00:25.590> really<00:00:25.800> yeah<00:00:26.070> now<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:26.939> need<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.300> turn

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
there's really yeah now I need to turn

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.180 
there's really yeah now I need to turn
it<00:00:27.630> off<00:00:27.750> at<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.020> angle<00:00:28.349> stop<00:00:28.529> since<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.010> have

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:29.190 
it off at the angle stop since I have

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.010 
it off at the angle stop since I have
another<00:00:29.430> repaired<00:00:31.820> get<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.030> sign<00:00:33.510> up<00:00:33.540> and

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
another repaired get that sign up and

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.930 
another repaired get that sign up and
then<00:00:34.199> go<00:00:34.410> turn<00:00:34.650> off<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.949> water<00:00:37.790> looks<00:00:38.790> like

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
then go turn off the water looks like

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.900 
then go turn off the water looks like
the<00:00:39.059> full-size<00:00:39.540> leaky<00:00:39.960> -<00:00:40.580> time<00:00:41.580> to<00:00:41.699> change

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
the full-size leaky - time to change

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:51.530 
the full-size leaky - time to change
that<00:00:48.620> easy<00:00:49.620> changes<00:00:50.339> over<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:50.729> a<00:00:50.820> ceramic<00:00:51.089> disc

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
that easy changes over in a ceramic disc

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.350 
that easy changes over in a ceramic disc
cartridges<00:00:52.309> these<00:00:53.309> ones<00:00:53.549> are<00:00:53.729> compressional

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
cartridges these ones are compressional

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.229 
cartridges these ones are compressional
cartridges<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.229> get<00:00:55.710> rid<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.979> those<00:00:56.190> no<00:00:57.059> more

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
cartridges so get rid of those no more

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.899 
cartridges so get rid of those no more
squeeze<00:00:57.629> squeeze<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.920> particular<00:00:59.250> one<00:00:59.610> I

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
squeeze squeeze this particular one I

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:03.229 
squeeze squeeze this particular one I
just<00:01:00.210> shut<00:01:00.420> off<00:01:00.449> at<00:01:00.839> the<00:01:01.080> angle<00:01:01.860> stop<00:01:02.129> but<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
just shut off at the angle stop but the

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.830 
just shut off at the angle stop but the
hot<00:01:03.390> side<00:01:03.659> I'll<00:01:03.989> be<00:01:04.309> turning<00:01:05.309> off<00:01:07.130> outside<00:01:08.130> so

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
hot side I'll be turning off outside so

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.160 
hot side I'll be turning off outside so
there<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:09.960> go

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
there we go

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.430 
there we go
hold<00:01:10.530> side<00:01:10.799> first<00:01:11.299> got<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.479> water<00:01:12.990> turned<00:01:13.290> off

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
hold side first got the water turned off

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.280 
hold side first got the water turned off
I<00:01:13.770> was<00:01:14.729> gonna<00:01:14.909> prove<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.360> I'm<00:01:15.690> not<00:01:15.840> too<00:01:15.990> worried

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
I was gonna prove it I'm not too worried

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.349 
I was gonna prove it I'm not too worried
about<00:01:16.350> squeezing<00:01:16.859> these<00:01:17.159> today<00:01:17.369> but<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:18.240> know

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:18.359 
about squeezing these today but you know

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:19.580 
about squeezing these today but you know
usually<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.869> want<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.109> avoid<00:01:19.259> squeezing

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
usually you want to avoid squeezing

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.800 
usually you want to avoid squeezing
these<00:01:20.009> but<00:01:20.310> look<00:01:20.909> play<00:01:21.119> something's<00:01:21.509> up

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
these but look play something's up

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.300 
these but look play something's up
-<00:01:22.020> moves<00:01:22.380> out<00:01:22.590> anyway<00:01:23.039> with<00:01:23.969> the<00:01:24.979> ceramic<00:01:25.979> disc

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
- moves out anyway with the ceramic disc

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.480 
- moves out anyway with the ceramic disc
cartridges<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.180> still<00:01:27.359> hung<00:01:27.450> about<00:01:27.719> oh<00:01:28.490> man

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
cartridges I still hung about oh man

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:52.080 
cartridges I still hung about oh man

find out Noby then here's our new and
these<00:01:58.040> are<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.430> ceramic<00:01:59.030> disc<00:01:59.410> cartridges

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
these are the ceramic disc cartridges

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.700 
these are the ceramic disc cartridges
I've<00:02:00.590> been<00:02:00.740> raving<00:02:01.010> t<00:02:01.280> about<00:02:02.350> it's<00:02:03.350> got<00:02:03.530> this

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
I've been raving t about it's got this

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.970 
I've been raving t about it's got this
little<00:02:04.840> solid<00:02:05.840> washer<00:02:06.350> that<00:02:06.500> goes<00:02:06.710> on<00:02:06.890> the

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
little solid washer that goes on the

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.620 
little solid washer that goes on the
bottom<00:02:07.130> here<00:02:09.850> and<00:02:10.850> the<00:02:11.120> nice<00:02:11.300> thing<00:02:11.330> about

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
bottom here and the nice thing about

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.830 
bottom here and the nice thing about
this<00:02:12.110> is<00:02:12.410> there's<00:02:13.280> no<00:02:13.370> parts<00:02:14.270> to<00:02:14.450> wear<00:02:14.660> out

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
this is there's no parts to wear out

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.150 
this is there's no parts to wear out
here<00:02:15.140> everything<00:02:15.490> glides<00:02:16.600> against<00:02:17.600> itself<00:02:18.160> so

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
here everything glides against itself so

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.220 
here everything glides against itself so
it's<00:02:19.490> not<00:02:19.640> squeezing<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.660> only<00:02:20.900> time<00:02:21.080> it

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
it's not squeezing the only time it

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.170 
it's not squeezing the only time it
squeezes<00:02:21.770> is<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.190> first<00:02:22.400> time<00:02:22.670> that<00:02:22.910> you<00:02:22.970> put

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
squeezes is the first time that you put

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.360 
squeezes is the first time that you put
it<00:02:23.270> in<00:02:23.480> or<00:02:24.200> or<00:02:24.410> if<00:02:24.650> you<00:02:24.740> need<00:02:24.860> to<00:02:24.950> take<00:02:25.070> it<00:02:25.250> out

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
it in or or if you need to take it out

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.100 
it in or or if you need to take it out
and<00:02:25.520> put<00:02:25.670> it<00:02:25.700> back<00:02:25.820> in<00:02:26.150> but<00:02:26.420> instead<00:02:26.750> of<00:02:26.930> having

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
and put it back in but instead of having

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.640 
and put it back in but instead of having
a<00:02:27.400> constant<00:02:28.400> squeezing<00:02:29.240> I<00:02:29.420> don't<00:02:30.410> know<00:02:30.470> if<00:02:30.530> you

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
a constant squeezing I don't know if you

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.340 
a constant squeezing I don't know if you
can<00:02:30.800> see<00:02:31.100> this<00:02:31.280> one<00:02:31.520> too<00:02:31.790> well<00:02:32.030> but<00:02:32.350> inside

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
can see this one too well but inside

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.010 
can see this one too well but inside
there<00:02:33.740> there's<00:02:34.010> a<00:02:34.100> little<00:02:34.660> rubber<00:02:35.660> washer

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
there there's a little rubber washer

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.290 
there there's a little rubber washer
that<00:02:36.470> keeps<00:02:36.680> seating<00:02:37.160> and<00:02:37.610> it<00:02:37.760> gets<00:02:37.940> squeezed

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
that keeps seating and it gets squeezed

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.840 
that keeps seating and it gets squeezed
and<00:02:38.660> there's<00:02:38.780> also<00:02:38.990> an<00:02:39.590> o-ring<00:02:40.100> in<00:02:40.490> the<00:02:40.610> top

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
and there's also an o-ring in the top

00:02:40.850 --> 00:03:11.140 
and there's also an o-ring in the top
which<00:02:43.030> anyway

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.720 

here<00:03:12.150> we<00:03:12.240> go<00:03:13.670> it's<00:03:14.670> like<00:03:14.940> snow

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
here we go it's like snow

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.900 
here we go it's like snow
get<00:03:17.730> down<00:03:17.940> nice<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.420> snug<00:03:18.660> and<00:03:19.910> avoid

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
get down nice and snug and avoid

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:29.600 
get down nice and snug and avoid
squeezing<00:03:24.920> squish<00:03:25.920> anything<00:03:26.400> here<00:03:28.190> okay<00:03:29.190> so

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
squeezing squish anything here okay so

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.340 
squeezing squish anything here okay so
now<00:03:29.940> I<00:03:29.970> got<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.330> hot<00:03:30.660> water<00:03:30.690> turned<00:03:31.230> off

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
now I got the hot water turned off

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.400
