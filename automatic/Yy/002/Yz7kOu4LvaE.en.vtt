in<00:00:00.210> this<00:00:00.329> video<00:00:00.539> I'll<00:00:00.989> show<00:00:01.319> the<00:00:01.469> changes<00:00:01.829> for

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
in this video I'll show the changes for

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.519 
in this video I'll show the changes for
overgrowth<00:00:02.399> alpha<00:00:02.939> 123<00:00:03.750> which<00:00:04.140> you<00:00:04.259> can<00:00:04.350> try

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
overgrowth alpha 123 which you can try

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.619 
overgrowth alpha 123 which you can try
if<00:00:04.680> you've<00:00:04.830> pre-ordered<00:00:05.270> this<00:00:06.270> week<00:00:06.509> I

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
if you've pre-ordered this week I

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.390 
if you've pre-ordered this week I
started<00:00:06.960> working<00:00:07.170> on<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.620> AI<00:00:07.770> characters

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
started working on the AI characters

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.220 
started working on the AI characters
awareness<00:00:08.910> of<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.150> world<00:00:09.330> based<00:00:09.780> on<00:00:09.990> sight

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
awareness of the world based on sight

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.830 
awareness of the world based on sight
and<00:00:10.440> sound<00:00:10.679> I<00:00:11.150> started<00:00:12.150> by<00:00:12.300> limiting<00:00:12.660> their

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
and sound I started by limiting their

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.200 
and sound I started by limiting their
field<00:00:13.080> of<00:00:13.259> view<00:00:13.440> it's<00:00:14.070> about<00:00:14.280> 180<00:00:14.790> degrees

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
field of view it's about 180 degrees

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.120 
field of view it's about 180 degrees
right<00:00:15.420> now<00:00:15.480> but<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.260> peripheral<00:00:16.800> vision

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
right now but the peripheral vision

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.460 
right now but the peripheral vision
can't<00:00:17.369> see<00:00:17.550> very<00:00:17.580> far<00:00:17.880> if<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.960> step<00:00:19.170> into<00:00:19.350> a

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
can't see very far if you step into a

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.990 
can't see very far if you step into a
character's<00:00:19.920> field<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.340> view<00:00:20.460> while<00:00:20.730> he's<00:00:20.880> in

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
character's field of view while he's in

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.090 
character's field of view while he's in
hostile<00:00:21.420> mode<00:00:21.600> then<00:00:22.140> he'll<00:00:22.350> target<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.830> and

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
hostile mode then he'll target you and

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.880 
hostile mode then he'll target you and
start<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.430> chase<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.760> around<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:27.470> also<00:00:28.470> wanted

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
start to chase you around I also wanted

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.380 
start to chase you around I also wanted
to<00:00:29.010> make<00:00:29.160> sure<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.340> characters<00:00:29.910> can't<00:00:30.179> see

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
to make sure that characters can't see

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.749 
to make sure that characters can't see
through<00:00:30.630> walls<00:00:31.160> so<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.219> added<00:00:32.369> some<00:00:32.520> ray

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
through walls so I added some ray

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.760 
through walls so I added some ray

casting checks to determine if there's a
clear<00:00:35.010> line<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.250> sight<00:00:36.469> this<00:00:37.469> test<00:00:37.770> works<00:00:38.010> by

clear line of sight this test works by

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.770 
clear line of sight this test works by
casting<00:00:38.610> array<00:00:38.820> from<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.180> characters<00:00:39.570> eyes

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
casting array from the characters eyes

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.569 
casting array from the characters eyes
to<00:00:40.260> random<00:00:40.649> point<00:00:40.829> on<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.129> target<00:00:41.340> and

to random point on the target and
checking<00:00:42.149> for<00:00:42.270> intersections<00:00:43.789> this<00:00:44.789> is

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
checking for intersections this is

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.369 
checking for intersections this is
pretty<00:00:45.120> efficient<00:00:45.600> because<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:46.020> only<00:00:46.140> does

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
pretty efficient because it only does

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
one raycast at a time it also adds some

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.770 
one raycast at a time it also adds some
realism<00:00:50.039> by<00:00:50.520> making<00:00:50.730> characters<00:00:51.120> notice<00:00:51.570> full

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
realism by making characters notice full

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.569 
realism by making characters notice full
exposure<00:00:52.110> faster<00:00:52.949> than<00:00:52.980> they<00:00:53.219> noted<00:00:53.489> it's

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
exposure faster than they noted it's

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.100 
exposure faster than they noted it's
just<00:00:53.760> an<00:00:53.879> ear<00:00:54.090> or<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.390> flood<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.899> side<00:00:55.079> of

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
just an ear or a flood that side of

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
covering rabbits aren't especially known

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.369 
covering rabbits aren't especially known
for<00:00:59.399> their<00:00:59.699> keen<00:00:59.940> eyesight<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.079> was<00:01:01.199> also

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
for their keen eyesight so it was also

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.880 
for their keen eyesight so it was also
important<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.980> add<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.160> sense<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.579> hearing<00:01:03.890> to

important to add a sense of hearing to

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.830 
important to add a sense of hearing to

do that I headed a system to track sound

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.840 
do that I headed a system to track sound

of<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> sound<00:01:12.740> this<00:01:13.740> means<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.159> still

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
of the sound this means you can still

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.010 
of the sound this means you can still
sneak<00:01:14.700> pretty<00:01:14.970> close<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> guard<00:01:15.630> with<00:01:15.750> quiet

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
steps but if you jump around or fall

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:32.210 
steps but if you jump around or fall
over<00:01:18.270> then<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.840> can<00:01:18.990> hear<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.290> from<00:01:19.409> far<00:01:19.680> away

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.680 

now<00:01:32.370> that<00:01:32.610> it's<00:01:32.760> possible<00:01:32.940> to<00:01:33.210> hide<00:01:33.480> behind

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
now that it's possible to hide behind

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.380 
now that it's possible to hide behind
objects<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:35.220> AI<00:01:35.370> has<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.910> figure<00:01:36.060> out<00:01:36.240> what<00:01:36.360> to

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
objects the AI has to figure out what to

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.310 
objects the AI has to figure out what to
do<00:01:36.600> if<00:01:36.720> its<00:01:36.870> target<00:01:37.230> disappears<00:01:38.870> for<00:01:39.870> now<00:01:40.020> I

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
do if its target disappears for now I

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.380 
do if its target disappears for now I
just<00:01:40.740> made<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.130> assume<00:01:41.550> that<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.940> target<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.330> a

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
just made it assume that the target is a

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.300 
just made it assume that the target is a
newtonian<00:01:42.930> object<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.800> will<00:01:43.950> just<00:01:44.160> keep

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
newtonian object that will just keep

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.910 
newtonian object that will just keep
moving<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.730> the<00:01:44.820> same<00:01:44.940> direction<00:01:45.560> this<00:01:46.560> isn't

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
moving in the same direction this isn't

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.770 
moving in the same direction this isn't
a<00:01:46.980> very<00:01:47.130> good<00:01:47.250> assumption<00:01:47.670> but<00:01:48.510> i'll<00:01:48.660> add

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
a very good assumption but i'll add

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.840 
a very good assumption but i'll add
better<00:01:49.020> searching<00:01:49.440> behavior<00:01:49.830> later<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.340> for

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
better searching behavior later and for

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.490 
better searching behavior later and for
now<00:01:50.880> it's<00:01:51.150> fun<00:01:51.330> to<00:01:51.360> trick<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.750> AI<00:01:51.900> into<00:01:52.350> going

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
now it's fun to trick the AI into going

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:02.270 
now it's fun to trick the AI into going
the<00:01:52.680> wrong<00:01:52.800> way<00:02:00.080> that's<00:02:01.080> it<00:02:01.230> for<00:02:01.260> this<00:02:01.470> week<00:02:01.530> if

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
the wrong way that's it for this week if

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.830 
the wrong way that's it for this week if
you'd<00:02:02.490> like<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.670> preorder<00:02:02.970> and<00:02:03.330> try<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.510> Alpha

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
you'd like to preorder and try the Alpha
