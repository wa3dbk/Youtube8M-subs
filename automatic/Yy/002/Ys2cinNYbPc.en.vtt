00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.910
 really started a long time ago 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.650
 chiquitita little time in about 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.960

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.400

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.380
 years or so they gave me my first 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.529
 cookbook after going follow 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.560
 practicing with the dentist books and 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.980
 newspaper clippings from magazines 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.140
 Blog 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.230
 basically started a year and a half ago 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.570
 it all started with facebook emptying dishes and 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.430
 I put them on my profile and people 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.530
 began to ask the recipes and that 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.020
 I was wearing and how I was doing it and that's how I 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.739
 I ventured but well let's do the 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.149
 blog and the focus basically mine is 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.100
 fast and delicious recipes that all 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.520
 we can do currently has more than 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.930
 20,000 visits and more than a thousand fans I 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.820
 I feel super proud to see 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.949
 when people tell me I made the recipe 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.600
 It was really good for me 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.460
 family and that brings me a 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.530
 very great satisfaction that has been a 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.360
 love story is a kitchen and this is 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.020
 let's say at my best I love 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.020
 easy 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.010
 let's make the lack of water from the 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.620
 10 years for the end is a dough 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.660
 extremely practical will not fail you 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.180
 I guarantee that it does have a little secret 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.280
 which is the bar of the sea along with 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.040
 flour and water we are going to mix the flour 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.870
 with margarine and let's make a guy 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.610
 of orona using nothing but the tip of 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.170
 the fingers and also the little ones of the 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.520
 house could help us do this is 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.920
 important I peel children in the 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.510
 cooks so that in that feeling of 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.950
 achievement of putting effort into something that is 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.690
 that is a very rich result that everything 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.760
 the world can enjoy 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.560
 and when we have an hour once and 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.480
 we are going to incorporate water from 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.420
 ice little by little until we have left 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.040
 an extremely moldable texture we are going to 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.890
 put the pasta on a piece of paper 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.750
 film and we put it in the network so that 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.820
 cool a little while the pasta is 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.830
 is cooling down let's prepare the 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.550
 filling the apple for that we're going to 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.230
 peel and chop five apples or four 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.250
 depending on the size of the mold 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.290
 cinnamon and nutmeg sugar and a 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.110
 little bit of lemon peel and a little 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.080
 of the juice and a species called old 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.910
 spice or jamaica pepper that is a 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.610
 combination like between clove and walnut 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.620
 moscada and this we are going to do the 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.200
 chromebook or the boronas that are going to go 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.410
 over then we are going to mix flour 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.890
 oatmeal sugar 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.230
 and some nuts and we are going to stir these 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.000
 good terms thick when we do 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.040
 sweet preparations like this 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.440
 chrome bol we need to throw usually 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.390
 a pinch of salt which enhances 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.160
 sweet in this case we do not need it 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.930
 because you are encouraged by the number 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.910
 three 'delicious to make a puree quoted 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.590
 an egg half we do it as well as 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.060
 Sighs and we put them in the oven and 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.340
 they do so big and the hamsters in so 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.510
 cute and taste delicious at this time 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.550
 already the pasta will be what 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.190
 cold enough we're going to take it out 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.280
 we throw them a little bit and we're going to 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.010
 press in the mold and we will add 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.740
 the apples and finally the chromebook 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.710
 we put some slices of normar by 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:25.020
 over and we put it in the oven and 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.120
 we would do about 350 as a 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.610
 good that you have to see it the smell that is going to 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.810
 have the house is delicious good I challenge it 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.510
 more interesting is that I have had in the 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.760
 kitchen was that I set out to cook and 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.590
 keep making meals without repeating my 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.760
 record are six months without repeating 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.760
 then it is possible 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.980
 all right
