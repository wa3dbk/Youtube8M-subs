00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
although I can't really remember it

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.550 
although I can't really remember it
because<00:01:25.479> I'm<00:01:25.720> a<00:01:25.750> bit<00:01:25.869> of<00:01:25.960> an<00:01:26.050> idiot<00:01:26.140> and<00:01:26.470> I'm

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
because I'm a bit of an idiot and I'm

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.870 
because I'm a bit of an idiot and I'm
really<00:01:26.800> busy<00:01:26.979> throughout<00:01:27.310> most<00:01:27.520> of<00:01:27.640> the<00:01:27.729> day

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
really busy throughout most of the day
