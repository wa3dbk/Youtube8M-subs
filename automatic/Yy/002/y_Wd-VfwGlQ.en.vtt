I'm<00:00:01.079> sitting<00:00:01.469> in<00:00:01.589> a<00:00:01.890> Chevy<00:00:02.429> Silverado<00:00:02.939> 1500

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:04.940 
I'm sitting in a Chevy Silverado 1500

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
I'm sitting in a Chevy Silverado 1500
2003<00:00:05.940> it's<00:00:06.569> got<00:00:06.810> a<00:00:06.859> 5.3<00:00:07.859> liter<00:00:08.309> v8<00:00:08.840> engine<00:00:09.840> in

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
2003 it's got a 5.3 liter v8 engine in

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.290 
2003 it's got a 5.3 liter v8 engine in
it<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.580> I'm<00:00:11.580> going<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:11.730> show<00:00:11.820> you<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:11.969> problem

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
it and I'm going to show you the problem

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:21.710 
it and I'm going to show you the problem
I'm<00:00:12.420> having

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.390 

if<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.260> look<00:00:22.470> at<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.710> oil<00:00:22.920> pressure<00:00:23.250> gauge

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
if you look at the oil pressure gauge

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.760 
if you look at the oil pressure gauge
you<00:00:24.000> see<00:00:24.150> how<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.390> jerked<00:00:24.779> up<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.170> back<00:00:25.350> and

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770 
you see how it jerked up and back and

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.540 
you see how it jerked up and back and
out<00:00:26.460> sitting<00:00:26.850> at<00:00:27.029> zero<00:00:28.070> it's<00:00:29.070> been<00:00:29.250> like<00:00:29.400> this

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
out sitting at zero it's been like this

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.370 
out sitting at zero it's been like this
for<00:00:29.610> a<00:00:29.790> little<00:00:29.880> while<00:00:30.150> now<00:00:30.450> obviously<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.259> don't

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
for a little while now obviously I don't

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.200 
for a little while now obviously I don't
have<00:00:31.560> zero<00:00:31.920> oil<00:00:31.980> pressure<00:00:32.460> my<00:00:32.970> engine

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
have zero oil pressure my engine

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.259 
have zero oil pressure my engine
wouldn't<00:00:33.480> be<00:00:33.540> running<00:00:33.690> still<00:00:36.470> but<00:00:38.180> let's<00:00:39.180> see

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
wouldn't be running still but let's see

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:42.520 
wouldn't be running still but let's see
if<00:00:39.300> we<00:00:39.420> can<00:00:39.510> solve<00:00:39.720> this<00:00:39.870> problem

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.810 

all<00:00:43.530> right<00:00:43.650> so<00:00:43.830> most<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.220> time<00:00:44.430> when<00:00:44.730> you

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
all right so most of the time when you

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.220 
all right so most of the time when you
got<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.970> gauge<00:00:45.239> that's<00:00:45.449> acting<00:00:45.809> funny<00:00:45.989> like

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
got a gauge that's acting funny like

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.189 
got a gauge that's acting funny like
that<00:00:47.059> it's<00:00:48.059> it's<00:00:48.330> going<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.629> be<00:00:48.750> your<00:00:48.930> oil

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 
that it's it's going to be your oil

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.590 
that it's it's going to be your oil
sending<00:00:49.739> unit<00:00:52.129> that's<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.550> sensor<00:00:54.149> that's

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
sending unit that's the sensor that's

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.560 
sending unit that's the sensor that's
mounted<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.110> back<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.469> engine<00:00:55.620> that

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
mounted on the back of the engine that

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.150 
mounted on the back of the engine that
sends<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.629> signal<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.110> gauge<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.800> lets

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
sends a signal to that gauge and lets

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.490 
sends a signal to that gauge and lets
them<00:00:59.219> know<00:00:59.280> what<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.550> oil<00:00:59.579> pressure<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.500> so

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
them know what the oil pressure is so

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.290 
them know what the oil pressure is so
first<00:01:02.010> thing<00:01:02.129> we<00:01:02.219> need<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.460> do<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.850> get<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.180> that

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
first thing we need to do to get to that

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.749 
first thing we need to do to get to that
is<00:01:03.480> remove<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.140> top<00:01:04.860> cover<00:01:05.220> here<00:01:05.489> it's

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
is remove this top cover here it's

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.279 
is remove this top cover here it's
really<00:01:06.030> easy<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.360> do<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.840> it's<00:01:07.830> just<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.039> 5/16

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:09.289 
really easy to do and it's just a 5/16

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:14.930 
really easy to do and it's just a 5/16
socket<00:01:10.369> one<00:01:11.369> bolt<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:12.000> we'll<00:01:12.450> do<00:01:12.539> that<00:01:12.660> now<00:01:13.940> all

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
socket one bolt so we'll do that now all

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.310 
socket one bolt so we'll do that now all
right<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.240> I've<00:01:15.330> got<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.539> cover<00:01:15.750> taken<00:01:16.140> off

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
right so I've got the cover taken off

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.410 
right so I've got the cover taken off
and<00:01:16.680> I'm<00:01:17.340> going<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.490> do<00:01:17.610> my<00:01:17.729> best<00:01:17.910> to<00:01:18.090> show<00:01:18.330> you

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
and I'm going to do my best to show you

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.779 
and I'm going to do my best to show you
where<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.690> sensor<00:01:19.050> is<00:01:19.080> using<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:19.789> iPhone

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 
where the sensor is using this iPhone

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:23.600 
where the sensor is using this iPhone
camera<00:01:21.180> here<00:01:22.039> coming<00:01:23.039> from<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.220> front<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.550> the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
camera here coming from the front of the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
camera here coming from the front of the
engine<00:01:25.220> just<00:01:26.220> go<00:01:26.369> straight<00:01:26.700> back<00:01:27.349> all<00:01:28.349> the<00:01:28.709> way

there<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.720> have<00:01:42.870> it<00:01:43.730> way<00:01:44.730> down<00:01:45.360> there<00:01:48.170> all

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
there you have it way down there all

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.090 
there you have it way down there all
right<00:01:49.320> there's<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.530> couple<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.830> things<00:01:50.010> you're

90 for it but this one will do just fine
and<00:02:06.690> save<00:02:06.930> myself<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.380> few<00:02:07.530> dollars<00:02:08.240> so<00:02:09.240> take<00:02:09.990> a

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
and save myself a few dollars so take a

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.050 
and save myself a few dollars so take a
look<00:02:10.200> at<00:02:10.320> that<00:02:10.550> this<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:11.640> what<00:02:11.790> we're<00:02:11.910> going<00:02:12.030> to

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
look at that this is what we're going to

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.330 
look at that this is what we're going to
be<00:02:12.180> pulling<00:02:12.450> out<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:13.700> putting<00:02:14.700> back<00:02:14.820> in<00:02:16.340> it's

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
be pulling out and putting back in it's

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.960 
be pulling out and putting back in it's
got<00:02:17.600> three<00:02:18.600> wires<00:02:18.810> that<00:02:19.050> connect<00:02:19.350> to<00:02:19.410> it

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
got three wires that connect to it

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.480 
got three wires that connect to it
pretty<00:02:20.970> simple<00:02:21.620> just<00:02:22.620> screws<00:02:22.890> right<00:02:23.130> into<00:02:23.280> the

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
pretty simple just screws right into the

you're going to need a 1 and 16 1 and
1/16<00:02:31.410> inch<00:02:31.650> socket<00:02:31.980> for<00:02:32.520> this<00:02:33.709> if<00:02:34.709> you<00:02:34.920> have<00:02:35.070> an

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
1/16 inch socket for this if you have an

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.280 
1/16 inch socket for this if you have an
impact<00:02:35.610> like<00:02:35.940> this<00:02:36.239> it's<00:02:36.690> not<00:02:36.930> going<00:02:37.110> to<00:02:37.170> work

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
impact like this it's not going to work

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.000 
impact like this it's not going to work
it's<00:02:38.190> too<00:02:38.489> big<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:40.170> side<00:02:40.380> walls<00:02:40.680> are<00:02:40.830> too

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
it's too big the side walls are too

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.320 
it's too big the side walls are too
thick<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.580> you<00:02:41.640> won't<00:02:41.850> be<00:02:41.910> able<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.090> get<00:02:42.239> it

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
thick and you won't be able to get it

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.320 
thick and you won't be able to get it
back<00:02:42.480> there<00:02:42.690> on<00:02:42.840> top<00:02:43.110> of<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.350> sensor<00:02:44.120> so<00:02:45.120> what

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
back there on top of the sensor so what

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.330 
back there on top of the sensor so what
you<00:02:45.450> really<00:02:45.570> need<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.900> do<00:02:46.140> is<00:02:46.830> get<00:02:47.070> one<00:02:47.250> of

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
you really need to do is get one of

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.210 
you really need to do is get one of
these<00:02:47.430> I<00:02:48.620> don't<00:02:49.620> know<00:02:49.680> if<00:02:49.739> you<00:02:49.830> can<00:02:49.950> tell<00:02:50.160> very

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
these I don't know if you can tell very

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.410 
these I don't know if you can tell very
well<00:02:50.670> but<00:02:50.910> this<00:02:51.060> is<00:02:51.209> much<00:02:51.450> thinner<00:02:53.239> than<00:02:54.239> this

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
well but this is much thinner than this

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.020 
well but this is much thinner than this
other<00:02:54.630> socket<00:02:55.170> so<00:02:55.860> it<00:02:55.980> can<00:02:56.130> get<00:02:56.250> in<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.519> much

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
other socket so it can get in a much

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.120 
other socket so it can get in a much
tighter<00:02:57.269> space<00:02:57.769> this<00:02:58.769> one's<00:02:58.950> actually

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
tighter space this one's actually

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.040 
tighter space this one's actually
designed<00:02:59.670> specifically<00:03:00.269> for<00:03:00.390> pulling<00:03:00.870> oil

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
designed specifically for pulling oil

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.490 
designed specifically for pulling oil
pressure<00:03:01.350> sensors<00:03:02.690> you<00:03:03.690> can<00:03:03.720> get<00:03:04.019> this<00:03:04.140> at<00:03:04.350> all

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
pressure sensors you can get this at all

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.259 
pressure sensors you can get this at all
design<00:03:04.860> I<00:03:05.070> found<00:03:05.310> this<00:03:05.459> one<00:03:05.700> is<00:03:05.820> about<00:03:06.060> ten

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
design I found this one is about ten

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.740 
design I found this one is about ten
dollars<00:03:07.190> which<00:03:08.190> is<00:03:08.340> a<00:03:08.370> lot<00:03:08.550> less<00:03:08.760> than<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:09.060> $90

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
dollars which is a lot less than the $90

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.509 
dollars which is a lot less than the $90
that<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:10.140> dealer<00:03:10.560> wanted<00:03:10.830> to<00:03:10.920> replace<00:03:11.250> this

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
that the dealer wanted to replace this

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.060 
that the dealer wanted to replace this
so<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:13.410> other<00:03:13.530> thing<00:03:13.680> you're<00:03:13.769> going<00:03:13.800> to<00:03:13.950> need

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
so the other thing you're going to need

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.320 
so the other thing you're going to need
just<00:03:14.610> regular<00:03:14.940> ratchet<00:03:15.360> extension<00:03:16.110> and<00:03:17.330> it

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
just regular ratchet extension and it

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.330 
just regular ratchet extension and it
may<00:03:18.540> help<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:18.840> have<00:03:18.870> an<00:03:19.230> articulating<00:03:22.340> socket

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
may help to have an articulating socket

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.660 
may help to have an articulating socket
on<00:03:23.459> it<00:03:23.580> so<00:03:24.300> let's<00:03:24.450> see<00:03:24.570> if<00:03:24.630> we<00:03:24.660> can<00:03:24.810> do<00:03:24.900> all

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
on it so let's see if we can do all

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.509 
on it so let's see if we can do all
right<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:26.970> first<00:03:27.120> thing<00:03:27.269> you<00:03:27.450> have<00:03:27.780> to<00:03:27.840> do<00:03:28.080> is

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
right the first thing you have to do is

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.020 
right the first thing you have to do is
pull<00:03:29.519> this<00:03:29.640> plug<00:03:29.910> off

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
pull this plug off

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.970 
pull this plug off
thank<00:03:31.630> you<00:03:31.780> see<00:03:31.930> I<00:03:31.960> got<00:03:32.140> my<00:03:32.200> finger<00:03:32.530> on<00:03:32.590> it<00:03:32.710> here

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
it's pretty easy you just got to lift

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.360 
it's pretty easy you just got to lift
this<00:03:34.660> tab<00:03:34.930> up<00:03:34.960> like<00:03:35.410> this<00:03:36.510> all<00:03:37.510> the<00:03:37.720> way<00:03:37.840> and

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
this tab up like this all the way and

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.910 
this tab up like this all the way and
then<00:03:39.370> it<00:03:39.490> should<00:03:39.670> come<00:03:39.850> loose<00:03:43.440> just<00:03:44.440> like<00:03:44.680> that

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
then it should come loose just like that

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.520 
then it should come loose just like that
piece<00:03:45.670> of<00:03:45.850> cake

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
piece of cake

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
you can pull this wire just leave it

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.340 
you can pull this wire just leave it
there<00:03:50.320> out<00:03:50.620> of<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.860> way<00:03:51.870> let<00:03:52.870> it<00:03:53.020> sit<00:03:53.200> there

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
there out of the way let it sit there

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.130 
there out of the way let it sit there
that's<00:03:53.560> fine<00:03:53.740> and<00:03:54.010> you<00:03:54.070> can<00:03:54.130> see<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.900> top<00:03:56.110> of

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
that's fine and you can see the top of

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
that's fine and you can see the top of
the<00:03:56.380> oil<00:03:56.560> pressure<00:03:57.480> sender<00:03:58.480> right<00:03:58.810> there<00:03:59.160> and

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
the oil pressure sender right there and

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.470 
the oil pressure sender right there and
we<00:04:00.280> got<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.460> get<00:04:00.580> our<00:04:00.700> socket<00:04:00.940> and<00:04:01.210> put<00:04:01.360> it<00:04:01.420> over

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
we got to get our socket and put it over

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.540 
we got to get our socket and put it over
there<00:04:01.750> and<00:04:02.490> take<00:04:03.490> it<00:04:03.610> off<00:04:04.920> all<00:04:05.920> right<00:04:06.250> as<00:04:06.400> you

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
there and take it off all right as you

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.430 
there and take it off all right as you
can<00:04:06.670> see<00:04:06.910> now<00:04:07.740> I've<00:04:08.740> got<00:04:09.010> the<00:04:09.190> socket<00:04:10.440> down

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
can see now I've got the socket down

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.590 
can see now I've got the socket down
there<00:04:12.209> placed<00:04:13.209> over<00:04:13.450> in<00:04:13.720> the<00:04:14.760> center<00:04:15.760> it's

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
there placed over in the center it's

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.930 
there placed over in the center it's
locked<00:04:16.900> on<00:04:17.109> there<00:04:17.350> no<00:04:18.220> problem

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
locked on there no problem

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.230 
locked on there no problem
now<00:04:19.600> with<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:19.930> larger<00:04:20.470> socket<00:04:20.980> you<00:04:21.940> see<00:04:22.090> that

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
now with the larger socket you see that

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.690 
now with the larger socket you see that
bolt<00:04:22.510> there<00:04:22.690> was<00:04:22.870> getting<00:04:23.080> in<00:04:23.140> the<00:04:23.230> way<00:04:23.380> and<00:04:23.700> I

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
bolt there was getting in the way and I

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.010 
bolt there was getting in the way and I
wasn't<00:04:25.060> able<00:04:25.240> to<00:04:25.360> put<00:04:25.510> it<00:04:25.630> all<00:04:25.720> the<00:04:25.810> way<00:04:25.870> over

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
wasn't able to put it all the way over

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.890 
wasn't able to put it all the way over
so<00:04:26.730> this<00:04:27.730> one<00:04:27.940> just<00:04:27.970> slipped<00:04:28.300> right<00:04:28.390> over<00:04:28.780> no

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
so this one just slipped right over no

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.780 
so this one just slipped right over no
problem<00:04:29.350> all<00:04:30.010> I<00:04:30.160> got<00:04:30.310> to<00:04:30.400> do<00:04:30.490> is<00:04:30.610> hook<00:04:30.730> a

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
problem all I got to do is hook a

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.120 
problem all I got to do is hook a
ratchet<00:04:31.210> to<00:04:31.360> it<00:04:31.540> and<00:04:31.750> I'll<00:04:32.620> pull<00:04:32.830> this<00:04:32.890> thing

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
ratchet to it and I'll pull this thing

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.850 
ratchet to it and I'll pull this thing
out<00:04:33.250> of<00:04:33.310> here<00:04:33.580> piece<00:04:34.210> of<00:04:34.240> cake<00:04:34.480> I'm<00:04:35.470> gonna<00:04:35.590> set

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
out of here piece of cake I'm gonna set

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.990 
out of here piece of cake I'm gonna set
the<00:04:35.950> camera<00:04:36.280> down<00:04:36.310> while<00:04:36.640> I<00:04:36.669> do<00:04:36.790> that<00:04:39.000> all

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.020 
the camera down while I do that all
right<00:04:40.180> here's<00:04:40.690> the<00:04:40.750> old<00:04:41.290> sensor<00:04:41.790> that<00:04:42.790> I<00:04:42.880> just

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
right here's the old sensor that I just

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.870 
right here's the old sensor that I just
pulled<00:04:43.270> out<00:04:43.480> I<00:04:43.980> don't<00:04:44.980> think<00:04:45.040> didn't<00:04:45.700> take<00:04:45.790> me

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
pulled out I don't think didn't take me

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.130 
pulled out I don't think didn't take me
very<00:04:45.940> long<00:04:46.120> at<00:04:46.360> all<00:04:46.419> to<00:04:46.479> get<00:04:46.600> this<00:04:46.720> out

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.290 

you<00:04:50.140> see<00:04:50.530> it<00:04:50.650> it's<00:04:51.160> the<00:04:51.220> same<00:04:51.460> thing<00:04:51.520> as<00:04:51.940> what's

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
you see it it's the same thing as what's

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.710 
you see it it's the same thing as what's
going<00:04:52.360> in<00:04:52.690> here<00:04:52.720> so<00:04:53.380> the<00:04:53.440> replacement<00:04:53.710> part

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
going in here so the replacement part

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:01.170 
going in here so the replacement part
same<00:04:55.720> plug<00:04:56.110> and<00:04:56.890> everything<00:04:59.940> it's<00:05:00.940> not<00:05:01.030> all

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
same plug and everything it's not all

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.409 
same plug and everything it's not all
you<00:05:01.240> going<00:05:01.360> to<00:05:01.419> do<00:05:01.540> just<00:05:01.930> put<00:05:02.140> this<00:05:02.260> back<00:05:02.530> in

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
you going to do just put this back in

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.300 
you going to do just put this back in
I'll<00:05:04.419> show<00:05:04.810> you

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
I'll show you

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.930 
I'll show you
now<00:05:07.310> there's<00:05:07.850> a<00:05:07.910> hole<00:05:08.120> back<00:05:08.390> there<00:05:09.610> so<00:05:10.610> all<00:05:10.820> I

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
now there's a hole back there so all I

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:19.510 
now there's a hole back there so all I
got<00:05:11.090> to<00:05:11.120> do<00:05:13.030> is<00:05:14.030> reach<00:05:14.270> around<00:05:18.220> thread<00:05:19.220> the<00:05:19.370> new

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
got to do is reach around thread the new

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:26.890 
got to do is reach around thread the new
one<00:05:19.700> into<00:05:19.850> that<00:05:25.210> probably<00:05:26.210> more<00:05:26.390> easily<00:05:26.630> said

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
one into that probably more easily said

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:35.320 
one into that probably more easily said
than<00:05:27.110> done<00:05:27.140> a<00:05:32.110> pretty<00:05:33.110> coarse<00:05:33.470> thread<00:05:33.830> so<00:05:34.330> it

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
than done a pretty coarse thread so it

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.480 
than done a pretty coarse thread so it
should<00:05:35.600> go<00:05:35.780> in<00:05:35.960> fairly<00:05:36.440> easily<00:05:39.160> all<00:05:40.160> right<00:05:40.280> got

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
should go in fairly easily all right got

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.640 
should go in fairly easily all right got
the<00:05:40.520> thread<00:05:40.820> started<00:05:41.270> now<00:05:41.450> hmm<00:05:42.080> took<00:05:42.380> a<00:05:42.500> couple

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
the thread started now hmm took a couple

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.250 
the thread started now hmm took a couple
seconds<00:05:43.130> but<00:05:43.250> pretty<00:05:43.730> easy<00:05:43.990> I'm<00:05:44.990> gonna<00:05:45.140> go

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
seconds but pretty easy I'm gonna go

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.170 
seconds but pretty easy I'm gonna go
grab<00:05:45.440> the<00:05:45.500> socket<00:05:46.010> we'll<00:05:46.430> place<00:05:46.640> that<00:05:46.670> over

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
grab the socket we'll place that over

grab the socket we'll place that over
and<00:05:47.410> tighten<00:05:48.410> her<00:05:48.500> down<00:05:49.420> and<00:05:50.420> hook<00:05:50.960> up<00:05:51.140> this

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
and tighten her down and hook up this

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.470 
and tighten her down and hook up this
connector<00:05:52.070> and<00:05:52.310> we'll<00:05:52.460> be<00:05:52.580> done<00:05:55.120> all<00:05:56.120> righty<00:05:56.330> I

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
do not want to strip those two heads up

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.980 
do not want to strip those two heads up
and<00:06:05.990> the<00:06:06.230> last<00:06:06.440> thing<00:06:06.710> we<00:06:06.830> need<00:06:06.950> to<00:06:06.980> do<00:06:07.220> here<00:06:07.490> is

and the last thing we need to do here is

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:14.200 
and the last thing we need to do here is
put<00:06:08.990> this<00:06:09.230> connector<00:06:09.740> back<00:06:09.890> up<00:06:12.730> and<00:06:13.730> you<00:06:14.000> know

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
put this connector back up and you know

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:20.040 
put this connector back up and you know
it<00:06:14.930> only<00:06:15.080> goes<00:06:15.320> on<00:06:15.500> one<00:06:15.560> way<00:06:15.920> so<00:06:17.350> it's<00:06:18.350> not<00:06:18.530> too

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
it only goes on one way so it's not too

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.670 
it only goes on one way so it's not too
kind<00:06:21.050> of<00:06:21.080> foolproof<00:06:21.320> as<00:06:21.680> far<00:06:21.950> as<00:06:22.160> so<00:06:23.590> open<00:06:24.590> it

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:24.680 
kind of foolproof as far as so open it

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.250 
kind of foolproof as far as so open it
up<00:06:24.770> wrong<00:06:25.420> I'll<00:06:26.420> just<00:06:26.600> set<00:06:26.780> this<00:06:26.900> right<00:06:27.110> back

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:27.260 
up wrong I'll just set this right back

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:39.189 
up wrong I'll just set this right back
in<00:06:27.470> here<00:06:29.350> and<00:06:30.350> push<00:06:31.100> it<00:06:31.250> all<00:06:31.370> the<00:06:31.490> way

all right so here we are back in the

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.480 
all right so here we are back in the
truck<00:07:09.080> we're<00:07:09.710> going<00:07:09.830> to<00:07:09.889> see<00:07:09.979> if<00:07:10.069> this<00:07:10.219> thing

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:10.490 
truck we're going to see if this thing

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:19.329 
truck we're going to see if this thing
is<00:07:10.969> fixed<00:07:11.210> now<00:07:11.830> go<00:07:12.830> in<00:07:13.039> start<00:07:13.699> up<00:07:18.189> alright<00:07:19.189> as

00:07:19.329 --> 00:07:19.339 
is fixed now go in start up alright as

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:22.659 
is fixed now go in start up alright as
you<00:07:19.460> can<00:07:19.580> see<00:07:19.879> now<00:07:21.039> it<00:07:22.039> looks<00:07:22.249> like<00:07:22.339> the<00:07:22.639> oil

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:22.669 
you can see now it looks like the oil

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:26.739 
you can see now it looks like the oil
pressure<00:07:23.330> is<00:07:23.749> reading<00:07:24.139> normal<00:07:24.499> and<00:07:25.509> if<00:07:26.509> I<00:07:26.629> hit

00:07:26.739 --> 00:07:26.749 
pressure is reading normal and if I hit

00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:29.469 
pressure is reading normal and if I hit
the<00:07:26.900> accelerator<00:07:27.610> it<00:07:28.610> should<00:07:28.879> go<00:07:28.999> up<00:07:29.029> some

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:29.479 
the accelerator it should go up some

00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:33.189 
the accelerator it should go up some
which<00:07:29.990> is<00:07:30.020> also<00:07:30.919> completely<00:07:31.550> normal<00:07:31.879> so<00:07:32.199> it

00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:33.199 
which is also completely normal so it
