 This is the clip he's got. 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:23.909
 feeling it will feel the vibration of the 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.979
 The rope that the person touches is 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.630

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.219

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:59.450
 He is on your left and has just 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:02.329

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:07.689
 Missing, we 'll go there, then. 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:23.720
 again it will tighten until you see the 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:26.870
 green light appears fixed cell 'is 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:35.390

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:36.950
 fifth string iam libya is playing the 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.780
 fifth the rope goes 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.910
 let's look at digital tuner linen 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:48.590
 Notice that it's yellow. 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:51.889
 the five scientific fifth aaa scene and 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.769
 The code is there from there, and the 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:59.510
 means that it is set to 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:08.690
 guitar or guitar well the natasha ball 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:12.980
 fifth rope and squeeze in rate to the top 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.380
 again until the green color appears as 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.069

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:23.660
 perfect now play the fourth string 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:25.959
 Touch us, wake up, wake up, wake up 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.959

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:47.900
 again 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:52.000
 For example, let's give an example 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.000
 that if I push too hard, it will ring again 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.110
 Well, there it is red means that 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:03.090
 Then you'll have to go back to 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:07.820
 rate and loosen the rope until I am 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:14.490

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:41.460
 tuning for the note there is the 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:45.630
 vibration at the world frequency used 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:48.570
 to tune the note there that is 440 harry 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:53.430

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:30.320
