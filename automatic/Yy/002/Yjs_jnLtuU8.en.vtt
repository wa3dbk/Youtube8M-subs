hi<00:00:01.260> guys<00:00:01.469> I<00:00:01.740> met<00:00:01.920> Hetherington<00:00:02.370> with<00:00:02.550> table

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
hi guys I met Hetherington with table

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.059 
hi guys I met Hetherington with table
house<00:00:03.000> 11.com<00:00:03.959> and<00:00:04.230> today<00:00:04.529> I'll<00:00:04.680> be<00:00:04.710> doing<00:00:05.009> a

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
house 11.com and today I'll be doing a

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.249 
house 11.com and today I'll be doing a
review<00:00:05.100> of<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.580> DHS<00:00:06.060> three-star<00:00:06.750> plastic

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
review of the DHS three-star plastic

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:14.509 
review of the DHS three-star plastic
ball<00:00:11.240> for<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.360> review<00:00:12.719> we<00:00:12.900> compared<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.980> DHS

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
ball for the review we compared the DHS

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.590 
ball for the review we compared the DHS
ball<00:00:14.820> with<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.780> regular<00:00:16.410> three<00:00:16.680> star<00:00:16.949> butterfly

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
ball with a regular three star butterfly

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.019 
ball with a regular three star butterfly
does<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:18.750> work<00:00:18.900> for<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.609> we<00:00:20.609> started<00:00:20.850> with<00:00:20.970> a

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
does it work for and we started with a

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.910 
does it work for and we started with a
very<00:00:21.180> simple<00:00:21.420> bounce<00:00:21.779> test<00:00:22.080> where<00:00:22.800> you'll

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
very simple bounce test where you'll

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.040 
very simple bounce test where you'll
notice<00:00:23.100> straight<00:00:23.550> away<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.570> bounce<00:00:24.840> of

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
notice straight away that the bounce of

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.790 
notice straight away that the bounce of
the<00:00:25.230> plastic<00:00:25.740> ball<00:00:26.029> the<00:00:27.029> peak<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.630> lower<00:00:28.380> on

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
the plastic ball the peak is lower on

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.400 
the plastic ball the peak is lower on
every<00:00:29.340> bounce<00:00:31.850> so<00:00:32.850> as<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.120> can<00:00:33.239> see<00:00:33.450> here<00:00:33.780> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
every bounce so as you can see here the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.010 
every bounce so as you can see here the
ball<00:00:34.620> bounce<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.010> little<00:00:35.340> bit<00:00:35.430> lower<00:00:36.020> it's

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
ball bounce is a little bit lower it's

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.920 
ball bounce is a little bit lower it's
not<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:38.120> significant<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.420> bounce<00:00:39.600> test

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
not so significant and a bounce test

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.049 
not so significant and a bounce test
once<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.040> get<00:00:41.190> out<00:00:41.280> onto<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.579> table<00:00:41.760> and

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
once you get out onto the table and

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.270 
once you get out onto the table and
start<00:00:42.329> practicing<00:00:42.540> with<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.170> ball<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:44.129> can

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
start practicing with the ball you can

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.760 
start practicing with the ball you can
definitely<00:00:44.489> tell<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.480> difference<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:46.260> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
definitely tell the difference and the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.709 
definitely tell the difference and the
bounce<00:00:46.980> between<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.489> two<00:00:47.640> balls<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:50.210> in<00:00:51.210> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
bounce between the two balls so in the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.569 
bounce between the two balls so in the
close<00:00:51.930> table<00:00:52.199> situations<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.129> bounce<00:00:53.340> was

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
close table situations the bounce was

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.840 
close table situations the bounce was
not<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.910> significant<00:00:55.430> because<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
not that significant because of the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.389 
not that significant because of the
hardness<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.690> plastic<00:00:58.140> ball<00:00:58.399> it

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
hardness of the plastic ball it

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.119 
hardness of the plastic ball it
definitely<00:01:00.090> felt<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.660> lot<00:01:00.989> heavier<00:01:01.469> than<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
definitely felt a lot heavier than the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.579 
definitely felt a lot heavier than the
celluloid<00:01:02.550> ball<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.960> ball<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.290> little

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
celluloid ball and the ball is a little

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.370 
celluloid ball and the ball is a little
bit<00:01:04.710> slower<00:01:05.240> the<00:01:06.240> control<00:01:06.750> felt<00:01:07.080> quite<00:01:07.320> good

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
bit slower the control felt quite good

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.500 
bit slower the control felt quite good
and<00:01:07.830> that's<00:01:08.250> something<00:01:08.670> which<00:01:08.820> reoccurred

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
and that's something which reoccurred

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.440 
and that's something which reoccurred
during<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.990> drill<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:11.700> any<00:01:12.180> part

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
during the drill is that in in any part

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.270 
during the drill is that in in any part
of<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.780> review<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.260> testing<00:01:13.710> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
of the review and the testing the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.380 
of the review and the testing the
consistency<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:17.340> comfort<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.090> you

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
consistency and the comfort that you

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.260 
consistency and the comfort that you
have<00:01:18.630> with<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.049> plastic<00:01:19.530> ball<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:20.270> definitely

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
have with the plastic ball is definitely

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.890 
have with the plastic ball is definitely
better<00:01:21.450> than<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.689> celluloid<00:01:22.200> ball<00:01:23.689> so<00:01:24.689> we

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
better than the celluloid ball so we

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.630 
better than the celluloid ball so we
moved<00:01:25.110> on<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.259> topspin<00:01:25.799> with<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.250> celluloid

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
moved on to topspin with the celluloid

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.280 
moved on to topspin with the celluloid
ball<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.299> much<00:01:27.479> more<00:01:27.659> comfort<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.170> the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
ball is so much more comfort in the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.399 
ball is so much more comfort in the
mechanics<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.950> each<00:01:29.100> shot<00:01:29.960> whereas<00:01:30.960> with<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
mechanics of each shot whereas with the

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.080 
mechanics of each shot whereas with the
plastic<00:01:31.890> ball<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.340> have<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.549> generate<00:01:33.060> a

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
plastic ball you have to generate a

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.569 
plastic ball you have to generate a
little<00:01:33.390> bit<00:01:33.570> more<00:01:33.780> power<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.409> little<00:01:35.100> bit<00:01:35.400> more

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
little bit more power a little bit more

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.990 
little bit more power a little bit more
spin<00:01:35.970> from<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:37.170> legs<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:38.009> core<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.759> have<00:01:38.820> to

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
spin from the legs the core you have to

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.810 
spin from the legs the core you have to
turn<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.240> little<00:01:39.479> bit<00:01:39.659> faster<00:01:40.460> sometimes<00:01:41.460> the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
turn a little bit faster sometimes the

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.429 
turn a little bit faster sometimes the
ball<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.210> dropping<00:01:42.329> quite<00:01:42.750> low<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:42.990> can<00:01:43.290> see

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
ball is dropping quite low you can see

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.580 
ball is dropping quite low you can see
here<00:01:43.649> my<00:01:43.770> practice<00:01:44.189> partner<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.990> bounces

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
here my practice partner the bounces

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.580 
here my practice partner the bounces
shorter<00:01:47.159> on<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.310> table<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.509> ball<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:49.020> arcing

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
shorter on the table the ball is arcing

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.530 
shorter on the table the ball is arcing
a<00:01:49.680> lot<00:01:49.829> lower<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.340> Chadwicks<00:01:50.729> trajectory<00:01:51.360> off

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
a lot lower the Chadwicks trajectory off

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.230 
a lot lower the Chadwicks trajectory off
blocking<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.259> not<00:01:52.740> anywhere<00:01:53.520> near<00:01:53.579> as<00:01:53.970> high<00:01:54.180> as

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
blocking is not anywhere near as high as

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.219 
blocking is not anywhere near as high as
with<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.720> celluloid<00:01:55.140> ball<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:57.390> main<00:01:57.630> reason

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
with the celluloid ball the main reason

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.310 
with the celluloid ball the main reason
for<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.340> plastic<00:01:59.759> ball<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.320> a

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
for that is that the plastic ball is a

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.370 
for that is that the plastic ball is a
little<00:02:01.350> bit<00:02:01.680> firmer<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.369> slightly<00:02:02.880> bigger

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
little bit firmer and slightly bigger

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.410 
little bit firmer and slightly bigger
which<00:02:04.380> definitely<00:02:04.770> slows<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.369> down

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.570 

so<00:02:11.420> when<00:02:11.690> I<00:02:11.720> moved<00:02:11.989> on<00:02:12.140> to<00:02:12.290> blocking<00:02:12.800> the

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
so when I moved on to blocking the

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.490 
so when I moved on to blocking the
celluloid<00:02:14.030> ball<00:02:14.360> you<00:02:14.629> definitely<00:02:14.840> have<00:02:15.230> room

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
celluloid ball you definitely have room

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.520 
celluloid ball you definitely have room
to<00:02:16.370> put<00:02:16.580> more<00:02:16.760> pace<00:02:17.000> on<00:02:17.269> the<00:02:17.390> ball<00:02:17.530> you

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
to put more pace on the ball you

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.410 
to put more pace on the ball you
definitely<00:02:18.920> get<00:02:19.010> a<00:02:19.069> lot<00:02:19.250> more<00:02:19.280> spring<00:02:19.940> through

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
definitely get a lot more spring through

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.809 
definitely get a lot more spring through
the<00:02:20.540> ball<00:02:20.720> when<00:02:21.590> you<00:02:21.680> play<00:02:21.890> with<00:02:22.129> the<00:02:22.280> plastic

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
the ball when you play with the plastic

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.470 
the ball when you play with the plastic
ball<00:02:23.620> it's<00:02:24.620> very<00:02:24.980> consistent<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:26.060> margin<00:02:26.420> of

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
ball it's very consistent the margin of

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.080 
ball it's very consistent the margin of
error<00:02:26.599> is<00:02:26.720> very<00:02:27.019> low<00:02:27.370> even<00:02:28.370> when<00:02:28.489> I<00:02:28.519> moved<00:02:28.790> on

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
error is very low even when I moved on

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.000 
error is very low even when I moved on
to<00:02:29.420> adding<00:02:29.750> tops<00:02:29.959> from<00:02:30.170> variation<00:02:30.709> into<00:02:30.830> my

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
to adding tops from variation into my

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.539 
to adding tops from variation into my
blocks<00:02:31.310> I<00:02:32.440> definitely<00:02:33.440> felt<00:02:33.769> there<00:02:34.400> was<00:02:34.519> a

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
blocks I definitely felt there was a

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.490 
blocks I definitely felt there was a
lower<00:02:34.849> chance<00:02:35.209> that<00:02:35.480> I<00:02:35.510> would<00:02:35.750> mess<00:02:35.989> with<00:02:36.019> the

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
lower chance that I would mess with the

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.949 
lower chance that I would mess with the
plastic<00:02:36.950> ball<00:02:37.190> then<00:02:38.090> with<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.510> celluloid

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
plastic ball then with the celluloid

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.100 
plastic ball then with the celluloid
ball<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.940> a<00:02:40.940> lot<00:02:41.060> of<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.299> times<00:02:41.540> that<00:02:41.660> I<00:02:41.840> did

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
ball and a lot of the times that I did

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.949 
ball and a lot of the times that I did
miss<00:02:42.349> it<00:02:43.120> wasn't<00:02:44.120> because<00:02:44.450> of<00:02:44.599> the<00:02:44.690> balls

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
miss it wasn't because of the balls

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.920 
miss it wasn't because of the balls
properties<00:02:45.500> itself<00:02:45.980> it<00:02:46.730> was<00:02:47.360> more<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:47.750> fact

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
properties itself it was more the fact

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.180 
properties itself it was more the fact
that<00:02:48.049> I<00:02:48.170> hadn't<00:02:48.560> made<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.890> right<00:02:49.040> adjustments

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
that I hadn't made the right adjustments

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.400 
that I hadn't made the right adjustments
to<00:02:49.940> playing<00:02:50.239> with<00:02:50.989> the<00:02:51.170> different<00:02:51.560> ball<00:02:53.410> so

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
to playing with the different ball so

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.069 
to playing with the different ball so
you<00:02:54.890> can<00:02:55.069> see<00:02:55.280> here<00:02:55.549> as<00:02:55.640> I<00:02:55.760> move<00:02:56.000> into<00:02:56.180> slightly

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
you can see here as I move into slightly

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.979 
you can see here as I move into slightly
more<00:02:57.379> topspin<00:02:57.769> variation<00:02:58.370> with<00:02:58.549> the<00:02:58.579> ball

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
more topspin variation with the ball

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.949 
more topspin variation with the ball
it's<00:02:59.989> very<00:03:00.379> very<00:03:00.650> comfortable<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.660> it<00:03:02.660> feels

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
it's very very comfortable and it feels

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.160 
it's very very comfortable and it feels
very<00:03:03.459> consistent<00:03:04.459> to<00:03:04.730> use<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:06.230> plastic<00:03:06.470> ball

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170

one of the common misconceptions about

you can't play big shots you can't play

you can't play big shots you can't play

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
with a lot of power that's something

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.870 
with a lot of power that's something
that's<00:03:16.819> not<00:03:17.209> entirely<00:03:17.870> accurate<00:03:18.170> and<00:03:18.880> while

that's not entirely accurate and while

that's not entirely accurate and while
it<00:03:20.030> can<00:03:20.269> be<00:03:20.450> more<00:03:20.630> difficult<00:03:20.690> to<00:03:21.350> hurt<00:03:21.849> winning

between the ball not ones that we're not

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389 
going to get used to so the more you

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
practice with it the more you will learn

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.240 
practice with it the more you will learn

the<00:03:43.099> ball<00:03:43.310> you<00:03:43.959> can<00:03:44.959> see<00:03:45.139> there<00:03:45.380> a<00:03:45.590> couple<00:03:46.250> of

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
the ball you can see there a couple of

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.039 
the ball you can see there a couple of
times<00:03:46.519> I<00:03:46.669> got<00:03:46.819> caught<00:03:47.060> off<00:03:47.090> guard<00:03:47.209> with<00:03:47.930> the

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
times I got caught off guard with the

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.009 
times I got caught off guard with the
lower<00:03:48.230> bounce<00:03:49.030> so<00:03:50.030> one<00:03:50.299> of<00:03:50.389> the<00:03:50.480> things<00:03:50.720> that

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
lower bounce so one of the things that

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:52.870 
lower bounce so one of the things that
has<00:03:51.200> been<00:03:51.349> said<00:03:51.590> about<00:03:51.680> the<00:03:51.919> ball<00:03:52.160> is<00:03:52.400> that<00:03:52.609> it

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
has been said about the ball is that it

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.370 
has been said about the ball is that it
would<00:03:53.060> be<00:03:53.209> better<00:03:53.389> for<00:03:53.510> defensive<00:03:54.139> players

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
would be better for defensive players

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.190 
would be better for defensive players
and<00:03:55.060> I<00:03:56.060> found<00:03:56.359> when<00:03:56.540> I<00:03:56.599> was<00:03:56.660> playing<00:03:56.930> against

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
and I found when I was playing against

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.440 
and I found when I was playing against
somebody<00:03:57.470> who<00:03:57.709> was<00:03:57.829> chopping<00:03:58.160> I<00:03:58.549> definitely

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
somebody who was chopping I definitely

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.449 
somebody who was chopping I definitely
had<00:03:59.599> to<00:03:59.630> give<00:03:59.930> a<00:04:00.139> little<00:04:00.319> bit<00:04:00.500> more<00:04:00.560> bite<00:04:01.010> into

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
had to give a little bit more bite into

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.150 
had to give a little bit more bite into
my<00:04:01.489> shot<00:04:01.880> to<00:04:02.870> get<00:04:03.019> the<00:04:03.440> amount<00:04:03.680> of<00:04:03.739> tops<00:04:03.980> for

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
my shot to get the amount of tops for

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.909 
my shot to get the amount of tops for
that<00:04:04.310> I<00:04:04.340> need<00:04:04.579> to<00:04:04.730> get<00:04:04.880> the<00:04:05.000> ball<00:04:05.180> over<00:04:05.209> and<00:04:05.919> on

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:06.919 
that I need to get the ball over and on

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:08.530 
that I need to get the ball over and on
a<00:04:06.950> separate<00:04:07.370> occasion<00:04:07.400> I<00:04:07.819> did<00:04:08.030> play<00:04:08.269> against

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
a separate occasion I did play against

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.870 
a separate occasion I did play against
someone<00:04:08.810> who<00:04:09.109> had<00:04:09.380> long<00:04:10.220> perps<00:04:10.519> on<00:04:10.730> their

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
someone who had long perps on their

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.629 
someone who had long perps on their
backhand<00:04:11.060> and<00:04:11.859> the<00:04:12.859> amount<00:04:13.099> of<00:04:13.160> control<00:04:13.609> that

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:13.639 
backhand and the amount of control that

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:16.300 
backhand and the amount of control that
they<00:04:13.940> had<00:04:14.150> was<00:04:14.959> definitely<00:04:15.469> a<00:04:15.500> lot<00:04:15.680> higher<00:04:15.920> and

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
they had was definitely a lot higher and

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.219 
they had was definitely a lot higher and
it<00:04:16.969> was<00:04:17.090> more<00:04:17.269> difficult<00:04:17.419> to<00:04:17.780> hit<00:04:17.930> through

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
it was more difficult to hit through

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:19.840 
it was more difficult to hit through
them

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
them

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.510 
them
so<00:04:20.850> we<00:04:21.090> moved<00:04:21.269> on<00:04:21.449> to<00:04:21.479> short<00:04:22.169> game<00:04:22.380> which<00:04:23.340> is<00:04:23.490> a

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
so we moved on to short game which is a

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.820 
so we moved on to short game which is a
very<00:04:23.819> very<00:04:24.030> important<00:04:24.539> part<00:04:24.690> of<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.840> game<00:04:24.990> the

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
very very important part of the game the

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.129 
very very important part of the game the
the<00:04:25.860> plastic<00:04:26.699> ball<00:04:26.910> was<00:04:27.090> a<00:04:27.330> lot<00:04:27.690> harder<00:04:27.900> to

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 
the plastic ball was a lot harder to

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:31.999 
the plastic ball was a lot harder to
keep<00:04:28.289> low<00:04:28.620> to<00:04:29.520> the<00:04:29.639> net<00:04:30.380> but<00:04:31.380> once<00:04:31.560> we<00:04:31.710> made<00:04:31.889> the

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 
keep low to the net but once we made the

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.180 
keep low to the net but once we made the
necessary<00:04:32.160> adjustments<00:04:33.710> even<00:04:34.710> though<00:04:35.039> we

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
necessary adjustments even though we

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.129 
necessary adjustments even though we
weren't<00:04:35.340> able<00:04:35.520> to<00:04:35.789> impart<00:04:36.300> that<00:04:36.599> much<00:04:36.810> spin<00:04:37.110> on

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
weren't able to impart that much spin on

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:38.870 
weren't able to impart that much spin on
the<00:04:37.349> ball<00:04:37.500> sometimes<00:04:38.190> it<00:04:38.310> did<00:04:38.460> feel<00:04:38.669> a<00:04:38.699> little

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
the ball sometimes it did feel a little

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.939 
the ball sometimes it did feel a little
bit<00:04:39.150> like<00:04:39.810> we<00:04:39.990> were<00:04:40.050> floating<00:04:40.319> the<00:04:40.650> ball<00:04:40.800> over

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
bit like we were floating the ball over

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.390 
bit like we were floating the ball over
the<00:04:41.069> net<00:04:41.509> we<00:04:42.509> were<00:04:42.720> able<00:04:42.960> to<00:04:43.199> take<00:04:44.039> the<00:04:44.190> ball<00:04:44.340> a

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
the net we were able to take the ball a

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.820 
the net we were able to take the ball a
little<00:04:44.610> bit<00:04:44.729> earlier<00:04:45.470> give<00:04:46.470> the<00:04:46.620> ball<00:04:46.800> a

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
little bit earlier give the ball a

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.460 
little bit earlier give the ball a
little<00:04:47.069> bit<00:04:47.220> more<00:04:47.370> nudge<00:04:47.910> to<00:04:48.870> get<00:04:49.020> it<00:04:49.110> over<00:04:49.349> the

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
little bit more nudge to get it over the

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.490 
little bit more nudge to get it over the
net<00:04:49.500> and<00:04:50.539> change<00:04:51.539> the<00:04:51.690> angles<00:04:52.020> a<00:04:52.110> little<00:04:52.349> bit

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
net and change the angles a little bit

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.700 
net and change the angles a little bit
so<00:04:52.710> we<00:04:52.800> could<00:04:52.979> keep<00:04:53.130> that<00:04:53.190> ball<00:04:53.520> low<00:04:53.729> in<00:04:54.710> terms

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
so we could keep that ball low in terms

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.360 
so we could keep that ball low in terms
of<00:04:56.039> service<00:04:56.870> I<00:04:57.870> felt<00:04:58.530> quite<00:04:59.070> comfortable

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
of service I felt quite comfortable

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.439 
of service I felt quite comfortable
returning<00:05:00.120> serve<00:05:01.340> it's<00:05:02.340> still<00:05:02.820> possible<00:05:03.090> to

returning serve it's still possible to

returning serve it's still possible to

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599 
celluloid ball you can still get good

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:16.580 
celluloid ball you can still get good
service<00:05:09.780> so<00:05:12.380> in<00:05:13.380> these<00:05:13.530> points<00:05:13.800> scenarios<00:05:15.590> the

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
service so in these points scenarios the

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.809 
service so in these points scenarios the
opening<00:05:17.039> balls<00:05:17.280> were<00:05:17.940> quite<00:05:18.780> consistent<00:05:19.470> I

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:19.819 
opening balls were quite consistent I

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.450 
opening balls were quite consistent I
was<00:05:20.819> still<00:05:21.060> able<00:05:21.210> to<00:05:21.389> make<00:05:21.690> some<00:05:22.500> powerful

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
was still able to make some powerful

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.540 
was still able to make some powerful
shots<00:05:23.729> I<00:05:24.440> did<00:05:25.440> get<00:05:25.620> caught<00:05:25.830> out<00:05:26.039> back<00:05:26.250> from<00:05:26.460> the

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
shots I did get caught out back from the

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.520 
shots I did get caught out back from the
table<00:05:26.699> quite<00:05:27.150> a<00:05:27.180> few<00:05:27.389> times<00:05:27.630> mainly<00:05:28.289> because

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
table quite a few times mainly because

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.770 
table quite a few times mainly because
of<00:05:28.680> the<00:05:28.860> belts<00:05:31.550> so<00:05:32.550> there<00:05:33.120> are<00:05:33.240> a<00:05:33.330> few<00:05:33.539> things

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
of the belts so there are a few things

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.300 
of the belts so there are a few things
that<00:05:34.020> you<00:05:34.320> need<00:05:34.469> to<00:05:34.500> get<00:05:34.740> used<00:05:34.860> to<00:05:35.070> with<00:05:35.190> the

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
that you need to get used to with the

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.240 
that you need to get used to with the
new<00:05:35.430> ball<00:05:36.320> mainly<00:05:37.320> the<00:05:37.650> distance<00:05:38.070> that<00:05:38.190> you

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
new ball mainly the distance that you

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.219 
new ball mainly the distance that you
play<00:05:38.490> from<00:05:38.669> the<00:05:38.759> table<00:05:39.150> the<00:05:39.570> ball<00:05:39.750> does<00:05:39.990> bounce

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
play from the table the ball does bounce

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:42.740 
play from the table the ball does bounce
slower<00:05:40.560> and<00:05:41.400> it's<00:05:41.639> better<00:05:41.820> to<00:05:42.060> be<00:05:42.180> closer<00:05:42.479> to

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
slower and it's better to be closer to

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.469 
slower and it's better to be closer to
the<00:05:42.840> table<00:05:43.020> than<00:05:43.590> further<00:05:43.830> back<00:05:44.159> you<00:05:45.830> have<00:05:46.830> to

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
the table than further back you have to

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:51.950 
the table than further back you have to
try<00:05:48.479> and<00:05:49.039> make<00:05:50.039> each<00:05:50.520> technique<00:05:51.270> as<00:05:51.449> efficient

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
try and make each technique as efficient

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.779 
try and make each technique as efficient
as<00:05:52.020> you<00:05:52.139> can<00:05:52.380> to<00:05:52.650> maximize<00:05:53.219> the<00:05:53.460> amount<00:05:53.550> of

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
as you can to maximize the amount of

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:57.080 
as you can to maximize the amount of
spin<00:05:54.030> you<00:05:54.210> can<00:05:54.389> get<00:05:54.539> on<00:05:54.659> the<00:05:54.780> ball<00:05:55.699> you<00:05:56.699> really

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
spin you can get on the ball you really

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.659 
spin you can get on the ball you really
have<00:05:57.300> to<00:05:57.449> work<00:05:57.659> on<00:05:57.870> getting<00:05:58.830> as<00:05:58.949> much<00:05:59.159> contact

00:05:59.659 --> 00:05:59.669 
have to work on getting as much contact

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:01.760 
have to work on getting as much contact
on<00:05:59.909> the<00:06:00.000> ball<00:06:00.180> as<00:06:00.330> you<00:06:00.360> can<00:06:00.719> so<00:06:01.289> that<00:06:01.320> you<00:06:01.500> can

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
on the ball as you can so that you can

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.110 
on the ball as you can so that you can
try<00:06:02.009> and<00:06:02.130> generate<00:06:02.219> as<00:06:02.610> much<00:06:02.789> spin<00:06:03.060> as

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
try and generate as much spin as

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.830 
try and generate as much spin as
possible

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
possible

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.180 
possible
and<00:06:04.430> of<00:06:05.430> course<00:06:05.969> you<00:06:06.240> need<00:06:06.419> to<00:06:06.479> use<00:06:06.810> more<00:06:07.190> power

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
and of course you need to use more power

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.370 
and of course you need to use more power
from<00:06:08.520> your<00:06:08.669> legs<00:06:08.909> in<00:06:09.120> your<00:06:09.150> core<00:06:09.539> when<00:06:10.229> you're

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
from your legs in your core when you're

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.419 
from your legs in your core when you're
playing<00:06:10.650> the<00:06:11.639> powerful<00:06:12.150> shots
