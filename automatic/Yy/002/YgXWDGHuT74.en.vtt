colors different schemes I get a lot of
my<00:06:19.250> design<00:06:19.580> patterns<00:06:20.090> from<00:06:20.420> you<00:06:20.840> know<00:06:21.020> outfits

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
my design patterns from you know outfits

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.100 
my design patterns from you know outfits
that<00:06:21.590> I<00:06:21.680> have<00:06:22.010> after<00:06:22.310> I've<00:06:22.670> seen<00:06:23.030> Isis<00:06:23.930> that

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
that I have after I've seen Isis that

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.430 
that I have after I've seen Isis that
other<00:06:24.350> people<00:06:24.860> have<00:06:25.100> and<00:06:26.060> I'm<00:06:26.660> pretty<00:06:27.350> much

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 
other people have and I'm pretty much

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.100 
other people have and I'm pretty much
I'm<00:06:27.800> never<00:06:28.100> doing<00:06:28.310> all<00:06:28.670> the<00:06:28.850> same<00:06:29.060> like<00:06:29.960> I

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
I'm never doing all the same like I

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.170 
I'm never doing all the same like I
figured<00:06:30.320> I<00:06:30.500> use<00:06:30.680> different<00:06:30.830> colors<00:06:31.370> I<00:06:31.580> do<00:06:31.970> the

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
figured I use different colors I do the

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.420 
figured I use different colors I do the
design<00:06:32.480> patterns<00:06:32.990> differently<00:06:33.500> so<00:06:33.740> that's

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
design patterns differently so that's

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.750
