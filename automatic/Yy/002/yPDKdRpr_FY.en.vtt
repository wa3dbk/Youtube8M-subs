00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.500
 hi easy minutes girls.com 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.269
 so me it's manual sousa happens all 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.519
 right from my blog to deliver you 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.080
 but some hair beauty tips 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.059
 review what do I know 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.260
 so in fact I make videos 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.779
 especially on youtube 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.279
 and there I left but little brush 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.050
 to come to see you and you by the 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.130
 hair and beach because the beach 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.439
 it's very soon 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.800
 and suddenly I wanted to show you 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.750
 how to make wave loops use it 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.450
 on this site so easy minutes.com which 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.489
 is the first site out or in France and 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.860
 actually it's about delivering you 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.430
 simple quick tips easy for the 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.739
 daily 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.770
 so be it manicure hair 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.989
 makeup and suddenly we started everything 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.020
 immediately by brushing your hair so 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.670
 with a wolf neither in the genus so in 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.260
 here is the beast 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.930
 so it's small pimples in 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.399
 plastic and it allows you to 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.500
 mails and hair are tearing them off 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.699
 for those who finally have little hair 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.020
 of hair or that they fall 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.059
 really the right option you can 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.280
 buy on asos so this is the tiger 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.010
 teaser so me I pray them neon pink 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.520
 because here I love it so we start 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.280
 by this the trouble and we will start 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.810
 with a straightener but to make 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.570
 loops a whole paradox 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.939
 so in fact it's an hour style so 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.320
 I'll show you why not 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.090
 style because it's actually a 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.799
 device that is tidy on the side and 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.900
 which allows you to do both 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.520
 loops and the the helix and also 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.409
 so suddenly it's a bit of a product 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.390
 all terrain all in one and it's mega 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.920
 Cool especially in the holidays 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.869
 when we do not want to bring a 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.700
 billion stuff in his suitcase not 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.390
 to make boy boy moan 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.689
 so we'll start with 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.479
 small sections of hair and we're going 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.890
 make loops out of the 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.829
 face actually to not close it 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.500
 so we take this way we turn to 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.149
 the outside and we go down and while 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.039
 descending in fact we turn 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.439
 so here's what it gives 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.450
 so it's not English so he 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.269
 do not have to be a corkscrew 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.429
 pig is not it but it has to be 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.470
 about half of the heads 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.450
 for not that it goes back too much and to make a 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.420
 Poodle effect we had everything 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.590
 So suddenly that's what it gives is 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.629
 what to do to make it 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.069
 natural is to break the loop so 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.530
 there you're celebrating a little bit of it 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.349
 and it gives you jealousy 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.459
 life so there we start having already the 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.349
 result is beautiful 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.690
 can you do that so 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.489
 to do it even right in front of it's 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.690
 much faster if really the 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.250
 days you are really in the rush 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.760
 and suddenly we will do it on the other 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.040
 side too 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.220
 so we have to take locks when 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.230
 even wide enough to have a side not 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.599
 too sophisticated so we do the same 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.239
 thing we take we do not understand at the 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.340
 root and one turns and at the same time 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:56.840
 is rotated descends hop is 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:00.410
 simple we turn we turn in rates and the 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.609
 here we have something at half 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.980
 of the face which really starts to 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:06.260
 half and we'll do the same 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.600
 say that have undone the loop up which is getting 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.519
 pass the hand the sensual way do not know 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.049
 not where the hair is and we're breaking it all 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.450
 if like me you have hair 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.019
 terribly flat and that gravity makes 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.690
 his work 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:20.720
 well you can put shampoo 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.849
 dry so the number one English stars 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.040
 and all and the Baptist he is super good 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.410
 and you have read all the problem I 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.109
 think of dry shampoo too white of 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.930
 drugstore and suddenly me I you 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:35.569
 advise the tint so for the 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.389
 brunettes lebrun and for blondes rather 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:42.440
 yellow is not it so we take it we go 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:42.829
 below at the root and offers at 30 cm 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.569
 about 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:48.410
 we put some dry shampoo 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:50.599
 the same on the other side and we wait for a 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.639
 little that that makes its effect 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.590
 and then we'll mix it all up and that 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:57.200
 just do not take off the root so 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.150
 so that's once you 've left 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.010
 ask your little magic dry shampoo 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.080
 and brown 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.269
 on the hair for 2 to 3 minutes 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.640
 you can mix like a little 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:09.340
 way points hop hop hop we love and 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.870
 then you have two volumes here 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.159
 it's magic good it's not obvious 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.200
 because I have very real hair 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.150
 flat but still it changes a little 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.549
 little and I advise you to do it 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.190
 when your blow dry and raplapla at night 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.449
 if you go out you have been invited in 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.740
 fourth speed 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:26.320
 hop a little bit of dry shampoo 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.330
 tasty gives volume is actually 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.860
 what we do is we get together 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.660
 quotes the hair even if it's 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.460
 shampoo to give it texture 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.430
 and it's easier to have this effect 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.300
 beach and loose with that so what are we going 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.979
 do now is we're going 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.860
 continue with the rest of the mop 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:43.510
 so I'm going to show you his more towards 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.490
 the back of the head so the little one 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.590
 rotational movement down that 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.720
 you will see after one or two times 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.000
 in your workout bathroom 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:57.699
 you will get there alone so we 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:01.900
 click and hop it turns and at the same time 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:03.940
 we turn we draw the loop so 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.900
 it's a loop that's wound on 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.849
 she herself and it's not really a 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.729
 English it's an effect a little bit 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:11.139
 beach like that as you can see 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:12.580
 so now what am I going to do 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:14.199
 I'm going to finish my head 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.270
 every ignorant master and I find you 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:19.320
 just after for the result will voom 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.320
 too extraordinary 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.240
 all 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:37.309
 saddam and so now so you 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.719
 have your little look or heavy you are 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:40.279
 ready to go to the beach you take 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:42.169
 your sunscreen is gone 

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:45.020
 there is just a little last step 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:48.139
 so to make the big blast another one 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.089
 little more we take a slap 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:53.149
 is not really a queen for access 

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:56.300
 the day so seeds of a day and that's 

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:56.839
 blue for the tiji superstar product so 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.699
 here it is 

00:05:56.839 --> 00:06:00.649
 is that what it does is that it gives 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:03.259
 still a little more volume while 

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:06.289
 keeping the small curls but 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:08.269
 are the lake facts of our grandmothers 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:10.610
 you know the lakes that actually make a 

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:12.469
 little bit because your tone is there you have 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:16.639
 not that it's my trick to put back on the 

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:19.129
 hand instead of directly delivering and 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:20.629
 so you're going to wrinkle your hair and 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:22.189
 it's much better not to put the 

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:24.050
 texture directly I find that it 

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:28.839
 makes it more natural so hop on them 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:31.159
 goes back up and we also put some 

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:36.439
 on the roots to take off a little 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:38.149
 plus all that and here we are now 

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:39.529
 it's okay you can fix a little 

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:42.519
 hearth band on the top of your head 

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:42.519
 and leave 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:50.479
 and now we have our 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.530
 little loose look for the beach 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:53.600
 maybe we should take care of 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.560
 nails eyebrows and yes everything is 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.240
 not at all to have beautiful hair 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.800
 so suddenly I find you on 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.650
 easy minutes.com with many others 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.400
 manicured hints eyebrows hollywoodian 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.400
 stay tuned
