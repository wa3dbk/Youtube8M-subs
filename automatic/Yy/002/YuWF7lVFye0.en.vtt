00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.389
 the earliest memory I have of the 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.759
 Tomatoes are from those Sunday mornings in 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.350
 that my grandmother spent hours preparing the 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.690
 pasta sauce 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.430
 whenever she turned her back on me 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.539
 took the opportunity to dive into a 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.699
 bread in the pan 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.590
 because my desire for it was so 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.000
 big that I could not wait until the 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.250
 lunch time 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.080
 It took me years to learn how to take the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.120
 best advantage of each variety of 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.710
 tomato that we find around and 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.930
 more time to find a 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.870
 sauce recipe capable of honoring 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.760
 my italian roots 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.829
 the Dutch type is easy to recognize 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.989
 because they usually see branches as it is 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.079
 he has some ideas and 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.690
 balanced but as the house is thin it 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.180
 has more seed than it saves 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.480
 better for salads than for sauce 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.280
 the cherry tomato you already know it was 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.530
 the first in miniature if 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.110
 popularize in the Brazilian market 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.280
 by the nice sour taste goes a lot 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.520
 good in salads 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.990
 already the kaki the giant tomato and has 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.850
 firm consistency 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.490
 it works well as monitoring of 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.549
 burgers and also in the salads 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.420
 the tomato debris is stick to all work 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.340
 for its versatility and reasonable acidity 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.590
 it goes well both in sauces and in 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.409
 vinaigrette and even to make dry tomato 1 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.960
 suite greip vulgo tomato would have is a 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.630
 rival that took off drinking beer in the 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.180
 category of mini atura beyond format 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.390
 flattened it differs by taste 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.360
 very sweet and I'll make a sauce 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.909
 with the most consecrated option tomato 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.530
 Italian it has the elongated shape and 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.829
 pointed and meets the characteristics 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.460
 Perfect for sauce to sip a little 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:59.100
 fleshy or intense red and acidity is 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.820
 very low the first operation is the 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.820
 automax 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.400
 tomatoes with the peel to 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.640
 low in boiling water 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.970
 after 30 seconds 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.820
 I'll take tomax and put it on the plate with the 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.830
 bark up said in this water 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.970
 all the ideas of the 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.459
 tomato 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.700
 now that playful moment as you would say 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:35.530
 the pedantic intellectuals take the bark 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.780
 tomato to 10 o max 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.540
 I put 2 cloves of garlic the fat ones 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.480
 sauté the olive oil and put onion 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.170
 make the sauce yield nothing else to see 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.640
 this is a thing of poor people of spirit 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.580
 add take without leaving oil 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.530
 burned 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.320
 sauté until the tomatoes start to 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.180
 in the case of simonium the idea is to 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.489
 preserve the maximum freshness 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.020
 So I will not put any water on and leave 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:06.209
 cook as little as possible 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.209
 5 to 7 minutes is of great size 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.859
 this world is so versatile that it goes well 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.329
 with pizza or any kind of pasta today 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:20.950
 I'll test you with this beautiful 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.950
 Tagliatelle die of envy
