00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.879
 very good to all kids and girls and 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.980
 remember v2 and we start with another mini 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.349
 game is worth you know that at 2000 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.360
 likes, well, I'll get the level 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.520
 legend I will try to get me link 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.189
 level legend to show you then 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:31.059
 some tips like in this case for 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:32.380
 example for ses is worth the pass as 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:34.510
 you are seeing this is the first of the 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.090
 exercises that we will find in your 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.190
 Bronze level this does not have much 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.110
 mystery is that little by little I'm going to 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.030
 say more than you do as much 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.520
 fast as you can 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.820
 it's simply about pressing the button 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.540
 pass and put it in the basket that you 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.540
 indicate vale 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.460
 logically for the near 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.070
 simply touching the button will suffice 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.830
 because the pass is automatic 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.590
 diego and for those of back then it will be necessary 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:06.020
 keep it pressed a little bit better 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.550
 they give you 1000 points for each time 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:13.370
 the metais give us more points to mark 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:17.240
 then with a pass or with a 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:20.119
 acrobatic pass you know they are not a pass 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.890
 cool pulo something of this are not going to 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.110
 give more points so well I'll 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.550
 try anyway and it's only worth 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.440
 the flat pass is worth 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.500
 So, well, there you see, that's the 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.690
 maximum score that I have achieved that 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.729
 It's not a lot of people who have 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.130
 that score I have not managed to make 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.170
 more notice that I was a lot of time 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.810
 saying good I can do it faster 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.910
 I should be able to scratch him 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.160
 I do not like the marker and that I and that 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.979
 give me more goal points or well to me 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.520
 it has been impossible one for this site is 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.720
 I can give some kind some small 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.540
 advice is good for you to do it 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.450
 Well, much faster 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.710
 well let's start with the one of the 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.740
 left that is the one that is us 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.490
 marking you will have to do this drawing 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.910
 cos frame and make the pass from there 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.970
 for the second you will have to do this 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.530
 drawing with frame and throw from here vale 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.590
 for the third one it's pretty simple 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.340
 because simply with pulling straight 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.890
 it will be worth to us and for and for the last 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.540
 of all we have to do is the 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.000
 drawing contrary to what we have done the 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.950
 first ok we come here and 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.800
 we throw from here and from there then 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.440
 we mark logically to do it again 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.720
 as fast as you can so that for 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.730
 that they give you then prisoner then more 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.430
 points 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.739
 let's see how I have done it better 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.610
 Well you see the drawing because it marked 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:53.629
 this is quite simple the second one is 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.860
 throw straight is worth it you should not 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.650
 have no problem if you do 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.140
 fast logically for this one we will have 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.610
 what to do this drawing is worth and for 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.340
 last then the same but in reverse 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.879
 worth the same but the same but at 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.069
 reverse 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:09.200
 so it's good when the barrier is 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:13.280
 reaching its end is when when 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.379
 We launched vale and good, you can see that 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.650
 this one that for this minigame also 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:21.140
 Well, well, I've done enough 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.140
 enough points worth 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.520
 well I think 7200 points I think that 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.200
 it's pretty good to see you can 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.900
 improve voucher can always be improved 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.720
 everything can be improved and sure that 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.940
 is there any small trickery some 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.150
 small council that maybe you 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.890
 you can give us, you do not know is that the 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.060
 that has more points that has been 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.130
 removed more points then in the 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.350
 comments can calmly give us 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:49.130
 some kind to everyone else so that 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:52.190
 to get more good points for this 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.410
 gold game what we have to do is 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.570
 we have six players three up and 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.060
 three down the two in white we 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.160
 they will try to remove the ball and what 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.680
 we have to do is pass it through 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.840
 those two blue stripes through those 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.010
 cones are worth the blue stripes 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.840
 and go past the ball you can pass it to him 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.239
 to the partner that you have next is worth not 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.600
 it has to be the one on the other side it's worth 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.540
 if you can pass it to the one next door 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.340
 and I recommend you good this one 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.850
 drawing is worth doing I am doing now 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.770
 same is the one that I recommend you to do 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.259
 Well, practically all the time 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.879
 it's like more you're going to get good already 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:33.680
 You see that I also good you see 

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:35.690
 the marker but I have taken enough 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.479
 points I have already seen how they have taken us 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:42.199
 the good ball is treated that simply 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:44.599
 to aim the best you can and go 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:47.240
 making the ball pass through 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:49.520
 between between those two of 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.830
 those two cones are worth good is very 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.840
 important to play with them especially with 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.599
 the middle players are worth that 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.449
 now has the ball and then 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:01.460
 later this other is worth this other 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.979
 are the ones that we say direct a 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.409
 little where is it going to guide the 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:09.770
 ball or is often the same is better 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:12.289
 skip skipping the dashes and not 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.909
 lose let's say the thread of what we are 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:16.130
 doing not as I have done for example 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:19.610
 in this case the same is better this the 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:22.909
 high and start from the beginning not 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.590
 I had many times good I think that this 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:26.870
 score yes that it deserves 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:30.480
 quite worth it and you know kids 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:33.240
 like in previous minigames I like 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:36.030
 and I tried to get the legend mode worth 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.620
 to give you some tips and more 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.800
 I suppose it will be pretty enough 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:43.290
 more difficult and nothing here I dismiss like 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.200
 please and see you in the next 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:49.230
