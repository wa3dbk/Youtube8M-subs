here from how she was placed in the box

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.499 
here from how she was placed in the box
so<00:05:13.270> that's<00:05:13.509> it<00:05:14.470> came<00:05:14.680> that<00:05:14.860> way<00:05:15.150> maybe<00:05:16.150> I<00:05:16.300> can

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:16.509 
so that's it came that way maybe I can

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:22.040 
so that's it came that way maybe I can
iron<00:05:16.750> that<00:05:16.990> out<00:05:19.020> she<00:05:20.020> also<00:05:20.139> has<00:05:20.620> this<00:05:20.919> under

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050
