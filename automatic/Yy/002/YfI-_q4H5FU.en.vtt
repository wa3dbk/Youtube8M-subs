particular offensively really happy with
the<00:00:21.600> way<00:00:21.720> we<00:00:21.990> push<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.350> ball<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.859> way<00:00:22.949> we

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
the way we push the ball and the way we

and their man we've got some good shots
I<00:00:27.029> thought<00:00:27.210> our<00:00:27.330> offense<00:00:27.359> down<00:00:27.869> at<00:00:28.050> school

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
I thought our offense down at school

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.960 
I thought our offense down at school
which<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.619> good<00:00:28.800> side<00:00:29.010> well<00:00:29.400> he's<00:00:29.519> really<00:00:29.760> been

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
which is good side well he's really been

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.749 
which is good side well he's really been
a<00:00:30.320> very<00:00:31.320> aggressive<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.130> think<00:00:32.219> he's<00:00:32.520> playing

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
a very aggressive I think he's playing

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.540 
a very aggressive I think he's playing
he's<00:00:33.540> playing<00:00:33.780> as<00:00:33.930> well<00:00:34.050> as<00:00:34.110> he<00:00:34.320> ever<00:00:34.440> has<00:00:34.739> in

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
he's playing as well as he ever has in

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.190 
he's playing as well as he ever has in
particularly<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.149> first<00:00:36.329> half<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.899> games

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
particularly in the first half of games

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.049 
particularly in the first half of games
he's<00:00:37.559> been<00:00:37.590> getting<00:00:38.040> off<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.340> great<00:00:38.520> starts

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
he's been getting off to great starts

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.369 
he's been getting off to great starts
and<00:00:39.210> then<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.390> second<00:00:39.780> half<00:00:39.809> he<00:00:40.140> kind<00:00:40.320> of

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
and then the second half he kind of

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.260 
and then the second half he kind of
cools<00:00:40.620> off<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:41.190> thought<00:00:41.670> he<00:00:41.820> was<00:00:41.969> good<00:00:42.149> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
cools off I thought he was good the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.729 
cools off I thought he was good the
whole<00:00:42.420> way<00:00:42.570> through<00:00:42.600> tonight<00:00:43.079> just<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:43.590> terms

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
whole way through tonight just in terms

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.770 
whole way through tonight just in terms
of<00:00:43.890> being<00:00:43.950> aggressive<00:00:44.280> but<00:00:44.579> DeSean<00:00:45.300> was<00:00:45.539> good

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
of being aggressive but DeSean was good

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.200 
of being aggressive but DeSean was good
Kendall<00:00:46.649> really<00:00:46.920> had<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.160> nice<00:00:47.340> job<00:00:47.670> finishing

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
Kendall really had a nice job finishing

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.910 
Kendall really had a nice job finishing
and<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.989> know<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.110> thought<00:00:49.350> just<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:49.770> general

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
and you know I thought just in general

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.400 
and you know I thought just in general
Kyle's<00:00:50.399> overall<00:00:51.090> game<00:00:51.420> was<00:00:52.020> about<00:00:52.260> as

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
Kyle's overall game was about as

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.350 
Kyle's overall game was about as
important<00:00:52.890> as<00:00:52.980> anybody<00:00:53.190> because<00:00:53.550> we<00:00:54.090> asked

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
important as anybody because we asked

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.150 
important as anybody because we asked
him<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.539> do<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.690> lot<00:00:54.899> defensively<00:00:55.530> here<00:00:55.770> tonight

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
him to do a lot defensively here tonight

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.220 
him to do a lot defensively here tonight
but<00:00:56.399> but<00:00:56.940> we<00:00:57.149> got<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.420> get<00:00:57.510> some<00:00:57.750> wind<00:00:57.989> right

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
but but we got to get some wind right

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.470 
but but we got to get some wind right
now<00:00:58.260> I'm<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.890> little<00:00:59.129> nervous<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.300> men

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480
