00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.270
 for new video that I think are going or 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.710
 father since I show you how 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.840
 have nitro on any 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.580
 gta vehicle may 5 thereafter 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.529
 how to import them into the solo in 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.580
 their meshs earlier so when I 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.629
 talk about nitro it's really not 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.160
 anything is really useful 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.110
 when you see I fight with a 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.699
 adhere so is the car the most 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.590
 fast of 5 gta while it's with a 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:42.640
 big engine and I still crazy 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.500
 small gap while you love me to 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.339
 background and so I'm going to show you 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.479
 how do we do that we take that 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.250
 very simple you will go alone 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:53.260
 inch to your ps3 be named ps3 you 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.159
 have a usb stick plugged in 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.019
 in the data utility 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:57.309
 saved and there you have everything 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:01.089
 just to see a backup copy 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.350
 gta 5 years, taking the average USB 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.170
 did not already have one so I replace it 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.049
 and are waiting for us and that his copy is fine 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.670
 to be that sb 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.750
 once it is on the copy will 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.530
 make this Monday to continue this 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.760
 little trick so once on pc you 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.770
 you will have to connect a usb stick with 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.630
 the backup and after you are going to have to 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.549
 download software gta 5 publishers 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.509
 that I have already presented in one of my 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.920
 previous videos 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.990
 I would put an end to 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.119
 descriptions to download it so 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.530
 you open it whose appearance that you 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.549
 will ask for an update since 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.109
 this is an update for melanie hole 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.820
 also ask you for an update 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:35.710
 it's very simple you will be guided will have 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.259
 just copied the new update its 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.020
 office and it will work so after you 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.369
 open from the east in these movies there you 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.439
 you will have to select your usb key 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.909
 me it was already done in the folder 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.799
 weighs 3 usb key points 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.869
 after there will be the data and 1/2 century 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:53.289
 a soft or sectional number of 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:55.450
 clamping use or true ice asked for 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:56.319
 back up it's a backup 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.369
 backup copy 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:59.679
 so if you really care about your 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.240
 keen and talented look then I hope so 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:03.909
 not because there's no risk I have 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.189

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.700
 to import vehicles from the ground or into 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.310
 sea 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.990

 nitro can run out 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.930
 it will take two to three minutes 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.160
 poker face but usually it lasts 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.980
 long enough and if we could have you 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.780
