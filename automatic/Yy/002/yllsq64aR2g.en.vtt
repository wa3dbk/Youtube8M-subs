 boys and welcome to the big house 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.800
 program on art that shows you that 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.640
 you don't have to be big cocks and 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.640
 to make art 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.910
 and then now now the attack well me 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.920
 I bet your room is full 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.720
 of papers of candy of papers and 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.230
 maps tell of various waste all spaces 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.210
 on the floor 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.100
 and then in my opinion what you need 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.460
 a beautiful monster may waste like him 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.460

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.710
 cute is in my opinion it's really nice 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.760
 character 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:54.449
 well you won't believe it really is 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.339
 very simple we need only 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.339
 three old newspapers like these 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.690
 let's start by opening one of the dogs 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.400
 and look a little further added 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.110
 some details for example the eyes 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.790
 I defined them with an ancestor marker 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.070
 I did another reader there 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.540
 song strip claims now you have a 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.540
 nice monster eats waste 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.229
 all fill up the big belly with litter 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.329
 hi everyone, it's me and then not 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:41.470
 found that they were fantastic 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:41.470
 therefore to make one of capitalia like 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.970
 here ad art attack really makes art 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:58.549
 with anything and neal the great 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:02:00.710
 the artist does just that the other one 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.580
 day the had started with the idea of 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.320
 hang out the laundry 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.350
 but you know what happened to a certain one 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:11.090
 break point and blow stronger and stronger 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.709
 and then neither was left in red 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.030
 take from one of seven to art 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.590
 great you look out for 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.130
 understand what he is up to but 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:25.690
 especially where he uses these two pegs 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.690
 to hang clothes, look at it 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.870
 now I want to show you something 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:33.700
 really never seen before on my tv 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.700
 child's room in the dark 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.459
 well yes i know it actually can't be seen 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.170
 nothing and then I don't know 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.329
 an idea comes to mind because it doesn't 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.000
 let's try to open a door but that's it 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:47.340
 that the nun who beats the door 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.359
 shut up screaming and let in a little 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.359
 of light simply with this 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.359
