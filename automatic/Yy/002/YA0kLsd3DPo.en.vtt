 Hello dear Musikvereins welcome to degrease music talent 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.779
 Check today with Markus Respect 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.050
 and the Elvis of the CAD and her brought her an idea what that 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.710
 could be 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.390
 as one of the over a clarinet 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.429
 not lush Stick or No "It is not very sheltered in operation 

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:44.049
 It is a coincidence - driving in Saxophone driving Saxons 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.210
 As always authorities could he is short and thus very high 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.340
 so illedits 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.870
 Small round and generates 2 lit I go in as a train - saxophone we are 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.340
 So, with the saxophones succeeded, that's what nobody really thought 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.040
 like clarinet it has nothing to do with it 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.510
 Ott the 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.280
 Adolf Sachsler invented the saxophone it really invented so 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.960
 had 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.880
 Price base already the clarinet 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.250
 he himself was killed too 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.430
 very good of the tight box 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.490
 and percent excellent little Nick, it is also a chair 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:29.040
 Percent Paris Percent e there hangs there and but never had more like crazy 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.400
 researched and projects puzzles and give instruments developed 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.820
 Of course we now always know the saxophone with these 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.100
 "Up" "Up" so everyone says clear saxophone so just can sound too 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.560
 those after family and they brought us the whole lot more today than 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.050
 Third to Prime Line up 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.770
 the thickest farther in the family it goes on down there continues with 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.490
 the train tram saxophone here Hammerstein had the typical form 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.550
 Curved shape There is another counter-attack to do in this straight line 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:01:59.270
 shape 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.159
 also there that is often mistakenly referred to as percent by nuclear energy 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.159
 it does not compare the children under 14 

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:17.279
 just 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.209
 and it continues with the old saxophone 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:29.689
 Climax 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:31.679
 Dr 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:35.329
 how long will it take to tell the children what they are for? 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.359
 little prick the parents ever can play as I like my son 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:43.349
 Paris gave out with the approach and and and percent 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.919
 maybe ten minutes fifteen minutes 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:47.339
 percents 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:51.409
 in the meadow the Garbo Moorrege this ease as maybe 20 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.839
 Minutes practice and IGS will make Samsung two three months 

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:56.549
 you can do something 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.549
 with tolerable listening the mouthpiece could but still 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:02.679
 4 similar to the clarinet before 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:05.679
 um did not have a little more to do with it 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:09.269
 exactly the sound production is their quasi identical 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.629
 Because it is long term it is now stuck in the corpus gesturing animal health 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:16.219
 plugged in and the sound generation the players as with the swine flu 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:18.589
 confirmed place here 

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:20.209
 that's what gets her on her knees 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.169
 Born mounted on this mouthpiece 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:26.509
 by this sound production it is in the wood space 

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:29.239
 as it becomes clear after the throne generation, so to speak 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.089
 Filed woodwind 

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:34.359
 is the regular assistant at the Hamburg Symphony Orchestra 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:39.539
 Aushilfe because it is not a typical if it is the instrument that saxophone 

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:43.049
 actually why not Robert used his club and why not from 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.489
 an orchestra of course, the story is very short and percent to 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.229
 An irritated less literature one applies to the youngest of her dogs 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:53.149
 before that not only the 

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:56.159
 finally edit notes and there are also many beautiful things 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:04:00.089
 especially in Germany 

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:02.869
 then you can special cards that my compulsory break by the 

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:06.149
 National Socialism was this are authentic instrument 

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:08.949
 Percent and it was their official 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:12.679
 Picture does not allow to play instrument which of course also so in 

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:16.759
 The German 36 and vulnerable book was created that actually has to 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:19.840
 Saxophone brought that she has so fascinated rank 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.260
 I also find the shapes I think it's not really easy now 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.580
 it must be the first time music helper with us sees this shoe 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.949
 These golden Ali were eight times romantic sort out today 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:35.740
 under% accidentally and make yourself with the following in his old jukebox man 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.220
 then so 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.430
 Rottenburg hears and drums saxophone 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.059
 and 

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:45.469
 it can Bolelli or release so he should this 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:47.590
 that kind of music and then I have to stop myself 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.779
 dealt with by the worker 

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:52.660
 Campana be quite casual iPad Ramadan too 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.430
 to 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.360
 LÃ¼th and then of course it was very clear to jazz music or 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.809
 African-American music 

00:04:58.809 --> 00:05:01.809

 Bendel used Bender 

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:20.610
 now must 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:28.090
 Bonn m there were among other things percentage 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:34.020
 the toddler knew who had probably everyone knows back though who fought 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.639
 has an interest in composing in the orchestra 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:42.440
 30% or Mussorgsky wants in the contemporaries of Neurath and Zott 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.580
 He then also wrote to special or contact him 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.320
 who also asked what to write so much and children feel 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.320
 be inspired by immissions 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:01.889
 on 

00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:17.860
 The Internet is changing to the big surprise, respectively 

00:06:17.859 --> 00:06:18.819
 reveals 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:21.819
 on the really big brother Euro and with it around 

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:25.509
 maybe you can do it so naturally 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:30.539
 Iris' voice is like the custom with other instruments 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:33.559
 Instruments tend to be so thick that function so the supporting function 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:39.449
 A bus soon picks up tips it needs as well or sunglasses pop 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:42.449
 Pop the IAEA should this this 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.319
 January

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:07.539
 because then it will 

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:17.449
 someday would
