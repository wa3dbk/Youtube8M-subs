00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
little bit more creamier so that means

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.569 
little bit more creamier so that means
you<00:01:01.530> pick<00:01:01.710> up<00:01:01.829> more<00:01:01.980> product<00:01:02.340> on<00:01:02.430> your<00:01:02.520> brush

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
but you don't necessarily need this one

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.090 
but you don't necessarily need this one
however<00:01:05.700> it's<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.180> little<00:01:06.510> more<00:01:06.810> know<00:01:07.409> compact

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
cuz usually round eyeliners do get

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.060 
cuz usually round eyeliners do get
pretty<00:02:55.239> dark<00:02:55.540> in<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:56.170> color<00:02:56.380> range<00:02:56.590> but<00:02:56.920> this
