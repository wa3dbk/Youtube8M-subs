00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
probably the closest you can have from a

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.060 
probably the closest you can have from a
precision<00:01:50.300> struck<00:01:50.630> but<00:01:51.409> it's<00:01:51.530> still<00:01:51.770> a<00:01:51.830> castra

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
precision struck but it's still a castra

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.270

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
favorite wheels by far I've done like my

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.210 
favorite wheels by far I've done like my
biggest<00:02:04.070> stand-up<00:02:04.700> slides<00:02:05.060> on<00:02:05.300> them<00:02:05.539> I<00:02:06.220> was

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
biggest stand-up slides on them I was

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.400 
biggest stand-up slides on them I was
first<00:02:07.520> really<00:02:07.970> disappointed<00:02:08.899> in<00:02:09.080> them

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
first really disappointed in them

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.340 
first really disappointed in them
because<00:02:09.830> even<00:02:10.580> though<00:02:10.789> their<00:02:11.540> pre<00:02:11.750> broken<00:02:12.140> in

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
because even though their pre broken in

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.890 
because even though their pre broken in
you<00:02:13.280> still<00:02:14.090> need<00:02:14.330> to<00:02:14.480> break<00:02:14.720> them<00:02:14.930> in<00:02:15.110> and<00:02:16.900> so

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
you still need to break them in and so

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.660 
you still need to break them in and so
that<00:02:18.050> took<00:02:18.230> about<00:02:18.350> an<00:02:18.530> hour<00:02:18.590> but<00:02:19.250> after<00:02:19.400> that

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
that took about an hour but after that

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.770 
that took about an hour but after that
it's<00:02:20.209> just<00:02:20.300> really<00:02:21.430> sugary<00:02:22.430> smooth<00:02:23.269> slides
