00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
so that's just many reason here think

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.170 
so that's just many reason here think
why<00:01:03.750> they<00:01:04.350> are<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.710> DG<00:01:05.129> 3<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.670> killer<00:01:05.909> phone

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
why they are in DG 3 is a killer phone

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.950 
why they are in DG 3 is a killer phone
here<00:01:06.540> but<00:01:07.439> there's<00:01:07.619> also<00:01:07.740> some<00:01:08.070> other<00:01:08.130> things

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
here but there's also some other things

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.120 
here but there's also some other things
the<00:01:09.960> other<00:01:10.110> thing<00:01:10.380> here<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:10.830> they're

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
the other thing here is that they're

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.630 
the other thing here is that they're
almost<00:01:11.310> same<00:01:11.760> size<00:01:12.470> but<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.680> seems<00:01:13.920> like<00:01:14.460> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
almost same size but it seems like the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.450 
almost same size but it seems like the
g3<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.619> way<00:01:16.619> more<00:01:16.890> edge<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.729> edge<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.860> that<00:01:19.860> the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
g3 is way more edge to edge and that the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.700 
g3 is way more edge to edge and that the
they<00:01:20.970> successfully<00:01:21.659> have<00:01:21.810> crammed<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.409> a

of the only 5.1 inch which is super tiny
upgrade<00:01:53.369> compared<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.950> what<00:01:55.950> we<00:01:56.820> had<00:01:57.000> that

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
upgrade compared to what we had that

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.319 
upgrade compared to what we had that
last<00:01:57.450> year<00:01:57.840> from<00:02:00.290> from<00:02:01.290> from<00:02:01.350> from<00:02:01.530> from<00:02:01.710> from

last year from from from from from from

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.469 
last year from from from from from from
from<00:02:03.329> something<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.320> galaxy<00:02:04.799> s4<00:02:05.189> which<00:02:06.090> I

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
from something the galaxy s4 which I

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.070 
from something the galaxy s4 which I
guess<00:02:06.810> came<00:02:07.140> with<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:08.330> with<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.420> display<00:02:09.780> that

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
guess came with a with the display that

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.059 
guess came with a with the display that
was

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
was

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.690 
was
that<00:02:11.790> size<00:02:12.469> so<00:02:13.469> let's<00:02:13.709> let's<00:02:14.099> move<00:02:14.250> on<00:02:14.459> now<00:02:14.670> to

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
that size so let's let's move on now to

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.250 
that size so let's let's move on now to
to<00:02:15.599> the<00:02:15.810> next<00:02:16.170> thing<00:02:16.609> why<00:02:17.609> I<00:02:18.030> think<00:02:18.930> here

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
to the next thing why I think here

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.589 
to the next thing why I think here
personally<00:02:19.890> y<00:02:20.189> DM<00:02:21.980> Y<00:02:22.980> D<00:02:23.040> idea<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:24.000> g3<00:02:24.569> is

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
personally y DM Y D idea the g3 is

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.740 
personally y DM Y D idea the g3 is
better<00:02:25.140> over<00:02:25.530> here<00:02:25.739> so<00:02:26.640> we've<00:02:26.909> been<00:02:27.299> saying

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
better over here so we've been saying

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.190 
better over here so we've been saying
now<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.379> take<00:02:28.859> on<00:02:29.040> like<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.370> display<00:02:29.810> size<00:02:30.810> in

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
now the take on like the display size in

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.929 
now the take on like the display size in
terms<00:02:31.470> of<00:02:31.590> its<00:02:31.739> four<00:02:31.920> factor<00:02:32.310> its<00:02:32.430> it's<00:02:32.760> just

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:32.939 
terms of its four factor its it's just

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.569 
terms of its four factor its it's just
better<00:02:33.319> and<00:02:34.319> we<00:02:34.920> have<00:02:34.950> also<00:02:35.250> went<00:02:35.489> over

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
better and we have also went over

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.210 
better and we have also went over
quality<00:02:36.379> there's<00:02:37.379> also<00:02:37.650> another<00:02:38.099> thing

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
quality there's also another thing

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.030 
quality there's also another thing
that's<00:02:38.579> way<00:02:39.060> better<00:02:39.269> here<00:02:39.450> are<00:02:40.109> on<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.500> g3<00:02:41.010> and

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
that's way better here are on the g3 and

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.780 
that's way better here are on the g3 and
that<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.819> display<00:02:42.349> the<00:02:43.349> resolution<00:02:44.310> so

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
that is the display the resolution so

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.170 
that is the display the resolution so
talking<00:02:45.389> the<00:02:45.480> quad<00:02:45.689> HD<00:02:45.959> display<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.889> so<00:02:47.579> 4040

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
talking the quad HD display and so 4040

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.960 
talking the quad HD display and so 4040
does<00:02:48.359> 2560<00:02:49.290> pixels<00:02:49.319> and<00:02:50.010> I<00:02:50.459> probably<00:02:50.669> going<00:02:50.879> to

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
does 2560 pixels and I probably going to

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.089 
does 2560 pixels and I probably going to
do<00:02:51.030> more<00:02:51.239> videos<00:02:51.299> about<00:02:51.659> that<00:02:52.079> but<00:02:52.919> it<00:02:53.069> is

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
do more videos about that but it is

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.610 
do more videos about that but it is
super<00:02:53.639> super<00:02:54.329> high<00:02:54.540> resolution<00:02:55.260> screen

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
super super high resolution screen

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.339 
super super high resolution screen
compared<00:02:56.519> to<00:02:56.669> only<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:56.909> 1080p<00:02:57.389> display<00:02:58.049> here

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
compared to only a 1080p display here

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.140 
compared to only a 1080p display here
that<00:02:59.159> you<00:02:59.310> do<00:02:59.430> get<00:02:59.669> on<00:02:59.939> the<00:03:00.799> galaxy<00:03:01.799> s5<00:03:02.150> there

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
that you do get on the galaxy s5 there

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.780 
that you do get on the galaxy s5 there
is<00:03:03.269> a<00:03:03.510> quad<00:03:03.750> HD<00:03:03.900> galaxy<00:03:04.709> s5<00:03:04.950> though<00:03:05.189> and<00:03:05.669> we'll

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
is a quad HD galaxy s5 though and we'll

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.129 
is a quad HD galaxy s5 though and we'll
probably<00:03:05.970> see<00:03:06.299> more<00:03:06.329> about<00:03:06.569> that<00:03:06.689> in<00:03:07.079> the

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
probably see more about that in the

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:10.369 
probably see more about that in the
future<00:03:07.849> and<00:03:08.849> I<00:03:09.269> want<00:03:09.389> to<00:03:09.510> take<00:03:09.629> a<00:03:09.659> look<00:03:09.810> at<00:03:09.989> like

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
future and I want to take a look at like

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.860 
future and I want to take a look at like
pictures<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.159> I<00:03:11.220> like<00:03:11.340> that<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:11.939> you<00:03:12.569> can't

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
pictures and I like that and you can't

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.110 
pictures and I like that and you can't
see<00:03:13.169> a<00:03:13.200> difference<00:03:13.769> in<00:03:14.010> real<00:03:14.159> life<00:03:14.430> or<00:03:14.909> else

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
see a difference in real life or else

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.559 
see a difference in real life or else
I'm<00:03:15.359> going<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.599> say<00:03:15.810> this<00:03:15.959> especially<00:03:16.409> on<00:03:16.949> its

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
I'm going to say this especially on its

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.649 
I'm going to say this especially on its
pictures<00:03:18.569> if<00:03:18.930> I<00:03:19.079> if<00:03:19.199> I<00:03:19.349> can't<00:03:19.590> recall<00:03:19.889> and<00:03:20.659> it's

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:21.659 
pictures if I if I can't recall and it's

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:25.250 
pictures if I if I can't recall and it's
pretty<00:03:22.109> cool<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.440> think<00:03:22.940> so<00:03:23.940> let's<00:03:24.299> move<00:03:24.840> on<00:03:25.049> to

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
pretty cool I think so let's move on to

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.330 
pretty cool I think so let's move on to
some<00:03:25.739> other<00:03:25.919> things<00:03:26.190> here<00:03:26.819> you<00:03:27.659> do<00:03:28.440> get<00:03:28.859> a

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
some other things here you do get a

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.559 
some other things here you do get a
laser<00:03:30.060> a<00:03:30.540> frickin<00:03:31.500> laser<00:03:31.799> on<00:03:32.760> this<00:03:33.060> one<00:03:33.329> and

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
laser a frickin laser on this one and

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.640 
laser a frickin laser on this one and
only<00:03:34.440> g3<00:03:35.069> which<00:03:35.729> is<00:03:35.940> just<00:03:36.180> amazing<00:03:36.690> so<00:03:37.409> this

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
only g3 which is just amazing so this

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.520 
only g3 which is just amazing so this
little<00:03:37.919> laser<00:03:38.129> down<00:03:38.430> here<00:03:38.819> on<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.209> back<00:03:39.530> is

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
little laser down here on the back is

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.059 
little laser down here on the back is
the<00:03:41.519> same<00:03:41.819> laser<00:03:42.209> it<00:03:42.720> seems<00:03:42.989> as<00:03:43.290> some<00:03:43.709> cameras

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
the same laser it seems as some cameras

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.879 
the same laser it seems as some cameras
that's<00:03:44.220> been<00:03:44.370> using<00:03:44.519> so<00:03:44.879> I<00:03:45.120> mean<00:03:45.750> focus<00:03:46.079> with

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
that's been using so I mean focus with

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.460 
that's been using so I mean focus with
the<00:03:47.040> camera<00:03:47.489> is<00:03:47.669> just<00:03:48.269> so<00:03:48.659> quick

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
the camera is just so quick

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.670 
the camera is just so quick
I<00:03:49.819> mean<00:03:50.930> you<00:03:51.930> just<00:03:51.959> tap<00:03:52.260> somewhere

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
I mean you just tap somewhere

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.899 
I mean you just tap somewhere
and<00:03:52.949> instantly<00:03:53.760> it<00:03:54.349> starts<00:03:55.349> to<00:03:55.530> focus<00:03:55.849> at<00:03:56.849> that

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
and instantly it starts to focus at that

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:00.800 
and instantly it starts to focus at that
area<00:03:57.419> and<00:03:57.780> it<00:03:58.769> changes<00:03:59.519> automatically<00:04:00.269> super

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
area and it changes automatically super

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.020 
area and it changes automatically super
super<00:04:01.139> quick<00:04:01.319> and<00:04:01.709> I<00:04:02.459> haven't<00:04:02.699> done<00:04:02.819> a<00:04:02.849> video

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
super quick and I haven't done a video

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.960 
super quick and I haven't done a video
about<00:04:03.209> it<00:04:03.510> but<00:04:03.780> then<00:04:04.109> I<00:04:04.290> probably<00:04:04.680> want<00:04:05.639> to<00:04:05.879> do

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
about it but then I probably want to do

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.499 
about it but then I probably want to do
a<00:04:06.000> video<00:04:06.239> about<00:04:06.510> it<00:04:06.840> I<00:04:07.939> mean<00:04:08.939> it's<00:04:09.180> it's

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:09.509 
a video about it I mean it's it's

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:14.479 
a video about it I mean it's it's
intense<00:04:09.930> how<00:04:10.470> good<00:04:10.739> it<00:04:10.859> is<00:04:12.979> you<00:04:13.979> can<00:04:14.159> see<00:04:14.310> those

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
intense how good it is you can see those

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.909 
intense how good it is you can see those
things<00:04:14.790> that<00:04:14.970> comes<00:04:15.239> up<00:04:15.389> sometimes<00:04:15.919> the

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
things that comes up sometimes the

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.330 
things that comes up sometimes the
system<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:18.150> laser<00:04:18.389> working<00:04:19.229> there<00:04:19.500> to<00:04:19.979> change

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
system the laser working there to change

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.069 
system the laser working there to change
focus

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
focus

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.659 
focus
and<00:04:22.169> it's<00:04:22.560> really<00:04:22.830> really<00:04:23.129> intense<00:04:23.310> and<00:04:23.490> cool

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
and it's really really intense and cool

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.059 
and it's really really intense and cool
so<00:04:24.330> that's<00:04:24.659> one<00:04:25.259> of<00:04:25.349> those<00:04:25.440> other<00:04:25.710> killer

00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:26.069 
so that's one of those other killer

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:28.339 
so that's one of those other killer
things<00:04:26.460> here<00:04:26.909> they're<00:04:27.720> really<00:04:27.900> really<00:04:28.199> do

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:28.349 
things here they're really really do

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:31.210 
things here they're really really do
enjoy<00:04:28.470> about<00:04:29.129> the<00:04:29.280> LG<00:04:29.550> g3<00:04:29.729> what's<00:04:30.330> better<00:04:30.569> and

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
enjoy about the LG g3 what's better and

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.309 
enjoy about the LG g3 what's better and
another<00:04:32.220> thing<00:04:32.520> here<00:04:32.940> is<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:33.870> problem<00:04:34.139> one

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:34.319 
another thing here is the problem one

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:36.770 
another thing here is the problem one
last<00:04:34.650> ones<00:04:34.919> here<00:04:35.310> that<00:04:35.520> I'm<00:04:36.180> going<00:04:36.330> to<00:04:36.389> say<00:04:36.539> is

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
last ones here that I'm going to say is

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.659 
last ones here that I'm going to say is
the<00:04:36.990> battery<00:04:37.409> you<00:04:38.039> do<00:04:38.159> get<00:04:38.310> a<00:04:38.340> little<00:04:38.490> bit

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
the battery you do get a little bit
