00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:09.070
 Hello everyone I am this nutritionist 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.780
 the residents and my recipes I'm going to 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.590
 talk again about the foods that 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:17.619
 reduce cholesterol to clarify a 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.510
 very common mistake is usually believed when 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.089
 has cholesterol that measures there 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.089
 to take in nutrition are on the one hand 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:26.949
 reduce food of animal origin and 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:29.949
 increase plant-based foods 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.640
 Well, this generalization is not 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.399
 correct 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.010
 on the one hand the food of origin 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.559
 animal not all fats of origin 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.560
 animal are harmful there are 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.110
 beneficial for health 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.390
 there are foods of animal origin that 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.730
 they have saturated fats that as I said 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.890
 in a video are harmful by 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.840
 example are the fats that we found 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.710
 in the butters in dairy 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.850
 whole or in fatty meats but 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.000
 there are also foods of animal origin 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.150
 that have beneficial fats such as 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.930
 unsaturated fats for example in the 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.660
 blue fish a very common example is they are 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.500
 sardines the consumption of sardines a 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.770
 Although it is a food 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.920
 which has cholesterol helps to decrease it 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.500
 by the type of fat then there are the 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.660
 the plant food 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.120
 plant food fats 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.810
 Vegetables are not synonymous with fats 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:34.570
 healthful there are also harmful 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.580
 On the one hand there are fats that are 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.040
 beneficial fats are 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.050
 unsaturated that we can find them in 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.390
 the extra virgin olive oil or in the 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.400
 nuts but there are also foods 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.009
 of vegetable origin that have fats 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.860
 saturated as for example the oils 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:55.020
 of olive or bread do not forgive the oil of 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.020
 olive not palm or coconut 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.970
 these foods of plant origin can 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.130
 be that they do not have cholesterol because 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.650
 remember that cholesterol but it comes 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.479
 always of food of animal origin 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.970
 but be careful because they can help 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:13.420
 increase it 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.250
 and something that many people do not know and that you 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.680
 I have to clarify also taking advantage 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.540
 that we are talking about this there are many 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.580
 packaged products that although they are from 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.920
 plant origin in the labeling 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.590
 nutritional we can see what it says 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.500
 fats of vegetable origin well 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.110
 when you put this in, do not think that 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.690
 they refer to it neither olive oil nor 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.450
 sunflower oil because if that were what 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.239
 re mark would usually refer to oils 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.480
 non-beneficial vegetables as well the 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:46.450
 palm or coconut oil so a lot 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.550
 Be careful with this and this is all I hope 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.260
 have helped you clarify your doubts 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.260
 until the next friends video
