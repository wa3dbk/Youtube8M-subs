time and getting more things to do now

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.990 
time and getting more things to do now
gugu<00:00:22.830> could<00:00:22.980> potentially<00:00:23.490> teach<00:00:23.699> them<00:00:23.910> to

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
gugu could potentially teach them to

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.080 
gugu could potentially teach them to
kaio-ken<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.680> don't<00:00:26.310> that<00:00:26.400> cocaine<00:00:26.789> is

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
kaio-ken and I don't that cocaine is

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.810 
kaio-ken and I don't that cocaine is
pretty<00:00:27.720> pretty<00:00:28.170> much<00:00:28.260> forgotten<00:00:28.800> by<00:00:28.949> now<00:00:29.099> but

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
pretty pretty much forgotten by now but

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.580 
pretty pretty much forgotten by now but
it<00:00:30.090> would<00:00:30.269> still<00:00:30.420> be<00:00:30.539> really<00:00:30.990> useful<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.439> them

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
it would still be really useful to them

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.470 
it would still be really useful to them
because<00:00:31.859> x<00:00:32.279> 20<00:00:32.640> boosting<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.059> power<00:00:33.239> by<00:00:33.360> that

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
because x 20 boosting that power by that

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.180 
because x 20 boosting that power by that
much<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.870> know<00:00:33.899> would<00:00:34.230> probably<00:00:34.860> come<00:00:35.070> in

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
much you know would probably come in

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.540 
much you know would probably come in
handy<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.730> mean<00:00:36.620> sure<00:00:37.620> they're<00:00:37.980> not<00:00:38.370> that

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
handy I mean sure they're not that

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.100 
handy I mean sure they're not that
useful<00:00:38.790> anymore<00:00:39.210> at<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:39.450> stage<00:00:39.780> but<00:00:39.989> you

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
useful anymore at this stage but you

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.840 
useful anymore at this stage but you
know<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.800> we<00:00:40.920> could<00:00:41.070> possibly<00:00:41.190> have<00:00:41.670> some

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
know that we could possibly have some

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.100 
know that we could possibly have some
scenes<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.270> training<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.989> know

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
scenes of the training you know

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.569

preparing<00:00:43.530> for<00:00:43.890> something<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.370> case

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
preparing for something in case

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.729 
preparing for something in case
something<00:00:44.940> goes<00:00:45.090> wrong<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.170> just<00:00:46.200> seeing

your producer power now I believe the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.779 
your producer power now I believe the
gun<00:01:00.359> could<00:01:00.809> possibly<00:01:01.230> get<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.670> know

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
gun could possibly get the you know

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.850 
gun could possibly get the you know
Super<00:01:03.059> Saiyan<00:01:03.239> God<00:01:03.420> power<00:01:04.080> up<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.470> he<00:01:04.710> could

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
Super Saiyan God power up and he could

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.380 
Super Saiyan God power up and he could
possibly<00:01:05.189> absorb<00:01:05.430> their<00:01:05.729> power<00:01:05.760> up<00:01:06.090> into

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
possibly absorb their power up into

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.080 
possibly absorb their power up into
himself<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.860> know<00:01:07.950> become<00:01:08.220> God<00:01:08.850> beyond

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
himself and you know become God beyond

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.149 
himself and you know become God beyond
saying<00:01:09.330> like<00:01:09.510> goku<00:01:09.780> vegeta<00:01:09.900> did<00:01:10.260> because<00:01:10.590> he

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
saying like goku vegeta did because he

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.350 
saying like goku vegeta did because he
has<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> massive<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.909> know<00:01:12.030> amount<00:01:12.270> of

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
has a massive you know amount of

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.450 
has a massive you know amount of
potential<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:13.200> mean<00:01:13.590> he<00:01:13.770> hasn't<00:01:13.920> trained<00:01:14.250> for<00:01:14.310> a

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
potential I mean he hasn't trained for a

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.710 
potential I mean he hasn't trained for a
while<00:01:14.610> but<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:14.909> wouldn't<00:01:15.270> stop<00:01:15.360> him<00:01:15.600> from

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
while but that wouldn't stop him from

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.929 
while but that wouldn't stop him from
doing<00:01:15.930> such<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> thing<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:17.610> know<00:01:17.729> he's

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
doing such a thing and you know he's

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.450 
doing such a thing and you know he's
parallel<00:01:18.299> would<00:01:18.810> massively<00:01:19.680> skyrocket

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
parallel would massively skyrocket

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.190 
parallel would massively skyrocket
because<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:20.939> new<00:01:21.000> power<00:01:21.299> up<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.750> then<00:01:21.930> if

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
because of this new power up and then if

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.440 
because of this new power up and then if
he<00:01:22.409> trains<00:01:22.650> with<00:01:22.740> weez<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.790> power<00:01:24.060> up<00:01:24.180> even

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
he trains with weez you power up even

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.380 
he trains with weez you power up even
more<00:01:24.600> they<00:01:25.110> possibly<00:01:25.590> get<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.310> know<00:01:26.430> his

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
more they possibly get you know his

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.390 
more they possibly get you know his
