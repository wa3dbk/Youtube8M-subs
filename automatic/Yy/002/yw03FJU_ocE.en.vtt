 because I've been fascinated with the way 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.670
 to write you remember in this new 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.320
 saga of books now we no longer have the 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.270
 ten witnesses as protagonists but to 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.670
 the Egyptians one thing that I love 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.190
 He always liked it Egypt 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.480
 the pharaohs the pyramids and the gods 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.400
 so this new saga has lied 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.720
 totally fascinated and also the new 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.510
 form of writing of the author who has 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.980
 as protagonists to exit and cÃ¡rter that 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.480
 are two brothers are the protagonists 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.980
 of this story and each chapter is 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.780
 narrated from a point of view 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.280
 different so it's been a great 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.870
 reading and it exists being that this second 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.730
 part is also another of the readings 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.350
 what I plan to do will be mansfield park 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.920
 jane austen is the second novel that 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.110
 shape 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.549
 of the joint reading of the novels of 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.810
 jane austen which organized inside 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.640
 my block would leave you here below 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.350

 you want to read with me the novels of 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.390
 jane austen I think the third one comes out the 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.860
 fourth time he reads the novel of 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.170
 mansfield park and you will be wondering 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.090
 never get tired of reading the books of 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.590
 fill you up the answer is that no 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.090
 because we each have an author 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.250
 preferred we love reading the novels 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.509
 of that author and you are my case is Chinese 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.310
 shen so I'm going to have to go to the

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.909
 many rereadings so this month touches 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.350
 mansfield for other readings I think 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.030
 will be Aragon that he prepared 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.080
 read and finally I will start this saga 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.030
 of books I really want 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.770
 I mentioned that I had it pending in the 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.970
 top 10 of the forgotten of the year 2013 and 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.950
 I'll leave the link up here 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.000
 you can visit it I'm really looking forward 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.100
 because the truth is that I am very 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.090
 currently fond of dragons I 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.130
 has always called attention 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.110
 this saga of books and the movie already 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.819
 I said many times I liked it and I'm 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.069
 wishing that aragon is a great read 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:01.959
 of the readings you see before the un 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:03.850
 the awakening of the dragon's eye are 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:05.679
 guzmÃ¡n is a book that asks commented to 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.420
 through the irec book hold me channel 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.890
 it caught a lot of attention so I 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.420
 I signed it and the other day by chance 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.769
 went to the library looking for a book and 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.340
 I found it so I could not 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.620
 withstand 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.030
 borrowed for this month of March I think that 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.280
 it's an interesting habit because he won the 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.110
 youth fantasy novel prize the 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.060
 year 2008 in australia I think that way 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.709
 part of a trilogy so I'm 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.120
 Wishing to read it the truth is that I do not know 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.950
 a lot about the book because the meter 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.140
 nor the synopsis of the back cover but 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.599
 it came so well recommended iva about 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.739
 dragons or m the bears but so what 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.420
 I took it, I think this March I'm going to 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.640
 have a great reaction of dragons 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.319
 because between lion and aragon is going to have 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.879
 dragons for a while and the last one I'm going to 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.319
 teach cellay the boy next to 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:42.700
 lost stephanie I have so many 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.530
 I want to start this book because I 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.910
 They left for Christmas and still not 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.290
 I had found the perfect place to 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.090
 I can read it but I think it will be 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.380
 during this month of March I like 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.730
 very much the first quality novel of the 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.170
 author who was a kiss in Paris 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.940
 story was beautiful to the characters 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.650
 they fell in love with me and although it may seem 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.269
 typical story full of romance 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.340
 teenager the typical cliches 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.560
 the truth is that it was very very pretty 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.970
 very romantic and I'm sure that the 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.379
 hello and the boy on the side will also be a 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.610
 very good reading good these are 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.290
 some of the books you plan to read 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.790
 during the month of March is taught 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.620
 total of five books but it ensures you 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.030
 that the reading list is going to increase 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.590
 considerably during this month 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.180
