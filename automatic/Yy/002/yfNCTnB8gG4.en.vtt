00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.080
 hello gold to ambatobe is very 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.700
 simple it's a little hairstyles so 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.740
 you would not necessarily like them 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.780
 hairstyles that will have it's ok huh 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.480
 because I do not necessarily have them 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.800
 same tastes so the hairstyles that have 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.660
 changed it's sure rochelle tpu and on 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.980
 spectra good spectra I show you after 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.550
 because we see really well and 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.289
 change so in fact rochelle it's 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.990
 super simple I will show you everything 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.420
 immediately watched a little wine if you 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.910
 see information and we will see after 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.719
 so I'll find you again 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.210
 so 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.329
 in fact I do not know if you see but 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.539
 there I started a braid underneath 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.440
 the ear here so I 'm going to start that 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.239
 to make them go to coma I put 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.230
 a black elastic that you can see 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.870
 here I pass them all around in 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.640
 below like that and suddenly it raised 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.239
 a little bit her hair and there I look 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.210
 shot down here on the other side I'm going to the 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:07.260
 same thing I made a braid here 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.170
 all along that was going up here is 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.210
 frozen jelly there I fixed the two 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.010
 ends together and suddenly it makes a 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.140
 kind of ponytail is 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.950
 really use an elastic for the 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.200
 do it directly 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.060
 they find me no doubt that he is going 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.970
 very good 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:29.750
 it's not a monster high 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:35.990
 say right now in fact so here 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:38.550
 the point is done so ben that's good 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.680
 So that's me I find it laid back 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.830
 super good after you do not have to 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.830
 to love 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:52.710
 now we'll go to spectrum 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.270
 so prepared I do not know that for 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.470
 breathe something because the change 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.420
 it is true we see well before this expensive 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:05.610
 friend let's introduce you to spectra 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:09.149
 boom and here is what spectra fears 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:14.130
 strip gays gold hair has 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.150
 started when I did this time I 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.880
 will formulate both 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.500
 I was saying the hairstyle started when 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.540
 I'm doing this braid with the wicks 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.700
 clear then I will explain to you 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.080
 how did I then to matrices I 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.920
 did not do as usual 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:32.550
 go through the middle part to the top no 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:36.300
 at molin ballerina bag I spent a year 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.900
 so are aiming to show you there that 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.970
 risk of not working too well but 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.560
 it is not serious 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.550
 here is me spectra so I'm going to you 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.180
 show how I was so in fact 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.500
 started taking 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.989
 good if you want to do as well as 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.250
 I took I think a little less than 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:03:03.660
 that perhaps it 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:03.660
 at pu so cut you between parties 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:13.630
 com 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:21.190
 usually a big so then I 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:27.430
 actually goes below hop I 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:31.760
 pass below hop I do 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:34.060
 pass underneath 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.060
 hop 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.260
 instead of passing over which 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.299
 he did not see very well but it's not 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.560
 true 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:48.640
 and there you see it starts to make a 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.709
 little braid but it's really going to have 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.340
 the habit 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.230
 good now I'm going to show you 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.459
 how do we do that actually gives 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.629
 now I'm going to drink explain to you 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.819
 why I was like that and not like 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.670
 usually because I usually do 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.379
 share above 1 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:07.930
 as usual actually put on sale there 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:09.310
 it's because I have them down there 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.840
 and do not think it's a big deal 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.530
 bump not pass if you would have been 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.509
 as usual it would have done yes and 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.430
 it would have been weird and low shot 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:21.489
 to make it a little not too much 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.080
 weird that's why I tell you 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.330
 right now it's not the race of the 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.479
 braid played at the start make this pass 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:32.550
 press around like that except that a 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:34.840
 elastic it was cpt but here after 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.960
 I removed all that wick from the 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.370
 quilt is here 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.020
 here is the wick so it's a bit like 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:47.449
 a headband and after hop the quilt 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.490
 Ben here is this tutorial is finished 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.750
 now we will do a little bonus and 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.539
 I will show you some monsters 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:56.289
 had I have a little if you want a little 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.289
 in use 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:06.199
 here's maquis again this tome what she 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:07.610
 is beautiful yes she actually is a little 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:10.039
 an imitation monster high 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:13.580
 and she still shows 13 school one 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:16.069
 thing in the beginning the wicks case of ben they 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.180
 were connected by a rubber band here 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:21.319
 so maybe they can maybe 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.520
 know this barbie mr hyde and at 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:24.529
