00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
move into the aqua hot this also has the

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.000 
move into the aqua hot this also has the
engine<00:04:57.360> preheat<00:04:57.750> package<00:04:58.229> so<00:04:58.410> it'll<00:04:58.620> actually

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
engine preheat package so it'll actually

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.830 
engine preheat package so it'll actually
warm<00:04:59.250> up<00:04:59.430> the<00:04:59.550> engine<00:04:59.880> before<00:05:00.210> you<00:05:00.360> start<00:05:00.690> it

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840

what's<00:05:01.289> really<00:05:01.530> nice<00:05:01.680> about<00:05:01.740> the<00:05:02.130> aqua<00:05:02.520> hot<00:05:02.729> is

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
what's really nice about the aqua hot is

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.420 
what's really nice about the aqua hot is
that<00:05:03.060> it's<00:05:03.450> a<00:05:03.660> hydronic<00:05:04.350> heating<00:05:04.710> system<00:05:05.250> so

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
that it's a hydronic heating system so

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.969 
that it's a hydronic heating system so
it<00:05:05.580> pumps<00:05:05.880> glycol<00:05:06.450> through<00:05:07.199> the<00:05:07.380> coach<00:05:07.620> and

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
it pumps glycol through the coach and

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:09.950 
it pumps glycol through the coach and
the<00:05:08.430> other<00:05:08.550> nice<00:05:08.760> thing<00:05:09.030> is<00:05:09.180> it's<00:05:09.479> diesel

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
the other nice thing is it's diesel

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.960 
the other nice thing is it's diesel
fired<00:05:10.169> so<00:05:10.530> you're<00:05:10.680> not<00:05:10.800> using<00:05:11.039> propane<00:05:11.729> and

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
fired so you're not using propane and

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.700 
fired so you're not using propane and
then<00:05:12.330> when<00:05:12.479> you<00:05:12.600> get<00:05:12.720> to<00:05:12.780> a<00:05:12.930> park<00:05:13.289> you<00:05:13.500> can

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
then when you get to a park you can

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.040 
then when you get to a park you can
switch<00:05:14.100> it<00:05:14.130> to<00:05:14.310> electric<00:05:14.880> and<00:05:15.060> it'll<00:05:15.720> convert

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
switch it to electric and it'll convert

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.080 
switch it to electric and it'll convert
over<00:05:16.200> to<00:05:16.289> electric<00:05:16.830> heat<00:05:17.039> that's<00:05:17.280> firing<00:05:17.760> the

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
over to electric heat that's firing the

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.840 
over to electric heat that's firing the
burner<00:05:18.300> so<00:05:18.810> just<00:05:19.260> a<00:05:19.350> fantastic<00:05:19.979> option<00:05:20.520> of

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
burner so just a fantastic option of

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.700 
burner so just a fantastic option of
while<00:05:21.210> it's<00:05:21.419> a<00:05:21.479> very<00:05:21.510> expensive<00:05:21.930> option<00:05:22.620> I

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
while it's a very expensive option I

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.890 
while it's a very expensive option I
think<00:05:22.740> it's<00:05:23.070> just<00:05:23.250> worth<00:05:23.910> every<00:05:24.270> penny

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
think it's just worth every penny

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.680 
think it's just worth every penny
