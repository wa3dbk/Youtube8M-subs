00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.300
 today I bring you an informative video more 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.920
 that nobody marks because they say and I'm going to 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.930
 talk a little fast to finish fast 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.280
 with this topic and so not them now 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.750
 to begin with let's talk about the 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.240
 infinite world controversy what is 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.950
 what is going to interest you best yesterday 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.270
 James public that there are no worlds 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.669
 infinite that the worlds are going to be of 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.250
 tinder by disc today takes only against you 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.000
 If you publish the following, first put the 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.100
 worlds and they are going to be absolutely 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.860
 infinite that 10 k by 10 k is a 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.420
 default way to generate or 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.820
 create a world but that this any 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.190
 will be able to modify it and be able to do them 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.870
 or turn into infinite worlds what 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.100
 I understand what it says for and is going to 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.660
 be like with a predetermined way 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.250
 of generating your world that is going to 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.750
 generate up there but then I do not want 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.640
 can be infinite something stupid I 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.740
 I would say because it is infinite or you go 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.910
 to finish the memory your phone 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.290
 walking in the fucking world and then to 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.750
 time is not going to have any space 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:09.270
 that's why me and he says this is not 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.800
 Well, obviously there will be 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.480
 we know they will see different sizes of 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.370
 worlds so I think that 10k for 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.530
 10k is another size of the world that goes 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.479
 to see what is going to be so to speak 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.060
 normal if you want you will have worlds 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.670
 infinite if not and smaller worlds 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.200
 for mid-range devices or 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.390
 low or that do not hold the worlds 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.690
 big 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.700
 2 the public that this limiting good I 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.010
 understood this tweet like that he publishes 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.260
 that the limitation of 10 k by 10 k is not going 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:41.430
 to come in this version of the 0.9 point 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.680
 0 but until 0.9 point 1 because not 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.229
 they have a lot of time to add it 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.600
 that puts in the end we will have to live 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.850
 by by d as with many 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.619
 worlds infinite worlds is what I 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.479
 that I understood and that's why I say 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.659
 no or it is not so much that 10 k per disc 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.970
 is going to be the final size of the map not 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.160
 but this is going to be a normal option 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.050
 or standardized the size of minecraft 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.360
 that editing and then obviously if you have 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.979
 phone or a device less 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.300
 resources are going to have to do your 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.510
 worlds are smaller that will come 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.190
 the option is assumed and if you can or if 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.080
 you want to have infinite worlds and finish 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.780
 you your memory stick walking from here 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.489
 over there you can do it also not 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.769
 but they say that this limitation of the 10 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.750
 that will be up to maybe the 0.9 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.459
 point 1 is what I understood is what 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.170
 I understood bastards before they come to 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.370
 Fuck machine and good with regard to the 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.170
 image 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.940
 this is an image that goes up that is in 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.379
 the sheet and how they see the fucking world 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.980
 you see giant looks huge I do not know what 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:39.690
 size be but but it looks great and what 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.890
 what he says is that the man who does not 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.239
 is already a bit more stable and that is not 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.330
 scare the trees that say that 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.129
 get to see there floating in the air 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.629
 I think it refers to those of water or us 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.879
 said this that it seems to be floating 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.950
 this here says do not get scared 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.840
 that those little mistakes or problems already 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.010
 they have them under control so nothing 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.290
 guys that would be all in terms of 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.540
 news understand 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.010
 one last thing in the previous video I 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.780
 they said many hears but it is that micros 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.819
 fish do not have infinite worlds I do not know 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.230
 where did they get that idea of ​​me 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.000
 I said that minecraft is already we have the 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.890
 infinite in itself this controversy the 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.390
 key from a long time ago 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.620
 when they said that worlds would come out 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.180
 infinities of minecraft or what edition I 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.400
 I told them I started I did not know and that 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.799
 it would be something unique to minecraft that 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.629
 they run until now but it's obviously going to 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.980
 be infinite worlds up to where you 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.019
 phone hold it because you're not going to 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.940
 generate a fucking world of 20,000 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.040
 gigabytes and your phone has nothing else 4 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.810
 gigabytes of space is not something is something that 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.670
 we must think that so nothing 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.910
 dismissal I'm pro regime and I hope so 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.490
 liked this video 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.170
 I just wanted to create doubts and 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.500
 good regards guys we'll see you until the 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.500
 next
