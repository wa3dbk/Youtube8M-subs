Spring 2015

Konrad Wielogórski
CEO, Co-organizer of the Absolvent Talent Days, Bespoke

00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:56.875
If you ask me if we wanted to create a better career fair,

00:00:56.875 --> 00:00:58.509
the answer is obvious.

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:59.495
Absolutely not.

00:00:59.795 --> 00:01:01.795
What we wanted to do from the beginning

00:01:02.055 --> 00:01:04.055
was redefine the concept of career fair entirely.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.400
Katarzyna Godlewska
COO&amp;CO-FUNDER Absolvent.pl

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.540
What we are particularly proud of here, at Absolvent.pl

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.960
Is the fact that thanks to the Absolvent Talent Days many companies believed in the effectiveness of career fairs again.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.580
Since the first time those employers appeared at our event

00:01:26.896 --> 00:01:28.856
they’ve kept coming back.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.580
It’s often the only event they participate in.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.280
Rafał Nachyna
Managing Director, Pracuj.pl

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.480
Pracuj.pl became the Absolvent Talent Days Strategic Partner,

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.480
because we want to support young people in their first experiences of work.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.200
It’s the biggest event of its kind targeted at students and graduates.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.580
Thanks to our partnership

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.320
many participants of the event

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.240
were able not only to meet renowned employers

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.260
but also to get practical information on finding a job.
