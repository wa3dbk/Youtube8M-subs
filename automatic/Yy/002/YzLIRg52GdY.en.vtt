it's sherry we're gonna talk about how

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.780 
it's sherry we're gonna talk about how
to<00:00:02.070> decorate<00:00:02.399> using<00:00:03.240> a<00:00:03.419> round<00:00:03.780> tip<00:00:04.470> and<00:00:04.859> this

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
to decorate using a round tip and this

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.290 
to decorate using a round tip and this
is<00:00:06.000> a<00:00:06.029> big<00:00:06.420> round<00:00:06.810> tip<00:00:07.109> it's<00:00:07.319> 1a<00:00:07.799> and<00:00:08.400> it<00:00:09.179> was

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
is a big round tip it's 1a and it was

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.770 
is a big round tip it's 1a and it was
very<00:00:09.540> difficult<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.380> find<00:00:10.710> I<00:00:10.980> went<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:12.059> three

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
very difficult to find I went to three

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.110 
very difficult to find I went to three
different<00:00:12.900> craft<00:00:13.290> stores<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.980> Walmart<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.639> I

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
different craft stores and Walmart and I

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.970 
different craft stores and Walmart and I
finally<00:00:15.509> had<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.900> buy<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.139> in<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.590> kit<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:18.180> tips<00:00:18.980> I

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
finally had to buy it in a kit of tips I

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.859 
finally had to buy it in a kit of tips I
would<00:00:20.730> recommend<00:00:21.380> ordering<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.859> online

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
would recommend ordering it online

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.660 
would recommend ordering it online
because<00:00:24.869> it's<00:00:25.350> easier<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.769> find<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.369> also

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
because it's easier to find and I also

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.259 
because it's easier to find and I also
recommend<00:00:27.420> using<00:00:28.140> all<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.890> same<00:00:29.099> brand<00:00:29.460> so

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
recommend using all of the same brand so

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.010 
recommend using all of the same brand so
I<00:00:30.810> like<00:00:31.619> Welton<00:00:32.130> Wilton<00:00:32.550> so<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.300> would<00:00:33.660> get<00:00:33.809> the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
I like Welton Wilton so I would get the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.979 
I like Welton Wilton so I would get the
Wilton<00:00:34.410> tips<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.370> Wilton<00:00:35.760> couplers<00:00:36.180> you

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
Wilton tips the Wilton couplers you

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.560 
Wilton tips the Wilton couplers you
could<00:00:37.170> probably<00:00:37.350> get<00:00:37.590> any<00:00:37.739> bag<00:00:38.010> but<00:00:38.540> what<00:00:39.540> I

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
could probably get any bag but what I

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.490 
could probably get any bag but what I
found<00:00:39.870> with<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.200> couplers<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:42.170> the<00:00:43.170> tips

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
found with the couplers is that the tips

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.500 
found with the couplers is that the tips
from<00:00:43.800> one<00:00:44.010> brand<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.730> tips<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.300> other

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
from one brand to the tips to the other

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.100 
from one brand to the tips to the other
brand<00:00:46.309> had<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.340> little<00:00:47.910> issue<00:00:48.180> there<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:49.050> you

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
brand had a little issue there so you

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.380 
brand had a little issue there so you
would<00:00:49.590> want<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.980> stay<00:00:50.520> in<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.789> same<00:00:51.000> brand<00:00:51.239> if

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
would want to stay in the same brand if

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.590 
would want to stay in the same brand if
you<00:00:51.420> possibly<00:00:51.930> can<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:53.000> another<00:00:54.000> thing<00:00:54.300> when

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
you possibly can and another thing when

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.000 
you possibly can and another thing when
you<00:00:54.690> get<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.050> lot<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.530> start<00:00:55.770> getting

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
you get that a lot you start getting

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.709 
you get that a lot you start getting
these<00:00:56.100> large<00:00:56.370> tips<00:00:56.850> you're<00:00:57.300> gonna<00:00:57.420> need<00:00:57.660> a

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
these large tips you're gonna need a

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.049 
these large tips you're gonna need a
larger<00:00:58.109> coupler<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.070> other<00:00:59.430> video<00:01:00.000> I

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
larger coupler and the other video I

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.970 
larger coupler and the other video I
made<00:01:00.420> about<00:01:00.449> using<00:01:01.109> tips<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.469> couplers<00:01:01.800> I

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
made about using tips and couplers I

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.880 
made about using tips and couplers I
showed<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.579> small<00:01:02.850> one<00:01:03.000> but<00:01:03.480> these<00:01:03.600> are

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
showed you the small one but these are

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.880 
showed you the small one but these are
large<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.760> will<00:01:06.170> actually<00:01:07.170> fit<00:01:07.740> the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
large and it will actually fit the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.000 
large and it will actually fit the
larger<00:01:08.280> tips<00:01:09.380> okay<00:01:10.490> so<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:13.110> way<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.350> decorate

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
larger tips okay so the way you decorate

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.410 
larger tips okay so the way you decorate
using<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.509> round<00:01:16.369> tip<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.759> large<00:01:18.000> round<00:01:18.299> tip

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
using the round tip the large round tip

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.120 
using the round tip the large round tip
the<00:01:18.780> very<00:01:18.990> first<00:01:19.259> thing<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.560> do<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.950> want

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
the very first thing you do is you want

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.940 
the very first thing you do is you want
to<00:01:20.220> put<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> dollop<00:01:20.729> in<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.180> middle<00:01:21.830> and<00:01:22.830> this

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
to put a dollop in the middle and this

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.649 
to put a dollop in the middle and this
is<00:01:23.070> gonna<00:01:23.220> give<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.400> height<00:01:26.240> one<00:01:27.240> thing<00:01:27.450> you

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
is gonna give it height one thing you

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.929 
is gonna give it height one thing you
when<00:01:28.140> you're<00:01:28.290> pressing<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:29.430> hold<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.759> bag

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
when you're pressing you hold the bag

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.600 
when you're pressing you hold the bag
like<00:01:30.150> this<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.659> when<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.320> press<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:32.310> want<00:01:32.340> to

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
like this and when you press you want to

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.660 
like this and when you press you want to
keep<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.479> same<00:01:33.689> pressure<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.439> then<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.520> can

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
keep the same pressure and then you can

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.310 
keep the same pressure and then you can
put<00:01:35.820> your<00:01:36.000> hand<00:01:36.210> here<00:01:36.270> if<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.750> want<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.200> don't

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
put your hand here if you want you don't

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.399 
put your hand here if you want you don't
have<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.880> have<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.600> need<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.960> let<00:01:40.200> go

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
have to but you have you need to let go

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.990 
have to but you have you need to let go
of<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.680> pressure<00:01:40.829> before<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.520> lift<00:01:41.759> up

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
of the pressure before you lift up

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.260 
of the pressure before you lift up
otherwise<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.930> get<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.470> big<00:01:44.100> tip<00:01:44.369> then<00:01:45.180> you

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
otherwise you get a big tip then you

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.069 
otherwise you get a big tip then you
just<00:01:45.509> start<00:01:45.810> around<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.229> edge<00:01:47.630> move<00:01:48.630> slowly

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
just start around the edge move slowly

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.060 
just start around the edge move slowly
and<00:01:50.000> this<00:01:51.000> takes<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.420> lot<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.750> frosting

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.990 

and<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:56.150> recipe<00:01:56.600> I<00:01:56.630> have<00:01:57.140> calls<00:01:57.830> for<00:01:58.280> it

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
and the recipe I have calls for it

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.230 
and the recipe I have calls for it
actually<00:01:59.330> makes<00:01:59.510> a<00:01:59.600> lot<00:01:59.750> of<00:01:59.780> frosting<00:02:04.240> slowly

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
actually makes a lot of frosting slowly

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.380 
actually makes a lot of frosting slowly
around<00:02:06.310> its<00:02:07.310> gonna<00:02:07.400> be<00:02:07.610> like<00:02:07.640> an<00:02:07.910> ice<00:02:08.119> cream

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
around its gonna be like an ice cream

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:16.990 
around its gonna be like an ice cream
swirl

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.470 

and<00:02:17.540> when<00:02:17.690> I<00:02:17.780> get<00:02:17.840> to<00:02:17.990> the<00:02:18.230> end<00:02:19.060> let<00:02:20.060> go<00:02:20.240> the

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
and when I get to the end let go the

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.020 
and when I get to the end let go the
pressure<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:22.760> then<00:02:22.910> pull<00:02:23.180> that<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:25.030> that's

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
pressure and then pull that and that's

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.650 
pressure and then pull that and that's
how<00:02:26.210> you<00:02:26.270> make<00:02:26.510> an<00:02:26.690> ice-cream<00:02:26.900> swirl<00:02:27.620> I<00:02:28.660> found
