00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
is the only one I happen to have so I

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.590 
is the only one I happen to have so I
use<00:01:32.010> this<00:01:32.280> side<00:01:32.580> the<00:01:32.880> reason<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.300> do<00:01:33.420> this<00:01:33.450> is

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
because then you get out of the shower

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.950 
because then you get out of the shower
and<00:01:35.430> your<00:01:35.640> hair<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:35.880> soaking<00:01:36.360> wet<00:01:36.390> your<00:01:36.720> hair

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
is in the cell a sticky stage and since

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.850 
is in the cell a sticky stage and since
it's<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.600> cell<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.990> sticky<00:01:40.290> stage<00:01:40.500> it

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
it's in the cell a sticky stage it

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.160 
it's in the cell a sticky stage it
basically<00:01:41.490> can<00:01:41.850> like<00:01:42.030> stretch<00:01:42.420> really<00:01:42.750> far

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
basically can like stretch really far

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.170 
basically can like stretch really far
and<00:01:43.560> when<00:01:43.950> it's<00:01:44.100> pulled<00:01:44.340> too<00:01:44.490> hard<00:01:44.520> its<00:01:44.910> rips

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
and when it's pulled too hard its rips

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.090 
and when it's pulled too hard its rips
and<00:01:45.480> it<00:01:45.810> snaps<00:01:46.050> back<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.650> that's<00:01:46.800> what<00:01:46.950> makes

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
and it snaps back and that's what makes

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.770 
and it snaps back and that's what makes
split<00:01:47.370> ends<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:47.910> when<00:01:48.060> you're<00:01:48.150> using<00:01:48.330> a<00:01:48.479> comb

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
it is a lot more easy and it doesn't

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.219 
it is a lot more easy and it doesn't
actually<00:01:50.670> stretch<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.300> far<00:01:51.570> as<00:01:51.810> opposed<00:01:52.140> to

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
actually stretch that far as opposed to

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.080 
actually stretch that far as opposed to
using<00:01:52.410> a<00:01:52.650> brush<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.340> if<00:01:53.550> you<00:01:53.700> would<00:01:53.790> like<00:01:53.940> to

what I do before I take a shower is I

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.760 
what I do before I take a shower is I

and and I throw my hair in a braid and
they<00:03:13.110> let<00:03:13.290> it<00:03:13.380> sit<00:03:13.590> for<00:03:13.620> about<00:03:13.860> ten<00:03:14.190> minutes<00:03:14.370> I

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
they let it sit for about ten minutes I

they let it sit for about ten minutes I
know<00:03:14.730> you're<00:03:14.970> thinking<00:03:15.180> why<00:03:15.480> do<00:03:15.540> you<00:03:15.690> do<00:03:15.840> that

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
know you're thinking why do you do that

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.210 
know you're thinking why do you do that
let's<00:03:16.260> see<00:03:16.350> that's<00:03:16.530> pointless<00:03:16.860> if<00:03:17.100> you're

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
let's see that's pointless if you're

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.920 
let's see that's pointless if you're
just<00:03:17.340> gonna<00:03:17.490> wash<00:03:17.670> it<00:03:17.880> out<00:03:18.000> but<00:03:18.330> I<00:03:18.390> honestly<00:03:18.510> do

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
just gonna wash it out but I honestly do

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.570 
just gonna wash it out but I honestly do
notice<00:03:19.140> a<00:03:19.230> difference<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:19.890> really<00:03:20.010> makes<00:03:20.430> my

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
notice a difference it really makes my

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.850 
notice a difference it really makes my
ends<00:03:21.000> look<00:03:21.420> a<00:03:21.600> lot<00:03:21.810> healthier<00:03:22.080> because<00:03:22.470> trust

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
ends look a lot healthier because trust

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.100 
ends look a lot healthier because trust
me<00:03:22.950> if<00:03:23.280> I<00:03:23.430> didn't<00:03:23.790> put<00:03:23.940> that<00:03:23.970> in<00:03:24.120> my<00:03:24.750> hair<00:03:24.960> would

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
me if I didn't put that in my hair would

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.200 
me if I didn't put that in my hair would
go<00:03:25.260> poof<00:03:25.590> so<00:03:26.070> I<00:03:26.100> find<00:03:26.490> that<00:03:26.550> a<00:03:26.640> big<00:03:26.790> silica<00:03:27.090> law

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
go poof so I find that a big silica law

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.620 
go poof so I find that a big silica law
healthier<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:28.020> I<00:03:28.410> do<00:03:28.980> like<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.610> look<00:03:30.000> of<00:03:30.240> that

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
healthier and I do like the look of that

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.270 
healthier and I do like the look of that
other<00:03:30.930> things<00:03:31.260> that<00:03:31.350> I<00:03:31.440> do<00:03:31.530> to<00:03:31.650> my<00:03:31.830> hair<00:03:31.860> that

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
other things that I do to my hair that

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.250 
other things that I do to my hair that
are<00:03:32.310> really<00:03:32.760> weird<00:03:32.910> um<00:03:33.270> I<00:03:33.570> only<00:03:33.720> do<00:03:33.930> this<00:03:34.020> once

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
are really weird um I only do this once

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.560 
are really weird um I only do this once
in<00:03:34.380> a<00:03:34.440> while<00:03:34.560> but<00:03:34.950> sometimes<00:03:35.670> I<00:03:36.030> will<00:03:36.210> take<00:03:36.390> an

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
in a while but sometimes I will take an

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.480 
in a while but sometimes I will take an
egg<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:37.230> I<00:03:37.470> separate<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.070> white<00:03:38.220> from<00:03:38.250> the

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
egg and I separate the white from the

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.090 
egg and I separate the white from the
yolk<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.330> put<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.810> white<00:03:40.020> in<00:03:40.320> my<00:03:40.590> scalp<00:03:40.920> and

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
yolk and I put the white in my scalp and

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.280 
yolk and I put the white in my scalp and
the<00:03:41.370> yolk<00:03:41.580> on<00:03:41.820> the<00:03:42.120> ends<00:03:42.510> I<00:03:42.690> know<00:03:42.810> that's

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
the yolk on the ends I know that's

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.560 
the yolk on the ends I know that's
disgusting<00:03:44.220> that's<00:03:44.250> so<00:03:44.820> weird

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
disgusting that's so weird

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.980 
disgusting that's so weird
but<00:03:46.230> it<00:03:46.650> makes<00:03:47.010> your<00:03:47.250> hair<00:03:47.490> so<00:03:48.090> much<00:03:48.420> softer

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
but it makes your hair so much softer

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.990 
but it makes your hair so much softer
and<00:03:49.020> so<00:03:49.410> much<00:03:49.650> shinier<00:03:50.070> like<00:03:50.280> I<00:03:50.400> couldn't<00:03:50.790> make

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
and so much shinier like I couldn't make

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000 
and so much shinier like I couldn't make
this<00:03:51.300> up<00:03:51.570> I've<00:03:51.870> only<00:03:52.080> done<00:03:52.260> it<00:03:52.410> a<00:03:52.470> few<00:03:52.650> times<00:03:52.800> in

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
this up I've only done it a few times in

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.220 
this up I've only done it a few times in
the<00:03:53.100> past<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:53.790> it's<00:03:54.300> really<00:03:54.690> gross<00:03:54.960> I'll

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
the past and it's really gross I'll

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.630 
the past and it's really gross I'll
admit<00:03:55.560> that<00:03:55.590> and<00:03:56.010> your<00:03:56.100> hair<00:03:56.250> feels<00:03:56.490> like

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
admit that and your hair feels like

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.820 
admit that and your hair feels like
really<00:03:56.820> hard<00:03:57.210> once<00:03:57.540> you<00:03:57.630> take<00:03:57.810> it<00:03:57.930> out<00:03:58.020> but

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
really hard once you take it out but

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.010 
really hard once you take it out but
basically<00:03:59.340> you<00:03:59.910> just<00:04:00.270> separate<00:04:00.660> it<00:04:00.720> like<00:04:00.930> I

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
basically you just separate it like I

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.170 
basically you just separate it like I
said<00:04:01.080> and<00:04:01.680> you<00:04:01.950> put<00:04:02.220> it<00:04:02.310> in<00:04:02.430> your<00:04:02.580> hair<00:04:02.790> leave

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
said and you put it in your hair leave

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.390 
said and you put it in your hair leave
it<00:04:03.300> in<00:04:03.390> for<00:04:03.540> about<00:04:03.750> 20-30<00:04:04.230> minutes<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:04.830> put

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
it in for about 20-30 minutes and put

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.910

your<00:04:05.550> hair<00:04:05.730> in<00:04:06.060> a<00:04:06.180> plastic<00:04:06.750> bag<00:04:06.990> while<00:04:07.590> you're

also<00:04:37.050> I<00:04:37.260> know<00:04:37.410> this<00:04:37.560> sounds<00:04:37.890> weird<00:04:37.950> but<00:04:38.340> if<00:04:38.520> you

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
also I know this sounds weird but if you

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.400 
also I know this sounds weird but if you
tip<00:04:39.000> upside<00:04:39.570> down<00:04:39.810> like<00:04:40.140> if<00:04:40.230> you're<00:04:40.380> just

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
tip upside down like if you're just

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.050 
tip upside down like if you're just
laying<00:04:40.800> on<00:04:40.920> your<00:04:41.100> better<00:04:41.280> couch<00:04:41.580> sure<00:04:41.910> about

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
laying on your better couch sure about

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.060 
laying on your better couch sure about
like<00:04:42.300> two<00:04:42.630> minutes<00:04:42.930> or<00:04:43.230> so<00:04:43.440> it<00:04:43.680> basically

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
like two minutes or so it basically

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.880 
like two minutes or so it basically
changes<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.640> blood<00:04:44.910> stream<00:04:45.240> so<00:04:45.930> that<00:04:46.500> your

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
changes the blood stream so that your

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.400 
changes the blood stream so that your
blood<00:04:47.130> is<00:04:47.190> like<00:04:47.520> pushing<00:04:47.760> down<00:04:48.270> on<00:04:48.690> your<00:04:48.870> roots

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
blood is like pushing down on your roots

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.960 
blood is like pushing down on your roots
saying<00:04:49.710> this<00:04:49.800> out<00:04:49.950> loud<00:04:50.010> sounds<00:04:50.370> really<00:04:50.790> weird

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
saying this out loud sounds really weird

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:51.810 
saying this out loud sounds really weird
and

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
and

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.100 
and
I'm<00:04:51.880> actually<00:04:52.030> not<00:04:52.300> sure<00:04:52.360> if<00:04:52.660> it<00:04:52.750> has<00:04:52.930> that

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
I'm actually not sure if it has that

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.140 
I'm actually not sure if it has that
much<00:04:53.290> of<00:04:53.440> an<00:04:53.560> infection<00:04:54.160> but<00:04:54.340> I<00:04:54.610> seem<00:04:54.970> to<00:04:55.000> think

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
much of an infection but I seem to think

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.540 
much of an infection but I seem to think
it<00:04:55.420> works<00:04:55.630> so<00:04:56.350> I'm<00:04:56.770> not<00:04:56.890> really<00:04:57.070> sure<00:04:57.220> if

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
it works so I'm not really sure if

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.920 
it works so I'm not really sure if
you've<00:04:57.760> ever<00:04:57.940> heard<00:04:58.210> that<00:04:58.420> trimming<00:04:58.840> your

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.960 
you've ever heard that trimming your
hair<00:04:59.020> makes<00:04:59.380> a<00:04:59.470> girl<00:04:59.620> faster<00:05:00.160> that<00:05:00.580> is<00:05:00.760> not

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
hair makes a girl faster that is not

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.090 
hair makes a girl faster that is not
true<00:05:01.360> only<00:05:01.930> trimming<00:05:02.290> the<00:05:02.410> dead<00:05:02.620> part<00:05:02.890> at<00:05:03.010> the

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
true only trimming the dead part at the

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.250 
true only trimming the dead part at the
bottom<00:05:03.220> that<00:05:03.670> does<00:05:03.880> not<00:05:04.060> affect<00:05:04.390> how<00:05:04.660> fast<00:05:04.960> it

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
bottom that does not affect how fast it

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.560 
bottom that does not affect how fast it
grows<00:05:05.410> from<00:05:05.770> the<00:05:05.950> roots<00:05:06.190> however<00:05:06.850> it<00:05:07.180> can<00:05:07.390> make

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
grows from the roots however it can make

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.210 
grows from the roots however it can make
it<00:05:07.690> look<00:05:07.810> healthier<00:05:08.230> if<00:05:08.410> you<00:05:08.560> do<00:05:08.740> get<00:05:08.890> regular

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
it look healthier if you do get regular

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.300 
it look healthier if you do get regular
trims<00:05:09.450> because<00:05:10.450> it<00:05:11.020> gets<00:05:11.470> rid<00:05:11.650> of<00:05:11.710> split<00:05:11.980> ends

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
trims because it gets rid of split ends

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.530 
trims because it gets rid of split ends
and<00:05:12.460> it<00:05:12.640> prevents<00:05:13.030> it<00:05:13.120> from<00:05:13.270> splitting

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:13.540 
and it prevents it from splitting

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.210 
and it prevents it from splitting
upwards<00:05:14.110> which<00:05:14.440> actually<00:05:14.890> makes<00:05:15.040> it<00:05:15.190> look

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
upwards which actually makes it look

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.540 
upwards which actually makes it look

part<00:05:40.270> which<00:05:40.360> I'm<00:05:40.480> not<00:05:40.570> gonna<00:05:40.720> do<00:05:40.900> right<00:05:41.050> now

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
part which I'm not gonna do right now

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.990 
part which I'm not gonna do right now
and<00:05:41.470> I<00:05:41.920> just<00:05:42.250> tied<00:05:42.400> it<00:05:42.520> in<00:05:42.580> the<00:05:42.640> back<00:05:42.790> with<00:05:42.970> a

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
and I just tied it in the back with a

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.030 
and I just tied it in the back with a
low<00:05:43.180> ponytail<00:05:43.540> and<00:05:44.050> then<00:05:44.200> since<00:05:44.530> my<00:05:44.710> hair<00:05:44.920> is

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:45.040 
low ponytail and then since my hair is

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.430 
low ponytail and then since my hair is
very<00:05:45.070> long<00:05:45.490> I<00:05:45.970> put<00:05:46.240> three<00:05:46.540> more<00:05:46.570> elastics<00:05:47.260> down

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
very long I put three more elastics down

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.110 
very long I put three more elastics down
towards<00:05:47.950> the<00:05:48.100> bottom<00:05:48.250> so<00:05:48.670> let's<00:05:48.700> see<00:05:49.000> it's

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
towards the bottom so let's see it's

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.940 
towards the bottom so let's see it's
straight<00:05:49.420> and<00:05:49.630> that<00:05:50.020> seems<00:05:50.290> to<00:05:50.380> work<00:05:50.500> for<00:05:50.740> me<00:05:50.860> I

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:50.950 
straight and that seems to work for me I

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:51.930 
straight and that seems to work for me I
think<00:05:51.010> that's<00:05:51.250> all<00:05:51.370> the<00:05:51.460> tips<00:05:51.640> I<00:05:51.730> have<00:05:51.880> for

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940
