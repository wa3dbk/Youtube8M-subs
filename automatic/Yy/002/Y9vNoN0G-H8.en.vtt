I acted completely different from my
brother<00:02:48.700> because<00:02:49.210> I<00:02:50.280> was<00:02:51.280> lazy<00:02:52.060> from<00:02:52.510> was<00:02:52.660> more

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
brother because I was lazy from was more

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.010

quiet<00:02:53.020> I<00:02:53.320> was<00:02:53.560> much<00:02:54.400> more<00:02:54.430> angry<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:55.660> a<00:02:55.870> lot

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
quiet I was much more angry and a lot

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.410 
quiet I was much more angry and a lot
teachers<00:02:56.380> didn't<00:02:56.620> understand<00:02:57.100> how<00:02:57.430> I<00:02:57.790> was

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
teachers didn't understand how I was

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.030 
teachers didn't understand how I was
reacting<00:02:58.810> differently<00:02:59.140> to<00:02:59.560> even<00:02:59.920> they

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
reacting differently to even they

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.730 
reacting differently to even they
thought<00:03:00.250> it<00:03:00.460> was<00:03:00.580> just<00:03:00.880> a<00:03:01.500> behavior<00:03:02.500> thing

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
thought it was just a behavior thing

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.480 
thought it was just a behavior thing
rather<00:03:02.980> than<00:03:03.160> a<00:03:03.600> reaction<00:03:04.600> to<00:03:04.750> bereavement

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
rather than a reaction to bereavement

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.740 
rather than a reaction to bereavement
for<00:03:06.490> the<00:03:06.550> time<00:03:06.760> being<00:03:07.000> I<00:03:07.120> was<00:03:07.210> okay<00:03:07.570> because

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
for the time being I was okay because

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.940 
for the time being I was okay because
well<00:03:08.650> I<00:03:08.680> say<00:03:08.890> okay<00:03:09.280> I<00:03:09.690> suppose<00:03:10.690> I<00:03:11.020> was<00:03:11.200> still<00:03:11.500> in

well I say okay I suppose I was still in

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.230 
well I say okay I suppose I was still in
kind<00:03:12.700> of<00:03:12.820> a<00:03:12.880> numb<00:03:13.150> State<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.440> so<00:03:15.250> I<00:03:15.580> didn't

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
kind of a numb State and so I didn't

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.470 
kind of a numb State and so I didn't
really<00:03:16.750> know<00:03:17.490> what<00:03:18.490> to<00:03:18.520> do<00:03:18.850> or<00:03:19.060> really<00:03:19.270> how<00:03:19.420> to

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
me I wanted to be nice to her back I was

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.030 
me I wanted to be nice to her back I was
just<00:03:51.880> expected<00:03:52.390> to<00:03:53.310> buckle<00:03:54.310> up<00:03:54.400> and<00:03:56.010> kind<00:03:57.010> of

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
just expected to buckle up and kind of

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:04.960 
just expected to buckle up and kind of
gone<00:03:57.430> with<00:03:57.610> it

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.580 

I<00:04:06.430> think<00:04:07.430> loads<00:04:07.700> of<00:04:07.850> teachers<00:04:08.390> have<00:04:09.080> a<00:04:09.140> certain

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
I think loads of teachers have a certain

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.550 
I think loads of teachers have a certain
time<00:04:09.830> period<00:04:10.130> set<00:04:10.700> in<00:04:10.940> their<00:04:11.270> mind<00:04:11.540> and<00:04:12.320> if

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
time period set in their mind and if

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.490 
time period set in their mind and if
you're<00:04:12.710> not<00:04:12.890> okay<00:04:13.220> by<00:04:13.460> that<00:04:13.730> time<00:04:14.000> period<00:04:14.500> then

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
you're not okay by that time period then

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.949 
you're not okay by that time period then
you're<00:04:16.190> abusing<00:04:16.579> it<00:04:16.790> and<00:04:16.940> that<00:04:17.060> is<00:04:17.180> it<00:04:17.359> you<00:04:17.690> get

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
you're abusing it and that is it you get

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.870 
you're abusing it and that is it you get
the<00:04:18.109> feeling<00:04:18.320> that<00:04:18.500> teachers<00:04:19.100> think<00:04:19.400> that

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
the feeling that teachers think that

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.240 
the feeling that teachers think that
when<00:04:20.150> you're<00:04:20.299> breathed<00:04:20.620> it's<00:04:21.620> the<00:04:21.739> same<00:04:21.980> for

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
when you're breathed it's the same for

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.860 
when you're breathed it's the same for
everyone<00:04:22.610> they<00:04:23.570> didn't<00:04:23.900> really<00:04:24.170> realize<00:04:24.740> the

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
everyone they didn't really realize the

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.360 
everyone they didn't really realize the
different<00:04:26.870> things<00:04:27.620> that<00:04:27.860> happen<00:04:28.220> in<00:04:28.310> the

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
different things that happen in the

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.680 
different things that happen in the
