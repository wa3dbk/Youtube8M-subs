00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.930 
you have the volume which is on top like
so<00:02:56.940> give<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.150> base<00:02:58.329> on<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.810> side<00:02:59.579> can<00:03:00.579> scroll

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
so give the base on the side can scroll

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.800 
so give the base on the side can scroll
it<00:03:01.090> up<00:03:01.239> down<00:03:01.720> auxilary<00:03:02.590> port<00:03:03.239> headphone<00:03:04.239> jack

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
it up down auxilary port headphone jack

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.160 
it up down auxilary port headphone jack
and<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:06.670> on<00:03:06.819> and<00:03:07.060> off<00:03:07.120> switches<00:03:07.510> here<00:03:07.930> on<00:03:08.049> the

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
and the on and off switches here on the

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.440 
and the on and off switches here on the
side<00:03:08.380> right<00:03:09.100> so<00:03:09.370> here<00:03:09.579> are<00:03:09.639> the<00:03:09.760> two<00:03:09.940> satellite

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450
