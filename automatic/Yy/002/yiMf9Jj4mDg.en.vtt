00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.059
 We will teach you how to navigate and look at 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.059
 your around then you will have to perform 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.980
 your first takeoff and landing now 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.890
 same on the screen you can see the panel 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.080
 angular all the instructions of this 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.500
 tutorial are recorded on the page 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.530
 messages on the page instructions are 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.660
 indicate the mission instructions 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.430
 to close the angular panel click 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.270
 in the X located on the corner 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.170
 top right to reopen it 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.380
 press uppercase 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.620
 efe 10 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.520
 you are sitting in an ultralight airways 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.740
 a trade 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.600
 at the end of track 15 of the base 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.480
 the edwards air forces in 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.810
 california this is one of the most tracks 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:57.840
 long of the world in fact sometimes the 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:00.930
 space at all uses it to land 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.129
 during the missions use the compass 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.770
 and the mission pointer to navigate 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.009
 see that indicator from the top corner 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.439
 left of the screen is the compass 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.479
 of the mission the small triangle 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.399
 located outside the heading indicator 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.490
 rotating points the objective 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:21.860
 selected or the object of interest 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.869
 the text below the indicator will 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.119
 informs of the name of the objective its 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.800
 altitude above sea level and 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:32.650
 the distance to which he is from him 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.280
 of that big indicator that has front 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.470
 to you is the pointer of the mission 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.350
 points out the objects or objects of 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.080
 interest 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.080
 in some visions there will be more than one 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.000
 objective or object of interest for 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.710
 change the object pointed to by 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.100
 compass and the mission pointer 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.780
 press the k key to hide the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.159
 compass and the mission pointer 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.159
 press the key 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.850
 to look around move the 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.490
 push button on top of the 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.950
 joystick or hold down the 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.560
 spacebar and then move the mouse 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.200
 Now look at both sides of the aircraft 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.349
 to practice you can also try the 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.640
 different views with the keys f 9 f 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:23.860
 10 f 11 yf 12 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.050
 when I finish testing the views 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.080
 press one to move on to the next 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.650
 phase of this tutorial 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.060
 now release the parking brake 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.180
 use the joystick trigger button 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.060
 or press the point key 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.129
 in flight simulator the aircraft can be 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.739
 control a joystick with a joystick 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.870
 universal the mouse or the keys 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:50.560
 keyboard arrow 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.049
 Ready to take off, move gently 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.870
 the accelerator to the maximum if you do not have 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:03:00.319
 joystick presses the key f 4 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.459
 Take off is easy when you go to 30 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.680
 miles per hour 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.870
 I pulled gently from logistics towards you 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.180
 so that the aircraft takes off from the 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.520
 track 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.560
 it has a bit of the lever 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.450
 congratulations are flying back to 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.490
 place the joystick in its place with 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.800
 softness and doing a little to 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.730
 go through the first door that has 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.730
 in front of you 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.689
 fantastic now doing a little more and 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.689
 go through the second door 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.750
 now reduce the acceleration a bit and 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.430
 slow down the next 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.070
 door is a little lower than the 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.550
 last and after crossing it will have 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.550
 to land 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:38.650
 or work now reduce the 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.539
 acceleration completely and use the 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.050
 lever to adjust the speed of 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:43.050
 decline 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:56.749
 I pulled slightly on the lever and level 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:59.169
 the plane tried to float on the runway 

00:04:56.749 --> 00:05:02.110
 The most time possible 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.539
 now slow down use the shutter button 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:08.569
 of the joystick or press the 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:11.740
 point stop completely 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:16.650
 good landing 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.650
 press escape to complete the mission
