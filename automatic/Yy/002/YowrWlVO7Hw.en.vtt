00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 Hello everyone and welcome to this one 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.680
 second part of the guide to the use of 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.870
 mac for beginners then the other 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.460
 time we have seen some things ad 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.089
 example the doc the bar of the 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.800
 applications like change answer and how 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.000
 maybe put and remove applications 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.670
 by dr 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.880
 and also internet connection e 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.910
 others say functions of our mac 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.550
 now instead I want to take a moment 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.619
 step forward and show you some things 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.790
 that are not immediate, even those who do not 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.380
 he knows mac has n't always known them 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.329
 I want to talk to you about the gestures that 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.110
 they are movements that you do with your fingers 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.730
 or on ipabs we know macbook pro 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.320
 or on a mouse if you have an imac 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.829
 then the first thing we have to do 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.899
 learning about mac is that when we go 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.300
 partly different applications 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.760
 now he has just a couple to do 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.590
 review to move from 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.320
 an application to the other is not like on 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.880
 windows we have the bar at the bottom and where 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.510
 we have to go and press to change 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.390
 screen will be enough to do or f 3 if 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.150
 you have just one of the latest keyboards 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.250
 and we will have as you see the mission control 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.200
 let's say an application that demonstrates 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.549
 which applications are open for which 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.960
 allows f3 on the keyboard 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.860
 we can go to change screens 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.150
 how you want to see by pressing 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.920
 on the application we want 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.509
 view this in the foreground 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.490
 function can also be used 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.320
 via gesture for which instead of 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.060
 press the button on the keyboard 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.350
 we can go and use three fingers 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.259
 on the pad 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.270
 in case we have the pad and go for it 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.020
 a swipe upwards or move us 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.750
 upwards and as you can see we have 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.460
 precisely the mission control and returning to 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:56.219
 down we wo n't close up up down is a lot 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.969
 simple there is nothing to nothing from 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.770
 remember then we know a mouse instead is 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.469
 different because up and down with three 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.810
 fingers on the mouse is not so simple enough 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.209
 press twice with two double fingers 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.820
 tap so click click using two 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:16.280
 fingers and we will have the same effect 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.720
 same thing then if we want to go to 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.740
 see the notifications found in the 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.750
 notification center which is on the right 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.210
 just go with three fingers a 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.280
 they launch swipe from the side where there is no 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:32.330
 pad there is precisely from the aluminum of the 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.670
 imac to the center of the pan and then 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.380
 release as you see we would have opened the 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.760
 notification center to close the same 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.690
 thing 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.550
 as you can see also to move us 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.310
 from one desk to another of ours 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.100
 mac we can always do with three fingers 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.650
 one swipe on the right and one swipe a 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.790
 left then what are the 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.920
 desks 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.090
 now I'll explain why we say one 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.310
 important part of your mac we do 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.770
 swipe it with three fingers or double tap 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.560
 with two fingers on the mouse and we will have no 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.410
 check up here you can see three 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.420
 dashboard screens desk 1 and then 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.320
 you here will have nothing unless you 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.390
 you have set up a second desk 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.450
 imac let's say more powerful than gods 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.840
 in recent years they allow this 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.580
 function and we say because I say then gods 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.650
 recent years can actually use from 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.019
 all the macs, however, those of the last 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.150
 years are powerful enough to be able to 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:35.870
 take advantage of this thing while those 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.489
 a little more obsolete year do a little more 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.010
 of fatigue however all the mac 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.620
 may have more than one desk 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.900
 just go all right with with the 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.570
 arrow until this comes out 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.890
 screen with the most here we press and 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.769
 as you can see there will be another one added 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.320
 desk to close it and on people 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.600
 touch it and eventually go to the 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.549
 leaks having two desks can be 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.810
 useful because here we have already opened 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.769
 application we have the whole screen 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.390
 busy 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:05.330
 if we want to go the other side do 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.209
 something just do with three fingers on the pad 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.850
 one swipe to the right and we will have the other 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.290
 desk but if we have the mouse to 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.910
 going from one desk to another is 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.790
 one swipe with two fingers is sufficient 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.470
 on one side and with two fingers on the other 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.880
 here and there 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.850
 let's proceed and see the 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.560
 dashboards 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.970
 when we went on mission control 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.580
 and we went to see all the 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.680
 open applications the dashboard was 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.190
 this page we can access here 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.570
 pressing c above or making it swipe 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.730
 to the right to the left between 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.620
 desks going to the left we will go 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.510
 precisely the right hand dashboard 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.830
 we will sell another desk and the 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.630
 left we will return to the main one 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:48.150
 therefore the dashboard is on the left and 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.370
 on the keyboards of the macs prior to 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.130
 2011 so those who come up 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.960
 at the end the eight 2010 of mistake 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.590
 those produced in the last part of the 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.930
 2010 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.850
 if you press f4 on the keyboard if 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.650
 will come to the dashboard 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.810
 if we do it instead on the new ones 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.760
 shores for example not of which we will go to 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.850
 lance pad we saw in the 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.920
 previous episode and the area from which 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.570
 we can go and open all the 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.660
 applications that are in the folder 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.860
 applications of our of our mac 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.480
 let's go a little talk about this 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.280
 dashboard so we saw how there 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.280
 is accessed if we have a computer in the 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.950
 2010 or lower we do at 34 on 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.230
 keyboard or do mission control 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.270
 and we are above or we do 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.780
 swipe to the left from where we are 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.610
 so until we get there then this is it 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.830
 a section essentially in which 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.620
 we find the widget ie we say gods 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.900
 small programs that run and there 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.460
 allow you to go and pin things down 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.680
 do quick calculations 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.290
 maybe see the weather and so on are 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.730
 Many widgets available online 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.980
 so we can go and download it 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.690
 new is not that we are limited 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.850
 to those who are already present in the 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.040
 our computer but we can indeed 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:01.800
 explaining new ones to add them will be 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.790
 just click on more and 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.490
 select the ones that interest us 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:08.790
 how we find the search for flights 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:13.140
 the dictionary the calendar la 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:17.160
 calculator i post it or notes e 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:20.340
 the translation is also the converter of 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.139
 currency and so on these are those 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.930
 I use more 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:27.030
 to go and set for example the 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:30.689
 your city ​​on the weather will be enough 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:32.490
 press on i and enter the name of the 

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:34.319
 your city and a list will disappear 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.909
 would select the right thing also 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:38.219
 on the watch it is possible to have more than 

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:38.610
 one in case we are interested in the time zones 

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:41.639
 timetables 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.560
 just click on and select the 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:46.139
 region and the city from which we want 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.759
 have it was 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:49.590
 so let's see this widget 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:51.990
 you won't already have this widget 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.819
 installed I downloaded it and it is 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:56.789
 simply a widget that makes a 

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:58.560
 continuous countdown from to 

00:06:56.789 --> 00:07:00.360
 day we set I have 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.340
 set on the day of fia in the 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.710
 school and how rimini that is missing 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:07.889
 fourteen days 21 and 7 minutes and 26 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:09.689
 really precise seconds of positi 

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:12.419
 we can have as long as we want 

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:14.759
 do more for and goods over and here is that 

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:16.529
 we would have it here to modify it enough for 

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:19.589
 goods over write what we want 

00:07:16.529 --> 00:07:22.349
 and so on as you see this and the ananas 

00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:25.110
 ward is very useful in my opinion is a 

00:07:22.349 --> 00:07:28.349
 time you really get used to it a lot 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:30.870
 Functional video for today's good guys 

00:07:28.349 --> 00:07:34.199
 is over here we have seen few things 

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:35.520
 however we say that it is better to practice 

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:37.830
 first on these before continuing 

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.539
 because the things we will see later are a 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.669
 they are more advanced than these 

00:07:39.539 --> 00:07:43.469
 and we say without mind to use a mac 

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:44.580
 these are the main things are the 

00:07:43.469 --> 00:07:45.569
 things that set it apart from others 

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.770
 operating systems 

00:07:45.569 --> 00:07:48.629
 the possibility of having all these 

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:51.210
 shortcuts to go on these pages 

00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:54.689
 and you will have all these different 

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:56.669
 possibility then you try 

00:07:54.689 --> 00:07:58.409
 play the video if not 

00:07:56.669 --> 00:07:59.729
 you read more often if you have 

00:07:58.409 --> 00:08:02.279
 doubts about the questions and comments 

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:05.599
 I will try to help you and not see you at 

00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:05.599
 next video hello everyone
