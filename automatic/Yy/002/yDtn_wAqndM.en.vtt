after<00:02:45.160> a<00:02:45.190> Burin<00:02:45.790> on<00:02:45.940> just<00:02:46.150> get<00:02:46.300> an<00:02:46.390> idea

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
after a Burin on just get an idea

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.890 
after a Burin on just get an idea
looking<00:02:47.530> pretty<00:02:47.770> good<00:02:48.330> it's<00:02:49.330> just<00:02:49.450> pretty

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
looking pretty good it's just pretty

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.980 
looking pretty good it's just pretty
easy<00:02:50.200> just<00:02:50.980> take<00:02:51.220> painters<00:02:52.030> tape<00:02:52.270> take<00:02:52.960> a

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
razor blade just edge around it and peel

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.170 
razor blade just edge around it and peel
away<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.110> tape<00:02:56.260> it<00:02:57.070> leaves<00:02:57.310> a<00:02:57.460> nice<00:02:57.700> finished

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
away the tape it leaves a nice finished

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.740 
away the tape it leaves a nice finished
line<00:02:58.720> and<00:02:59.050> does<00:02:59.890> a<00:03:00.000> sharp<00:03:01.000> jump<00:03:01.240> we'll<00:03:01.420> get<00:03:01.600> the

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
line and does a sharp jump we'll get the

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.320 
line and does a sharp jump we'll get the
tires<00:03:01.990> mounted<00:03:02.230> on<00:03:02.440> tomorrow<00:03:03.030> looks<00:03:04.030> pretty

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
tires mounted on tomorrow looks pretty

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.590 
tires mounted on tomorrow looks pretty
good<00:03:05.010> now<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.070> prevent<00:03:06.580> paint<00:03:06.970> from<00:03:07.240> getting

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
good now to prevent paint from getting

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.210 
good now to prevent paint from getting
on<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.020> back<00:03:08.230> of<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:08.500> rim<00:03:08.680> cut<00:03:09.010> a<00:03:09.040> little

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
on the back of the rim cut a little

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.570 
on the back of the rim cut a little
biker<00:03:09.490> board<00:03:09.910> for<00:03:10.240> it<00:03:10.330> so<00:03:10.900> when<00:03:11.050> you<00:03:11.170> sprint

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
biker board for it so when you sprint

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.730 
biker board for it so when you sprint
paint<00:03:12.580> doesn't<00:03:13.210> transfer<00:03:13.750> over<00:03:14.290> to<00:03:14.530> the

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
paint doesn't transfer over to the

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.310 
paint doesn't transfer over to the
inside<00:03:15.040> of<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.130> rim<00:03:15.370> does<00:03:15.970> a<00:03:16.110> fairly<00:03:17.110> decent

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
inside of the rim does a fairly decent

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.750 
inside of the rim does a fairly decent
job<00:03:19.200> all<00:03:20.200> right<00:03:20.350> when<00:03:20.530> you're<00:03:20.650> spraying<00:03:21.010> make

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
job all right when you're spraying make

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.620 
job all right when you're spraying make
sure<00:03:22.000> you<00:03:22.330> spray<00:03:23.200> down<00:03:23.380> in<00:03:23.739> each<00:03:23.980> of<00:03:24.160> the<00:03:24.310> holes

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
sure you spray down in each of the holes

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.960 
sure you spray down in each of the holes
so<00:03:25.630> when<00:03:25.959> it<00:03:26.080> dries<00:03:26.410> you<00:03:26.800> don't<00:03:27.280> have<00:03:27.580> the

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
so when it dries you don't have the

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.050 
so when it dries you don't have the
silver<00:03:28.390> fading<00:03:28.810> through<00:03:29.100> that<00:03:30.100> way<00:03:30.400> it's

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
silver fading through that way it's

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.110 
silver fading through that way it's
