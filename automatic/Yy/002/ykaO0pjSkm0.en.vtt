00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.590 
ranges yet what you perceive like the
correct<00:01:44.220> stack<00:01:44.460> off<00:01:44.700> range<00:01:44.970> on<00:01:45.180> your<00:01:45.329> part<00:01:45.570> to

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
correct stack off range on your part to

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.749 
correct stack off range on your part to
be<00:01:45.840> it's<00:01:46.229> still<00:01:46.439> relatively<00:01:46.770> tight<00:01:47.159> because

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
be it's still relatively tight because

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.130 
be it's still relatively tight because
if<00:01:47.850> that's<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.149> case<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.570> means<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:49.020> your

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
if that's the case that means that your

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.600 
if that's the case that means that your
opponent<00:01:49.530> isn't<00:01:49.649> really<00:01:49.920> for<00:01:50.130> bat<00:01:50.280> bluffing

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
opponent isn't really for bat bluffing

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.950 
opponent isn't really for bat bluffing
you<00:01:50.700> enough<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.570> could<00:01:51.659> take<00:01:51.840> advantage

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
you enough so you could take advantage

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.810 
you enough so you could take advantage
in<00:01:52.320> those<00:01:52.439> situations<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.220> just<00:01:53.310> like<00:01:53.549> three

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
in those situations and just like three

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.700 
in those situations and just like three
that<00:01:53.970> Bluff<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.299> lot<00:01:54.479> knowing<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.470> your

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
that Bluff a lot knowing that your

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.710 
that Bluff a lot knowing that your
opponent<00:01:56.100> can't<00:01:56.130> really<00:01:56.579> format

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
opponent can't really format

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.110 
opponent can't really format
so<00:01:58.200> they're<00:01:58.530> more<00:01:58.650> stock<00:01:58.980> for<00:01:59.520> betting<00:01:59.700> all-in

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
so they're more stock for betting all-in

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.760 
so they're more stock for betting all-in
so<00:02:00.480> if<00:02:00.690> you<00:02:00.810> could<00:02:00.960> kind<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.230> find<00:02:01.440> fighters

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
so if you could kind of find fighters

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.110 
so if you could kind of find fighters
who<00:02:01.860> aren't<00:02:02.070> willing<00:02:02.220> to<00:02:02.370> for<00:02:02.580> bet<00:02:02.760> all<00:02:02.940> in

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
who aren't willing to for bet all in

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.910 
who aren't willing to for bet all in
without<00:02:03.690> a<00:02:03.870> strong<00:02:04.170> hand<00:02:04.440> but<00:02:04.650> they're<00:02:04.770> still

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
without a strong hand but they're still

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.860 
without a strong hand but they're still
opening<00:02:05.250> wide<00:02:05.430> ranges<00:02:05.880> you're<00:02:06.510> really<00:02:06.750> able

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
opening wide ranges you're really able

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.690 
opening wide ranges you're really able
to<00:02:07.050> like<00:02:07.230> take<00:02:07.500> advantage<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.130> this

have to take ICM into account because

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
and not only do you lose the chips but

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.420 
and not only do you lose the chips but
you<00:02:33.720> also<00:02:33.870> don't<00:02:34.080> cash<00:02:34.350> so<00:02:34.830> you<00:02:34.860> lose<00:02:35.100> that<00:02:35.280> I'm

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
you also don't cash so you lose that I'm

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.510 
you also don't cash so you lose that I'm
like<00:02:35.640> I'm<00:02:36.600> that<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.320> I<00:02:37.590> mean<00:02:37.950> generally<00:02:38.400> with

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
like I'm that so I mean generally with

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.280 
like I'm that so I mean generally with
ICM<00:02:38.940> it<00:02:39.180> allows<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.540> big<00:02:39.690> stacks<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:40.080> kind<00:02:40.260> of

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
ICM it allows the big stacks to kind of

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.530 
ICM it allows the big stacks to kind of
take<00:02:40.470> advantage<00:02:40.590> because<00:02:41.300> even<00:02:42.300> if<00:02:42.390> this

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
take advantage because even if this

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.000 
take advantage because even if this
because<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.230> pretty<00:02:43.440> much<00:02:43.590> if<00:02:43.710> the<00:02:43.800> small

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
because it pretty much if the small

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.350 
because it pretty much if the small
stacks<00:02:44.250> are<00:02:44.400> playing<00:02:44.610> correct<00:02:44.910> they<00:02:45.060> have<00:02:45.240> to

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
stacks are playing correct they have to

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.130 
stacks are playing correct they have to
allow<00:02:46.050> themselves<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:47.810> get<00:02:48.810> picked<00:02:49.050> on

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
allow themselves to get picked on

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.140 
allow themselves to get picked on
because<00:02:49.440> in<00:02:50.100> a<00:02:50.190> lot<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.340> spots<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:50.940> just

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
because in a lot of spots you just

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.450 
because in a lot of spots you just
shouldn't<00:02:51.570> be<00:02:51.690> taking<00:02:52.050> like<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.260> 55/45<00:02:52.860> or<00:02:53.370> like

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
shouldn't be taking like a 55/45 or like

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.270 
shouldn't be taking like a 55/45 or like
a<00:02:53.490> 5842<00:02:54.240> edge<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:54.900> really<00:02:55.770> to<00:02:55.860> be<00:02:55.980> correctly

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
a 5842 edge and really to be correctly

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.470 
a 5842 edge and really to be correctly
stacking<00:02:56.700> off<00:02:56.790> you<00:02:56.940> need<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.150> have<00:02:57.240> something

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
stacking off you need to have something

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.050 
stacking off you need to have something
more<00:02:57.690> like<00:02:57.870> 6535<00:02:58.890> thanks<00:02:59.520> again<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.880> Tom
