the other installations we have the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.259 
the other installations we have the
teflon<00:00:36.989> tape<00:00:37.290> this

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:41.269 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:44.560 

so<00:00:42.269> that<00:00:42.449> is<00:00:42.660> boom<00:00:42.870> we're<00:00:43.320> at<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.470> teflon<00:00:43.949> tape

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
so that is boom we're at a teflon tape

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.060 
so that is boom we're at a teflon tape
three<00:00:45.570> revolutions<00:00:48.350> can<00:00:49.350> be<00:00:49.500> carefully<00:00:49.920> on

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
three revolutions can be carefully on

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.880 
three revolutions can be carefully on
the<00:00:50.340> teflon<00:00:50.789> tape<00:00:51.120> hanging<00:00:51.629> out<00:00:52.879> into<00:00:54.890> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
the teflon tape hanging out into the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.819 
the teflon tape hanging out into the
water<00:00:56.550> flow<00:00:56.879> stream<00:00:57.390> when<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.289> make<00:00:58.469> sure<00:00:58.680> it's

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
water flow stream when I make sure it's

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.250 
water flow stream when I make sure it's
above<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.399> this<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.149> very<00:01:00.360> small<00:01:00.780> threaded

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
above it this is a very small threaded

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.889 
above it this is a very small threaded
area<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.250> little<00:01:02.789> more<00:01:02.969> difficultly<00:01:03.539> get<00:01:03.750> on

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
area so a little more difficultly get on

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.570 
area so a little more difficultly get on
it<00:01:04.110> was<00:01:04.589> on<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.979> other<00:01:05.250> ones<00:01:06.860> and<00:01:07.860> three

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
it was on the other ones and three

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.150 
it was on the other ones and three
revolutions<00:01:09.300> ready<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.960> tape<00:01:10.200> remember<00:01:11.070> in

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
revolutions ready to tape remember in

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.990 
revolutions ready to tape remember in
the<00:01:11.280> car<00:01:11.460> up<00:01:11.759> in<00:01:11.789> a<00:01:12.000> clockwise<00:01:12.270> direction<00:01:17.000> it

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
the car up in a clockwise direction it

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.210 
the car up in a clockwise direction it
was<00:01:18.090> thread<00:01:18.599> this<00:01:18.750> on<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.440> you're<00:01:19.590> gonna<00:01:19.709> be

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
and smoothly so we don't have it

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.639 
and smoothly so we don't have it
prostrate<00:01:39.149> now<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.869> might<00:01:40.050> notice<00:01:40.229> on<00:01:40.619> it
