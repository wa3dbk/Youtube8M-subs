thing that's advantageous about the

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.480 
thing that's advantageous about the
f2000<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:01.290> there's<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.860> many<00:02:02.010> bolts<00:02:02.340> to

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
f2000 is that there's so many bolts to

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.180 
f2000 is that there's so many bolts to
come<00:02:02.670> out<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:03.120> fast<00:02:03.420> that's<00:02:04.380> one<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.130> the

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
come out of it so fast that's one of the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
only guns that you could shoot off the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.770 
only guns that you could shoot off the
hip<00:02:07.560> without<00:02:08.099> steady<00:02:08.670> aim<00:02:08.909> and<00:02:09.239> still<00:02:09.599> hit

something<00:02:10.760> we<00:02:11.760> all<00:02:11.879> know<00:02:12.030> that's<00:02:12.209> going<00:02:12.330> to

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
something we all know that's going to

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.000 
something we all know that's going to
change<00:02:12.569> in<00:02:12.750> black<00:02:12.930> ops<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.409> here<00:02:13.590> i'm<00:02:13.709> waiting

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
change in black ops and here i'm waiting

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.470 
change in black ops and here i'm waiting
for<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.159> sniper<00:02:14.489> I<00:02:14.819> already<00:02:14.909> seen<00:02:15.209> it<00:02:15.329> come

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
for the sniper I already seen it come

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.970 
for the sniper I already seen it come
through<00:02:15.749> and<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.530> almost<00:02:16.680> died<00:02:17.069> but<00:02:17.930> lucky<00:02:18.930> me

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
through and I almost died but lucky me

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.460 
through and I almost died but lucky me
so<00:02:23.330> f2000<00:02:24.330> doesn't<00:02:24.569> have<00:02:24.659> too<00:02:24.900> many<00:02:24.930> bullets

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
so f2000 doesn't have too many bullets

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.490 
so f2000 doesn't have too many bullets
and<00:02:25.830> and<00:02:26.790> it's<00:02:26.940> an<00:02:27.030> assault<00:02:27.360> rifle<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:28.140> it's

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
and and it's an assault rifle so it's

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.160 
and and it's an assault rifle so it's
great<00:02:28.860> at<00:02:29.010> long<00:02:29.190> range<00:02:29.580> but<00:02:30.000> thing<00:02:30.840> about<00:02:31.019> it

weapon to use at long range especially

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.460 
weapon to use at long range especially
just<00:02:46.500> bursting<00:02:47.099> down<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.610> range<00:02:47.819> so<00:02:48.209> i

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
just bursting down the range so i

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.220 
just bursting down the range so i
thought<00:02:49.470> i<00:02:49.530> would<00:02:50.450> show<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:51.480> this<00:02:51.900> one

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
look at this look at the distance I got

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.629 
look at this look at the distance I got
a<00:03:35.130> double<00:03:35.910> burst<00:03:36.090> kill<00:03:36.510> double<00:03:36.930> /<00:03:37.049> skill<00:03:37.639> so

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
a double burst kill double / skill so

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:42.199 
a double burst kill double / skill so
the<00:03:39.650> thing<00:03:40.650> about<00:03:40.829> this<00:03:41.010> is<00:03:41.069> this<00:03:41.459> weapon<00:03:42.180> has

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
the thing about this is this weapon has

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.550 
the thing about this is this weapon has
a<00:03:42.389> lot<00:03:42.750> of<00:03:43.669> upward<00:03:44.669> momentum<00:03:45.109> which<00:03:46.109> I<00:03:46.290> think

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
a lot of upward momentum which I think

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.580 
a lot of upward momentum which I think
it's<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.799> only<00:03:47.190> gun<00:03:47.489> that<00:03:48.269> they<00:03:48.389> actually

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
it's the only gun that they actually

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.569 
it's the only gun that they actually
calibrated<00:03:49.590> I<00:03:49.709> don't<00:03:49.950> know<00:03:50.069> what<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:50.489> was

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
calibrated I don't know what it was

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.430 
calibrated I don't know what it was
maybe<00:03:50.819> they<00:03:51.030> thought<00:03:51.060> it<00:03:51.359> was<00:03:51.480> too<00:03:51.720> close<00:03:52.079> to

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
maybe they thought it was too close to

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.550 
maybe they thought it was too close to
the<00:03:54.109> too<00:03:55.109> close<00:03:55.380> to<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.889> tar<00:03:56.639> and<00:03:57.419> I<00:03:58.139> don't

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
the too close to the tar and I don't

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.319 
the too close to the tar and I don't
think<00:03:58.799> they<00:03:58.919> you<00:03:59.579> know<00:03:59.609> because<00:04:00.000> you<00:04:00.030> had<00:04:00.209> to

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
think they you know because you had to

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.990 
think they you know because you had to
reach<00:04:00.480> level<00:04:00.510> 60<00:04:01.169> to<00:04:01.290> use<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.769> weapon<00:04:02.160> so<00:04:02.760> they

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
reach level 60 to use the weapon so they

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.940 
reach level 60 to use the weapon so they
had<00:04:03.239> to<00:04:03.450> make<00:04:03.599> them<00:04:03.780> different<00:04:04.019> so<00:04:04.739> likes

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
had to make them different so likes

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.860 
had to make them different so likes
probably<00:04:05.459> somebody<00:04:05.730> like<00:04:05.849> I<00:04:05.970> just<00:04:06.450> there<00:04:06.750> are
