00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 Today we want to treat the topic 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.379
 Variation in horse training 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.870
 really extremely important topic because 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.389
 many horses unfortunately sleep in many places 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.250
 listless by the goods and are unfortunately 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.890
 Accordingly, not much motivation 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.840
 really active, so to speak 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.470
 Enthusiasm in horses training 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.470
 participate 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.489
 [Music] 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.220
 Many people know that you go with it 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.650
 his horse in the train it works 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.810
 ears down it looks from the face 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.920
 unmotivated and moved accordingly 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:51.390
 it also runs shuffling along with it 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.390
 cheerless facial expression in the train 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.980
 around and really work on 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.800
 Lessons and so on would like 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.150
 usually nothing is the problem and 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.330
 I totally underestimate the underestimation 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:06.300
 Many riders simply ride horses as well 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.830
 are, of course, out there in the 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.869
 fresh air in different 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.690
 different terrors in different 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.119
 environments with different irritants with 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.770
 different soil irritate every day 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.040
 a varied life, so to speak 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.130
 lead so well and also varied 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.800
 poor are many horses kept with us 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.210
 and unfortunately also trained yes you have to 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.729
 just even imagine the horse 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.440
 is in the box it comes from me then 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.880
 out a bit on the paddock in the 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.060
 Worst case then but also 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.890
 alone because of injury too big 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.709
 then the movement-related 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.330
 and play the incentive yourself 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:44.009
 with someone in the case with one 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.060
 to exchange another horse 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:51.330
 to complain that is a relative me 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.050
 say it's an appealing way of keeping it 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.479
 described 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.789
 and then of course it could be that 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.069
 then a specialized horse too 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.560
 still that is called shaving today 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.509
 Tomorrow the day after tomorrow or tomorrow 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.569
 is a jumping horse and accordingly 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.509
 a lot of discipline becomes specific 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:11.700
 the horse just worked yes the 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.010
 Variety remains on the track 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.650
 for the horse in the long term also remains 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.780
 the motivation on the track in general 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.520
 I think that's it completely 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.780
 important change in the horses 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.420
 to bring everyday life 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.340
 both ideal in attitude as well 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.950
 that means different coupling 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.080
 with a common double partner 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.420
 So at least one core 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.069
 partner and most important is easy 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.900
 also really hard in the training too 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.930
 give variety to bring in 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.540
 I personally bring this change 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.190
 by different things but completely 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.160
 Forcing also by hand horse riding 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.480
 if I ride my bike so my 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.580
 normal wheel for the hand drives 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.350
 take away then is the possibility 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.840
 to move without a rider 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.910
 It is allowed to work together in the group 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.710
 means with another horse and with 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.270
 move together so we are 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.950
 a small herd of three, so to speak 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.220
 different personalities 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.570
 it's out there in the outdoors 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.780
 has a minimum 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.340
 equipment, so to speak 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.770
 and thus has the feeling 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.070
 to really feel free, so to speak 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.350
 may and may also irritate soil 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.720
 perceive terrain to perceive stimuli 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.760
 it's outside it looks different 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.830
 Things may come up 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.900
 a little further away from the steel because you 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.970
 just two horses already at the same time 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.980
 trained and thus in the end 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.750
 Time saves you can do that too 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.670
 make a bigger round of two 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.760
 two and a half hours and then actually 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.910
 both horses, so to speak, in 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.110
 other diverse terrain 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.210
 take round 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.550
 yes, even if the horses that 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.530
 I know and are trained 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.610
 also often the horse halfway 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.740
 realize 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.440
 that means a horse is added to that 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.060
 hand moves the other horse is home too 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.640
 the craftsman no problem if 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.380
 course, the saddle accordingly 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.300
 Both horses fit or you can for example 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.760
 like me again and again 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.890
 maybe a treeless or even in the 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.110
 fans data then used it 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.870
 simple you opportunities in 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.120
 end effect halfway half so to speak the 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.069
 horses can work and this hand 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.169
 Horse riding is really one of those 

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:21.359
 wonderful form of training the horses 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.729
 Love is really fun for everyone 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.350
 Three if you are prepared on the ground 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:27.750
 that is very important right 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.360
 Preparation of horse and hand 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.639
 drives and also from the rider and then is 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.229
 it really a great thing 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.880
 Variation in the horses training too 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.289
 bring 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.419
 motivating for training 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:41.460
 Just bring the horse and the 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.080
 possibility to give freely 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.199
 move 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.000
 to really let go of the back and 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:48.770
 This also makes it a gentle 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.219
 training variant for example too 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.870
 maybe a bit older or 

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:56.629
 convalescent horses has one 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.250
 alternative to the edge horses ride when 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:00.439
 one does not have the possibility or that 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.780
 Do not want to do that would be natural 

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:04.360
 but go for a walk here too 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.889
 proper preparation of course 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.289
 essential that the horse in the train 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:11.990
 so to speak learned the soil once 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.729
 he and he may have become one at the beginning 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.590
 with a quiet escort drives 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:18.169
 accompany or just 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.810
 maybe his trainer will take that 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:23.300
 from the beginning in the terrain 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.330
 maybe even unexpected situations 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.889
 correctly encountered if you the video 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.900
 We would be very pleased

 our content shares for more horses 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:44.500
 thanks in the horse world and thank you
