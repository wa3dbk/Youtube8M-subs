 spices themselves are we for squeeze 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:49.050
 I took exactly the same for chicken only 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:52.050
 spices you first need to put some 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:56.070
 capacity plate add there one 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.469
 a tablespoon of flour and 2 3 tablespoons 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.750
 vegetable oil and so that they are a little bit 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.409
 infused now I added them somewhere 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.220
 very much and parts to the present, and now we 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.369
 we will use it 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:17.450
 It means to rush to the bag, even without ulta 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:17.450
 take and rub our chicken crooks 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:31.650
 I took the chicken for ice cream from us 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:34.430
 melted even just got ready in 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.430
 microwave and 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.970
 idle 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:02:00.010
 sprinkle salt well and rub 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:03.870
 now here are these spices completely 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.870
 everything and daubed 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.790
 Good principle is this package 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.920
 written on one kilogram street 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.500
 we have this chicken more than one 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.780
 a kilo of honest dirt don't even know 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:25.930
 how much she does not publish to hangs but 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:30.640
 more but nevertheless here these spokes 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:35.250
 enough even you do not need to add and can be 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.250
 and reduce principle 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.410
 here so also smears 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.500
 So 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:35.430
 here and put it in the pot should 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:35.430
 with hard climbs well 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.000
 fit now if you want more 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.640
 add a little bit of italian 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.610
 of taste 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:56.060
 like cooking likes doing tired and then 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.580
 we will need another glass 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.290
 tomato juice 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:08.130
 but the sense is not another archive in one 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:14.990
 a glass of tomato juice take a tomato 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:14.990
 juice and right here we pour on our chicken 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:31.490
 close the lid and put in the oven 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:42.320
 turn our oven temperature 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:45.400
 set somewhere around 230 degrees and time 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.400
 set half an hour 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:58.780
 all our chicken began to cook through 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:04.330
 one and a half hours let's try 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:07.650
 let's see open the lid and here's a 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.650
 we have a beauty 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.410
 blush 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:27.740
 Well , now we are ready to pull it on 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.290
 plate and show smart of course 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:33.620

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.990
 so we will cut right in the pot 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:43.600

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.390
 Russian stove 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.550
