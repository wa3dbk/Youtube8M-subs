00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:34.600
 But 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:40.130
 Well I think this is a book killer when I see the staff of the team or something pv 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:41.290
 When I saw it when I saw it on the Gar's net I think I can do it when I see it 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:46.300

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:12.070
 It is a great thing that you can go out to the favorite work because it is a great favorite work 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.750
 I'm thankful 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.780
 I'm not pressure anymore 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:22.550
 It stood certainly I in Well 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:25.580
 Or each other is bought and want to do something don the role yourself Te read Ono-kun 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.580
 Limited to Masashi Giant 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:33.470
 Hmmm work 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.490
 Of course there may also be other people who want to see it as a customer 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.930
 What 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:44.340
 I've also got a reason to think the Fu it 's such a want to do this role Oh after all this work 4 have 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:50.009
 But basically that oneself is not very confident 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:54.750
 Was can buy play a role to really raise the What 's and the quality of the work involved 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:59.130
 It's good, but I think I might not be able to buy it because I do n't have myself 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:02.939
 Although if decided let you if out do fine full When you become Rutte events in 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.330
 But if you are not, you should be enjoying yourself as a customer with Okun 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.240
 I wonder if it's good 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:11.610
 Hey 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:23.400
 I had a breath and a booboo when I was being booed 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:25.210
 So if you can cast at the beginning already, you can come in second place 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.680
 What 's translation Te Majinna 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:33.790
 When was what I Chan is the strongest the Hey Hey so is the strongest in the human 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:38.340
 Though it is said that it is said to be the strongest medicine in the world view of a certain 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:45.870
 Grinded not remove Te anymore so much negative 0 Damon'tsu 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:51.300
 Is I'm more than Degan-chan of the ne of the unit by which the Revival belongs 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:53.220
 Martha room Huh high take I did not think that would be the two people involved are of 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.819
 Sister at the time of the meeting 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:03.630
 I have been talking about things like having bought a new issue of a wife of wages 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:05.770
 Oh hey I guess I've been up to me I think so I'm looking at the fan 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.650

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:12.629
 This doing long as it Rutteyuu of the 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.530
 No, I have nothing to do , but I already have enough to get involved 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:18.390
 More than a 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:21.730
 I think if you know, it is natural that my parents are starting now 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:28.480
 The response from everyone who is watching that 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:33.810
 It seems that the environment is such a contribution, so I'll kill this momentum a little 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.810
 We will do our best so as not to
