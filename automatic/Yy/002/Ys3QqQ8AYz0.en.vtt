beloved favorite castells as for the
line<00:01:20.299> goes<00:01:20.630> I<00:01:20.990> don't<00:01:21.890> know<00:01:22.069> how<00:01:22.219> well<00:01:22.490> this<00:01:22.670> is

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
line goes I don't know how well this is

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.489 
line goes I don't know how well this is
going<00:01:22.939> to<00:01:23.030> be<00:01:23.119> in<00:01:23.210> focus<00:01:23.509> but<00:01:23.749> you<00:01:24.350> can

00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:24.499 
going to be in focus but you can

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:26.169 
going to be in focus but you can
definitely<00:01:24.679> tell<00:01:25.130> that<00:01:25.189> this<00:01:25.579> is<00:01:25.729> a<00:01:25.759> much

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:26.179 
definitely tell that this is a much

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:28.270 
definitely tell that this is a much
smoother<00:01:26.659> line<00:01:26.840> than<00:01:27.079> the<00:01:27.200> prismacolor<00:01:27.619> the

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
smoother line than the prismacolor the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.870 
smoother line than the prismacolor the
Copic<00:01:28.670> has<00:01:29.409> much<00:01:30.409> much<00:01:30.920> smoother<00:01:31.249> lines<00:01:31.460> I<00:01:31.639> did

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
Copic has much much smoother lines I did

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.289 
Copic has much much smoother lines I did
do<00:01:32.119> two<00:01:32.899> layers<00:01:33.200> over<00:01:33.499> each<00:01:33.880> so<00:01:34.880> you<00:01:34.939> could

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
do two layers over each so you could

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.139 
do two layers over each so you could
tell<00:01:35.659> which<00:01:36.380> one<00:01:36.530> has<00:01:36.679> better<00:01:36.710> blending<00:01:37.369> on

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
tell which one has better blending on

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.940 
tell which one has better blending on
the<00:01:38.479> prismacolor<00:01:40.600> it's<00:01:41.600> really<00:01:42.259> choppy<00:01:42.590> like

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
the prismacolor it's really choppy like

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.499 
the prismacolor it's really choppy like
that<00:01:43.130> would<00:01:43.219> be<00:01:43.310> extremely<00:01:43.579> noticeable<00:01:44.060> and

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
that would be extremely noticeable and

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.899 
that would be extremely noticeable and
something<00:01:44.840> you're<00:01:44.929> trying<00:01:45.049> to<00:01:45.350> do<00:01:45.909> markets

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
something you're trying to do markets

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.239 
something you're trying to do markets
well<00:01:47.770> no<00:01:48.770> comparison<00:01:49.399> whatsoever<00:01:49.509> and<00:01:51.249> favor

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:52.249 
well no comparison whatsoever and favor

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:55.629 
well no comparison whatsoever and favor
Castells<00:01:53.170> they<00:01:54.170> are<00:01:54.319> similar<00:01:54.859> I<00:01:55.069> like<00:01:55.490> the

00:01:55.629 --> 00:01:55.639 
Castells they are similar I like the

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:57.219 
Castells they are similar I like the
smoothness<00:01:55.969> better<00:01:56.509> of<00:01:56.689> the<00:01:56.779> favorite

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
smoothness better of the favorite

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.169 
smoothness better of the favorite
castells<00:01:57.709> but<00:01:58.039> I<00:01:58.069> mean<00:01:58.340> that's<00:01:58.670> just<00:01:58.939> me

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
castells but I mean that's just me

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:01.389 
castells but I mean that's just me
personally<00:01:59.560> honestly<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:00.740> better<00:02:00.920> marker<00:02:01.249> is

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
personally honestly the better marker is

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.609 
personally honestly the better marker is
the<00:02:01.579> comics<00:02:01.999> but<00:02:02.299> if<00:02:02.869> you<00:02:03.049> want<00:02:03.200> to<00:02:03.259> go<00:02:03.409> for

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
the comics but if you want to go for

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.529 
the comics but if you want to go for
something<00:02:03.880> that's<00:02:04.880> a<00:02:04.999> little<00:02:05.090> bit<00:02:05.329> less

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
something that's a little bit less

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.749 
something that's a little bit less
expensive<00:02:06.079> definitely<00:02:06.499> go<00:02:06.590> for<00:02:06.619> the<00:02:07.009> favorite

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
expensive definitely go for the favorite

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.899 
expensive definitely go for the favorite
castells<00:02:08.119> before<00:02:08.629> you<00:02:08.810> go<00:02:08.959> for<00:02:09.170> prismacolors

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:09.909 
castells before you go for prismacolors

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:12.070 
castells before you go for prismacolors
prismacolors<00:02:10.909> are<00:02:11.060> not<00:02:11.180> worth<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.510> money<00:02:11.629> for

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
prismacolors are not worth the money for

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.080 
prismacolors are not worth the money for
me<00:02:12.290> may<00:02:12.980> be<00:02:13.040> there<00:02:13.220> for<00:02:13.459> you<00:02:13.580> but<00:02:13.790> that's<00:02:13.909> just

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
me may be there for you but that's just

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.310 
me may be there for you but that's just
my

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
my

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.170 
my
alright<00:02:16.320> we<00:02:16.500> ran<00:02:16.740> down<00:02:17.010> smoothness<00:02:17.850> and

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
alright we ran down smoothness and

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.960 
alright we ran down smoothness and
choppiness<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.320> blending<00:02:19.860> that's<00:02:20.730> pretty

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
choppiness and blending that's pretty
