while about how do I connect a PC to a

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.380 
while about how do I connect a PC to a
router<00:00:16.369> inside<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.520> packet<00:00:17.850> tracer<00:00:18.210> so

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
router inside of packet tracer so

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.609 
router inside of packet tracer so
they're<00:00:18.539> trying<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.840> do<00:00:18.960> it<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.199> they<00:00:19.289> can't

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
they're trying to do it and they can't

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.580 
they're trying to do it and they can't
get<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.920> connection<00:00:20.810> so<00:00:21.810> here's<00:00:21.990> why<00:00:22.170> so<00:00:22.410> let's

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
get a connection so here's why so let's

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.560 
get a connection so here's why so let's
do<00:00:22.740> this<00:00:22.949> where<00:00:23.220> we've<00:00:23.340> got<00:00:23.519> packet<00:00:24.090> tracer<00:00:24.390> up

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
do this where we've got packet tracer up

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.019 
do this where we've got packet tracer up
and<00:00:24.779> running<00:00:25.050> I'm<00:00:25.590> going<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.769> go<00:00:25.920> up<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.310> PC

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
and running I'm going to go up to a PC

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.330 
and running I'm going to go up to a PC
just<00:00:27.480> drag<00:00:27.750> one<00:00:27.779> in<00:00:28.080> there<00:00:28.260> I'm<00:00:28.890> just<00:00:29.189> going<00:00:29.310> to

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
just drag one in there I'm just going to

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.220 
just drag one in there I'm just going to
drag<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.170> 1841<00:00:31.170> el<00:00:31.830> cheapo<00:00:32.340> router<00:00:33.230> so

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
drag in the 1841 el cheapo router so

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.020 
drag in the 1841 el cheapo router so
what<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.649> lot<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:34.980> people<00:00:35.250> do<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.520> they<00:00:35.550> click<00:00:36.000> on

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
what a lot of people do is they click on

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.110 
what a lot of people do is they click on
this<00:00:37.309> automatically<00:00:38.309> choose<00:00:38.579> connection

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
this automatically choose connection

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.160 
this automatically choose connection
type<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.540> then<00:00:39.629> go<00:00:39.809> over<00:00:40.020> to

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
type and then go over to

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.380 
type and then go over to
straight-through<00:00:41.100> cable<00:00:41.129> because<00:00:42.059> they're

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
straight-through cable because they're

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.750 
straight-through cable because they're
thinking<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:43.829> should<00:00:44.100> work<00:00:44.250> like<00:00:44.579> in

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
thinking that this should work like in

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.970 
thinking that this should work like in
real<00:00:44.940> life<00:00:44.969> like<00:00:45.480> when<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.780> connect<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.260> PC<00:00:46.620> to

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
real life like when you connect a PC to

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.560 
real life like when you connect a PC to
a<00:00:47.010> switch<00:00:47.280> you're<00:00:47.610> using<00:00:47.820> just<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.239> regular

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
a switch you're using just a regular

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.709 
a switch you're using just a regular
straight<00:00:49.320> through<00:00:49.590> Ethernet<00:00:50.010> cable<00:00:50.539> so<00:00:51.539> we'll

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
straight through Ethernet cable so we'll

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.040 
straight through Ethernet cable so we'll
click<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.199> fastethernet<00:00:53.010> 0/0<00:00:53.840> drag<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:54.989> over

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
click on fastethernet 0/0 drag that over

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.400 
click on fastethernet 0/0 drag that over
to<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.469> PC<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.070> connect<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.719> there<00:00:57.719> now<00:00:58.320> you

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
to the PC and connect to there now you

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.840 
to the PC and connect to there now you
notice<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.039> links<00:00:59.250> are<00:00:59.370> red<00:00:59.579> which<00:00:59.820> is

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
notice that the links are red which is

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.689 
notice that the links are red which is
fine<00:01:00.359> for<00:01:00.600> now<00:01:00.750> but<00:01:01.100> we're<00:01:02.100> going<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.280> need<00:01:02.370> to

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
fine for now but we're going to need to

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.789 
fine for now but we're going to need to
turn<00:01:03.210> on<00:01:03.449> things<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:03.960> let's<00:01:04.170> turn<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:04.769> the

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
turn on things so let's turn on the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.870 
turn on things so let's turn on the
router<00:01:05.159> over<00:01:05.519> here<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:07.400> as<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.520> go<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.760> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
router over here and as I go to the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.980 
router over here and as I go to the
command<00:01:09.180> line<00:01:09.299> you'll<00:01:09.659> see<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:11.450> basic<00:01:12.450> bare

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
command line you'll see that basic bare

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.450 
command line you'll see that basic bare
conveying<00:01:13.680> nothing's<00:01:14.070> there

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
conveying nothing's there

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.600 
conveying nothing's there
so<00:01:14.790> I'm<00:01:14.880> going<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.030> go<00:01:15.180> into<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.869> fast<00:01:16.830> 0/0

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
so I'm going to go into the fast 0/0

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.760 
so I'm going to go into the fast 0/0
interface<00:01:18.119> give<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.750> IP<00:01:18.869> address<00:01:19.320> we'll<00:01:19.590> just

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
interface give the IP address we'll just

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.120 
interface give the IP address we'll just
make<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.040> really<00:01:20.189> simple<00:01:20.580> all<00:01:20.729> ones<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.860> a<00:01:22.860> /

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
make it really simple all ones and a /

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.859 
make it really simple all ones and a /
24<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.909> no<00:01:24.240> shut<00:01:25.790> now<00:01:26.790> you'll<00:01:27.000> see<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.240> if<00:01:27.689> I

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
24 and no shut now you'll see that if I

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.980 
24 and no shut now you'll see that if I
show<00:01:28.049> IP<00:01:28.259> NPR<00:01:29.070> I've<00:01:29.280> got<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:30.119> status<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.810> up

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
show IP NPR I've got the status is up

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.140 
show IP NPR I've got the status is up
which<00:01:31.200> means<00:01:31.439> I've<00:01:31.590> done<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.799> no<00:01:32.040> shut<00:01:32.340> but<00:01:33.000> the

which means I've done a no shut but the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.800 
which means I've done a no shut but the
protocol<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.869> down<00:01:35.119> so<00:01:36.119> let's<00:01:36.299> go<00:01:36.450> over<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.720> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
protocol is down so let's go over to the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.740 
protocol is down so let's go over to the
PC<00:01:37.140> let's<00:01:37.350> see<00:01:37.560> what's<00:01:37.740> going<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.119> now<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.180> PC

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
PC let's see what's going on now the PC

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.870 
PC let's see what's going on now the PC
their<00:01:40.350> interfaces<00:01:41.009> are<00:01:41.310> automatically<00:01:41.820> out

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
their interfaces are automatically out

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.469 
their interfaces are automatically out
but<00:01:42.240> let's<00:01:42.450> say<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:43.159> we<00:01:44.159> want<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.700> configure

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
but let's say that we want to configure

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.330 
but let's say that we want to configure
an<00:01:45.570> IP<00:01:45.659> address<00:01:45.869> just<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.590> make<00:01:46.799> sure<00:01:47.009> things

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
an IP address just to make sure things

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.569 
an IP address just to make sure things
are<00:01:47.640> are<00:01:48.530> working<00:01:49.530> or<00:01:49.829> not<00:01:49.860> working<00:01:50.070> as

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
are are working or not working as

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.249 
are are working or not working as
intended<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.360> I'm<00:01:51.780> going<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:51.960> make<00:01:52.110> this

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
intended so I'm going to make this

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.700 
intended so I'm going to make this
really<00:01:52.530> simple<00:01:52.560> 1<00:01:53.100> 1<00:01:53.310> 1<00:01:53.579> 2<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.570> that's<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.470> slash

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
really simple 1 1 1 2 and that's a slash

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.710 
packet tracer now normally in most
situations<00:04:13.949> this<00:04:14.569> shouldn't<00:04:15.569> matter

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
situations this shouldn't matter

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.719 
situations this shouldn't matter
especially<00:04:16.349> in<00:04:16.440> real<00:04:16.590> life<00:04:16.799> because<00:04:17.039> this<00:04:17.579> is

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
especially in real life because this is

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.249 
especially in real life because this is
how<00:04:17.849> you<00:04:17.909> would<00:04:18.209> be<00:04:18.359> connecting<00:04:18.870> things<00:04:19.019> in

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:19.259 
how you would be connecting things in

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.069 
how you would be connecting things in
real<00:04:19.590> life<00:04:19.769> you<00:04:19.949> wouldn't<00:04:20.220> be<00:04:20.840> connecting<00:04:21.840> a

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
real life you wouldn't be connecting a

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.909 
real life you wouldn't be connecting a
PC<00:04:22.560> to<00:04:22.590> a<00:04:22.830> router<00:04:23.330> most<00:04:24.330> of<00:04:24.449> the<00:04:24.509> time<00:04:24.889> what<00:04:25.889> you

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
PC to a router most of the time what you

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.640 
PC to a router most of the time what you
would<00:04:26.220> be<00:04:26.370> doing<00:04:26.550> is<00:04:26.820> you'd<00:04:27.419> have<00:04:27.599> a<00:04:27.630> router

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
would be doing is you'd have a router

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.280 
would be doing is you'd have a router
and<00:04:30.490> routers<00:04:30.880> don't<00:04:31.090> have<00:04:31.240> many<00:04:31.479> interfaces

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
and routers don't have many interfaces

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.040 
and routers don't have many interfaces
they<00:04:32.410> might<00:04:32.590> have<00:04:32.800> to<00:04:33.340> maybe<00:04:33.970> four<00:04:34.360> interfaces

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
they might have to maybe four interfaces

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.250 
they might have to maybe four interfaces
at<00:04:35.889> the<00:04:36.310> desktop<00:04:36.850> at<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:37.150> home<00:04:37.270> level<00:04:37.479> so

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
at the desktop at the home level so

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.659 
at the desktop at the home level so
you're<00:04:38.410> going<00:04:38.590> to<00:04:38.650> need<00:04:38.800> more<00:04:38.979> ports<00:04:39.370> so<00:04:39.490> what

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
you're going to need more ports so what

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.670 
you're going to need more ports so what
if<00:04:39.760> you<00:04:39.880> need<00:04:40.060> to<00:04:40.090> connect<00:04:40.479> five<00:04:40.750> computers<00:04:41.410> to

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
if you need to connect five computers to

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.850 
if you need to connect five computers to
two<00:04:42.490> to<00:04:42.940> your<00:04:43.060> router<00:04:43.300> well<00:04:43.840> you<00:04:44.020> can<00:04:44.470> if<00:04:44.710> you

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
two to your router well you can if you

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.300 
two to your router well you can if you
only<00:04:45.040> have<00:04:45.310> one<00:04:45.610> or<00:04:45.639> two<00:04:45.760> ports<00:04:46.630> on<00:04:46.720> the<00:04:47.020> router

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
only have one or two ports on the router

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.680 
only have one or two ports on the router
so<00:04:48.310> what<00:04:48.490> you<00:04:48.610> need<00:04:48.729> to<00:04:48.790> do<00:04:49.000> is<00:04:49.300> you're<00:04:49.660> going

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
so what you need to do is you're going

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.020 
so what you need to do is you're going
to<00:04:49.870> buy<00:04:49.990> a<00:04:50.020> switch<00:04:50.470> we're<00:04:51.460> going<00:04:51.580> to<00:04:51.639> buy<00:04:51.760> a

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
to buy a switch we're going to buy a

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.900 
to buy a switch we're going to buy a
what's<00:04:52.540> good<00:04:52.720> switch<00:04:52.930> here<00:04:53.110> 2960<00:04:54.010> you're

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
what's good switch here 2960 you're

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.100 
what's good switch here 2960 you're
going<00:04:55.060> to<00:04:55.120> connect<00:04:55.360> the<00:04:55.479> router<00:04:55.600> to<00:04:55.990> the

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
going to connect the router to the

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.530 
going to connect the router to the
switch<00:04:56.350> and<00:04:56.590> then<00:04:56.949> the<00:04:57.130> PC<00:04:57.550> to<00:04:58.000> the<00:04:58.030> switches

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
switch and then the PC to the switches

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.760 
switch and then the PC to the switches
so<00:04:58.810> this<00:04:59.020> is<00:04:59.169> how<00:04:59.260> it's<00:04:59.440> going<00:04:59.530> to<00:04:59.590> work<00:05:01.770> and

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
so this is how it's going to work and

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.189 
so this is how it's going to work and
we'll<00:05:02.949> drag<00:05:03.130> in<00:05:03.370> three<00:05:03.940> pcs<00:05:04.330> right<00:05:04.510> there<00:05:04.750> so

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
we'll drag in three pcs right there so

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.110 
we'll drag in three pcs right there so
this<00:05:05.350> is<00:05:05.620> where<00:05:05.949> we're<00:05:06.130> going<00:05:06.250> to<00:05:06.310> be<00:05:06.520> using<00:05:06.910> a

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
this is where we're going to be using a

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.460 
this is where we're going to be using a
straight-through<00:05:07.570> cable<00:05:07.780> we're<00:05:08.260> going<00:05:08.410> to

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
straight-through cable we're going to

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.010 
straight-through cable we're going to
connect<00:05:08.740> the<00:05:08.800> PCs<00:05:09.310> to<00:05:09.639> the<00:05:09.760> switches<00:05:11.039> like<00:05:12.039> so

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
connect the PCs to the switches like so

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:19.650 
connect the PCs to the switches like so
so<00:05:14.020> PC<00:05:14.410> one<00:05:17.460> so<00:05:18.460> something<00:05:18.850> like<00:05:18.880> that<00:05:19.000> so

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
so PC one so something like that so

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.659 
so PC one so something like that so
straight<00:05:19.960> through<00:05:20.169> cables<00:05:20.560> from<00:05:20.770> PCs<00:05:21.250> to<00:05:21.550> the

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
straight through cables from PCs to the

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.629 
straight through cables from PCs to the
switch<00:05:21.910> and<00:05:22.650> from<00:05:23.650> the<00:05:23.830> switch<00:05:24.100> to<00:05:24.340> the<00:05:24.460> router

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 
switch and from the switch to the router

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:26.820 
switch and from the switch to the router
let's<00:05:25.449> see<00:05:25.600> if<00:05:25.750> we<00:05:25.870> can<00:05:26.050> get<00:05:26.169> away<00:05:26.289> with<00:05:26.650> the

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
let's see if we can get away with the

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.460 
let's see if we can get away with the
straight<00:05:27.100> through<00:05:27.310> cable<00:05:27.520> there<00:05:28.289> let's<00:05:29.289> see

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
straight through cable there let's see

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.560 
straight through cable there let's see
what<00:05:29.620> happens

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
what happens

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.760 
what happens
so<00:05:31.570> we<00:05:31.690> have<00:05:31.810> red<00:05:32.080> that's<00:05:32.380> not<00:05:32.530> a<00:05:32.560> problem

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
so we have red that's not a problem

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.589 
so we have red that's not a problem
let's<00:05:33.010> turn<00:05:33.220> on<00:05:33.340> the<00:05:33.460> interface<00:05:33.880> on<00:05:34.120> Fast<00:05:34.360> zero

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
let's turn on the interface on Fast zero

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:36.540 
let's turn on the interface on Fast zero
zero<00:05:34.870> on<00:05:35.020> the<00:05:35.139> router<00:05:35.349> and<00:05:35.590> see<00:05:35.889> if<00:05:36.099> that<00:05:36.280> link

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
zero on the router and see if that link

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:42.900 
zero on the router and see if that link
turns<00:05:37.000> green<00:05:41.099> so<00:05:42.099> I'm<00:05:42.160> going<00:05:42.280> to<00:05:42.340> go<00:05:42.430> to<00:05:42.490> cop<00:05:42.700> T

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
turns green so I'm going to go to cop T

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.020 
turns green so I'm going to go to cop T
interface<00:05:43.539> pass<00:05:43.780> zero<00:05:43.810> zero<00:05:44.520> same<00:05:45.520> deal<00:05:45.729> IP

four<00:05:49.419> and<00:05:49.690> no<00:05:50.289> shut<00:05:50.560> let's<00:05:50.860> see<00:05:50.979> if<00:05:51.070> we<00:05:51.190> have<00:05:51.220> a

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
four and no shut let's see if we have a

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.240 
four and no shut let's see if we have a
color<00:05:51.639> change<00:05:51.970> on<00:05:52.240> our<00:05:53.020> link<00:05:53.200> and<00:05:53.620> looks<00:05:54.130> like

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
color change on our link and looks like

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.740 
color change on our link and looks like
we<00:05:54.370> have<00:05:54.460> green<00:05:54.669> on<00:05:54.820> one<00:05:55.000> side<00:05:55.210> now<00:05:55.419> the<00:05:55.479> switch

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
we have green on one side now the switch

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.310 
we have green on one side now the switch
is<00:05:56.050> orange<00:05:56.919> or<00:05:57.130> yellow<00:05:57.810> depending<00:05:58.810> on<00:05:59.020> if<00:05:59.229> you

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320 
is orange or yellow depending on if you

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.710 
is orange or yellow depending on if you
are<00:05:59.440> if<00:05:59.740> you're<00:06:00.220> colorblind<00:06:00.580> or<00:06:00.910> not<00:06:01.060> but

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
are if you're colorblind or not but

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.060 
are if you're colorblind or not but
what's<00:06:01.960> happening<00:06:02.289> right<00:06:02.380> here<00:06:02.440> is<00:06:02.889> the

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
what's happening right here is the

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.529 
what's happening right here is the
switches<00:06:03.430> going<00:06:03.669> through<00:06:03.910> spanning-tree

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:04.539 
switches going through spanning-tree

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:06.420 
switches going through spanning-tree
just<00:06:04.990> to<00:06:05.080> figure<00:06:05.260> out<00:06:05.470> if<00:06:05.710> there<00:06:06.310> are<00:06:06.340> any

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
just to figure out if there are any

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.980 
just to figure out if there are any
loops<00:06:06.940> in<00:06:07.240> the<00:06:07.780> network<00:06:08.220> and<00:06:09.220> just<00:06:09.810> to<00:06:10.810> prove

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
loops in the network and just to prove

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.140 
loops in the network and just to prove
to<00:06:11.050> you<00:06:11.289> that<00:06:11.320> everything<00:06:12.010> should<00:06:12.669> be<00:06:12.729> good

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150 
to you that everything should be good

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.300 
to you that everything should be good
I'm<00:06:13.360> going<00:06:13.479> to<00:06:13.539> go<00:06:13.660> over<00:06:13.990> to<00:06:14.139> this<00:06:14.289> PC<00:06:14.979> will

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
I'm going to go over to this PC will

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.670 
I'm going to go over to this PC will
give<00:06:15.430> the<00:06:15.520> IP<00:06:15.669> address<00:06:16.060> of<00:06:16.300> all<00:06:16.510> one<00:06:17.320> one<00:06:17.500> one

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
give the IP address of all one one one

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.420 
give the IP address of all one one one
two<00:06:18.449> and<00:06:19.449> let's<00:06:20.320> see<00:06:20.440> if<00:06:20.470> we<00:06:20.620> can<00:06:20.770> ping<00:06:21.010> through

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430 
two and let's see if we can ping through

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.290 
two and let's see if we can ping through
the<00:06:21.580> switch<00:06:21.789> and<00:06:22.169> into<00:06:23.169> the<00:06:23.440> router

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
the switch and into the router

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.700 
the switch and into the router
so<00:06:25.300> this<00:06:25.449> is<00:06:25.599> going<00:06:25.750> to<00:06:25.810> be<00:06:25.930> really<00:06:26.169> simple<00:06:26.380> one

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
so this is going to be really simple one

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:34.140 
so this is going to be really simple one
one<00:06:26.949> one<00:06:27.190> two<00:06:27.430> and<00:06:28.979> a<00:06:29.979> /<00:06:30.220> 24<00:06:30.789> mask<00:06:33.000> and<00:06:34.000> we'll

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.150 
one one two and a / 24 mask and we'll

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:35.879 
one one two and a / 24 mask and we'll
just<00:06:34.300> make<00:06:34.449> sure<00:06:34.510> all<00:06:35.169> of<00:06:35.199> our<00:06:35.500> lights<00:06:35.710> are

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:35.889 
just make sure all of our lights are

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:38.630 
just make sure all of our lights are
green<00:06:36.039> that's<00:06:36.310> good<00:06:36.460> so<00:06:37.030> we'll<00:06:37.120> go<00:06:37.270> to<00:06:37.300> the<00:06:37.599> PC

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:38.640 
green that's good so we'll go to the PC

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.730 
green that's good so we'll go to the PC
go<00:06:39.640> to<00:06:39.700> the<00:06:40.150> command<00:06:40.539> prompt<00:06:40.870> and<00:06:41.349> we're<00:06:41.590> going

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
go to the command prompt and we're going

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.469 
go to the command prompt and we're going
to<00:06:41.770> paying<00:06:42.039> one<00:06:42.610> one<00:06:43.000> one
