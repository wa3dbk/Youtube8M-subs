actually carbon fiber to you can see

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.530 
actually carbon fiber to you can see
that<00:02:57.520> and<00:02:58.520> I<00:02:58.580> think<00:02:58.640> that's<00:02:58.820> all<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.090> mods<00:02:59.330> so

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
have a slip-on right I think so and yeah

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.449 
have a slip-on right I think so and yeah
that's<00:03:12.110> basically<00:03:12.230> it<00:03:12.590> i<00:03:12.710> use<00:03:12.830> them<00:03:13.010> a<00:03:15.459> screen

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
that's basically it i use them a screen
