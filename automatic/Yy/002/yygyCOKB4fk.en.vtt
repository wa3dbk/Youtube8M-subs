pin<00:03:07.240> the<00:03:07.900> other<00:03:08.020> end<00:03:08.200> would<00:03:08.350> go<00:03:08.470> straight<00:03:08.530> into

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
pin the other end would go straight into

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.280 
pin the other end would go straight into
the<00:03:09.070> PSU<00:03:09.580> then<00:03:10.090> we<00:03:10.270> have<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.600> 24<00:03:10.900> pin

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290

guess<00:03:13.630> it<00:03:13.750> would<00:03:13.870> probably<00:03:14.050> be<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:14.740> it<00:03:15.490> looks

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
guess it would probably be and it looks

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.770 
guess it would probably be and it looks
a<00:03:15.760> little<00:03:15.850> bit<00:03:16.030> different<00:03:16.180> than<00:03:16.480> twenty<00:03:16.660> plus

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
a little bit different than twenty plus

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.330 
a little bit different than twenty plus
four<00:03:17.050> actually<00:03:17.470> we're<00:03:17.860> going<00:03:17.950> to<00:03:18.070> call<00:03:18.190> it<00:03:18.310> a

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
four actually we're going to call it a

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.150 
four actually we're going to call it a
24<00:03:18.790> pin<00:03:19.000> all<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.270> same<00:03:19.530> moving<00:03:20.530> along<00:03:20.770> we<00:03:20.980> do

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
24 pin all the same moving along we do

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.640 
24 pin all the same moving along we do
have<00:03:21.370> your<00:03:21.640> peripheral<00:03:22.209> connectors<00:03:22.660> you<00:03:23.500> are

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
have your peripheral connectors you are

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.460 
have your peripheral connectors you are
getting<00:03:24.070> four<00:03:24.700> of<00:03:24.970> their<00:03:25.540> two's<00:03:25.720> me<00:03:25.840> three<00:03:26.170> of

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
getting four of their two's me three of

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.010 
getting four of their two's me three of
the<00:03:26.770> SATA<00:03:27.550> peripheral<00:03:28.150> can<00:03:28.330> power<00:03:28.570> connectors

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
the SATA peripheral can power connectors

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.080 
the SATA peripheral can power connectors
three<00:03:29.709> of<00:03:29.830> the<00:03:29.950> SATA<00:03:30.130> connectors<00:03:30.550> on<00:03:30.700> each<00:03:30.880> one

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
three of the SATA connectors on each one

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.090 
three of the SATA connectors on each one
of<00:03:31.180> these<00:03:31.270> four<00:03:31.690> times<00:03:32.380> three<00:03:32.650> which<00:03:32.740> is<00:03:32.800> total

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
of these four times three which is total

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.760 
of these four times three which is total
of<00:03:33.160> nine<00:03:33.400> then<00:03:34.360> you're<00:03:34.480> getting<00:03:34.780> four<00:03:35.140> molex

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
of nine then you're getting four molex

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.520 
of nine then you're getting four molex
four<00:03:36.040> pin<00:03:36.310> that<00:03:37.150> would<00:03:37.270> be<00:03:37.390> plugged<00:03:37.690> in<00:03:37.900> and<00:03:38.230> as

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
four pin that would be plugged in and as

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.430 
four pin that would be plugged in and as
well<00:03:38.890> as<00:03:39.070> using<00:03:39.370> these<00:03:39.880> to<00:03:40.720> get<00:03:40.840> it<00:03:41.020> I'm<00:03:41.290> not

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
well as using these to get it I'm not

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.510 
well as using these to get it I'm not
really<00:03:41.590> sure<00:03:41.830> that<00:03:41.860> you<00:03:42.040> would<00:03:42.160> even<00:03:42.280> have

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
really sure that you would even have

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.830 
really sure that you would even have
this<00:03:42.670> but<00:03:42.850> in<00:03:42.940> case<00:03:43.090> you<00:03:43.209> do<00:03:43.360> have<00:03:43.480> a<00:03:43.540> floppy

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
this but in case you do have a floppy

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.020 
this but in case you do have a floppy
you<00:03:44.590> can<00:03:44.739> provide<00:03:45.010> power<00:03:45.280> for<00:03:45.340> that<00:03:45.640> with<00:03:45.850> this

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
you can provide power for that with this

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.740 
you can provide power for that with this
small<00:03:46.540> adapter<00:03:46.930> and<00:03:47.550> then<00:03:48.550> finally<00:03:49.060> we<00:03:49.570> have

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
small adapter and then finally we have

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.280 
small adapter and then finally we have
for<00:03:50.380> a<00:03:51.100> VGA<00:03:51.760> power<00:03:52.090> connectors<00:03:52.600> that<00:03:52.720> is<00:03:53.020> six

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
for a VGA power connectors that is six

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.740 
for a VGA power connectors that is six
plus<00:03:53.560> two<00:03:53.830> pin<00:03:54.100> and<00:03:54.340> a<00:03:54.820> total<00:03:55.090> of<00:03:55.209> four<00:03:55.480> of<00:03:55.510> them

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
plus two pin and a total of four of them

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.300 
plus two pin and a total of four of them
so<00:03:55.900> you're<00:03:55.989> going<00:03:56.170> to<00:03:56.230> have<00:03:56.320> plenty<00:03:56.620> of<00:03:56.830> power

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
so you're going to have plenty of power

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.310 
so you're going to have plenty of power
provided<00:03:57.970> to<00:03:58.180> your<00:03:58.390> graphics<00:03:58.840> cards<00:03:59.140> and
