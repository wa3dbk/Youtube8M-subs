00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
but it is seven pound plus postage and

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:45.840 
but it is seven pound plus postage and
packaging<00:04:44.650> so<00:04:44.919> I<00:04:44.949> think<00:04:45.130> all<00:04:45.220> together<00:04:45.520> came

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
packaging so I think all together came

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.840 
packaging so I think all together came
to<00:04:46.000> about<00:04:46.090> nine<00:04:46.600> pound<00:04:46.990> and<00:04:47.610> that's<00:04:48.610> not<00:04:48.729> too

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
to about nine pound and that's not too

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.280 
to about nine pound and that's not too
bad<00:04:48.880> if<00:04:49.090> you<00:04:49.180> think<00:04:49.360> there's<00:04:49.510> only<00:04:49.660> every<00:04:49.990> two

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
bad if you think there's only every two

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.650 
bad if you think there's only every two
months<00:04:50.470> instead<00:04:50.830> of<00:04:50.949> every<00:04:51.430> month<00:04:51.639> which<00:04:52.330> is

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
months instead of every month which is

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.200 
months instead of every month which is
pretty<00:04:53.050> good<00:04:53.260> pretty<00:04:53.440> manageable<00:04:53.910> sashy<00:04:54.910> for

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
pretty good pretty manageable sashy for

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.460 
pretty good pretty manageable sashy for
a<00:04:55.240> few<00:04:55.419> younger<00:04:55.570> I<00:04:55.720> think<00:04:55.960> this<00:04:56.050> is<00:04:56.110> actually<00:04:56.440> a

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
a few younger I think this is actually a

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.219 
a few younger I think this is actually a
really<00:04:56.650> great<00:04:57.070> idea<00:04:57.430> for<00:04:57.940> EM<00:04:58.360> like<00:04:58.900> younger

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
really great idea for EM like younger

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:00.840 
really great idea for EM like younger
generations<00:04:59.770> but<00:04:59.889> even<00:05:00.220> for<00:05:00.370> people<00:05:00.490> my<00:05:00.820> age

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
generations but even for people my age

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.969 
generations but even for people my age
because<00:05:01.270> I<00:05:01.419> would<00:05:01.720> still<00:05:01.990> use<00:05:02.199> the<00:05:02.710> stuff

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
because I would still use the stuff

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:05.129 
because I would still use the stuff
except<00:05:03.460> really<00:05:03.699> for<00:05:03.910> this<00:05:04.090> but<00:05:04.479> if<00:05:04.630> i<00:05:04.750> add<00:05:04.900> like

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:05.139 
except really for this but if i add like

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:07.740 
except really for this but if i add like
um<00:05:05.410> I<00:05:05.830> don't<00:05:06.789> know<00:05:06.940> like<00:05:07.120> it<00:05:07.240> may<00:05:07.600> be<00:05:07.660> a

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
um I don't know like it may be a

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:08.969 
um I don't know like it may be a
different<00:05:08.110> one<00:05:08.229> than<00:05:08.470> this<00:05:08.590> design<00:05:08.949> I

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
different one than this design I

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:11.040 
different one than this design I
probably<00:05:09.370> would<00:05:09.610> use<00:05:09.850> it<00:05:10.150> or<00:05:10.360> experiment<00:05:10.960> with

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
probably would use it or experiment with

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.890 
probably would use it or experiment with
it<00:05:11.110> anyway<00:05:11.500> so<00:05:12.400> yeah<00:05:13.000> I'm<00:05:13.360> really<00:05:13.690> really

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900
