00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.560
Hmmmm

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.080
It has good smell!

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.680
it's good!

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.880
That our fake Truffle chocolate was so good, but as good

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.700
That our guests, subscribes, could not figure out what it was made

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.020
if you have any guesses what this recipe is made comments down there

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:24.860
Do not waste time!

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.400
the only ingredient that they were able to identify was ...

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.020
It has, cocoa powder

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.100
I think it's that ...

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.800
Chocolate

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.150
Cocoa powder!

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.350
I do not know what else hahaha

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.810
but it is tasty

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.840
I do not know, I could only feel the cocoa

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.400
The Fake Food here has made savory recipes that seemed sweet

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.080
And they did that seemed salty sweet recipes

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.570
But this one looks sweet and is sweet!

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.480
this is really cool,
we are innovating our revenues

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.760
yes yes, it's getting increasingly difficult to identify

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.440
The basis of this recipe is made with sweet potatoes

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.460
You will only get a not very big potato.
An average

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.320
cut it into very small pieces

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.780
And take to cook until very tender

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.680
then you can crush with a potato kneading or you can use a fork also

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.160
Adds two tablespoons of brown sugar

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.080
A tablespoon cocoa powder

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.670
some cinnamon

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.400
a few drops of vanilla essence

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.060
and mix everything until a very dark mass

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.720
and then we can model our
truffles

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.200
just get a lot and make a ball

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.020
then just pass the cocoa powder

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.600
and then just put in a pretty package for truffles deceive everyone!

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.300
