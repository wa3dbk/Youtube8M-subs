00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.880
 hello in this video I show you one 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.370
 recipe to take care of ours 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.020
 face with a few simple ingredients but 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.400
 especially natural 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.410
 we're going to make a mask that has 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.840
 nourishing and slightly scrub properties 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.470
 anti ingredients to make it 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.940
 I'm a spoonful of honey in this 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.400
 case I used 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:33.290
 I'll use an acacia honey you can 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.140
 also use the millefiori medium 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.399
 spoon of yogurt 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.179
 make sure we are white in August 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:43.039
 possibly natural a tablespoon of 

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:45.499
 almond flour that will be the one 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:47.239
 will give us the cracking effect 

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:50.179
 almond brakes and the one you can 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.399
 use to make desserts in the kitchen 

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:53.989
 we also need a container for 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.469
 mix the ingredients and make the 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.510
 mask and a spoon to start 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.949
 towards the honey in my bowl can 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.620
 to be a spoon I already used it 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.960
 first and it will help us honey will help us to 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.880
 make the skin softer and 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.409
 above all it will also help us to keep 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.409
 together our mask 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:23.430
 then I add half a tablespoon of yogurt 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:26.910
 white yogurt has properties 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.320
 soothing and moisturizing 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.240
 however we must remember that it also plays 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.620
 of antibacterial functions once 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.850
 that we're going to wait on the face after 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.410
 having reached the first two ingredients 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.410
 I start mixing 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.700
 this then the compound we have 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.729
 obtained by mixing the yogurt well 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.590
 aniene and could already be used 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.299
 as a mask it is a little liquid 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.189
 so I usually go to add 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.049
 a bit of almond flour so me 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.670
 washable will be further not me 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:00.729
 also allows when I go to apply it 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.729
 to have a shielding effect on the face 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.610
 this then the compound we get 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.560
 I'll show you the consistency on 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.560
 hand like a little 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.010
 as you can see it does not flow and in the moment in 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.140
 which we are going to massage it makes an effect 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.640
 skim and of course you settle a little 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.850
 then also for the almond flour can 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.130
 can and want to put and you have to remember 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.720
 to wash your face well before 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.640
 apply the mask because you need to 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.190
 clean it well to remove 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.959
 all the impurities and remember 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.390
 especially to spread the mask 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.970
 even on the whole neck I usually have it 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.680
 I keep for 10 or 15 minutes and after that 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.459
 this time has passed to accept it with 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.959
 warm water 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.910
 this then our face mask 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.070
 made with honey and brakes yoghurt 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.640
 almonds I greet you and now I go to 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.640
 apply
