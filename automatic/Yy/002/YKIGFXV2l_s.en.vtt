my light here and then you get this
little<00:02:04.829> insert<00:02:05.280> here<00:02:05.670> which<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.090> basically

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
little insert here which is basically

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.570 
little insert here which is basically
same<00:02:07.409> things<00:02:07.649> we<00:02:07.770> got<00:02:07.920> on<00:02:08.009> all<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.250> other<00:02:08.369> toys

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
same things we got on all the other toys

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.510 
same things we got on all the other toys
and<00:02:09.509> then<00:02:09.660> we<00:02:10.080> have<00:02:10.259> this<00:02:10.739> now<00:02:10.979> this<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.310> the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
and then we have this now this is the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.030 
and then we have this now this is the
cheetah<00:02:11.910> tot

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
cheetah tot

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.259 
cheetah tot
and<00:02:13.129> I<00:02:13.189> think<00:02:13.459> this<00:02:13.610> is<00:02:13.760> like<00:02:13.909> a<00:02:13.939> refrigerator

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.240 
and I think this is like a refrigerator
magnet<00:02:14.959> just<00:02:15.110> it's<00:02:15.409> magnetized<00:02:15.950> on<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.159> back

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:19.720 
they're very cool and here is the ring
which<00:02:18.590> actually<00:02:18.920> glows<00:02:19.099> in<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.250> dark<00:02:19.340> oh<00:02:19.640> I

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
which actually glows in the dark oh I

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.539 
which actually glows in the dark oh I
