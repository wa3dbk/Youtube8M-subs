00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:43.830 

I

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.100 

there's<00:00:44.590> a7<00:00:45.160> tube<00:00:45.460> set<00:00:45.730> up<00:00:46.080> t304<00:00:47.080> stainless

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
there's a7 tube set up t304 stainless

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.470 
there's a7 tube set up t304 stainless
steel<00:00:47.620> tubes<00:00:47.890> and<00:00:48.160> tap<00:00:48.310> water<00:00:48.580> in<00:00:48.730> a<00:00:48.760> pasta<00:00:49.210> jar

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
steel tubes and tap water in a pasta jar

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.570 
steel tubes and tap water in a pasta jar
and<00:00:49.780> the<00:00:50.050> outside<00:00:50.410> tubes<00:00:50.710> if<00:00:51.250> you<00:00:51.340> have<00:00:51.430> one

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
and the outside tubes if you have one

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.950 
and the outside tubes if you have one
circle<00:00:51.970> in<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:52.120> middle<00:00:52.150> you<00:00:52.450> can<00:00:52.510> perfectly

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
circle in the middle you can perfectly

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.110 
circle in the middle you can perfectly
fit<00:00:53.200> six<00:00:53.500> around<00:00:53.800> it<00:00:54.010> meaning<00:00:54.400> all<00:00:54.610> outside

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
fit six around it meaning all outside

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.670 
fit six around it meaning all outside
tubes<00:00:55.330> are<00:00:55.510> touching<00:00:55.900> just<00:00:56.110> by<00:00:56.230> giving<00:00:56.410> one

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
tubes are touching just by giving one

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.490 
tubes are touching just by giving one
common<00:00:57.040> connection<00:00:57.309> and<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.870> the<00:00:59.110> outside

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
common connection and so the outside

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.689 
common connection and so the outside
tubes<00:00:59.800> I<00:01:00.070> have<00:01:01.350> positive<00:01:02.350> and<00:01:03.070> then<00:01:03.400> on<00:01:03.610> the

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
tubes I have positive and then on the

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.290 
tubes I have positive and then on the
inside<00:01:03.820> tubes<00:01:04.300> i<00:01:04.690> have<00:01:05.670> negative<00:01:06.670> hooked<00:01:07.119> up

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
inside tubes i have negative hooked up

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.390 
inside tubes i have negative hooked up
and<00:01:07.540> the<00:01:08.020> outside<00:01:08.320> tubes<00:01:08.650> are<00:01:08.800> connect<00:01:09.100> or<00:01:09.280> the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
and the outside tubes are connect or the

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.490 
and the outside tubes are connect or the
inside<00:01:09.640> tubes<00:01:09.940> are<00:01:10.060> connected<00:01:10.510> negative<00:01:11.229> and

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
inside tubes are connected negative and

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.780 
inside tubes are connected negative and
are<00:01:11.619> touching<00:01:11.920> each<00:01:12.010> other<00:01:12.220> with<00:01:12.369> that<00:01:12.460> copper

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
are touching each other with that copper

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:13.920 
are touching each other with that copper
wire<00:01:12.940> you<00:01:13.119> can<00:01:13.150> see<00:01:13.420> kind<00:01:13.540> of<00:01:13.630> wrapped<00:01:13.810> around

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
wire you can see kind of wrapped around

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.770 
wire you can see kind of wrapped around
those<00:01:14.550> which<00:01:15.550> car<00:01:15.760> back<00:01:15.940> so<00:01:16.060> it's<00:01:16.180> black<00:01:16.450> with

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
those which car back so it's black with

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.410 
those which car back so it's black with
it<00:01:17.170> unless<00:01:17.470> absorbing<00:01:17.920> something<00:01:18.310> but<00:01:18.520> and

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
it unless absorbing something but and

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.719 
it unless absorbing something but and
then<00:01:20.050> I've<00:01:20.470> got<00:01:20.530> at<00:01:20.770> the<00:01:20.830> very<00:01:21.009> bottom<00:01:21.160> you<00:01:21.700> can

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
then I've got at the very bottom you can

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.359 
then I've got at the very bottom you can
see<00:01:21.880> that<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:22.869> luck<00:01:23.410> the<00:01:23.649> middle<00:01:23.920> tubes<00:01:24.220> are

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
see that the luck the middle tubes are

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.040 
see that the luck the middle tubes are
bloggers<00:01:24.580> and<00:01:24.970> so<00:01:25.270> are<00:01:25.570> sticking<00:01:25.899> out<00:01:26.020> a

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
bloggers and so are sticking out a

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.540 
bloggers and so are sticking out a
little<00:01:26.080> bit<00:01:26.320> that<00:01:26.560> way<00:01:26.710> there's<00:01:26.950> space<00:01:27.520> for

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
little bit that way there's space for

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.430 
little bit that way there's space for
water<00:01:28.090> to<00:01:28.270> get<00:01:28.420> up<00:01:28.630> in<00:01:28.810> there<00:01:28.960> and<00:01:29.050> get<00:01:29.140> sucked

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
water to get up in there and get sucked

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.560 
water to get up in there and get sucked
up<00:01:29.590> into<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:29.950> tube<00:01:30.160> while<00:01:31.030> it's<00:01:31.180> producing

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
up into the tube while it's producing

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.050 
up into the tube while it's producing
gas<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:32.830> power<00:01:33.040> supply<00:01:33.250> is<00:01:33.460> this<00:01:34.060> variable<00:01:35.050> AC

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
gas the power supply is this variable AC

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.180 
gas the power supply is this variable AC

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
on is coming out this cord going to that

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:48.389 
on is coming out this cord going to that
power<00:01:47.080> cord<00:01:47.380> which<00:01:47.560> I<00:01:47.649> cut<00:01:47.890> off<00:01:48.009> at<00:01:48.160> the<00:01:48.190> end

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
power cord which I cut off at the end

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.430 
power cord which I cut off at the end
and<00:01:48.610> I<00:01:48.670> just<00:01:48.819> connected<00:01:49.060> it<00:01:49.360> to<00:01:49.569> a<00:01:49.720> bridge<00:01:50.410> here

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
and I just connected it to a bridge here

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.999 
and I just connected it to a bridge here
and<00:01:50.890> so<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:52.390> positive<00:01:52.959> on<00:01:53.110> the<00:01:53.229> bridge<00:01:53.440> is

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
and so the positive on the bridge is

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.660 
and so the positive on the bridge is
going<00:01:54.450> into<00:01:55.450> this<00:01:56.100> cord<00:01:57.100> here<00:01:57.340> which<00:01:57.490> goes

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
going into this cord here which goes

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.919 
going into this cord here which goes
into<00:01:57.819> this<00:01:57.910> ant<00:01:58.209> meter<00:01:58.420> and<00:01:59.340> the<00:02:00.390> output<00:02:01.390> on

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
into this ant meter and the output on

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:08.330 
into this ant meter and the output on
the<00:02:01.959> at<00:02:02.140> mater<00:02:02.580> is<00:02:03.580> going<00:02:04.450> to<00:02:04.899> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.089 

positive<00:02:09.300> which<00:02:09.989> eventually<00:02:10.590> comes<00:02:10.950> right

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
positive which eventually comes right

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.500 
positive which eventually comes right
here<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.340> just<00:02:11.489> clips<00:02:11.700> onto<00:02:11.879> that<00:02:12.060> band<00:02:12.300> that

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
here and just clips onto that band that

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.550 
here and just clips onto that band that
I<00:02:12.569> have<00:02:13.010> wrapped<00:02:14.010> around<00:02:14.129> those<00:02:14.430> tubes<00:02:15.030> and

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
I have wrapped around those tubes and

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.990 
I have wrapped around those tubes and
the<00:02:18.140> negative<00:02:19.140> is<00:02:19.440> just<00:02:19.709> click<00:02:20.250> there<00:02:20.519> at<00:02:20.910> the

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
the negative is just click there at the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.729 
the negative is just click there at the
top<00:02:21.260> right<00:02:22.260> there<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:23.459> so<00:02:24.319> on<00:02:25.319> my<00:02:25.440> major<00:02:25.590> two

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
top right there and so on my major two

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:26.990 
top right there and so on my major two
bolts<00:02:26.069> and<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.280> can<00:02:26.400> see<00:02:26.549> that<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.760> voltage

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
bolts and you can see that the voltage

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.729 
bolts and you can see that the voltage
right<00:02:27.390> here<00:02:27.750> is<00:02:28.489> 1.3<00:02:29.489> for<00:02:30.030> three<00:02:30.629> volts<00:02:31.440> drop<00:02:31.620> a

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
right here is 1.3 for three volts drop a

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.920 
right here is 1.3 for three volts drop a
little<00:02:32.040> bit<00:02:32.129> added<00:02:32.459> on<00:02:32.549> for<00:02:32.760> second<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.269> so

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
little bit added on for second and so

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.539 
little bit added on for second and so
even<00:02:34.379> if<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.530> take<00:02:34.709> these<00:02:34.830> tubes<00:02:35.099> out<00:02:35.280> once

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
even if you take these tubes out once

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.449 
even if you take these tubes out once
your<00:02:35.700> condition<00:02:36.269> and<00:02:36.769> drain<00:02:37.769> the<00:02:37.860> water<00:02:38.010> put

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
your condition and drain the water put

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.270 
your condition and drain the water put
them<00:02:38.549> back<00:02:38.700> into<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.239> water<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.470> measure<00:02:41.130> the

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
them back into the water and measure the

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.890 
them back into the water and measure the
voltage<00:02:41.400> without<00:02:41.880> doing<00:02:42.120> anything<00:02:42.329> it<00:02:42.780> will

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
voltage without doing anything it will

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.300 
voltage without doing anything it will
automatically<00:02:43.290> have<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.500> voltage<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:44.099> so<00:02:44.220> the

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
automatically have a voltage and so the

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.400 
automatically have a voltage and so the
conditioning<00:02:44.760> process<00:02:45.000> gives<00:02:45.750> an<00:02:45.900> inherent

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
conditioning process gives an inherent

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.979 
conditioning process gives an inherent
negative<00:02:46.980> potential<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:48.329> the<00:02:48.450> negative<00:02:48.630> tube

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
negative potential to the negative tube

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.479 
negative potential to the negative tube
and<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.200> positive<00:02:49.620> potential<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.250> positive

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
and a positive potential to the positive

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.069 
and a positive potential to the positive
tubes<00:02:50.970> below<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:52.049> a<00:02:52.079> high<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.640> so<00:02:54.079> anyway

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
tubes below and a high and so anyway

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.979 
tubes below and a high and so anyway
I'll<00:02:55.230> go<00:02:55.349> ahead<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.530> turn<00:02:55.739> it<00:02:55.860> on<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:57.650> you<00:02:58.650> can

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
I'll go ahead and turn it on and you can

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.539 
I'll go ahead and turn it on and you can
see<00:03:00.989> what's<00:03:01.200> going<00:03:01.260> on<00:03:01.590> here<00:03:04.190> Saul<00:03:05.190> seven

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
see what's going on here Saul seven

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:11.890 
see what's going on here Saul seven
tubes<00:03:05.790> connected<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.810> being<00:03:08.810> conditioned

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.280 

and<00:03:12.790> right<00:03:13.790> now<00:03:13.970> it's<00:03:14.120> reading<00:03:14.480> this<00:03:15.019> is<00:03:15.260> a

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
and right now it's reading this is a

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.009 
and right now it's reading this is a
this<00:03:16.250> on<00:03:16.400> a<00:03:16.430> 10<00:03:16.670> out<00:03:16.819> scale<00:03:17.150> but<00:03:17.599> it's<00:03:17.720> halved

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
this on a 10 out scale but it's halved

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:26.500 
this on a 10 out scale but it's halved
and<00:03:19.930> so<00:03:21.250> that's<00:03:22.250> two<00:03:22.640> apps<00:03:22.849> at<00:03:24.519> 4.7<00:03:25.519> 4<00:03:25.970> volts

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
and so that's two apps at 4.7 4 volts

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.530 
and so that's two apps at 4.7 4 volts
and<00:03:27.370> you<00:03:28.370> know<00:03:28.489> that<00:03:28.760> is<00:03:28.909> really<00:03:29.150> was<00:03:29.269> leaving

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
and you know that is really was leaving

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.589 
and you know that is really was leaving
a<00:03:29.599> power<00:03:29.750> supply<00:03:29.930> because<00:03:30.230> if<00:03:30.349> i<00:03:30.439> turn<00:03:30.500> it<00:03:30.799> off

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
a power supply because if i turn it off

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.110 
a power supply because if i turn it off
voltz<00:03:32.599> starts<00:03:33.409> going<00:03:33.650> down<00:03:33.799> and<00:03:34.129> ass<00:03:34.340> off<00:03:34.760> in

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
voltz starts going down and ass off in

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.030 
voltz starts going down and ass off in
this<00:03:35.200> no<00:03:36.200> more<00:03:36.349> gas<00:03:36.530> production<00:03:36.920> and<00:03:37.540> so<00:03:39.040> you

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
this no more gas production and so you

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.610 
this no more gas production and so you
can<00:03:40.159> see<00:03:40.310> when<00:03:40.459> I<00:03:40.489> turn<00:03:41.060> it<00:03:41.180> on<00:03:41.299> amps<00:03:42.230> just<00:03:42.439> went

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
can see when I turn it on amps just went

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.369 
can see when I turn it on amps just went
up<00:03:42.769> into<00:03:42.920> voltage<00:03:43.129> is<00:03:43.430> climbing<00:03:44.049> and<00:03:45.819> so

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:47.379 
up into voltage is climbing and so

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.559 
up into voltage is climbing and so
that's<00:03:48.379> less<00:03:48.590> than<00:03:48.620> 5<00:03:48.950> volts<00:03:49.340> x<00:03:49.579> 2<00:03:49.819> amps<00:03:50.180> so

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
that's less than 5 volts x 2 amps so

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:57.640 
that's less than 5 volts x 2 amps so
that's<00:03:50.720> less<00:03:50.870> than<00:03:50.900> 10<00:03:51.200> watts<00:03:51.470> to<00:03:51.769> do<00:03:51.889> this<00:03:56.650> so

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
that's less than 10 watts to do this so

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.750 
that's less than 10 watts to do this so
