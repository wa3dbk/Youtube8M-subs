a<00:02:16.550> lot<00:02:16.850> of<00:02:17.030> cash<00:02:17.210> that<00:02:17.570> comes<00:02:17.900> from<00:02:18.140> that

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
a lot of cash that comes from that

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.790 
a lot of cash that comes from that
probably<00:02:18.620> both<00:02:18.830> one<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.430> ten<00:02:19.670> grand<00:02:23.770> so<00:02:24.770> I

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
probably both one to ten grand so I

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.150 
probably both one to ten grand so I
think<00:02:25.010> it's<00:02:25.280> actually<00:02:25.400> 10<00:02:25.820> grand<00:02:26.210> each<00:02:27.160> truck

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
think it's actually 10 grand each truck

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.220 
think it's actually 10 grand each truck
you<00:02:29.030> can<00:02:29.210> keep<00:02:29.450> getting<00:02:29.600> trucks<00:02:30.850> and<00:02:31.850> then

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
you can keep getting trucks and then

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:42.400 
you can keep getting trucks and then
grab<00:02:33.230> an<00:02:33.470> NRG<00:02:40.030> this<00:02:41.030> is<00:02:41.180> on<00:02:41.330> an<00:02:41.450> Xbox<00:02:41.630> 360

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
grab an NRG this is on an Xbox 360

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:59.559 
grab an NRG this is on an Xbox 360
tivity<00:02:42.739> you<00:02:42.860> can<00:02:43.010> do<00:02:43.100> it<00:02:43.190> on<00:02:43.310> any<00:02:43.550> of<00:02:43.610> them

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.610
