with some of your friends and to see how

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.380 
with some of your friends and to see how
the<00:00:52.739> deck<00:00:53.070> does<00:00:53.309> before<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.940> actually<00:00:54.120> build

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
the deck does before you actually build

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.389 
the deck does before you actually build
it<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.690> real<00:00:54.989> life<00:00:55.020> or<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.890> know<00:00:56.010> maybe<00:00:56.039> you

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
it in real life or you know maybe you

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.799 
it in real life or you know maybe you
won't<00:00:56.640> even<00:00:56.879> decide<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.329> play<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.629> online

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
won't even decide to play it online

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.410 
won't even decide to play it online
because<00:00:58.140> it's<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.559> bad<00:00:58.800> but<00:00:59.489> yeah<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.239> gives

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
because it's so bad but yeah it gives

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.510 
because it's so bad but yeah it gives
you<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> way<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.379> understand<00:01:02.010> how<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.219> deck

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
you a way to understand how the deck

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.509 
you a way to understand how the deck
plays<00:01:02.850> because<00:01:03.210> without<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:04.110> reference<00:01:04.650> or<00:01:05.309> you

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
plays because without a reference or you

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.219 
plays because without a reference or you
know<00:01:05.670> applying<00:01:06.330> against<00:01:06.600> someone<00:01:07.080> that's

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
know applying against someone that's

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.539 
know applying against someone that's
playing<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.590> deck<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.950> might<00:01:08.100> not<00:01:08.220> know<00:01:08.400> how

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
playing that deck you might not know how

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.039 
playing that deck you might not know how
the<00:01:08.610> deck<00:01:08.820> plays<00:01:09.030> at<00:01:09.210> all<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.659> think<00:01:09.840> that

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
the deck plays at all and I think that

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.750 
the deck plays at all and I think that
you<00:01:10.409> know<00:01:10.530> net<00:01:10.710> decking<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.130> fine<00:01:11.369> if<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.729> just

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
because I made my deck a little bit

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.130 
because I made my deck a little bit
different<00:02:53.850> I<00:02:53.910> mean<00:02:54.030> I<00:02:54.090> mean<00:02:54.240> that<00:02:54.420> tragoedia's

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
so you know I had a decent amount of

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.030 
so you know I had a decent amount of
dark<00:02:57.030> counts<00:02:57.360> and<00:02:57.510> turn<00:02:58.440> grant<00:02:58.590> at<00:02:58.740> one<00:02:58.860> point

car<00:03:04.500> was<00:03:04.680> illegal<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.340> believe<00:03:05.660> because<00:03:06.660> torrid

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
car was illegal I believe because torrid

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.510 
car was illegal I believe because torrid
sang<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.410> was<00:03:07.530> just<00:03:07.680> it<00:03:07.800> was<00:03:07.860> too<00:03:08.070> good<00:03:08.100> you

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
sang it was just it was too good you

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.650 
sang it was just it was too good you
could<00:03:08.610> search<00:03:08.820> out<00:03:08.940> for<00:03:09.120> any<00:03:09.240> that<00:03:09.450> land

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
could search out for any that land

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.950 
could search out for any that land
Kansas<00:03:10.020> and<00:03:10.080> Bigelow<00:03:10.410> was<00:03:10.560> game<00:03:10.770> right<00:03:11.930> but<00:03:12.930> I

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
Kansas and Bigelow was game right but I

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.400 
Kansas and Bigelow was game right but I
do<00:03:13.290> also<00:03:13.380> want<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:14.130> mention<00:03:14.550> that<00:03:15.410> just

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
do also want to mention that just

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.410 
do also want to mention that just
because<00:03:16.680> you<00:03:16.890> a<00:03:16.920> copy<00:03:17.520> a<00:03:17.670> deck<00:03:17.940> doesn't<00:03:18.180> mean

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
because you a copy a deck doesn't mean

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.870 
because you a copy a deck doesn't mean
that<00:03:18.600> it's<00:03:18.840> going<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.260> do<00:03:19.470> that<00:03:20.130> well<00:03:20.550> because

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
that it's going to do that well because

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.370 
that it's going to do that well because
you<00:03:21.120> know<00:03:21.150> that<00:03:21.360> other<00:03:21.510> player<00:03:21.780> like<00:03:22.350> I

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
you know that other player like I

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.870 
you know that other player like I
mentioned<00:03:22.590> before<00:03:22.739> could<00:03:23.370> just<00:03:23.520> know<00:03:23.670> the

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
mentioned before could just know the

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.280 
mentioned before could just know the
deck<00:03:24.000> a<00:03:24.030> little<00:03:24.209> bit<00:03:24.420> better<00:03:24.600> than<00:03:24.870> you<00:03:25.050> but

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
deck a little bit better than you but

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.530 
deck a little bit better than you but
the<00:03:25.709> main<00:03:25.860> idea<00:03:26.040> with<00:03:26.459> this<00:03:26.640> is<00:03:26.880> just<00:03:27.330> to<00:03:27.390> have

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
the main idea with this is just to have

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.180 
the main idea with this is just to have
fun<00:03:27.720> and<00:03:28.110> you<00:03:28.170> experiment<00:03:29.010> with<00:03:29.070> things

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
fun and you experiment with things

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.160 
fun and you experiment with things
because<00:03:29.730> if<00:03:29.940> you<00:03:30.510> you<00:03:30.690> know<00:03:30.720> just<00:03:30.959> copy

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
because if you you know just copy

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.750 
because if you you know just copy
someone<00:03:31.560> else's<00:03:31.620> deck<00:03:32.040> you<00:03:32.340> won't<00:03:32.520> you<00:03:32.730> know

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
car to a certain time because they'll

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.420 
car to a certain time because they'll
know<00:04:58.199> that<00:04:58.229> okay<00:04:58.710> that<00:04:58.860> base<00:04:59.039> down<00:04:59.219> is

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430

probably<00:04:59.759> treacherous<00:05:00.419> crap<00:05:00.629> pole<00:05:00.810> because

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
probably treacherous crap pole because

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.200 
probably treacherous crap pole because
that's<00:05:01.139> the<00:05:01.229> only<00:05:01.259> trap<00:05:02.069> card<00:05:02.310> that<00:05:02.460> that<00:05:02.639> you

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
that's the only trap card that that you

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.510 
that's the only trap card that that you
know<00:05:03.240> top<00:05:03.539> ycs<00:05:03.990> deck<00:05:04.169> plate<00:05:04.409> and<00:05:04.680> so<00:05:05.250> you<00:05:05.310> know

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
know top ycs deck plate and so you know

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.550 
know top ycs deck plate and so you know
it's<00:05:05.789> kind<00:05:06.240> of<00:05:06.300> a<00:05:06.389> disadvantage<00:05:06.780> in<00:05:07.110> one<00:05:07.319> sense

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
it's kind of a disadvantage in one sense

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.320 
it's kind of a disadvantage in one sense
but<00:05:07.710> it<00:05:08.039> is<00:05:08.310> an<00:05:08.460> advantage<00:05:08.789> because<00:05:08.969> it's<00:05:09.240> you

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
but it is an advantage because it's you

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.760 
but it is an advantage because it's you
know<00:05:09.419> it's<00:05:09.449> been<00:05:09.690> played<00:05:09.930> tested<00:05:10.289> over<00:05:10.469> and

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
know it's been played tested over and

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.230 
know it's been played tested over and
over<00:05:10.919> to<00:05:11.159> the<00:05:11.190> point<00:05:11.430> where<00:05:11.610> the<00:05:11.940> deck<00:05:12.090> is

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
over to the point where the deck is

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.670 
over to the point where the deck is
really<00:05:12.449> consistent<00:05:12.960> if<00:05:13.050> that<00:05:13.199> makes<00:05:13.379> sense<00:05:13.530> to

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
really consistent if that makes sense to

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.709 
really consistent if that makes sense to
you<00:05:13.770> guys<00:05:13.919> but<00:05:14.129> like<00:05:14.520> i<00:05:14.550> said<00:05:14.639> overall<00:05:15.479> just
