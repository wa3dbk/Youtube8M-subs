 mainly a daily video not 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.660
 always since there are daily exceptions that 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.800
 You can not do it for personal reasons but 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.930
 well almost always you have the video 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.239
 daily and then on weekends their 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.129
 two videos every day every Saturday 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.860
 as Sunday 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.689
 are two videos of call of duty that 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.939
 It is what most people ask me and what 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:14.270
 more flame and another of any other game 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:16.579
 since I have many games and good and so 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.770
 not between the monotony always of the 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:22.070
 same call of duty game and between the 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.049
 five days during the week 4 you have call of 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.950
 duty and another day you will have any other 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.539

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.310
 moment what I have uploaded is 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.159
 mainly that happens through my channel what 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.770
 You will see mainly call of duty this 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.920
 all or three videos that are far cry and 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.750
 two other zombies because as of 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.880
 moment as I just started and we are not 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.340
 many on my channel I do not want to upload another 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.929
 game until we're not more and I 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.840
 go asking people but I 'm telling you 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.399
 that I have many games and so on 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.729
 of having call of duty that I know what 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.679
 more like you can have see other games 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.000
 and I know if you have some money 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.220
 but have saved or god wants it 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.520
 spend some game well look I'm that 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.929
 opportunity for you to see another game and 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.390
 apart it gives me the opportunity to 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.399
 upload more things and as I said before 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.830
 in monotony and good now I'm going to 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.140
 explain how I upload the items in their 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.200
 high definition since you recorded with the hd 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.670
 pvr and the audio quite pretty well already 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.590
 that I have with a micro that is quite 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.380
 good and when I achieved with that micro a 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.100
 double I do not know how to speak or record with the 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:31.250
 turtle bitch placed about audio 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.490
 image you are going to have the best thing that is 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.430
 can have or what I think we're going 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.960
 and well my way is a few games 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.580
 I have many games at the moment in live 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.990
 but I'm already starting to do like 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.990
 because it has improved the hard disk of 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.670
 computer and you will have serious games 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.560
 that you have to have games and how they are 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.680
 in this case they are departures 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.210
 important but then I love him too 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.040
 add to most of the games a 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.250
 touch of humor because to me always 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.100
 I personally liked a game 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.650
 and male to laugh has made my day and 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.030
 that more than cheers now you and 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.450
 well I do not have much gameplay left and 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.670
 caught a short and intense gameplay for 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.460
 do not get bored those long ones 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.250
 sometimes bored but give me time 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.380

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.120

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.400

 I'm going to do it good there's always 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.450
 some exceptions things that are 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.879
 to pass is not going out you understand me 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.769
