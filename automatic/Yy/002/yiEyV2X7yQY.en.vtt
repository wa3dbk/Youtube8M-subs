00:00:19.772 --> 00:00:22.712
 Tears were crying until the sun rose again 

00:00:23.285 --> 00:00:28.286
 All the nights, it felt like the end 

00:00:29.145 --> 00:00:32.788
 But I'm breathing, I'm here 

00:00:34.476 --> 00:00:37.717
 So together we left the peace 

00:00:37.872 --> 00:00:43.159
 Start from before and fire again 

00:00:43.988 --> 00:00:47.623
 But I'm breathing, I'm here 

00:00:49.124 --> 00:00:52.445
 We can break so easily 

00:00:52.606 --> 00:00:56.966
 Because we are human only 

00:00:58.798 --> 00:01:02.084
 On the surface, on the surface 

00:01:02.304 --> 00:01:03.554
 We are 

00:01:03.614 --> 00:01:07.344
 As a beginning, we fall heartily hard 

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:11.993
 But we are proud of all our scars 

00:01:13.565 --> 00:01:17.306
 Because it's valuable, it's valuable 

00:01:17.426 --> 00:01:19.945
 For love 

00:01:40.618 --> 00:01:44.386
 Build the walls as a shelter to hide 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:50.465
 Everything cuts off the look in your eyes 

00:01:50.465 --> 00:01:53.012
 And I breathe in, the wind. 

00:01:55.602 --> 00:01:59.156
 Maybe I'm standing on the edge of a cliff 

00:01:59.183 --> 00:02:03.818
 But the price is a moment of this 

00:02:05.237 --> 00:02:08.783
 Because I'm in breath, the wind 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:20.150
 (Ooooo) 

00:02:39.898 --> 00:02:43.136
 We can break so easily, 

00:02:43.191 --> 00:02:48.367
 Because we are human only 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:54.000
 On the surface, on the surface, we are 

00:02:54.596 --> 00:02:58.169
 As a beginning, we fall heartily hard 

00:02:58.198 --> 00:03:03.009
 But we are proud of all our scars 

00:03:04.102 --> 00:03:07.957
 Because it's valuable, it's valuable 

00:03:07.998 --> 00:03:11.128
 For love 

00:03:27.786 --> 00:03:32.210
