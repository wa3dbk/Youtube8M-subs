of<00:01:56.970> now<00:01:57.179> that<00:01:57.450> may<00:01:57.630> take<00:01:57.899> four<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.649> five<00:01:58.860> days

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
of now that may take four to five days

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.660 
of now that may take four to five days
to<00:01:59.190> harvest<00:02:01.009> my<00:02:02.009> favorite<00:02:02.340> part<00:02:02.550> of<00:02:02.610> the

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
to harvest my favorite part of the

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.790 
to harvest my favorite part of the
harvest<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:03.119> guess<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.509> it's<00:02:04.229> your<00:02:04.380> whole<00:02:04.530> years

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
harvest I guess is it's your whole years

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.980 
harvest I guess is it's your whole years
worth<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:05.160> work<00:02:05.220> so<00:02:05.640> once<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.240> crop<00:02:06.539> is<00:02:06.810> off

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
worth of work so once this crop is off

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.210 
worth of work so once this crop is off
we're<00:02:07.229> already<00:02:07.410> starting<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.800> look<00:02:07.890> at<00:02:08.100> what

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
we're already starting to look at what

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.620 
we're already starting to look at what
next<00:02:08.489> year's<00:02:08.670> crop<00:02:08.910> looks<00:02:09.149> like<00:02:09.360> with<00:02:09.539> your

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
next year's crop looks like with your

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.740 
next year's crop looks like with your
upright<00:02:10.970> people<00:02:11.970> think<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.329> cranberries

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
upright people think the cranberries

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.720 
upright people think the cranberries
grow<00:02:12.780> in<00:02:13.110> water<00:02:13.350> all<00:02:13.590> season<00:02:14.070> long<00:02:14.250> but<00:02:14.549> the
