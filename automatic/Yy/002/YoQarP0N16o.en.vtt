00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
but strangely enough I've never been on

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.799 
but strangely enough I've never been on
the<00:00:33.899> podium<00:00:34.050> there<00:00:34.379> it's<00:00:34.769> I<00:00:35.430> don't<00:00:36.239> know<00:00:36.360> why<00:00:36.540> I

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
the podium there it's I don't know why I

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.619 
the podium there it's I don't know why I
love<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.260> circuit<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.800> bike<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.370> feel<00:00:39.300> we<00:00:39.480> need

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
love the circuit the bike I feel we need

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.060 
love the circuit the bike I feel we need
to<00:00:39.660> make<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.930> lot<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.140> progress<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.769> side<00:00:40.980> of

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
to make a lot of progress on the side of

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.240 
to make a lot of progress on the side of
the<00:00:41.129> tire<00:00:41.309> there<00:00:41.870> and<00:00:42.870> it's<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.110> tactic<00:00:43.890> or<00:00:43.980> it's

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
the tire there and it's a tactic or it's

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.119 
the tire there and it's a tactic or it's
not<00:00:44.370> necessarily<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.750> ride<00:00:45.960> 22<00:00:46.470> laps<00:00:46.680> as<00:00:46.890> fast

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
not necessarily you ride 22 laps as fast

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.430 
not necessarily you ride 22 laps as fast
as<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.400> can<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.790> have<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.149> be<00:00:48.300> quite<00:00:48.600> tactical

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
as you can you have to be quite tactical

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.369 
as you can you have to be quite tactical
and<00:00:49.620> think<00:00:50.519> about<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.059> last<00:00:51.300> relapse<00:00:51.720> so<00:00:52.079> from

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
and think about the last relapse so from

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.530 
and think about the last relapse so from
that<00:00:52.500> point<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.829> view<00:00:52.890> it's<00:00:53.360> you<00:00:54.360> need<00:00:54.510> a

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
that point of view it's you need a

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.229 
that point of view it's you need a
perfect<00:00:55.019> package<00:00:55.199> underneath<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.979> and<00:00:56.239> you

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
perfect package underneath you and you

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.090 
perfect package underneath you and you
know<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.360> just<00:00:58.049> missed<00:00:58.290> her<00:00:58.409> in<00:00:58.439> the<00:00:58.619> podium<00:00:59.010> I

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
know I just missed her in the podium I

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.460 
know I just missed her in the podium I
think<00:00:59.339> four<00:00:59.549> years<00:00:59.580> ago<00:00:59.970> there<00:01:00.210> but<00:01:00.540> then<00:01:00.930> it

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 
think four years ago there but then it

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.840 
think four years ago there but then it
would<00:01:01.559> be<00:01:01.619> nice<00:01:01.799> it's<00:01:01.979> almost<00:01:02.220> like<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> second

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
would be nice it's almost like a second

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.240 
would be nice it's almost like a second

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.940 
season even longer on highways it's also
very<00:01:48.530> challenging<00:01:48.650> tracker<00:01:49.570> is<00:01:50.740> so<00:01:51.740> so

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
very challenging tracker is so so

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.040 
very challenging tracker is so so
difficult<00:01:52.240> Phillip<00:01:53.240> Island<00:01:53.360> is<00:01:53.630> never<00:01:53.870> about

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
at the end of the race it's all about

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.080 
at the end of the race it's all about
the<00:01:58.430> last<00:01:58.580> four<00:01:58.910> or<00:01:59.030> five<00:01:59.210> five<00:01:59.480> laps<00:01:59.950> and

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
the last four or five five laps and

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.730 
the last four or five five laps and
being<00:02:02.090> at<00:02:02.300> the<00:02:02.360> first<00:02:02.600> round<00:02:03.140> of<00:02:03.260> the<00:02:03.350> season

being at the first round of the season

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.260 
being at the first round of the season
that<00:02:03.890> even<00:02:04.340> makes<00:02:04.490> it<00:02:04.580> more<00:02:04.640> difficult<00:02:04.910> but

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
that even makes it more difficult but

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.150 
that even makes it more difficult but
we're<00:02:05.570> still<00:02:05.810> basically<00:02:06.440> setting<00:02:06.950> up<00:02:07.070> the

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
we're still basically setting up the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.010 
we're still basically setting up the
machine<00:02:07.280> store

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
machine store

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.199 
machine store
the<00:02:08.200> development<00:02:08.679> parts<00:02:08.979> have<00:02:09.250> to<00:02:09.399> do<00:02:09.550> it<00:02:09.700> and

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
the development parts have to do it and

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.790 
the development parts have to do it and
could<00:02:10.509> in<00:02:10.569> the<00:02:10.630> first<00:02:10.840> round<00:02:11.110> to<00:02:11.200> attract

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
could in the first round to attract

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.400 
could in the first round to attract
which<00:02:12.459> is<00:02:12.640> dead<00:02:12.849> heavy<00:02:13.060> on<00:02:13.300> mom<00:02:13.569> on<00:02:13.870> tires<00:02:14.170> is

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
which is dead heavy on mom on tires is

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.860 
which is dead heavy on mom on tires is
even<00:02:14.680> more<00:02:14.800> challenging
