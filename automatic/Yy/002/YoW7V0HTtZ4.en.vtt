it is going to be a great workhorse for

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.390 
it is going to be a great workhorse for
my<00:02:38.310> photography<00:02:39.090> kit<00:02:39.500> that<00:02:40.500> is<00:02:40.739> all<00:02:41.069> that<00:02:41.280> is

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
my photography kit that is all that is

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.870 
my photography kit that is all that is
included<00:02:41.580> in<00:02:42.030> this<00:02:42.720> box<00:02:43.110> we'll<00:02:43.440> take<00:02:43.709> this<00:02:44.459> box

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
included in this box we'll take this box

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.360 
included in this box we'll take this box
aside<00:02:45.300> leave<00:02:45.989> the<00:02:46.260> camera<00:02:46.680> there<00:02:46.830> actually

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
aside leave the camera there actually

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.850 
aside leave the camera there actually
move<00:02:47.549> it<00:02:47.730> back<00:02:48.360> here<00:02:48.750> then<00:02:48.959> let's<00:02:49.230> get<00:02:49.380> into

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
move it back here then let's get into

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:56.570 
move it back here then let's get into

the EF 24 to 70 millimeter F 2.8 l ii
usm<00:02:56.880> lens<00:02:57.209> I<00:02:57.739> opted<00:02:58.739> to<00:02:58.769> get<00:02:58.890> this<00:02:59.130> lens<00:02:59.459> over

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
usm lens I opted to get this lens over

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.930 
usm lens I opted to get this lens over
the<00:03:00.000> is<00:03:00.420> lens<00:03:00.720> because<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.170> believe<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:01.590> the

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
the is lens because I believe that the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.140 
the is lens because I believe that the
lower<00:03:02.940> f-stop<00:03:03.720> will<00:03:04.080> be<00:03:04.260> better<00:03:04.819> over<00:03:05.819> the

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
lower f-stop will be better over the

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.800 
lower f-stop will be better over the
image<00:03:06.660> stabilization<00:03:07.319> so<00:03:08.239> let's<00:03:09.239> crack<00:03:09.630> in

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
image stabilization so let's crack in

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.420 
image stabilization so let's crack in
this<00:03:09.900> puppy<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.290> was<00:03:10.380> just<00:03:10.680> released<00:03:10.980> -<00:03:11.250> so
