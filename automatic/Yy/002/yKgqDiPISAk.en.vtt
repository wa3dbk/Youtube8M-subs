 hello in the description 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.570
 channel subscribers and viewers with you loki 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.020
 we continue a career for Borussia and 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.180
 last episode I'm sorry wrong what 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.039
 said that we have Hamburg in second place 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.529
 we Hoffenheim in second place and 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.109
 hamburg on the sixth principle on with them 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.960
 the same number of points and today we 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.730
 meet our former goalkeeper 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.969
 who sold out hamburg 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:47.329
 well and let's get to cloudy weather 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:49.309
 friends play at home today and need 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.809
 earn points 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.780
 I start each episode with the same thing 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.410
 same guys but you know i noticed that in 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:03.120
 career often happens so if you 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.810
 miss 1 then the computer rebuilds 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.900
 completely his game as if he had not played 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:13.909
 so that he does not get up at the beginning of the match but 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:19.619
 if you missed first then 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:21.000
 it is very hard to score and it is not 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.220
 depends generally on some commands 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.810
 you play with weak strong strong 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.990
 teams by the way easier to play because 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.090
 they often run to the attack they can 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.420
 catch 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.820
 ok now we have the match borussia 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.680
 hoffenheim hamburg 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:45.060
 I read them all the second time already confusing and 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.860
 here and so the first goal Olich knocks 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.000
 nothing foreshadowed us on the left foot 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:54.970
 woes but here 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:04.290
 the gate rushed in one direction the ball rushed 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:07.990
 another good royce but again loss 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:12.310
 loss again which I don't know what 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:15.000
 happens to footballers but kids 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.000
 some mistakes 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:35.730
 and 20 but I don't understand what's happening with 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:35.730
 our team walker memphis depay 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.130
 get it off 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.080
 yes why not obama i ngu that feeling 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.380
 that the players both want themselves and 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:56.239
 play there is such a feeling that 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:58.010
 we have no control over it 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:03.980
 most Iancu reason he passes on 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:06.830
 far flank royce da first half bye 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:11.690
 that we guys lose two points 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:13.250
 Hamburg two goals well though on strikes if 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.910
 look then they have much much 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.510
 more hits 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.510
 Well, we continue 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.630
 legalon obameyang 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.450
 Kagawa and here pulls out goalkeeper 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:45.730
 here is a penalty dangerous free kick 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:49.190
 Marco Royce at the sword 27 meters to the gate 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:55.550
 marco royce run kick and dead 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:58.690
 the goalkeeper takes this ball to where these groove and 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:04.940
 Kagawa scratched 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:08.210
 need to score goals 1 eat take ball hey 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:11.170
 let's run 1 have hands 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.170
 there is still time 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.590
 there is still powder in the old dog I think 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:29.830
 Obama Yanka and offside 20 minutes to the end 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.860
 a shot on goal is already gundogan 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:43.910
 punched so let ka know what 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:48.080
 replacements instead of gundogan we will 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:53.630
 shahin kampale will place on ingal on 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:58.389
 and instead of royce ramos will come out let them 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.389
 so here we go some places 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.240
 pass on depay depay 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.880
 depot gone from all 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.169
 this is just a fantastic safe 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.700
 legs gave ramos ramos 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:43.380
 but that's where 4 minutes added faster 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:43.380
 obama yang ball 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.900
 okra ng again 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:06:03.610
 no judge will give a penalty and all friends 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.610
 We lose and the next match and 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:10.490
 it's hard for me to find my game 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:16.010
 I get used to Borussia well and actually 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:18.140
 like the first start of the matches we have ourselves 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:21.170
 It is not the best way so 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:23.870
 Like guys in support I 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:26.720
 I hope we still will break about here 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:30.280
 this and we will start winning everybody thanks 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.280
