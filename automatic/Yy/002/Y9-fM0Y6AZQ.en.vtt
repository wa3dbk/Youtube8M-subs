that gives you a chance to step in and

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.810 
that gives you a chance to step in and
pass<00:01:27.400> them<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.810> number<00:01:29.110> one<00:01:29.470> take<00:01:30.190> some<00:01:30.550> pace

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
pass them so number one take some pace

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.110 
pass them so number one take some pace
off<00:01:31.120> the<00:01:31.390> ball<00:01:32.100> here<00:01:33.100> the<00:01:33.250> returner<00:01:33.640> uses

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
off the ball here the returner uses

one more thing to think about lob to the

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
backhand side that's going to make that

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.490 
backhand side that's going to make that

is when you throw up that occasional lob

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.050 
is when you throw up that occasional lob
you<00:04:42.050> keep<00:04:42.470> the<00:04:42.680> server<00:04:42.950> back<00:04:43.400> a<00:04:43.430> little<00:04:43.760> bit<00:04:43.940> he

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
you never lob they'll get real tight on

you never lob they'll get real tight on
the<00:04:49.190> net<00:04:49.400> they'll<00:04:49.580> have<00:04:49.760> a<00:04:49.790> lot<00:04:50.060> of<00:04:50.180> easy
