00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.210 
friends on the other side and you see
how<00:01:30.509> they<00:01:30.659> separate<00:01:31.290> I'm<00:01:31.530> guessing<00:01:32.040> either

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
how they separate I'm guessing either

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.469 
how they separate I'm guessing either
that<00:01:32.490> displays<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> group<00:01:33.329> will

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
that displays that the group will

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.140 
that displays that the group will
eventually<00:01:33.869> break<00:01:34.110> apart<00:01:34.530> away<00:01:34.770> from<00:01:35.009> toko<00:01:35.729> or

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
eventually break apart away from toko or

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.370 
eventually break apart away from toko or
at<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.360> same<00:01:36.570> time<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.900> looks<00:01:37.049> like<00:01:37.170> one<00:01:37.350> of

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
at the same time it looks like one of

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.719 
at the same time it looks like one of
them<00:01:37.530> are<00:01:37.619> going<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.770> get<00:01:37.920> hit<00:01:38.130> by<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.310> train

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
them are going to get hit by a train

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.190 
them are going to get hit by a train
because<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.180> see<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.450> train<00:01:39.720> coming<00:01:39.750> more

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
because you see the train coming more

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.710 
because you see the train coming more
toka<00:01:40.590> was<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.369> it's<00:01:41.549> either<00:01:41.729> way<00:01:41.970> or<00:01:42.240> toko

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
toka was so it's either way or toko

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.749 
toka was so it's either way or toko
could<00:01:42.960> move<00:01:43.140> away<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.649> could<00:01:44.009> be<00:01:44.130> any<00:01:44.369> one<00:01:44.700> of

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
could move away it could be any one of

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.060 
could move away it could be any one of
those<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.540> top<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.869> events<00:01:46.290> but<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.710> feel<00:01:46.950> like

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
those the top of events but I feel like

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.499 
those the top of events but I feel like
that's<00:01:47.250> exactly<00:01:47.670> what<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:47.939> vision<00:01:48.180> was

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
that's exactly what that vision was

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.969 
that's exactly what that vision was
supposed<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.869> show<00:01:49.140> us<00:01:49.380> because<00:01:49.710> they<00:01:49.799> would

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
supposed to show us because they would

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.410 
supposed to show us because they would
not<00:01:50.130> show<00:01:50.340> something<00:01:50.670> like<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.000> especially

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
not show something like that especially

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.960 
not show something like that especially
related<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.229> future<00:01:52.740> if<00:01:53.009> they<00:01:53.610> did<00:01:53.820> not

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
related to the future if they did not

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.240 
related to the future if they did not
mean<00:01:54.210> some<00:01:54.509> form<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.960> foreshadowing<00:01:55.470> winning

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
mean some form of foreshadowing winning

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.219 
mean some form of foreshadowing winning
so<00:01:56.700> overall<00:01:57.149> interesting<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.079> unique

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229

they're reusing the same backgrounds and
that's<00:03:30.389> what<00:03:30.569> they're<00:03:30.720> doing<00:03:30.930> which<00:03:31.109> is<00:03:31.139> a

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
that's what they're doing which is a

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.710

do<00:03:33.840> something<00:03:34.139> like<00:03:34.259> that<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:34.680> I'm<00:03:34.829> not

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
do something like that and I'm not

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.280 
do something like that and I'm not
complaining<00:03:35.639> on<00:03:35.790> their<00:03:36.209> decision<00:03:36.750> to<00:03:36.780> do<00:03:37.049> that

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
complaining on their decision to do that

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.319 
complaining on their decision to do that
because<00:03:37.439> it<00:03:37.919> allows<00:03:38.189> them<00:03:38.459> to<00:03:38.489> save<00:03:38.849> budget

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
future most likely didn't do some major

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.860 
future most likely didn't do some major
events<00:04:11.699> next<00:04:11.849> episode<00:04:12.329> that<00:04:12.509> will<00:04:12.599> probably

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
events next episode that will probably

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.959 
events next episode that will probably
lead<00:04:13.079> into<00:04:13.289> the<00:04:13.319> main<00:04:13.650> plot<00:04:14.069> of<00:04:14.459> this<00:04:14.699> series

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:14.969 
lead into the main plot of this series

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:16.759 
lead into the main plot of this series
because<00:04:15.599> it<00:04:15.750> seems<00:04:15.989> like<00:04:16.079> this<00:04:16.349> series<00:04:16.590> most

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
because it seems like this series most

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.439 
because it seems like this series most
likely<00:04:17.190> is<00:04:17.280> going<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.519> focus<00:04:17.669> around<00:04:18.030> telling

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
likely is going to focus around telling

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:20.180 
likely is going to focus around telling
the<00:04:18.539> future<00:04:18.659> at<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:19.079> same<00:04:19.320> time<00:04:19.530> probably

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
the future at the same time probably

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.620 
the future at the same time probably
