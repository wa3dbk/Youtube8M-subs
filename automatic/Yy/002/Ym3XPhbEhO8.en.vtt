00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.710
 sorry i am today if the inside of the peritoneum and because my training so far 

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:07.049
 I did not think so well I thought I would find a training partner for the boys 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.710
 how hard you run and maybe another two tips for me 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:16.129
 Treacy over and now you want that offers me »says Holtmann 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.449
 the EU is off 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:21.490
 There is a lot of trouble Watch live experience 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.570
 the stocks of the center so that generally against stage fright 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:26.619
 the people are 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.970
 important to high degree of nervousness at today to build and outpost 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.579
 was the motto 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:32.559
 percent 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.309
 already know before the whole thing starts to focus on the field then has 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:37.110
 that already 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.850
 how is that with you are you still excited in here before the home game 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:40.810
 Wolfsburg 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.010
 while pangs of conscience and nervousness are always part of that, that's important too 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.130
 that one still continues 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.240
 I'm preparing to listen to a bit of music in the center of town 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.010
 not on the 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.010
 to focus on the upcoming tasks 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.690
 I get into the game with a good feeling 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.550
 Stairs Spout you can be pretty quick between what do you mean 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.909
 Dusting Thielemann the fast for Dr 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:04.450
 has the potential to win such a race 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.289
 hard to say slump 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:07.830
 In principle, AP are also fit 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.920
 around 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.770
 FAIRFLIGHT origin to be seen 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.910
 Werdohler fitteste is that and Red Bull on your difficult to say who there 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.050
 Race will be 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.250
 even on the day of the third time games against Freiburg 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.090
 in the morning Künzel also celebrity training still join us but 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.180
 In the afternoon I have to suspend the match against Freiburg, I think that 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.509
 Hardly percent but the Bundesliga game is not all the more 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:32.120
 is 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.260
 I was as I focused on the game 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.600
 Alright, I almost thought but on 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.810
 in terms of noise nervousness I have a few tips get all the games 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.490
 covered 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.680
 It would be good to get into the stadium and get some hair here 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.020
 protect you below 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.760
 the first question immediately 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.510
 Stairs leaking is save in seven weeks and the hearty unsound 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.510
 prepare staircase interrupted Köppen still in duty 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.820
 who as a flop ever so important that you'll be so bubbly up and but that 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.540
 is too 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.180
 Konz in town is supposed to be the start of the week instead of wandering at the end 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.370
 Manfred Stoffers 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.560
 okay so avoid escalators 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.799
 Stairs run 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:10.769
 and then 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.939
 and how the outside net that runs everyday every day is what if you are 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:17.319
 bad day just do not want the motivated you to run 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:19.670
 yes with us to a simple or 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:20.609
 in the team 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:22.609
 Artur is already pulling each other 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:26.779
 otherwise you have a goal in mind like this and try and percent Dr 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:29.829
 This bad day is over bridges, it gives you better percent 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:31.789
 you just come out 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:34.829
 Many people tell me that the music in both places is what it is 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:38.419
 Greeks yes what the duo from the back it must be missing that is not 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:42.889
 This training is music we are bad but if we are still free 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:46.059
 and unabashed home Mr. Hirschmann would get music while running 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.219
 what I actually hear that 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:52.219
 different sales everything I like it 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.189
 untern 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:58.719
 on the day itself from the stairwell running play the team the first crew 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:02:59.779
 stand 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:03.569
 against Freiburg were playing fighting for the coach Steve McClaren already 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.869
 a bit as announced more to get that player to her 

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:09.159
 Morning training on the Rabenberg must fall in love I can do 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:10.569
 I think that will not work 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.319
 no idea 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.629
 the clubs are really nothing 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.429
 Preparation is more important 

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:20.299
 okay then with their prepare but thanks for the tip 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:20.729
 must
