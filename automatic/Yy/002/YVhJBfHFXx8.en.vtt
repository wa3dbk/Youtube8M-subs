00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.470
 stupid hello bird i'm duke and this 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.739
 and pokémon y 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.809
 meanwhile I change I get dressed and then I go 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.110
 down from my dear mother who is 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.870
 waiting to leave 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.550
 hello mom hello how did you dress that 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.730
 I don't know which pants 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.070
 anyway now I have to go and meet 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.510
 my neighbors we have just moved 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.030
 in this new home 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.890
 we just arrived then 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.489
 let's go for a walk outside and 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.019
 see my beautiful neighbor hello hello I 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.119
 I just moved but obviously 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.790
 it sends me around to my mother 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.159
 meeting unknown people but not there 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.920
 no problem after all I am a 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.560
 little boy who has very few years though 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.260
 by you can definitely go around and 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.630
 the girls never met and I expect 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.189
 in the next town but for mine 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.729
 mother of the genre this is not a 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.990
 problem 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:30.800
 so I run away and go to Rio Watercolor 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.850
 here it is the band gathered around 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.220
 a table we don't care who they are 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.680
 may be the worst infamous sim 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.160
 delinquents of the city but it is not a 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.260
 problem 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.480
 we must choose our starters 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.550
 great choice the most choice 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.290
 important that you can do in a game 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.690
 pokemon is not true at all 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.310
 however there is fennec in this fox of 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.070
 fire that seems to me a little too much care 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:00.020
 I don't like it, I don't want to use it later 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.700
 we have here in pokémon which is a frog 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.530
 rabiosa looks showcase the drool 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.500
 let them even get to the neck 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.619
 i think i use cespim in this in 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.379
 this pokémon y is nice and seems 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.659
 that it is a clamp with a head on 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.980
 green hat that make green looks 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.930
 a hat, however, I choose 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.760
 shakespeare i do n't want to give fools 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.190
 nicknames because we must not give 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.720
 nicknames to the starter for allowed 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.670
 give stupid and pokémon nicknames 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.290
 caught later this is a non rule 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.019
 written not to give nickname i 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.400
 starter then give me the pokédex in 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.989
 this pokémon 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.239
 there is not even the professor a 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.340
 bother giving us the pokédex anyway 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.900
 apparently the professor is a fool 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.150
 furious 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.400
 of kids around the world in 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.220
 this city ​​and I have to bring the letter 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.260
 of the professor to my mother that other 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.060
 crazy they are all a bit male in this 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.510
 city ​​and therefore must make us a beautiful one 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.500
 jog and let's go to deliver the 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.680
 letter from prof 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.739
 but to the mother, we must not first 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:04.609
 wait for the upload and apparently 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:08.209
 It wants to challenge and that is the rocky 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:12.260
 Pokémon in Pokémon slobbering with rage 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:15.859
 hydrophobic that is full of drool and we see 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.739
 a little how it behaves and kind and ef 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:20.659
 rocky is just the pokémon which is more 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.269
 suitable to be defeated by my there 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:25.879
 spin given that grass type and I with one 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.889
 great knowledge of pokémon usage 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:30.500
 obviously grass attacks though 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:33.200
 unfortunately, however, those who use the burr attack 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.500
 sim eni has launched its go except 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.540
 angry with my whip I keep it at 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.549
 watch how it looks like a hat 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.099
 with doing green is clearly a 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:45.410
 hat thankfully finished the attack 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.209
 dance use the blow attack I don't know 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.669
 how much damage it passes but it's not like me 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:53.000
 I suck and I still answer for an attack 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:54.949
 whip of arrogance and stupid goodbye 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.900
 coach who comes to challenge me with 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:59.930
 a pokémon on which my attacks are 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.799
 super effective so save for level 6 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.120
 in your face 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.040
 we hope to have good ones 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.810
 statistics has no idea I have not looked 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.900
 what are the basic statistics of the 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.459
 starter because I didn't want to do 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.079
 excessively what jersey is worth 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.720
 every minimum statistic 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:16.190

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.720

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.789
 we have just moved but it is not a 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.699
 problem 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:24.380

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.360
 first time in the history of pokémon 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:32.030
 and here I am in a well-known hamlet 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.430
 cartoonist cartoonist 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.650

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.380
 this came a letter home from 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.060
 people who don't know after the 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.430

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.460
 around the world 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.620
 after having just arrived in a city 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.260
 because the most normal thing is 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.250
 never seen to send your child 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.430

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:11.270

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.479

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.870
