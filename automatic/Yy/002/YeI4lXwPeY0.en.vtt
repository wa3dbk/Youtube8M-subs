00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:07.019
 it was just what I said about flash to the 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:09.100
 smaller in height obvious right he 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:11.110
 fits in the lion king philosophy 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.110
 right 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.449
 we do not need that impact was 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.539
 of course a little hit 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:21.340
 But what gives the strong punch I will 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:26.099
 try to see if I can put the phone 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.099
 to film or sell 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.370
 the ticket 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.490
 they only saw the new I think in my view 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:26.280
 it only took a tire there lock O 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.280
 embedded in noise and 5 letter signed 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:33.390
 now only in the chestnut tree is ready 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.390
 keep feet 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:42.810
 I checked in the champion was there 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:46.880
 ax is ok, work is on 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.980
 athens hose and now just follow 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.680
 if you have been disengaged a cart and 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.680
 you suddenly he dropped a catch 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.540
 your tone hose and you pull line 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.230
 cart on a website 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.820
 My god, what I do is because you stayed 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.310
 too tight hangs any problem 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.790
 mental will you do you will give 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:12.750
 one defendant in the horse that never pulls 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:14.310
 front and pull it will get more you 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.800
 will see and slowly give back the 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.730
 New horse will check again 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.650
 here the loose hawk pulls loose pulls and 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.580
 there will try to release the pull hair 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.070
 return 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.050
 whenever you see that tap is off 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.420
 locked the foot lowered hose in gaza 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.360
 disengage and will take the horse and not 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.850
 leave you give the line a force back 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.630
 show a little bit and then have to 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.830
 return 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.270
 have to see if it 's not too heavy 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.390
 because if you do not want to relieve the pain 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.850
 there it is very much to see that it is very 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.230
 heavy will get heavy on top of that baby 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.390
 pulling will get very heavy and slow 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.500
 because when you take a handle with 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.570
 hand crank 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:00.420
