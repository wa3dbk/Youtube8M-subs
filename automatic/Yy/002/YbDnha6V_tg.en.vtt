00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.719
 2nd 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.980
 hello everyone is steven and today 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.200
 I present you a new cydia tweak 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.269
 which is called go to block for 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.980
 secure access to your applications and 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.330
 after installation you have this icon 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.890
 here on the springboard so you 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.080
 open it and then 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.010
 there you are asked to enter a code so 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.480
 if it's the first time you 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.830
 open the tweak you choose a code 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.170
 otherwise you enter the code you have 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.880
 already defined and then pressing here 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.020
 you access the list of all 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.560
 applications installed on your 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.570
 apparatus 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.129
 so to secure one there you 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.530
 just check it here in 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.179
 the list for example cydia there he is 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.280
 secure so you can check 

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:41.809
 many applications of course you 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.339
 have all the native ones 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.929
 under ios those coming from the app 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:47.059
 store and even applications 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:48.109
 installed from cydia so that 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.780
 can be useful for example for 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:52.640
 facebook secure emails sms 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.019
 so you make your backup and 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.999
 then you find here the 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:57.289
 secure applications at any time 

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:59.059
 you can return to add 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.780
 others or long press on a 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.819
 to remove it 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.620
 then the few options of 

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:05.210
 customization if you check this 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.920
 option you have the option of 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.000
 define a time limit from which a 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.320
 once you are in the application one 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.870
 will recommend the code 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.340
 so I'm going off then for 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.700
 change the code precisely that happens 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.290
 right here 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.390
 so you have to type the old code 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.680
 is choosing the new so there I 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.600
 will spend one two three four 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.670
 we hit them a second time and that's 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.630
 all good the quad is registered you 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.580
 if you're interested too 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.770
 define a vibration if the cost 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.390
 entrance is not good and finally there we 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.130
 will be able to customize the screen 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.540
 authentication so you have to 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.610
 allow that the tweak can 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.870
 access your photos and then in 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.850
 your filmstrip you select a 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.290
 image so for example a beautiful background 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.210
 that I'm going to take this one 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.910
 you have the possibility to crop it 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.590
 and then you press and choose 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.910
 fund is applied it will show up 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.530
 now every time the screen 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.760
 authentication will be offered 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.680
 so I immediately show you 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.760
 how does it work in any case it's 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.080
 all for what we find as options 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.000
 of customization of this tweak 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.830
 now let's see how to use it 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.720
 so let's admit that I want to access it at 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.700
 the camera that is secure 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.860
 the code but ask and you see in 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.270
 the oven the pokÃ©ball that is displayed so 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.400
 it's the authentication screen that we have 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.200
 selected just before and there if the code 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.700
 is not good it does not work I do not 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.830
 can not access the camera 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.120
 so the secure tweak really access 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.799
 to applications 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.970
 there with the mezzo for example no 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.470
 concern to open it since it is not 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.110
 not protected against notes 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.989
 yes I am asked the code so month 1 2 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.159
 3 4 and the application opens so here it goes 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.930
 how does it work it's really 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:28.879
 simple to use everything simple to 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.650
 set up also you saw it so if 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.840
 this tweet interests you his name is aya 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.030
 plock like this it is available 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.129
 free on cydia on the source of 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.379
 big boss and it's only compatible 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:41.239
 with the ios so is if you are looking for a 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.519
 good way to secure your applications 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.079
