00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:09.260
 hello and welcome to a little 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:13.139
 Video where I show how to play this game 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.940
 heaven and hell craft and cup yes what 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:21.779
 heaven and hell is easy 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:25.320
 So one asks his friend day a number 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:30.300
 between 1 and 10 and exchanges he says on 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:33.059
 5 12345 at his here once 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.690
 Now, for example, select the black one here 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.290
 death 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:43.500
 he opens everything and then stands here 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:46.410
 stop something inside eg you win the lottery 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.579
 or something for the future 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.070
 then predict or can stop 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.949
 not or whatever 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:59.910
 example later rich or late 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:02.690
 Somehow something like that comes here now 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.690
 the craft part 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:16.380
 everything you need for it 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:19.640
 square paper then I found I 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:27.180
 So you fall that twice in the middle 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:29.450
 even open once and then once 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.450
 so 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:41.450
 then we have a plus here 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:56.800
 then it folded again so obliquely that 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:02:00.480
 such a triangle arises the guests 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:05.530
 then she opens it all up and now 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:08.800
 we have the center here and has 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:12.390
 now all corners that so the corners 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.390
 right on the medium to lie 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.350
 then you have something else smaller here 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.400
 square 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:35.350
 but then it turns around and does it exactly 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:48.460
 the same again so all corners in 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:50.860
 the middle if you have a small one 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.470
 square and now again both 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.380
 once so miraculous but so the 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:01.239
 half and actually on until he finished 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:12.370
 then we go in here with the fingers 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:13.440
 and then you can do it right away 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.959
 to begin 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:20.860
 if this game to play you can do it 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:24.459
 then stop when each opens up 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:29.440
 and then write something here and 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:31.900
 then on top of it just like stop 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:37.570
 somehow a point that he was in the day 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:39.580
 that the friend or the person 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:46.410
 Then something chooses then 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:46.410
 Does that make you a student on the side ? 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:55.209
 I hold now 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.110
 natively little you should be great with him 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.840
 do I currently only with the 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.630
 made small to show 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:05.020
 and yes that's the way it is and goes back with it 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.690
 a finger in the locksmith and that 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.190
 with the pointer and the index finger and 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:14.560
 thumb 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:16.570
 both hands then you can already 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.220
 start playing that was the whole thing 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.220
 video and bye
