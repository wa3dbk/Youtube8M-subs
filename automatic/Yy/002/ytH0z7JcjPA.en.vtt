00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.090
 we are with sir garden 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.349
 vice president of breitling hello 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.900
 sir thank you we know 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.639
 thank you for welcome to the booth 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.570
 bright line for this edition in 2015 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.830
 from baselworld 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.859
 so introduce yourself this year a 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.820
 prototype of the abbot 55 connected is this 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.480
 that you can tell us about his 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.789
 features 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.990
 from the beginning braille kling 131 years 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.609
 of history now has been a 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.560
 specialist in my technique with 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.420
 chronographs related to aviation from the 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.969
 30s and sends her a lot more 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.340
 common tool to improve 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.410
 the use of the watch only to try 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.570
 to put a wrong phone at 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.700
 wrist we have a watch we presented 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.260
 last year the coke 50 bpp with 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.180
 officials who are fake a 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.860
 little bit difficult to use with 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.539
 just a crown turned and of 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.700
 pushers on the other hand with the phone 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.079
 which has a big advantage over the 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.600
 shows that it has a large surface 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.309
 an extremely user-friendly interface and 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.920
 it allows the use of this watch 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.590
 in a super simple way especially 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.660
 synchronization with a gps tone of a 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.700
 another side in the other direction of 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.830
 connection if you measure times of 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.240
 flight for example with also no 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.710
 only the flight time but the time to 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.240
 which took you off and the time to 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.920
 which you have landed what all 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.960
 driver has to do when you have to fill 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.880
 his logbook you can in 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.619
 the aude and download in french all 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.119
 his information in an extremely 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.189
 simple and with that once it's on 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.310
 your phone send you all this through 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.439
 email on your laptop in csv format 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.570
 compatible excellent and it fills you up 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.860
 automatically your look book which is 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.000
 sometimes a little painful affair 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.380
 when you make the hand you that 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.700
 was already a moment in fact that you 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.610
 did some connected watches 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.000
 like that they send signals 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.470
 bearish 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.049
 so it depends what's called 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.040
 connected but it's true that in 1995 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.079
 we were not talking about worlds yet 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.000
 connected but breiving already had a 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.329
 shows with a distress transmitter that 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.110
 were sending satellite signals and 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.090
 actually we used the 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.430
 technologies at the time available 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.649
 to have a distress beacon at 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.670
 wrists and thanks to this watch we could 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.790
 find more than 20 people 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.010
 there are other actors who 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.840
 announced connected watches from here 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.030
 few months apple that will arrive in 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.710
 April what you do not think happen 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.010
 at the end of the year at the earliest it's a 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.860
 a little too late, listen, we have customers 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.660
 who are patient especially that our 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.770
 produced as I told you the 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.120
 phone is at the service of the world 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.950
 so we learned the next little bit 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.420
 different and we will not be directly in 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.280
 competition from others 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.790
 products on the market that will be launched 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.560
 recently 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.510
 then bomb another watch she's 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.430
 waterproof we will not need the 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.310
 recharge every day but it will 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.870
 plus every one or two months everything has been 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.370
 developed in Switzerland from which we 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.959
 differentiate anyway in a way 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.610
 quite significant compared to 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.290
 others show that we say connected 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.970
 precisely these times we do not speak badly 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.080
 connected watches because apple is going 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.720
 come on market what are you 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.700
 think of their apps watch so I 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.170
 not had too much opportunity to see him soto 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.880
 which is not much that has been 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.410
 seen today what we see anyway 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.010
 is that we see that in a very 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.230
 positive 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.790
 we talk a lot about watches wore at 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.959
 wrist what was more so the 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.390
 tendency especially in young people 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.160
 generations today so that shows 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.810
 the dynamism of our industry and that's 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.519
 although there is a little dynamism of 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.959
 competition we see that very 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.910
 good time so thank you very much but 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.960
 it's germain thanks to you then to the 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:19.640
 next time my first name 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:19.640
 left
