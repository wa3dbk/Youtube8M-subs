looks<00:02:24.860> like<00:02:24.980> when<00:02:25.160> you're<00:02:25.280> doing<00:02:25.489> it<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:27.790> in

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
looks like when you're doing it and in

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.449 
looks like when you're doing it and in
some<00:02:29.060> cases<00:02:29.590> because<00:02:30.590> of<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.830> thickness<00:02:31.160> of

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
some cases because of the thickness of

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.580 
some cases because of the thickness of
the<00:02:31.550> fabric<00:02:31.730> this<00:02:32.090> is<00:02:32.239> almost<00:02:32.480> a<00:02:32.660> double<00:02:33.110> cross

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
the fabric this is almost a double cross

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.520 
the fabric this is almost a double cross
stitch<00:02:33.920> which<00:02:34.880> is<00:02:34.910> perfectly<00:02:35.810> fine<00:02:36.170> in<00:02:36.410> this

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
stitch which is perfectly fine in this

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.680 
stitch which is perfectly fine in this
case<00:02:36.880> because<00:02:37.880> I<00:02:38.030> don't<00:02:38.180> want<00:02:38.299> my<00:02:38.420> collar

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
case because I don't want my collar

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.990 
case because I don't want my collar
falling<00:02:39.140> off<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:40.310> don't<00:02:40.519> want<00:02:40.640> them<00:02:40.730> to<00:02:40.849> get

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
falling off you don't want them to get

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.199 
falling off you don't want them to get
too<00:02:41.299> thick<00:02:42.140> otherwise<00:02:42.650> it<00:02:43.099> will<00:02:43.209> probably

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
too thick otherwise it will probably

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.490 
too thick otherwise it will probably
restrict<00:02:45.400> some<00:02:46.400> of<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.670> movement<00:02:47.299> and<00:02:47.780> I

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
restrict some of the movement and I

00:02:48.500 --> 00:03:00.670 
restrict some of the movement and I
would<00:02:48.650> also<00:02:48.830> just<00:02:48.980> be<00:02:49.310> wasting<00:02:49.760> thread<00:02:59.680> it's

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
would also just be wasting thread it's

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:08.259 
would also just be wasting thread it's
pretty<00:03:00.980> simple<00:03:01.370> a<00:03:06.880> couple<00:03:07.880> of<00:03:07.970> things<00:03:08.150> you

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
pretty simple a couple of things you

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.930 
pretty simple a couple of things you
want<00:03:08.299> to<00:03:08.450> keep<00:03:08.569> in<00:03:08.720> mind<00:03:09.040> first<00:03:10.040> of<00:03:10.160> all<00:03:10.310> when

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
want to keep in mind first of all when

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.670 
want to keep in mind first of all when
you<00:03:11.060> pull<00:03:11.360> you<00:03:11.599> don't<00:03:11.780> want<00:03:11.959> to<00:03:12.049> have<00:03:12.200> this

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
you pull you don't want to have this

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.660 
you pull you don't want to have this
happen<00:03:13.060> which<00:03:14.060> is<00:03:14.230> oops<00:03:15.230> I<00:03:15.560> have<00:03:15.859> a<00:03:15.920> bunch<00:03:16.549> of

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
happen which is oops I have a bunch of

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.340 
happen which is oops I have a bunch of
fabric<00:03:17.120> here<00:03:17.150> that's<00:03:17.480> kind<00:03:17.690> of<00:03:17.750> looping<00:03:18.170> up

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
fabric here that's kind of looping up

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.440 
fabric here that's kind of looping up
you<00:03:18.980> don't<00:03:19.190> want<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:19.430> have<00:03:19.579> that<00:03:19.790> happen<00:03:19.970> so

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
you don't want to have that happen so

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.780 
you don't want to have that happen so
what<00:03:20.630> you<00:03:20.720> do<00:03:20.900> is<00:03:21.019> if<00:03:21.200> that<00:03:21.319> does<00:03:21.590> happen<00:03:21.790> just

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
what you do is if that does happen just

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.479 
what you do is if that does happen just
kind<00:03:23.060> of<00:03:23.120> flip<00:03:23.540> it<00:03:23.569> up<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:24.310> put<00:03:25.310> your<00:03:25.430> thumb

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
kind of flip it up and put your thumb

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.520 
kind of flip it up and put your thumb
there<00:03:25.880> to<00:03:26.030> kind<00:03:26.239> of<00:03:26.299> control<00:03:26.660> it<00:03:26.810> through<00:03:26.989> and

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
there to kind of control it through and

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.720 
there to kind of control it through and
there<00:03:28.280> you<00:03:28.400> go

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
there you go

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.900 
there you go
you<00:03:28.850> want<00:03:29.090> this<00:03:29.209> to<00:03:29.359> be<00:03:29.480> as<00:03:29.600> flat<00:03:30.139> as<00:03:30.380> possible

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
you want this to be as flat as possible

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.789 
you want this to be as flat as possible
another<00:03:31.910> thing<00:03:32.329> about<00:03:32.450> these<00:03:32.780> stitches<00:03:33.650> is

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
another thing about these stitches is

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.800 
another thing about these stitches is
that<00:03:34.010> since<00:03:34.310> it's<00:03:35.030> you're<00:03:35.239> doing<00:03:35.480> it<00:03:35.569> on<00:03:35.660> the

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
that since it's you're doing it on the

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.590 
that since it's you're doing it on the
raw<00:03:35.959> edge<00:03:36.170> it<00:03:36.530> automatically<00:03:37.100> starts<00:03:37.730> picking

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
raw edge it automatically starts picking

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.090 
raw edge it automatically starts picking
up<00:03:38.840> the<00:03:39.019> raw<00:03:39.260> edges<00:03:39.560> of<00:03:40.010> the<00:03:40.100> fabric<00:03:40.340> here<00:03:41.000> and

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
up the raw edges of the fabric here and

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.270 
up the raw edges of the fabric here and
that<00:03:43.100> like<00:03:43.940> a<00:03:43.970> surging<00:03:44.480> stitch<00:03:45.260> protects<00:03:46.069> it

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
that like a surging stitch protects it

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.349 
that like a surging stitch protects it
from<00:03:46.310> unraveling<00:03:47.470> very<00:03:48.470> important<00:03:49.209> like<00:03:50.209> I

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
from unraveling very important like I

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:52.780 
from unraveling very important like I
said<00:03:50.630> none<00:03:50.900> of<00:03:51.109> these<00:03:51.260> stitches<00:03:51.769> will<00:03:52.010> be<00:03:52.040> seen

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
said none of these stitches will be seen

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.819 
said none of these stitches will be seen
once<00:03:53.630> I'm<00:03:53.840> done<00:03:54.079> because<00:03:54.380> I'm<00:03:54.530> going<00:03:54.680> to<00:03:54.769> be

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
once I'm done because I'm going to be

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.440 
once I'm done because I'm going to be
covering<00:03:55.250> them<00:03:55.489> up<00:03:55.519> with<00:03:55.700> another<00:03:56.120> piece<00:03:56.420> of

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
covering them up with another piece of

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.780 
covering them up with another piece of
fabric<00:03:56.780> which<00:03:57.109> is<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:57.410> top<00:03:57.709> collar<00:03:58.099> it's

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
fabric which is the top collar it's

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.240 
fabric which is the top collar it's
going<00:03:58.970> to<00:03:59.030> be<00:03:59.120> made<00:03:59.329> of<00:03:59.480> the<00:03:59.569> same<00:03:59.810> wool<00:04:00.250> that

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
going to be made of the same wool that

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:10.059 
going to be made of the same wool that
the<00:04:01.370> rest<00:04:01.579> of<00:04:01.700> the<00:04:01.790> coats<00:04:02.060> made<00:04:02.329> of<00:04:08.919> and<00:04:09.919> you

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
the rest of the coats made of and you

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:12.069 
the rest of the coats made of and you
get<00:04:10.190> the<00:04:10.280> hang<00:04:10.430> of<00:04:10.549> these<00:04:10.730> stitches<00:04:11.359> you<00:04:11.810> sort

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
get the hang of these stitches you sort

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.259 
get the hang of these stitches you sort
of<00:04:12.139> start<00:04:12.560> automatically<00:04:13.220> getting<00:04:13.549> faster

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
of start automatically getting faster

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.599 
of start automatically getting faster
but<00:04:15.169> you<00:04:15.319> don't<00:04:15.500> want<00:04:15.620> to<00:04:15.680> go<00:04:15.799> too<00:04:15.859> fast<00:04:16.370> if

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
but you don't want to go too fast if

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.969 
but you don't want to go too fast if
you're<00:04:16.729> not<00:04:16.789> comfortable<00:04:17.329> with<00:04:17.870> it<00:04:18.079> it's

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
you're not comfortable with it it's

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.830 
you're not comfortable with it it's
better<00:04:19.310> to<00:04:19.609> be<00:04:19.820> accurate<00:04:20.630> and<00:04:20.840> fast

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.490 

better<00:04:24.840> to<00:04:25.020> be<00:04:25.139> both<00:04:26.780> I've<00:04:27.780> seen<00:04:28.080> some<00:04:28.350> people

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
just zooming with these stitches they've

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:48.980 
just zooming with these stitches they've
been<00:04:40.110> doing<00:04:40.290> them<00:04:40.500> for<00:04:40.530> years<00:04:41.520> and<00:04:41.910> years<00:04:47.990> I'm

why<00:04:52.830> is<00:04:52.889> because<00:04:53.070> in<00:04:53.430> case<00:04:53.700> of<00:04:53.730> it<00:04:54.000> does<00:04:54.300> end<00:04:54.720> up

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
why is because in case of it does end up

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.750 
why is because in case of it does end up
showing<00:04:55.080> up<00:04:55.760> a<00:04:57.560> couple<00:04:58.560> of<00:04:58.740> the<00:04:58.919> fibers<00:04:59.370> or<00:04:59.550> so
