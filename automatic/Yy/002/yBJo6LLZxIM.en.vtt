think<00:04:47.169> if<00:04:47.290> I<00:04:47.560> think<00:04:48.100> the<00:04:48.190> rule<00:04:48.370> of<00:04:48.400> thumb<00:04:48.610> is<00:04:48.790> if

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
think if I think the rule of thumb is if

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:49.890 
think if I think the rule of thumb is if
you're<00:04:49.030> ever<00:04:49.150> going<00:04:49.360> to<00:04:49.419> do<00:04:49.510> something<00:04:49.690> a
