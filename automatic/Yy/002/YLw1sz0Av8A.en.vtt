00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
there

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.929 
there
this<00:00:58.770> thing<00:00:59.070> has<00:00:59.190> been<00:00:59.370> welded<00:00:59.699> on<00:01:00.480> there<00:01:04.939> for

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
this thing has been welded on there for

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.630 
this thing has been welded on there for
some<00:01:06.180> reason

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
some reason

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.109 
some reason
the<00:01:08.640> splines<00:01:09.170> insight<00:01:10.170> on<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.409> hub<00:01:11.119> have

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
the splines insight on that hub have

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.060 
the splines insight on that hub have
worn<00:01:13.080> down<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:14.930> it<00:01:15.930> was<00:01:16.080> repaired<00:01:16.590> by<00:01:17.040> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
worn down and it was repaired by the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.050 
worn down and it was repaired by the
previous<00:01:17.640> owner

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
previous owner

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.450

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
we didn't even notice that we'll went to

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.570 
we didn't even notice that we'll went to
pick<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.759> up<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.119> Colorado<00:01:22.280> which<00:01:23.280> was<00:01:23.549> a

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
pick this up in Colorado which was a

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.719 
pick this up in Colorado which was a
couple<00:01:24.000> months<00:01:24.150> back<00:01:24.450> but<00:01:24.890> it<00:01:25.890> appears<00:01:26.280> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
couple months back but it appears the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.890 
couple months back but it appears the
welds<00:01:27.360> finally<00:01:27.869> broken<00:01:28.820> that's<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.150> result

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
welds finally broken that's the result

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.539 
welds finally broken that's the result
right<00:01:31.110> there<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.740> got<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.040> do<00:01:32.189> some<00:01:32.369> welding

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
right there so I got to do some welding

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.679 
right there so I got to do some welding
on<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.150> thing<00:01:34.729> check<00:01:35.729> out<00:01:35.909> how<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.119> splines

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
on that thing check out how the splines

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.319 
on that thing check out how the splines
are<00:01:37.549> remove<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.729> tire

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
are remove the tire

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:45.149 
are remove the tire
maybe<00:01:40.899> they<00:01:41.140> can<00:01:41.320> be<00:01:41.500> repaired<00:01:41.920> maybe<00:01:42.250> not<00:01:44.159> all

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
maybe they can be repaired maybe not all

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.580 
maybe they can be repaired maybe not all
right<00:01:45.250> so<00:01:45.579> when<00:01:46.090> found<00:01:46.539> the<00:01:46.719> problem<00:01:46.990> finally

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
right so when found the problem finally

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.219 
right so when found the problem finally
of<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.719> Kodiak<00:01:49.719> and<00:01:51.600> not<00:01:52.600> enough<00:01:52.869> this<00:01:53.049> is<00:01:53.200> a

of the Kodiak and not enough this is a

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.510 
of the Kodiak and not enough this is a
pretty<00:01:53.469> common<00:01:53.860> problem<00:01:54.069> I<00:01:54.429> want<00:01:54.960> among

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520

haven't had any problems like this with
mine<00:02:03.459> but<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:06.310> splines<00:02:06.670> are<00:02:07.030> worn<00:02:07.299> here<00:02:07.630> in

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
mine but the splines are worn here in

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:08.249 
mine but the splines are worn here in
the<00:02:07.810> front

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
the front

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.479 
the front
but<00:02:08.379> these<00:02:08.500> arms<00:02:08.709> are<00:02:08.799> still<00:02:09.069> good<00:02:09.280> in<00:02:09.429> the

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
but these arms are still good in the

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.420 
but these arms are still good in the
back<00:02:10.170> what<00:02:11.170> happened<00:02:11.530> was<00:02:11.739> those<00:02:12.129> planes

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
back what happened was those planes

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.979 
back what happened was those planes
actually<00:02:12.849> worn<00:02:13.120> down<00:02:13.890> inside<00:02:14.890> on<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:16.120> actual

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
actually worn down inside on the actual

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.539 
actually worn down inside on the actual
hub<00:02:17.430> I've<00:02:18.430> never<00:02:18.730> seen<00:02:19.890> anything<00:02:20.890> like<00:02:21.099> this

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
hub I've never seen anything like this

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:22.610 
hub I've never seen anything like this
ever

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
ever

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.420 
ever
there's<00:02:23.620> just<00:02:23.920> no<00:02:24.190> splines<00:02:25.030> left<00:02:25.450> in<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:26.019> hub

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
there's just no splines left in the hub

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.699 
there's just no splines left in the hub
in<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.459> front<00:02:27.970> there<00:02:28.390> is<00:02:28.630> there's<00:02:29.470> the

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
in the front there is there's the

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.430 
in the front there is there's the
original<00:02:30.569> and<00:02:31.569> there's<00:02:31.750> just<00:02:31.989> the<00:02:32.110> front<00:02:32.349> part

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
original and there's just the front part

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.670 
original and there's just the front part
that<00:02:32.860> actually<00:02:33.010> has<00:02:33.510> that's<00:02:34.510> still<00:02:34.959> intact<00:02:35.170> as

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
that actually has that's still intact as

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.880 
that actually has that's still intact as
it<00:02:35.920> being<00:02:36.099> worn<00:02:36.370> down<00:02:36.579> and<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:38.230> only<00:02:38.349> reason<00:02:38.620> I

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
it being worn down and the only reason I

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.710 
it being worn down and the only reason I
know<00:02:38.950> why<00:02:39.340> those<00:02:39.579> planes<00:02:39.910> are<00:02:40.090> still<00:02:40.209> good<00:02:40.569> is

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
know why those planes are still good is

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.580 
know why those planes are still good is
because<00:02:41.110> this<00:02:41.319> one<00:02:41.530> still<00:02:41.860> goes<00:02:42.069> on<00:02:42.280> there

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
because this one still goes on there

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.830 
because this one still goes on there
and<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:44.010> has<00:02:44.160> a<00:02:44.190> nice<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:44.760> tight<00:02:44.970> fit<00:02:48.739> so

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
and it has a nice and tight fit so

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.630 
and it has a nice and tight fit so
there's<00:02:51.840> no<00:02:52.020> way<00:02:52.200> I'm<00:02:52.319> going<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.500> be<00:02:52.739> welding

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
there's no way I'm going to be welding

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.330 
there's no way I'm going to be welding
this<00:02:53.819> because<00:02:54.660> if<00:02:54.840> somebody<00:02:55.230> else<00:02:55.410> did<00:02:55.709> well

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
this because if somebody else did well

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.850 
this because if somebody else did well
this<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.000> can<00:02:57.120> tell<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:58.470> welds<00:02:58.770> are

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
this and you can tell the welds are

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.820 
this and you can tell the welds are
really<00:02:59.160> crappy<00:02:59.489> in<00:02:59.790> there<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.680> dating<00:03:01.680> even

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
really crappy in there the dating even

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.400 
really crappy in there the dating even
penetrate<00:03:02.459> I<00:03:02.640> mean<00:03:03.330> they<00:03:03.450> just<00:03:03.720> stuck<00:03:04.080> on<00:03:04.230> to

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
penetrate I mean they just stuck on to

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.370 
penetrate I mean they just stuck on to
the<00:03:04.500> metal<00:03:04.800> and<00:03:04.860> I<00:03:04.980> was<00:03:05.130> it<00:03:05.870> this<00:03:06.870> metal<00:03:07.260> is

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
the metal and I was it this metal is

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.930 
the metal and I was it this metal is
actually<00:03:07.530> too<00:03:07.950> thick<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:09.650> penetrate<00:03:10.650> with

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
actually too thick to penetrate with

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.550 
actually too thick to penetrate with
with<00:03:11.940> just<00:03:12.330> a<00:03:12.480> 110<00:03:13.130> welder<00:03:14.660> and<00:03:15.660> I'm<00:03:15.930> sure<00:03:16.530> I

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
with just a 110 welder and I'm sure I

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.920 
with just a 110 welder and I'm sure I
could<00:03:16.860> do<00:03:16.980> it<00:03:17.100> with<00:03:17.310> flux<00:03:17.610> core<00:03:17.910> no<00:03:18.330> problem<00:03:18.870> I

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
could do it with flux core no problem I

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.590 
could do it with flux core no problem I
can<00:03:19.080> penetrate<00:03:19.290> into<00:03:19.709> that<00:03:20.040> but<00:03:20.459> I<00:03:20.730> mean

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
can penetrate into that but I mean

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.160 
can penetrate into that but I mean
what's<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.989> point<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:22.530> actually<00:03:22.920> doing<00:03:23.580> some

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
what's the point and actually doing some

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.900 
what's the point and actually doing some
welding<00:03:25.170> on<00:03:25.590> this<00:03:25.910> when<00:03:26.910> it's<00:03:27.180> just<00:03:27.480> easier<00:03:27.840> to

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
welding on this when it's just easier to

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.020 
welding on this when it's just easier to
buy<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:29.970> part<00:03:30.390> and<00:03:31.430> now<00:03:32.430> I<00:03:32.459> have<00:03:32.640> to<00:03:32.819> worry

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
buy the part and now I have to worry

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.449 
buy the part and now I have to worry
about<00:03:33.950> welding<00:03:34.950> adder

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
about welding adder

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.070 
about welding adder
if<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.060> welds<00:03:36.330> are<00:03:36.420> going<00:03:36.569> to<00:03:36.630> hold<00:03:36.810> it<00:03:36.900> off

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
if the welds are going to hold it off

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.880 
if the welds are going to hold it off
but<00:03:38.569> my<00:03:39.569> brother's<00:03:39.959> just<00:03:40.110> gonna<00:03:40.349> have<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:40.590> wait

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
but my brother's just gonna have to wait

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.910 
but my brother's just gonna have to wait
and<00:03:41.209> order<00:03:42.209> himself<00:03:42.540> a<00:03:42.690> hub<00:03:42.870> because<00:03:43.230> welding

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
and order himself a hub because welding

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.569 
and order himself a hub because welding
it<00:03:44.099> would<00:03:44.280> just<00:03:44.580> be<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:44.790> waste<00:03:45.060> of<00:03:45.360> a<00:03:46.400> waste<00:03:47.400> of

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
it would just be a waste of a waste of

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.630 
it would just be a waste of a waste of
time<00:03:47.820> because<00:03:48.470> if<00:03:49.470> this<00:03:49.859> ever<00:03:50.070> has<00:03:50.310> to<00:03:50.519> be

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
time because if this ever has to be

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.140 
time because if this ever has to be
removed<00:03:51.060> again<00:03:51.299> and<00:03:51.750> it's<00:03:51.959> welded<00:03:53.150> there's

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
removed again and it's welded there's

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.289 
removed again and it's welded there's
just<00:03:54.390> no<00:03:54.660> way<00:03:54.840> it'll<00:03:55.079> have<00:03:55.200> to<00:03:55.320> be<00:03:55.440> cut<00:03:55.680> off<00:03:55.859> and

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
just no way it'll have to be cut off and

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:00.740 
just no way it'll have to be cut off and
there's<00:03:57.299> just<00:03:57.600> no<00:03:57.780> point<00:03:59.120> it<00:04:00.120> would<00:04:00.329> bring<00:04:00.540> me

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
there's just no point it would bring me

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.059 
there's just no point it would bring me
a<00:04:00.780> whole<00:04:01.019> new<00:04:01.069> axle<00:04:02.090> so<00:04:03.410> there<00:04:04.410> will<00:04:04.680> be<00:04:04.739> no

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
a whole new axle so there will be no

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.500 
a whole new axle so there will be no
repairs<00:04:05.900> until<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:07.079> part<00:04:07.319> actually<00:04:07.500> comes<00:04:07.950> in

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
repairs until the part actually comes in

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.460 
repairs until the part actually comes in
alright<00:04:09.510> so<00:04:09.750> I'm<00:04:09.840> here<00:04:09.989> working<00:04:10.140> on<00:04:10.410> my

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
alright so I'm here working on my

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.840 
alright so I'm here working on my
brother's<00:04:10.920> kodiak<00:04:12.230> he<00:04:13.280> finally<00:04:14.280> ordered<00:04:14.489> the

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
brother's kodiak he finally ordered the

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.870 
brother's kodiak he finally ordered the
hub<00:04:15.060> but<00:04:15.560> I<00:04:16.560> thought<00:04:16.889> I'd<00:04:17.070> demonstrate<00:04:17.700> how<00:04:17.850> to

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
hub but I thought I'd demonstrate how to

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.509 
hub but I thought I'd demonstrate how to
change<00:04:18.450> one<00:04:18.750> of<00:04:18.780> these<00:04:18.930> out<00:04:19.169> so<00:04:19.560> I<00:04:20.100> got<00:04:20.310> to<00:04:20.400> do

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
change one of these out so I got to do

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.469 
change one of these out so I got to do
is<00:04:20.579> just<00:04:20.729> take<00:04:20.910> out<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.359> cotter<00:04:21.840> pin<00:04:22.200> pretty

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.770 

as<00:04:26.479> you<00:04:26.630> can<00:04:26.780> tell<00:04:27.050> this<00:04:27.320> is<00:04:27.560> not<00:04:27.590> a<00:04:28.479> it's<00:04:29.479> just

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
as you can tell this is not a it's just

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.080 
as you can tell this is not a it's just
a<00:04:29.900> regular<00:04:30.320> knot<00:04:30.590> right<00:04:30.860> here<00:04:31.130> that<00:04:31.729> was<00:04:31.850> put

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
a regular knot right here that was put

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.780 
a regular knot right here that was put
in<00:04:32.180> the<00:04:32.210> for<00:04:32.780> the<00:04:32.930> time<00:04:33.169> being<00:04:33.440> just<00:04:33.740> torque<00:04:34.669> it

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
in the for the time being just torque it

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.480 
in the for the time being just torque it
a<00:04:34.880> little<00:04:35.120> bit<00:04:36.040> really<00:04:37.040> all<00:04:37.430> these<00:04:37.610> come<00:04:38.000> with

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
a little bit really all these come with

castle nut and if you're doing the same

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.920 
castle nut and if you're doing the same
thing<00:04:47.840> on<00:04:48.260> a<00:04:48.320> ETV<00:04:49.220> now<00:04:50.180> you<00:04:50.389> want<00:04:50.540> to<00:04:50.600> make<00:04:50.750> sure

thing on a ETV now you want to make sure

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.620 
thing on a ETV now you want to make sure
you<00:04:51.110> remove<00:04:51.290> the<00:04:51.590> pin<00:04:52.550> or<00:04:53.350> the<00:04:54.350> cotter<00:04:54.860> pin

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
you remove the pin or the cotter pin

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.420 
you remove the pin or the cotter pin
before<00:04:56.630> you<00:04:56.960> remove<00:04:57.380> the<00:04:57.560> nut<00:04:57.770> or<00:04:57.979> you<00:04:58.190> won't

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
before you remove the nut or you won't

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.760 
before you remove the nut or you won't
be<00:04:58.580> able<00:04:58.729> to<00:04:59.000> remove<00:04:59.270> this<00:04:59.510> nut<00:04:59.780> without

be able to remove this nut without

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.760 
be able to remove this nut without
damaging<00:05:01.460> something<00:05:01.850> of<00:05:01.970> course<00:05:02.240> so<00:05:02.770> just

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
damaging something of course so just

the<00:05:21.710> hub<00:05:27.310> replace<00:05:29.169> it's<00:05:30.169> pretty<00:05:30.500> much<00:05:30.650> a

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
the hub replace it's pretty much a

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:36.420 
the hub replace it's pretty much a
symbol<00:05:31.220> as<00:05:31.570> you<00:05:32.680> disassembled<00:05:33.680> so

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:46.560 

put<00:05:37.430> back<00:05:37.580> the<00:05:37.789> washer

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.740 

hand<00:05:47.570> down<00:05:47.780> your<00:05:47.930> castle<00:05:48.380> on<00:05:49.300> the<00:05:50.300> castle<00:05:50.660> and

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
hand down your castle on the castle and

let<00:05:50.900> that<00:05:51.050> was<00:05:51.199> ordered<00:05:51.380> for<00:05:51.710> this<00:05:51.889> was

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
let that was ordered for this was

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.980 
let that was ordered for this was
actually<00:05:53.889> different<00:05:54.889> size<00:05:55.190> so<00:05:55.990> that's

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
actually different size so that's

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.439 
actually different size so that's
actually<00:05:57.139> for<00:05:57.500> the<00:05:57.590> front<00:05:57.889> part<00:05:58.070> so<00:05:58.460> this

00:05:59.439 --> 00:05:59.449 
actually for the front part so this

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:07.439 
actually for the front part so this
laughs<00:05:59.750> did<00:06:00.020> do<00:06:00.560> in<00:06:00.740> the<00:06:00.970> meantime

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:07.449 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:11.260 

that's<00:06:08.449> it<00:06:09.669> you<00:06:10.669> don't<00:06:10.759> want<00:06:10.940> to<00:06:11.030> really

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270 
that's it you don't want to really

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:19.180 
that's it you don't want to really
torque<00:06:12.259> these<00:06:12.470> down<00:06:12.530> too<00:06:13.280> much<00:06:17.830> you<00:06:18.830> want<00:06:19.039> to

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.410 
torque it down and off and then you want

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.439

this again real soon so
that's<00:06:41.780> the<00:06:41.960> way<00:06:42.110> you<00:06:42.190> replace<00:06:43.190> a<00:06:43.490> axle<00:06:44.300> hub

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:44.510 
that's the way you replace a axle hub

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.500 
that's the way you replace a axle hub
and<00:06:44.870> it's<00:06:45.830> pretty<00:06:46.100> much<00:06:46.190> done<00:06:46.670> the<00:06:47.060> same<00:06:47.330> way

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:47.510 
and it's pretty much done the same way

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.870 
and it's pretty much done the same way
on<00:06:47.660> every<00:06:47.900> ATV<00:06:48.680> out<00:06:49.190> there

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:49.880
