00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:04.150
 prandelli could spend seven months and I suppose you are at work 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:05.540
 then an album 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.309
 yes that's right when I come back from us so he comes anyway a Dutch speaking 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:10.909
 are just out 

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:14.079
 and but that sentence or official dutch album 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:18.330
 I do not know exactly when each month but I do know that this year 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:21.329
 happens and the singel why Wielaert and who has registered 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:26.259
 we know who i am jvw where the son of marianne weber 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.039
 he is not going to write he has already written some songs and 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.110
 we have actually become very beautiful, but we have to look again 

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:38.160
 which song the single will be recording the modem with I will still do 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.250
 before going to oslo 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.870
 Pierre Kartner has shown that this is a bit of a shame to him 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.040
 has not been asked to deliver new songs for the album 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.770
 reason why 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.660
 this time a time that they might not be my own songs 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.799
 Jeffrey again 

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:59.159
 they take to the pump in a study that there are not next to me 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.870
 they are different composers and we made the selection there and 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.300
 then yes then I have to see which one doesn't suit you best and what I like best 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.090
 guy 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.110
 but most of those songs are from Jeffrey work but it 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.670
 Cadbury share has not yet been asked to accept new numbers 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.530
 sharpen 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.990
 and don't think he might have it worked in the future 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.920
 and there is no question yet of a duet with Marian again 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.570
 ing 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.930
 no, I do not think so 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.010
 d66 my manager and 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.450
 yes they say it is your career and you have to be the first to walk weird 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.780
 just go for it 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.810
 so they pointed out they are longing for and then buy and ever but there it seems 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.690
 no end was set 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.280
 he already has a title for singer 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.710
 no not 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.090
 admit the dan as a bouncer 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.880
 who comes there already more to support in our beautiful cars that 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.680
 friend 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.030
 yes there are a very large team 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.000
 i'm going the first week i'm only doing ten all noise and and destitute 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.150
 and friends come and weeks later 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.070
 And yes, of course, they are all there for mnm 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.760
 of statements 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.500
 finally you are cat is back noblesse oblige so it becomes something very special 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.279
 in oslo 

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:13.760
 but who knows who knows I don't know 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.749
 and what people do not test clothing on people and fight 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:20.629
 so that must all just fit out of them there we are going for it 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:21.879
 trying out 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.849
 and yes that I like the best 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.239
