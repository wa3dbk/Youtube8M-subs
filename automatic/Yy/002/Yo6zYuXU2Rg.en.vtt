know that'll give you a combination of

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.859 
know that'll give you a combination of
560<00:02:09.569> in<00:02:09.660> calories<00:02:10.170> and

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
560 in calories and

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.410 
560 in calories and
three<00:02:10.989> grams<00:02:11.290> but<00:02:12.129> you<00:02:12.879> can<00:02:13.090> break<00:02:13.239> it<00:02:13.390> down

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
three grams but you can break it down

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.210 
three grams but you can break it down
then<00:02:13.720> maybe<00:02:13.900> on<00:02:14.080> nonliving<00:02:14.620> days<00:02:14.920> if<00:02:15.069> I<00:02:15.159> do

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
then maybe on nonliving days if I do

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.460 
then maybe on nonliving days if I do
decide<00:02:15.459> to<00:02:15.640> take<00:02:15.849> it<00:02:16.090> I<00:02:16.150> just<00:02:16.180> take<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.690> for<00:02:16.900> two
