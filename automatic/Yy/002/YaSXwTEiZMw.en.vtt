00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
close-ups now another thing that I

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.300 
close-ups now another thing that I
noticed<00:01:23.189> inside<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.820> package<00:01:24.210> was<00:01:25.200> this<00:01:25.439> and

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
noticed inside the package was this and

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.109 
noticed inside the package was this and
this<00:01:26.970> isn't<00:01:27.150> made<00:01:27.750> by<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.930> pivo<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.939> this<00:01:29.939> would

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
this isn't made by a pivo and this would

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.319 
this isn't made by a pivo and this would
clip<00:01:30.360> over<00:01:30.960> your<00:01:31.590> monitor<00:01:32.579> or<00:01:32.759> your<00:01:33.180> laptop

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
clip over your monitor or your laptop

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:44.060 
clip over your monitor or your laptop
and<00:01:33.750> then<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:35.479> becomes<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:42.110> little<00:01:43.110> webcam<00:01:43.530> so

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
and then this becomes a little webcam so

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.710 
and then this becomes a little webcam so
you<00:01:44.610> can<00:01:44.729> take<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.180> few<00:01:45.360> different<00:01:45.450> places

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
you can take it a few different places

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.210 
you can take it a few different places
now<00:01:46.470> I'm<00:01:46.530> going<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.740> show<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.950> little<00:01:47.070> bit

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
take it from continuous focus and we can

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.630
