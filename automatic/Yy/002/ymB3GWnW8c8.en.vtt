00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
this off again to show you this little

00:02:52.010 --> 00:03:02.170 
this off again to show you this little
plus<00:02:52.340> rod<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:52.879> cool<00:02:53.150> wings<00:02:58.720> we<00:02:59.720> got<00:03:00.879> the<00:03:01.879> head

on<00:03:05.120> this<00:03:05.420> side<00:03:06.069> so<00:03:07.069> it<00:03:07.870> can<00:03:08.870> move<00:03:09.049> to<00:03:09.980> here<00:03:10.280> but

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
on this side so it can move to here but

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.400 
on this side so it can move to here but
it<00:03:10.760> can't<00:03:11.000> move<00:03:11.209> further<00:03:12.220> than<00:03:13.220> there<00:03:14.410> it

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
it can't move further than there it

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.659 
it can't move further than there it
won't<00:03:15.650> move<00:03:15.799> further<00:03:16.069> back

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:16.669

won't move further back
what's<00:03:17.329> up<00:03:17.480> cracking<00:03:17.840> off<00:03:17.989> so<00:03:18.549> that's<00:03:19.549> a<00:03:19.700> major

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
what's up cracking off so that's a major

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:20.650 
what's up cracking off so that's a major
problem

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
problem

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.180 
problem
Lego<00:03:21.489> could<00:03:22.489> have<00:03:22.639> made<00:03:22.819> it<00:03:22.970> sideways<00:03:23.389> and<00:03:24.190> it

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
Lego could have made it sideways and it

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.589 
Lego could have made it sideways and it
would<00:03:25.280> have<00:03:25.370> gotten<00:03:25.790> a<00:03:25.880> lot<00:03:26.000> more<00:03:26.060> poseability

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
would have gotten a lot more poseability

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.530 
would have gotten a lot more poseability
might<00:03:26.989> not<00:03:27.139> have<00:03:27.260> looked<00:03:27.500> as<00:03:27.739> good<00:03:28.419> but<00:03:29.419> I'd

multiple<00:05:17.960> ways<00:05:23.260> think<00:05:24.260> Jill<00:05:24.500> should<00:05:25.490> have<00:05:25.729> had

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
multiple ways think Jill should have had

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.110 
multiple ways think Jill should have had
another<00:05:26.270> piece<00:05:26.600> right<00:05:26.930> here<00:05:27.970> there<00:05:28.970> should

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
another piece right here there should

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.520 
another piece right here there should
have<00:05:29.150> been<00:05:29.240> a<00:05:29.539> little<00:05:29.690> piece<00:05:30.020> that<00:05:30.050> kind<00:05:30.440> of

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
have been a little piece that kind of

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.920 
have been a little piece that kind of
went<00:05:30.710> out<00:05:30.830> like<00:05:31.010> this<00:05:31.280> like<00:05:31.640> that<00:05:32.000> for<00:05:32.840> his

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
went out like this like that for his

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.600 
went out like this like that for his
antenna<00:05:33.350> because<00:05:33.620> he<00:05:33.800> has<00:05:33.950> antenna<00:05:34.340> in<00:05:34.520> the

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
antenna because he has antenna in the

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.400 
antenna because he has antenna in the
show<00:05:34.820> but<00:05:35.060> they<00:05:35.150> did<00:05:35.300> include<00:05:35.690> antenna<00:05:36.169> in

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
show but they did include antenna in

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.040 
show but they did include antenna in
this<00:05:36.560> set<00:05:36.830> so<00:05:36.860> I<00:05:37.400> don't<00:05:38.300> really<00:05:38.419> know<00:05:38.570> why<00:05:38.750> I

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
this set so I don't really know why I

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.540 
this set so I don't really know why I
mean<00:05:39.229> they<00:05:39.380> could<00:05:39.650> have<00:05:39.680> easily<00:05:39.890> done<00:05:40.160> that

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
mean they could have easily done that

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.370 
mean they could have easily done that
but<00:05:40.789> because<00:05:41.690> there's<00:05:41.810> actually<00:05:41.930> a<00:05:42.140> little

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
but because there's actually a little

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.680 
but because there's actually a little
Plus<00:05:42.650> rod<00:05:42.919> thing<00:05:43.190> right<00:05:43.400> there<00:05:43.669> and<00:05:44.270> they

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
Plus rod thing right there and they

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.450 
Plus rod thing right there and they
could<00:05:45.020> have<00:05:45.110> easily<00:05:45.260> put<00:05:45.680> that<00:05:45.860> in<00:05:46.039> but<00:05:46.280> they

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
could have easily put that in but they

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.129 
could have easily put that in but they
didn't<00:05:47.380> so<00:05:48.380> yeah<00:05:49.270> that's<00:05:50.270> the<00:05:50.419> pros<00:05:50.660> and<00:05:50.900> cons

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:51.139 
didn't so yeah that's the pros and cons

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:53.260 
didn't so yeah that's the pros and cons
and<00:05:51.440> good<00:05:51.650> things<00:05:51.919> about<00:05:52.100> Big<00:05:52.430> Chill<00:05:52.669> I<00:05:52.940> do
