00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.200

 even gives passed usual the guys who is 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.170
 totally contrary this is a set-up 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.380
 bad time not there more things 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.790
 possible and until then do this 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.800
 also that the staff asked me this 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.079

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.969

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.809
 get as much written on it reach 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.260
 this point 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.730
 So I'll come here for you here at 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.850
 first workout in my room and sixth 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.620
 Comes in the bedroom is not very spacious between 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.480
 quotes at the time of my bed with the bed 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.969
 therefore occupies a large part of the 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.010
 space but it's all snug accommodated 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.680
 I think it's very cool that you have 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.920
 tv console ride x tv series 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.229
 the walking dead the walking dead man 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.030
 was to watch the cartoon network that 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.250
 It's a cool thing I do not draw. 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.020
 excited is that we have a friendly atmosphere 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.240
 work and what if the computer 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.310
 stay here my coffee table is the step 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.930
 great for the weather here but let me 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.509
 Talk about this relic that I have 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.970
 here if here a well received old you 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.799
 can see gradient mark this thing 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.270
 Hold on to two speakers of this kind. 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.790
 here and you can see that it is very 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.720
 but it's a sound box with a 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.570
 speaker around 350 watts rms is expensive is 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.390
 fashion this box and we have this 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.070
 relic here the thing here galera is a 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.530
 fully analogue old relic if 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.000
 our strength is a power and named the 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.290
 judge on the computer to listen to the songs 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.579
 huh 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.100
 and here we have my computer desk 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.990
 simple is the house that pulls that I hate 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.920
 which would not have room for the t4 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.240
 with bad donations and ps prefer to buy 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.829
 one of these here 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.570
 is that they used to send me a printer 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.270
 here I went through a printer in the other 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.530
 sound box to put this second 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.780
 monitor guys I 'm not 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.670
 using yet because I'm without a 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.020
 Cable display can put the plate 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.410
 video but I'll buy 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.330
 and it is a cable it was possible to use two 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.640
 monitors here I will only use in the same live 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.690
 time a monitor is small 15 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.790
 inches with a resolution of 1366 by 768 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.410
 to a very simple monitor even that is 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.000
 even good because my video card nor 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.130
 I can handle higher resolution so today I 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.810
 I went with the monitor's default resolution, right? 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:38.760
 it never bothered me 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:41.640
 we have here is mine is small to be 7 271 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.620
 I'm mistaken, it's serious about bottles. 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.810
 right there to here that is 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.710
 alloy was ejected from a pit and 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.300
 batman 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.610
 when making a video with blue device 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.140
 from the year before we do not have my keyboard 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.720
 that you can see that waiting in the shade 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.050
 the foot is a simple keyboard that is 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.930
 trek, even the oldest guy is okay 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.330

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.090
 The message is that we have my mouse. 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.150

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.200
 well guys, if I had a super better 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.780

 of xbox has nothing interesting here and 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.340
 here we have got the good part is that the 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.290
 my computer is a little dark here 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.090
 no one is able to see but I 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.320
 I'll take it from there to show you 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.330

 Personal removed here third place there 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.040
 as you can see here 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:07.440
 hd 500 gb I use is to store 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.170
 type the videos and other things 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.820
 and the rest hd of 500 gb that has on my pc 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.400
 serves to let the games installed 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:17.070

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.290

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.610
 from the back and here we have guys 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.270
 my pc that you can see it stay 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.840
 open on both sides because 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.879
 This case is very small and it is a 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.500
 Cooling down too bad for the 

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:34.970
 Cabinet size ne 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.159
 You can look here in the office. 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.750
 tiny 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:40.639
 It's horrible for this very office. 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:46.009
 little he because he has inside him 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:48.289
 Let's show you around here that 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:53.000
 the machine inside is what you 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:59.599
 can see we have here is flex of 1 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.490

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:02.569
 good this battle and girl was what 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.520
 I bought her 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:07.669
 although the power it has is 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.740
 price the size is very good is 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:11.449
 I already bought the computer 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.460
 thinking the law in the background we have 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:16.009
 that piece that I bought from the internet 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.500
 It's because miami is the motherboard of the 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:20.180
 The problem that we have here is my course. 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.729

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.960

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:25.520
 sinks here 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.340
 This is what takes up my office space . 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.289
 was what allows what did not allow 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.590
 close the lid we have the hd 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:35.719

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:40.630
 components 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:43.279
 so basically guys this is the 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.710
 what does it take all the space in my 

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:49.039

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.669
 My computer is not

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:08.690
 This office here is temporary. 

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:10.430
