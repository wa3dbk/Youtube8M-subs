00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 energie and divide this method into three 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.000
 pages 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.269
 The first part is you form a 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.910
 cube layer that you can do 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.299
 a speech is not in fact you do not 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.850
 need to do this can do everything 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.699
 using that sequence I showed 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.980
 right for it and would be the space but 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.930
 first layer is simple you do and 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.760
 It gets faster to do it this way then 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.060
 I think it's worth it 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.540
 then it will work you will choose 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:36.450
 two colors for you to do in the end I 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.579
 I'll choose the yellow and white 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.610
 Okay, so I always leave it yellow on top. 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:46.680
 and then I chose yellow and white and I 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:49.140
 I'll make this middle layer here. 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.219
 that is, the parts that do not have 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.230
 yellow or white that will come here 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.690
 how will you make you will look 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.590
 here in the top layer or the layer of 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.539
 low on yellow white and you go 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.970
 look for parts that are neither yellow 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.810
 nor white for example the one here the baby 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.939
 blue 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.250
 if she has neither yellow nor white 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.939
 it is not from the top layer of the layer of the 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.400
 half that is going to make an attack on has 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:23.240
 A blue one that I'm going to make I'll turn on 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:25.950
 up until you find the blue found blue 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.229
 near where she'll have to stay and 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.720
 now I'm going to have to take this part of 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.670
 front where it looks great to play 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.939
 side to side 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.790
 that's where I'm going to play here, it's not playing 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.460
 by now she was beating red with 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.490
 red I have already put a piece on the 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.710
 beauty place and that's what I'm going to do 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.340
 with the four rock pieces another one 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.130
 oh orange and green 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.240
 I'll do what I'll get up here. 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.939
 turning the orange find orange 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.310
 in controlling the orange now has to 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.600
 take this piece on one side or for him 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.960
 get out to that same already along with green 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.960
 two pieces 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.060
 is not this the memory has yellow is 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.510
 this one is this has no background 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:20.350
 red green again or turning here 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:23.380
 up until you find who the green is now 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.900
 have to play logic have to play here 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.860
 only when I do what happened 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.830
 take an orange from the place you see 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.270
 so now I've already put two 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.680
 opposite yet 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.170
 the other two that I will put 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.610
 this problem happens but it does not 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.780
 problem he will do 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:47.500
 Look, I'll put it here instead. 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.720
 I put it and then take it away from the place so that I can 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.960
 back green orange for his place 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.420
 So I in box is in the place. 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.570
 Okay, and then I have to get this done. 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.220
 here where she got here so much 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.280
 Do it if she lies here. 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:07.900
 I took it there, I'll go back the one I had. 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.750
 oe taken back from here to there place pro 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.490
 pomegranate continued with red and blue 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.790
 Red and green 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:19.150
 only missing now is the orange and blue 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.280
 and white yellow white tie to 15 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.280
 keep nothing further so let's go downstairs 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.550
 O attack but it's the same thing today. 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.560
 until you reach orange with orange and then 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.170
 To fix a place, I 'll have to 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.930
 do this and I see that I took the 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.180
 laranjipe type already had a certain everything 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.630
 well, then no problem doing that 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:46.300
 As long as I get back, it fits it 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:51.550
 place takes away from here in orange 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:53.890
 green and come back here 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.580
 I've already put all four pieces in the 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.310
 place 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.440
 this is the first step there are some 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.660
 things that happen that I can give 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.030
 a tip for you all and sometimes you can 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:07.420
 for the first time, for example, you can 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:10.120
 this happens with a play here 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.520
 I already put this piece here already I put 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.970
 This and I 'll look for parts up there. 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.220
 Because still 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.739
 that's okay right white background and 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.450
 yellow has none serving white 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.000
 yellow white yellow has none 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:25.780
 which also serves because the parts are 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.540
 wrong in her place, see you 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.900
 There's one that's good from here to me. 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:34.330
 Can I take one up? 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.400
 The one that was wrong, right? 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:40.210
 and I'll put it in her place since 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:43.960
 attacked green happens they are exchanging 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:46.360
 in which another good now can happen 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.370
 something else can happen as well 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.090
 here looks I 'm with the parts in place 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:55.000
 the two are right and two are right 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.370
 wrong, what am I going to do? 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.700
 you have to take one of them put in 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.350
 place and then bring another for example 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.630
 that I have to play with the one I 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:08.200
 I'll do is get out of here, then the 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:11.380
 It plays up there turn up for 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:14.140
 get out back so you do not take this one out 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:17.830
 that I have already arranged and here we go 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.630
 here is green orange and then the same thing 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.040
 I was already old guy has to 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.890
 do it here 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.460
 Only I took this one from the place so take it 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:31.060
 This one from here I just fit 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:33.940
 I turn blue and come back from here when 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:37.450
 fit in place the other rose and how 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:40.510
 there in her place blue with the globe 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:44.970
 now I have to get back here with blue 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:47.470
 red the red and the blue orange 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:51.310
 western night that I just fit 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:55.960
 in the place there again blue with orange and 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:59.020
 from here, good fit, all over again 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:01.540
 The last thing that is bad is also the 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.560
 The next I can put things to you. 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.690
 in place 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.710
 and then it happens to face a piece in the place 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.100
 her 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.750
 only reversed but this idea even of 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.960
 The other one I just made that I 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:16.660
 I have to do is get him out of here so 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:20.380
 Lift up here, for example, throw up and 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:23.530
 back with a site that is already tidy and 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.760
 there it is until the place is done by 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.130
 play here to there 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.650
 align with the green but how I took the 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:32.380
 blue and red is just at home already 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.840
 who takes it in place to return the 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.410
 red and blue and back first with 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.650
 green 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:40.090
 I'm done, the first one in the middle is 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:44.910
 first step 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.910
 beauty now let's go second step
