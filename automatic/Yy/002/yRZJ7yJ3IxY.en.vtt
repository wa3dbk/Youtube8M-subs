00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
noticeable I guess it's noticeable that

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.570 
noticeable I guess it's noticeable that
it<00:05:53.570> doesn't<00:05:53.840> look<00:05:53.990> like<00:05:54.139> I<00:05:54.260> had<00:05:54.470> braces<00:05:54.710> on<00:05:55.010> so

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
it doesn't look like I had braces on so

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.100 
it doesn't look like I had braces on so
what<00:05:55.970> I'm<00:05:56.060> gonna<00:05:56.210> do<00:05:56.360> is<00:05:56.479> I'm<00:05:56.599> gonna<00:05:56.659> use<00:05:56.960> the

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use the

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.620 
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use the
money<00:05:57.289> that<00:05:57.530> I<00:05:57.740> made<00:05:58.159> from<00:05:58.190> a<00:05:58.430> cinema<00:05:58.760> to<00:05:59.419> get
