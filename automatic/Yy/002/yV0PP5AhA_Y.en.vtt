absorption from the soil while it needs

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.690 
absorption from the soil while it needs

one or two days with a foliar spray the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.790 
one or two days with a foliar spray the
plant<00:01:47.000> utilizes<00:01:47.840> hardly<00:01:48.290> three<00:01:48.500> to<00:01:48.650> five

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
plant utilizes hardly three to five

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.980 
plant utilizes hardly three to five
percent<00:01:49.190> of<00:01:49.340> the<00:01:49.430> nutrients<00:01:50.000> applied<00:01:50.660> to<00:01:50.870> the

percent of the nutrients applied to the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.340 
percent of the nutrients applied to the

hence<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:56.360> foliar<00:01:56.750> spray<00:01:57.110> saves<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.160> cost

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
crops will give same yield if the foliar
