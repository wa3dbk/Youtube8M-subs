00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
ROM for me this is just the joystick

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.000 
ROM for me this is just the joystick
test<00:00:12.450> ROM<00:00:14.299> for<00:00:15.299> anybody<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.630> doesn't<00:00:15.809> know

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
test ROM for anybody that doesn't know

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.130 
test ROM for anybody that doesn't know
they<00:00:17.010> tend<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.279> put<00:00:17.430> out<00:00:17.550> test<00:00:17.850> carts<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.630> test

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
they tend to put out test carts to test

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.099 
they tend to put out test carts to test
joysticks<00:00:19.859> all<00:00:20.250> kinds<00:00:20.609> of<00:00:20.670> stuff<00:00:20.880> on<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.779> NES

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
joysticks all kinds of stuff on the NES

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.929 
joysticks all kinds of stuff on the NES
in<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:23.070> particular<00:00:23.369> ROM<00:00:23.930> it<00:00:24.930> was<00:00:25.050> us<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.470> was

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
in this particular ROM it was us it was

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.950 
in this particular ROM it was us it was
separated<00:00:26.939> from<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:28.019> larger<00:00:29.000> test<00:00:30.000> cart<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.750> it

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
separated from a larger test cart so it

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.040 
separated from a larger test cart so it
all<00:00:31.170> does<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.560> test<00:00:31.800> joysticks<00:00:32.460> which<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.690> just

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
all does is test joysticks which I just

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.240 
all does is test joysticks which I just
call<00:00:34.230> them<00:00:34.290> controllers<00:00:34.910> but<00:00:36.920> there<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.129> a

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
call them controllers but there is a

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.580 
call them controllers but there is a
menu<00:00:38.550> which<00:00:39.059> i<00:00:39.270> think<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.930> completely

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
menu which i think is completely

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.170 
menu which i think is completely
unnecessary<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.489> if<00:00:41.550> somebody<00:00:41.850> could<00:00:41.969> hack

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
unnecessary so if somebody could hack

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.959 
unnecessary so if somebody could hack
this<00:00:42.360> ROM<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.899> where<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.140> goes<00:00:43.290> straight<00:00:43.739> to

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
this ROM to where it goes straight to

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.470 
this ROM to where it goes straight to
four<00:00:44.969> player<00:00:45.950> tests<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.000> all<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.300> mean<00:00:48.450> I

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
four player tests this is all I mean I

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.850 
four player tests this is all I mean I
just<00:00:48.719> wanted<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.020> boot<00:00:49.230> up<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.440> go<00:00:49.590> straight

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
just wanted to boot up and go straight

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.639 
just wanted to boot up and go straight
to<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.219> don't<00:00:50.399> need<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.910> menu<00:00:51.440> but<00:00:52.440> a

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
to this I don't need the menu but a

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.639 
to this I don't need the menu but a
problem<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.250> just<00:00:53.550> found<00:00:53.789> was<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.649> it's

having trouble reading this aftermarket

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.170 
having trouble reading this aftermarket
controller<00:00:59.190> and<00:01:01.399> there<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> there's

another<00:01:03.239> test<00:01:03.750> cart<00:01:05.570> I<00:01:06.570> think<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.680> one<00:01:07.860> is

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
another test cart I think this one is

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.929 
another test cart I think this one is
pulled<00:01:08.250> from<00:01:09.409> what<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:11.180> MTF<00:01:12.500> and<00:01:13.760> the<00:01:14.760> one<00:01:14.909> on

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
pulled from what the MTF and the one on

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.700 
pulled from what the MTF and the one on
the<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.240> tf2<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.689> had<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.960> put<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.229> power<00:01:16.680> back

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
the in tf2 I had to put the power back

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.240 
the in tf2 I had to put the power back
on<00:01:17.070> also<00:01:18.030> has<00:01:18.299> trouble<00:01:18.780> with<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:19.049> but<00:01:19.290> if<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.100> go

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
on also has trouble with it but if I go

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.020 
on also has trouble with it but if I go
into<00:01:20.460> normal<00:01:21.119> controller<00:01:21.990> test

into normal controller test
dog-bone<00:01:24.030> works<00:01:24.930> fine<00:01:25.229> but<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.100> aftermarket

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
dog-bone works fine but the aftermarket

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
one does not work at all nothing but on

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.149 
one does not work at all nothing but on
the<00:01:31.770> menu<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.340> can<00:01:32.520> select<00:01:33.500> and<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.560> can<00:01:34.740> start<00:01:34.979> if

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
the menu I can select and I can start if

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.210 
the menu I can select and I can start if
I<00:01:35.310> go<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.490> four<00:01:35.759> player<00:01:36.530> it<00:01:37.530> works<00:01:37.740> fine<00:01:38.009> it

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
I go to four player it works fine it

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.530 
I go to four player it works fine it
doesn't<00:01:38.369> matter<00:01:38.579> which<00:01:38.729> controller<00:01:39.150> port<00:01:39.479> I

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
doesn't matter which controller port I

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.410 
doesn't matter which controller port I
try<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.840> works<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.740> same<00:01:40.920> either<00:01:41.189> way<00:01:41.360> but<00:01:42.360> it

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
try it works the same either way but it

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.609 
try it works the same either way but it
just<00:01:42.540> doesn't<00:01:42.689> make<00:01:42.840> sense<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.229> me<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.500> it

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
just doesn't make sense to me that it

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.139 
just doesn't make sense to me that it
works<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.189> poor<00:01:44.399> player<00:01:44.640> not<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.000> two

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
works in the poor player not the two

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.859 
works in the poor player not the two
player<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.689> don't<00:01:46.409> get<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:47.390> so

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.849 

see<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.679> is<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.039> ROM<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.579> normally<00:01:53.670> use

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 
see this is the ROM that I normally use

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:55.999 
see this is the ROM that I normally use
okay

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
okay

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:05.929 
okay
MTF<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.820> test<00:01:57.240> part<00:01:59.569> alright<00:02:04.520> when<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.549> go<00:02:05.729> down

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
MTF to test part alright when I go down

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.680 
MTF to test part alright when I go down
to<00:02:05.969> control<00:02:06.869> test<00:02:07.140> on<00:02:07.259> this<00:02:07.439> one<00:02:07.970> on<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.509> dog

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
to control test on this one on the dog

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.039 
to control test on this one on the dog
bone<00:02:10.099> it'll<00:02:11.099> read<00:02:11.430> each<00:02:11.640> button<00:02:12.060> push<00:02:12.629> and

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
bone it'll read each button push and

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.559 
bone it'll read each button push and
change<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:13.980> read<00:02:14.160> but<00:02:15.000> on<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.209> aftermarket

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
change it read but on the aftermarket

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.100 
change it read but on the aftermarket
one<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:16.410> reads<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:17.599> but<00:02:18.599> it's<00:02:18.720> not<00:02:18.870> changing

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
one it reads it but it's not changing

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.839 
one it reads it but it's not changing
the<00:02:19.410> color<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.950> think<00:02:20.250> that's<00:02:20.370> why<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:20.549> other

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
the color I think that's why the other

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.130 
the color I think that's why the other
test<00:02:21.090> carts<00:02:21.299> maybe<00:02:21.510> having<00:02:21.750> fun<00:02:21.930> with<00:02:22.110> it

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
test carts maybe having fun with it

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.100 
test carts maybe having fun with it
maybe<00:02:22.980> this<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.370> like<00:02:23.549> just<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.569> really<00:02:24.780> fast

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
maybe this is like just a really fast

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.960 
maybe this is like just a really fast
turbo<00:02:25.769> on<00:02:25.950> all<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.220> other<00:02:26.340> buttons<00:02:26.549> and<00:02:26.880> a

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
turbo on all the other buttons and a

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.180 
turbo on all the other buttons and a
normal<00:02:27.690> turbo<00:02:28.019> on<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.319> turbo<00:02:28.620> buttons<00:02:28.980> I

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
normal turbo on the turbo buttons I

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.509 
normal turbo on the turbo buttons I
don't<00:02:29.459> know<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:29.819> just<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:31.220> know<00:02:32.220> this<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:32.489> a

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
don't know it just you know this is a

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.960 
don't know it just you know this is a
turbo<00:02:33.739> this<00:02:34.739> is<00:02:34.890> regular<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:36.870> on<00:02:36.989> a<00:02:37.079> dog<00:02:37.290> bone

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
turbo this is regular and on a dog bone

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.360 
turbo this is regular and on a dog bone
sounds<00:02:38.970> exactly<00:02:39.239> the<00:02:39.450> same<00:02:39.599> so<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:39.780> don't<00:02:39.989> know

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
sounds exactly the same so I don't know

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.580 
sounds exactly the same so I don't know
it's<00:02:41.370> just<00:02:41.489> a<00:02:41.640> theory<00:02:41.940> but<00:02:42.450> if<00:02:43.049> someone<00:02:43.349> get

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
it's just a theory but if someone get

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.490 
it's just a theory but if someone get
back<00:02:43.769> get<00:02:44.040> back<00:02:44.099> with<00:02:44.370> me<00:02:44.519> on<00:02:44.670> how<00:02:44.819> to<00:02:45.349> get<00:02:46.349> rid

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
back get back with me on how to get rid

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.170 
back get back with me on how to get rid
of<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:46.680> menu<00:02:46.950> altogether<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:47.940> just<00:02:48.090> go

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
of that menu altogether and just go

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.509 
of that menu altogether and just go
right<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.870> four<00:02:49.110> player<00:02:49.349> test<00:02:49.680> cart<00:02:49.950> that

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
right to the four player test cart that

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.660 
right to the four player test cart that
would<00:02:50.670> be<00:02:50.819> amazing<00:02:51.209> and<00:02:51.599> be<00:02:52.099> so<00:02:53.099> helpful<00:02:53.370> for

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
would be amazing and be so helpful for

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.479 
would be amazing and be so helpful for
me<00:02:53.790> because<00:02:54.680> for<00:02:55.680> instance<00:02:55.980> when<00:02:56.130> you<00:02:56.190> put<00:02:56.370> in

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
me because for instance when you put in

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.050 
me because for instance when you put in
a<00:02:56.639> bad<00:02:56.880> controller<00:02:58.010> you<00:02:59.010> can't<00:02:59.280> get<00:02:59.670> it<00:02:59.790> to

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
a bad controller you can't get it to

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.879 
a bad controller you can't get it to
select<00:03:00.329> or<00:03:00.600> start<00:03:00.959> but<00:03:01.319> the<00:03:01.440> other<00:03:01.560> buttons

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
select or start but the other buttons

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:05.809 
select or start but the other buttons
work<00:03:02.160> well<00:03:03.950> that<00:03:04.950> usually<00:03:05.310> means<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:05.549> have<00:03:05.730> to

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
work well that usually means I have to

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.220 
work well that usually means I have to
have<00:03:05.910> a<00:03:05.940> good<00:03:06.120> controller<00:03:06.540> plugged<00:03:06.989> into<00:03:07.139> the

in these four it's kind of a pain in the
butt<00:03:24.780> but<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.169> block<00:03:25.410> it's<00:03:26.010> just<00:03:26.280> something

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
little that I could change that would

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.830 
little that I could change that would
make<00:03:28.319> my<00:03:28.500> life<00:03:28.530> just<00:03:28.829> a<00:03:28.980> little<00:03:29.340> bit<00:03:29.430> easier

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840

take the time to learn it right now
maybe<00:03:34.769> in<00:03:34.919> the<00:03:34.980> future<00:03:35.099> we'll<00:03:35.459> see<00:03:35.669> you<00:03:35.760> but
