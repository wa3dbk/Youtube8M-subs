00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
really hoping for something a little bit

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.600 
really hoping for something a little bit
better<00:01:22.290> than<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.680> let's<00:01:23.130> see<00:01:23.250> if<00:01:23.340> we<00:01:23.460> can

better than that let's see if we can

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.120 
better than that let's see if we can
come<00:01:23.759> out<00:01:23.790> strong<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.479> we've<00:01:24.869> got<00:01:25.080> number<00:01:25.530> 96

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
come out strong and we've got number 96

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.010 
come out strong and we've got number 96
the<00:01:26.369> dark<00:01:26.729> mist<00:01:27.770> okay<00:01:29.509> at<00:01:30.509> least<00:01:30.720> we<00:01:30.900> got

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020
