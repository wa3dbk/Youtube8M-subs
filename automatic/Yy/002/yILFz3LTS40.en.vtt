00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.250
 little bit more comfortable because like this route 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.250

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.600
 These are the main ingredients 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.449

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.710
 soft a little more powerful tropez leaf 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.470
 but good I bought soft because 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.500
 speak spicy I do not like much 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.450
 then comics are here and then 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.740
 the pancakes and I extracted it a little 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.409
 with a little bit of tomato 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.200
 what grated success we clean all the 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.200
 vegetable and now let's proceed to 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.420
 cut it little by little as you can read 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.780
 that Mr. camera 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.210
 the foundations of the foundations have 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.549
 these little nuggets are obviously the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.549
 they remove because we need them 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:41.659
 the first pepper I cut myself from this 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:44.420
 way doing this error 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:50.060
 but the second pepper we have 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.979
 cut off so it's already open 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.619
 therefore you already know not the cuts 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.230
 doing this cut them like this and so you can 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:01.390
 remove all the nuggets before 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.390

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.960
 guerrillas in the pan 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.990

 we have already made the vegetables and now 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:36.760
 let's take 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.350
 the chick is worth it we miss the last 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.980
 moment so that we do not get too much 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:45.209
 we have already cut 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.209

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:53.319
 we have already cut 20 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.939
 lettuce and tomato 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.889
 we have cut a lot because we are not going 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:00.710
 to put the whole garden 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:03.090
 we have here 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:06.209
 what we had done before about 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.599
 But salt, remember the salt 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.599

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.540
 I'm going to teach you how to prepare a 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.020
 taco because many of you do not know 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.020
 do what 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.670
 once heated the pancake 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.720
 we will throw the vegetables and the chicken and 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:27.760
 then the cheese does not stain wey what 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.870
 good looking has this taco remained 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.870
 beautiful you 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.500
 as we do not want our tummy to 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.080
 be hungry we have to close well 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.249
 this taco so that food does not 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.889
 spreads us or fall over there 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:47.079
