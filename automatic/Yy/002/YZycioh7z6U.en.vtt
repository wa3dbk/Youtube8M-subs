00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
build a row of Pistons two blocks down

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:23.990 
build a row of Pistons two blocks down
from<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:16.939> around<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.830> like<00:01:20.330> that<00:01:22.640> yeah<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:23.880> that

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
from it around it like that yeah so that

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.090 
from it around it like that yeah so that
it's<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.509> middle<00:01:24.540> right<00:01:24.869> here<00:01:25.170> then<00:01:25.770> you

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
it's in the middle right here then you

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.070 
it's in the middle right here then you
put<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.580> ring<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:27.060> blocks<00:01:27.360> around<00:01:27.630> the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
put a ring of blocks around the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.270 
put a ring of blocks around the
enchanting<00:01:28.650> round<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.610> sticky<00:01:29.880> pistons<00:01:30.329> to

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
enchanting round of sticky pistons to

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.969 
enchanting round of sticky pistons to
put<00:01:32.280> your<00:01:32.430> wiring<00:01:32.640> up<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.560> when<00:01:34.560> you're<00:01:34.740> done

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
put your wiring up and when you're done

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.100 
put your wiring up and when you're done
with<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.430> be<00:01:35.759> sure<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.000> raise<00:01:36.390> those<00:01:36.659> two

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
with that be sure to raise those two

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.149 
with that be sure to raise those two
corners<00:01:37.530> up<00:01:37.710> one<00:01:38.130> block<00:01:38.340> then<00:01:39.240> two<00:01:39.900> blocks<00:01:40.200> out

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
corners up one block then two blocks out

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.289 
corners up one block then two blocks out
this<00:01:41.880> way

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
this way

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.870 
this way
one<00:01:42.570> block<00:01:42.810> up<00:01:43.079> here<00:01:43.439> three<00:01:44.159> blocks<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.820> way

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
one block up here three blocks this way

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.260 
one block up here three blocks this way
one<00:01:45.360> on<00:01:45.509> top<00:01:45.689> one<00:01:46.020> up<00:01:46.680> here<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.060> very

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
one on top one up here this is a very

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.760 
one on top one up here this is a very
peculiar<00:01:48.630> shape<00:01:48.930> but<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.470> shape<00:01:49.649> you

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
peculiar shape but this is the shape you

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.800 
peculiar shape but this is the shape you
need<00:01:49.920> for<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.610> work<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.540> have<00:01:51.750> to

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
need for it to work so you have to

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.770 
need for it to work so you have to
remember<00:01:52.100> memorize<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.280> basically<00:01:53.850> then<00:01:54.570> you

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
remember memorize it basically then you

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.539 
remember memorize it basically then you
put<00:01:54.960> your<00:01:55.049> wiring<00:01:55.590> start<00:01:56.280> with<00:01:56.369> two

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
put your wiring start with two

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.270 
put your wiring start with two
comparators<00:01:56.969> up<00:01:57.270> here<00:01:57.509> one<00:01:57.780> down<00:01:57.960> here<00:01:58.290> two<00:01:59.009> on

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
comparators up here one down here two on

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.170 
comparators up here one down here two on
the<00:01:59.880> sides<00:02:00.240> here<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.490> repeaters<00:02:02.490> coming<00:02:03.030> out

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
the sides here and repeaters coming out

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.670 
the sides here and repeaters coming out
of<00:02:03.479> these<00:02:03.689> blocks<00:02:04.170> in<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.530> corners<00:02:05.960> then<00:02:06.960> put

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
of these blocks in the corners then put
