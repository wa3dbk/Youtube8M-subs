Lego so that's how I ended up here my
first<00:00:37.850> legal<00:00:38.059> model<00:00:38.330> was<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:38.870> star<00:00:39.140> wars

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
first legal model was the star wars

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
at that time also was the biggest

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.090 
at that time also was the biggest
biggest<00:00:43.970> legal<00:00:44.449> model<00:00:44.570> this<00:00:45.229> is<00:00:45.409> the<00:00:45.620> brand

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
biggest legal model this is the brand

biggest legal model this is the brand
new<00:00:46.250> 2012<00:00:47.000> Star<00:00:47.930> Wars<00:00:47.960> b-wing<00:00:48.650> starfighter

new 2012 Star Wars b-wing starfighter

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.509 
new 2012 Star Wars b-wing starfighter
and<00:00:49.960> when<00:00:50.960> I<00:00:50.989> got<00:00:51.290> the<00:00:51.409> assignment<00:00:51.949> to<00:00:52.220> do<00:00:52.370> this

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519 
and when I got the assignment to do this

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:54.850 
and when I got the assignment to do this
model<00:00:52.850> I<00:00:52.970> started<00:00:53.720> doing<00:00:53.870> a<00:00:54.140> lot<00:00:54.409> of<00:00:54.470> research

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
model I started doing a lot of research

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.180 
model I started doing a lot of research
and<00:00:55.250> I<00:00:56.059> had<00:00:56.900> to<00:00:57.019> define<00:00:57.320> a<00:00:57.379> scale<00:00:57.799> of<00:00:58.070> this

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
and I had to define a scale of this

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.130 
and I had to define a scale of this
model<00:00:58.400> since<00:00:58.879> there's<00:00:59.089> no<00:00:59.269> minifigures<00:00:59.750> in<00:01:00.019> it

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
model since there's no minifigures in it

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.700 
model since there's no minifigures in it
the<00:01:00.260> scale<00:01:00.500> was<00:01:00.769> up<00:01:01.670> to<00:01:01.909> me<00:01:02.059> so<00:01:02.690> I<00:01:02.720> did<00:01:03.440> a<00:01:03.470> lot<00:01:03.650> of

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
the scale was up to me so I did a lot of

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.010 
the scale was up to me so I did a lot of
research<00:01:04.070> in<00:01:04.309> our<00:01:04.489> element<00:01:04.909> portfolio<00:01:05.630> and

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
research in our element portfolio and

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.320 
research in our element portfolio and
had<00:01:06.650> to<00:01:06.799> find<00:01:07.040> some<00:01:07.250> elements<00:01:07.670> that<00:01:07.850> would<00:01:08.090> be

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
had to find some elements that would be

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.300 
had to find some elements that would be
appropriate<00:01:08.780> for<00:01:09.020> this<00:01:09.229> one<00:01:09.470> the<00:01:10.010> biggest

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
appropriate for this one the biggest

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.880 
appropriate for this one the biggest
challenge<00:01:10.640> was<00:01:10.760> to<00:01:10.820> do<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:11.090> cockpit<00:01:11.540> part

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
challenge was to do the cockpit part

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.529 
challenge was to do the cockpit part
because<00:01:12.890> it's<00:01:13.070> round<00:01:13.310> and<00:01:13.520> we<00:01:14.149> don't<00:01:14.299> have

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:14.539 
because it's round and we don't have

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:18.670 
because it's round and we don't have
that<00:01:14.780> many<00:01:14.899> round<00:01:15.500> elements<00:01:16.149> so<00:01:17.149> I<00:01:17.539> found<00:01:17.930> two

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
that many round elements so I found two

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.830 
that many round elements so I found two
motorcycle<00:01:19.369> wheels<00:01:19.549> and<00:01:20.060> some<00:01:20.659> old

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
motorcycle wheels and some old

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.899 
motorcycle wheels and some old
caterpillar<00:01:21.289> tracks<00:01:21.619> and<00:01:22.130> some<00:01:22.369> power<00:01:22.579> minus

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
caterpillar tracks and some power minus

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.359 
caterpillar tracks and some power minus
wheels<00:01:23.119> that<00:01:23.479> would<00:01:23.659> would<00:01:24.530> be<00:01:24.560> appropriate<00:01:24.920> i

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
wheels that would would be appropriate i

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.679 
wheels that would would be appropriate i
also<00:01:26.149> found<00:01:26.390> his<00:01:26.630> canopy<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:27.490> then<00:01:28.490> that<00:01:29.179> kind

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
also found his canopy and then that kind

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.219 
also found his canopy and then that kind
of<00:01:29.780> defined<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:30.320> scale<00:01:30.590> and<00:01:30.909> the<00:01:31.909> rest<00:01:32.119> i<00:01:32.479> also

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
of defined the scale and the rest i also

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:34.660 
of defined the scale and the rest i also
had<00:01:33.439> to<00:01:33.560> find<00:01:33.770> elements<00:01:33.950> that<00:01:34.189> would<00:01:34.340> be

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
had to find elements that would be

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.599 
had to find elements that would be
appropriate<00:01:34.909> for<00:01:35.649> but<00:01:36.649> we<00:01:36.829> do<00:01:37.189> have<00:01:37.369> a<00:01:37.429> lot<00:01:37.549> of

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
appropriate for but we do have a lot of

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:39.340 
appropriate for but we do have a lot of
angle<00:01:37.999> plates<00:01:38.210> in<00:01:38.600> different<00:01:38.960> angles<00:01:39.289> and

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
angle plates in different angles and

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.310 
angle plates in different angles and
stuff<00:01:39.469> so<00:01:40.070> that<00:01:40.579> wasn't<00:01:41.299> that<00:01:41.420> hard<00:01:41.630> these

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
stuff so that wasn't that hard these

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.830 
stuff so that wasn't that hard these
caterpillar<00:01:42.829> tracks<00:01:43.100> up<00:01:43.280> here<00:01:43.340> are

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
caterpillar tracks up here are

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.929 
caterpillar tracks up here are
originally<00:01:44.840> from<00:01:44.840> a<00:01:45.249> 1970s<00:01:46.249> technique

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
originally from a 1970s technique

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.029 
originally from a 1970s technique
bulldozer<00:01:47.299> and<00:01:47.630> have<00:01:48.200> never<00:01:48.469> been<00:01:48.740> produced

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
bulldozer and have never been produced

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:50.770 
bulldozer and have never been produced
in<00:01:49.189> other<00:01:49.340> colors<00:01:49.670> than<00:01:49.820> black<00:01:49.850> but<00:01:50.539> in<00:01:50.659> this

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
in other colors than black but in this

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.989 
in other colors than black but in this
model<00:01:51.109> they<00:01:51.229> are<00:01:51.320> featured<00:01:51.649> in<00:01:51.740> light<00:01:51.979> grey<00:01:52.219> so

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:52.999 
model they are featured in light grey so

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:54.520 
model they are featured in light grey so
I<00:01:53.030> guess<00:01:53.210> it<00:01:53.539> will<00:01:53.630> be<00:01:53.810> really<00:01:53.990> unique<00:01:54.380> for

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
I guess it will be really unique for

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.679 
I guess it will be really unique for
this<00:01:54.649> model<00:01:54.829> this<00:01:55.340> model<00:01:55.549> doesn't<00:01:56.329> have<00:01:56.569> that

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
this model this model doesn't have that

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.649 
this model this model doesn't have that
big<00:01:57.399> part<00:01:58.399> of<00:01:58.549> the<00:01:58.700> movies<00:01:59.030> so<00:01:59.299> it<00:01:59.390> doesn't

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
big part of the movies so it doesn't

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.599 
big part of the movies so it doesn't
have<00:01:59.749> that<00:01:59.780> many<00:02:00.049> functions<00:02:00.619> but<00:02:00.829> it<00:02:01.399> has

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:01.609 
have that many functions but it has

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:03.999 
have that many functions but it has
vulnerable<00:02:02.149> wings<00:02:02.420> and<00:02:02.810> a<00:02:03.079> rotating<00:02:03.590> cockpit

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
vulnerable wings and a rotating cockpit

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:11.170 
vulnerable wings and a rotating cockpit
and<00:02:06.969> when<00:02:07.969> the<00:02:08.240> Starfighter<00:02:08.840> flies<00:02:09.170> in<00:02:10.180> space

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
and when the Starfighter flies in space

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.300 
and when the Starfighter flies in space
the<00:02:12.140> cockpit<00:02:12.530> will<00:02:12.710> rotate<00:02:13.100> like<00:02:13.250> this<00:02:13.460> and

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
the cockpit will rotate like this and

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.000 
the cockpit will rotate like this and
when<00:02:16.310> it's<00:02:16.490> landing<00:02:17.500> it's<00:02:18.500> got<00:02:18.860> these

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
when it's landing it's got these

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.839 
when it's landing it's got these
vulnerable<00:02:19.549> wings

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
vulnerable wings

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:26.520 
vulnerable wings
so<00:02:21.849> it<00:02:21.970> would<00:02:22.120> land<00:02:22.300> like<00:02:22.510> this<00:02:25.080> it's<00:02:26.080> also<00:02:26.290> got

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
so it would land like this it's also got

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.110 
so it would land like this it's also got
a<00:02:26.590> lot<00:02:26.800> of<00:02:26.830> guns<00:02:27.160> and<00:02:27.720> cannons<00:02:29.910> but<00:02:30.910> they<00:02:31.060> are

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
a lot of guns and cannons but they are

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.120 
a lot of guns and cannons but they are
not<00:02:31.270> non-functional<00:02:32.140> in<00:02:32.290> this<00:02:32.470> model<00:02:32.800> so<00:02:33.099> that

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
not non-functional in this model so that

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.970 
not non-functional in this model so that
just<00:02:33.640> for<00:02:33.790> display<00:02:33.989> my<00:02:34.989> favorite<00:02:35.470> element<00:02:35.830> in

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
just for display my favorite element in

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.920 
just for display my favorite element in
this<00:02:36.099> model<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.970> element<00:02:37.269> that<00:02:37.480> actually

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
this model and the element that actually

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.979 
this model and the element that actually
made<00:02:38.310> it<00:02:39.310> possible<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.239> build<00:02:40.480> this<00:02:40.630> model<00:02:40.930> in

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
made it possible to build this model in

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.979 
made it possible to build this model in
the<00:02:41.110> way<00:02:41.230> I<00:02:41.260> did<00:02:41.560> is<00:02:41.739> this<00:02:42.239> brand-new<00:02:43.239> 2<00:02:43.780> by<00:02:43.930> 2

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
the way I did is this brand-new 2 by 2

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.580 
the way I did is this brand-new 2 by 2
anchor<00:02:44.590> plate<00:02:45.370> with<00:02:45.670> studs<00:02:46.000> on<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.300> side

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
anchor plate with studs on the side

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.330 
anchor plate with studs on the side
which<00:02:47.590> allows<00:02:47.980> me<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.340> build<00:02:48.550> a<00:02:48.959> in<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:51.220> way<00:02:51.310> I

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
which allows me to build a in the way I

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.890 
which allows me to build a in the way I
do<00:02:51.489> here<00:02:52.440> so<00:02:53.440> I<00:02:53.799> have<00:02:54.220> a<00:02:54.430> lot<00:02:54.790> of<00:02:54.819> them<00:02:55.030> all<00:02:55.630> the

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
do here so I have a lot of them all the

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.020 
do here so I have a lot of them all the
way<00:02:55.989> down<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.739> spine<00:02:57.069> you<00:02:57.459> could<00:02:57.640> you<00:02:58.000> could

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
way down the spine you could you could

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.550 
way down the spine you could you could
say<00:02:58.410> sits<00:02:59.410> like<00:02:59.590> this<00:02:59.650> and<00:03:00.900> these<00:03:01.900> two<00:03:02.140> parts

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
say sits like this and these two parts

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.759 
say sits like this and these two parts
left<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.549> right<00:03:03.700> aisely<00:03:04.380> totally<00:03:05.380> the<00:03:05.739> same

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
left and right aisely totally the same

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.280 
left and right aisely totally the same
just<00:03:06.220> mirrored<00:03:06.640> and<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:07.750> way<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:07.930> model<00:03:08.230> is

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
just mirrored and the way the model is

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.680 
just mirrored and the way the model is
built<00:03:08.440> as<00:03:08.680> I<00:03:08.890> just<00:03:09.190> place<00:03:09.430> them<00:03:09.580> together<00:03:09.730> like

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
built as I just place them together like

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.130 
built as I just place them together like
this<00:03:11.220> then<00:03:12.220> I<00:03:12.310> have<00:03:12.489> a<00:03:12.519> lot<00:03:12.730> of<00:03:12.760> parts<00:03:13.209> where<00:03:14.110> I

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
this then I have a lot of parts where I

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.240 
this then I have a lot of parts where I
use<00:03:14.410> these<00:03:14.769> special<00:03:15.310> stats<00:03:15.640> these<00:03:16.480> bricks<00:03:17.250> all

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
use these special stats these bricks all

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.270 
use these special stats these bricks all
the<00:03:18.549> way<00:03:18.670> up<00:03:18.849> here<00:03:19.090> to<00:03:19.950> keep<00:03:20.950> them<00:03:21.099> together

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
the way up here to keep them together

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.250 
the way up here to keep them together
and<00:03:21.640> actually<00:03:22.330> makes<00:03:22.720> a<00:03:22.840> really<00:03:23.049> really

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
and actually makes a really really

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:31.190 
and actually makes a really really
stable<00:03:23.680> model<00:03:24.510> so<00:03:25.510> for<00:03:26.320> this<00:03:26.579> and<00:03:28.560> a<00:03:29.560> little

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
stable model so for this and a little

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.069 
stable model so for this and a little
extra<00:03:32.200> parts<00:03:32.530> here<00:03:33.100> and<00:03:33.130> there<00:03:33.900> makes<00:03:34.900> the

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
extra parts here and there makes the

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.920 
extra parts here and there makes the
whole<00:03:35.230> wing<00:03:35.470> and<00:03:36.329> basically<00:03:37.329> the<00:03:37.510> whole<00:03:37.600> model

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
whole wing and basically the whole model

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.460 
whole wing and basically the whole model
is<00:03:38.019> built<00:03:39.060> mirrored<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:40.420> then<00:03:40.989> just<00:03:41.290> put

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
is built mirrored and then just put

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.890 
is built mirrored and then just put
together<00:03:41.790> so<00:03:42.790> what<00:03:42.970> I<00:03:43.000> can<00:03:43.209> do<00:03:43.299> now<00:03:43.510> is<00:03:43.540> take

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
together so what I can do now is take

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.809 
together so what I can do now is take
the<00:03:44.350> top<00:03:44.560> part<00:03:44.799> which<00:03:45.040> is<00:03:45.069> building<00:03:45.519> the<00:03:45.549> same

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
the top part which is building the same

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:51.449 
the top part which is building the same
way<00:03:47.010> and<00:03:48.010> fit<00:03:48.400> them<00:03:48.430> together<00:03:50.280> click<00:03:51.280> on<00:03:51.400> the

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
way and fit them together click on the

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:59.069 
way and fit them together click on the
wings

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:04.750 

and<00:04:00.079> a<00:04:00.999> lower<00:04:01.999> gun<00:04:02.409> again<00:04:03.409> and<00:04:03.709> there<00:04:04.639> you<00:04:04.700> have

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
and a lower gun again and there you have

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.060 
and a lower gun again and there you have
the<00:04:04.849> model
