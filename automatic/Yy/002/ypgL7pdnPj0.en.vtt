everybody<00:00:06.150> gets<00:00:06.299> on<00:00:06.450> with<00:00:06.720> Bobcats<00:00:06.930> so<00:00:07.350> I

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
everybody gets on with Bobcats so I

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:08.629 
everybody gets on with Bobcats so I
wanted<00:00:07.680> to<00:00:07.770> go<00:00:07.830> over<00:00:08.040> some<00:00:08.220> of<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.370> drawing

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
wanted to go over some of the drawing

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.259 
wanted to go over some of the drawing
features<00:00:09.150> that<00:00:09.480> Bobcat<00:00:09.690> offers<00:00:10.469> that<00:00:11.090> you<00:00:12.090> can

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
features that Bobcat offers that you can

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.600 
features that Bobcat offers that you can
use<00:00:12.450> when<00:00:12.750> you're<00:00:12.870> trying<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:13.230> layout<00:00:13.610> parts

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
use when you're trying to layout parts

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.390 
use when you're trying to layout parts
that<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:14.880> may<00:00:15.000> need<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.330> turn<00:00:15.509> so<00:00:16.250> to<00:00:17.250> begin

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
that you may need to turn so to begin

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.210 
that you may need to turn so to begin
with<00:00:18.260> when<00:00:19.260> you're<00:00:19.529> laying<00:00:19.980> out<00:00:20.189> your

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
with when you're laying out your

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.490 
with when you're laying out your
geometry<00:00:21.029> in<00:00:21.119> Bobcat<00:00:21.600> it's<00:00:22.140> like<00:00:22.320> you're

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
geometry in Bobcat it's like you're

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.609 
geometry in Bobcat it's like you're
running<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.750> backside<00:00:24.750> lathe<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.500> know

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
running a a backside lathe you know

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.099 
running a a backside lathe you know
where<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:26.580> may<00:00:26.789> want<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.210> draw<00:00:27.480> in<00:00:27.869> this

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
where you may want to draw in this

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.720 
where you may want to draw in this
quadrant<00:00:28.380> here<00:00:28.920> because<00:00:29.250> that's<00:00:29.400> where<00:00:29.640> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
quadrant here because that's where the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.630 
quadrant here because that's where the
tool<00:00:29.910> post<00:00:30.210> would<00:00:30.390> be<00:00:30.570> but<00:00:30.840> realistically<00:00:31.769> in

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
tool post would be but realistically in

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.520 
tool post would be but realistically in
the<00:00:32.820> Bobcat<00:00:33.180> system<00:00:33.570> we<00:00:33.660> want<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.899> draw<00:00:34.200> our

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
the Bobcat system we want to draw our

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.040 
the Bobcat system we want to draw our
profiles<00:00:34.980> back<00:00:35.250> here<00:00:35.579> now<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.630> other<00:00:36.780> thing

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
profiles back here now the other thing

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.840 
profiles back here now the other thing
to<00:00:37.200> know<00:00:37.350> too<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.890> when<00:00:38.129> you're<00:00:38.309> laying<00:00:38.670> out

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
to know too is when you're laying out

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.520 
to know too is when you're laying out
your<00:00:38.879> work<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.570> really<00:00:39.719> need<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.079> lay<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.410> out

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
your work you really need to lay it out

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.389 
your work you really need to lay it out
for<00:00:41.309> only<00:00:41.399> half<00:00:42.140> half<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.379> shape<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.890> usually

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
for only half half the shape and usually

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.779 
for only half half the shape and usually
what<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.579> recommend<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.300> start<00:00:45.719> out<00:00:45.840> with<00:00:45.899> a

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
what I recommend is you start out with a

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.760 
what I recommend is you start out with a
rectangle<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:47.820> represents<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.870> length<00:00:49.590> of

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
rectangle that represents the length of

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.900 
rectangle that represents the length of
the<00:00:49.860> bar<00:00:50.039> stock<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.520> you're<00:00:50.640> going<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.850> be

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
the bar stock that you're going to be

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.670 
the bar stock that you're going to be
working<00:00:51.270> with<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.960> radius<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.500> bar

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
working with and the radius of the bar

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.740 
working with and the radius of the bar
stock<00:00:53.010> okay<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.090> example<00:00:54.270> we're

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
stock okay so in this example we're

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.670 
stock okay so in this example we're
gonna<00:00:54.809> say<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.410> 4<00:00:56.219> by<00:00:56.489> 1<00:00:56.960> and<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.109> represents

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
gonna say a 4 by 1 and that represents

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.840 
gonna say a 4 by 1 and that represents
the<00:00:58.800> length<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.280> stock<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.699> we're

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
the length of the stock that we're

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.270 
the length of the stock that we're
working<00:00:59.969> with<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.440> we're<00:01:01.440> working<00:01:01.770> with<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.949> 2

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
working with and we're working with a 2

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.649 
working with and we're working with a 2
inch<00:01:02.430> diameter<00:01:03.080> piece<00:01:04.189> piece<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.339> bar<00:01:05.460> okay<00:01:06.030> so

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
inch diameter piece piece of bar okay so

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.630 
inch diameter piece piece of bar okay so
using<00:01:07.170> our<00:01:07.380> rectangle<00:01:07.950> we<00:01:08.070> can<00:01:08.220> change<00:01:08.430> our

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
using our rectangle we can change our

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.910 
using our rectangle we can change our
origin<00:01:09.060> point<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.659> we<00:01:10.320> can<00:01:10.439> draw<00:01:10.680> out<00:01:10.890> our

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
origin point and we can draw out our

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.810 
origin point and we can draw out our
shape<00:01:11.340> okay<00:01:12.000> now<00:01:12.600> from<00:01:12.900> here<00:01:13.340> the<00:01:14.340> software<00:01:14.760> is

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
shape okay now from here the software is

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.880 
shape okay now from here the software is
in<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.060> standard<00:01:15.330> quat<00:01:15.930> agent<00:01:16.380> drawing<00:01:16.619> system

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
in a standard quat agent drawing system

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.289 
in a standard quat agent drawing system
so<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.340> have<00:01:17.369> x<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.000> y<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.960> can<00:01:19.650> come<00:01:20.100> up<00:01:20.130> to

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
so you have x and y you can come up to

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.670 
so you have x and y you can come up to
modules<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.720> can<00:01:21.869> put<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.259> turning

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
modules and you can put it in turning

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.850 
modules and you can put it in turning
mode<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.250> will<00:01:23.430> make<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.610> Z<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.210> X<00:01:24.710> to<00:01:25.710> me

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
mode and that will make it Z and X to me

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.830 
mode and that will make it Z and X to me
I<00:01:25.890> typically<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:26.610> draw<00:01:27.000> an<00:01:27.150> x<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.479> y<00:01:27.600> it

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
I typically just draw an x and y it

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.630 
I typically just draw an x and y it
doesn't<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.320> know<00:01:28.560> when<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:28.920> post<00:01:29.220> it's<00:01:29.549> gonna

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
doesn't I know when I post it's gonna

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.580 
doesn't I know when I post it's gonna
post<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.180> see<00:01:30.360> an<00:01:30.479> X<00:01:30.659> but<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.229> know<00:01:31.350> that's<00:01:31.439> a

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
post and see an X but you know that's a

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.920 
post and see an X but you know that's a
preference<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.220> it's<00:01:32.340> up<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.150> if<00:01:33.750> you

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
preference and it's up to you so if you

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.200 
preference and it's up to you so if you
want<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.170> draw<00:01:34.439> in<00:01:34.890> Z<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.430> X<00:01:35.579> or<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:35.970> want<00:01:36.119> to

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
want to draw in Z and X or you want to

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.030 
want to draw in Z and X or you want to
draw<00:01:36.360> an<00:01:36.479> x<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.810> y<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.229> can<00:01:37.380> just<00:01:37.590> swap<00:01:37.770> out

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
draw an x and y you can just swap out

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.700 
draw an x and y you can just swap out
turning<00:01:38.700> mode<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.119> change<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:40.320> mode<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.680> which

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
turning mode to change the mode in which

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.950 
turning mode to change the mode in which
you're<00:01:41.009> drawing<00:01:41.220> okay<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.390> now<00:01:42.540> we're<00:01:42.780> dealing

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
you're drawing okay so now we're dealing

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.550 
you're drawing okay so now we're dealing
with<00:01:43.399> half<00:01:44.399> half<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.210> our<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:46.020> radius<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.500> our

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
with half half of our the radius of our

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.380 
with half half of our the radius of our
bar<00:01:46.770> stock<00:01:47.130> we<00:01:47.430> have<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.729> length<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:48.119> our<00:01:48.210> bar

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
bar stock we have the length of our bar

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.060 
bar stock we have the length of our bar
stock<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:49.259> next<00:01:49.500> thing<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.649> we<00:01:49.860> want<00:01:50.040> to

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
stock the next thing that we want to

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.310 
stock the next thing that we want to
look<00:01:50.220> at<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.820> how<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.509> create<00:01:52.020> some<00:01:52.290> shapes

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
look at is how to create some shapes

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.990 
look at is how to create some shapes
like

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
like

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.120 
like
you<00:01:54.540> know<00:01:54.660> shoulders<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.710> things<00:01:55.890> like<00:01:56.070> that

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
you know shoulders and things like that

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.220 
you know shoulders and things like that
so<00:01:56.520> there's<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.120> couple<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.750> different<00:01:58.020> tools

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
so there's a couple of different tools

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.280 
so there's a couple of different tools
that<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.620> can<00:01:58.740> use<00:01:59.010> underline<00:01:59.840> line<00:02:00.840> sketch

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
that you can use underline line sketch

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.500 
that you can use underline line sketch
has<00:02:01.830> some<00:02:02.070> pretty<00:02:02.250> good<00:02:02.430> tools<00:02:02.730> when<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.300> go

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
has some pretty good tools when you go

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.180 
has some pretty good tools when you go
into<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.780> sketch<00:02:04.110> mode<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.590> can<00:02:04.740> do<00:02:04.890> sketch

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
into a sketch mode you can do sketch

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.270 
into a sketch mode you can do sketch
horizontal<00:02:05.940> you<00:02:06.870> can<00:02:06.900> enter<00:02:07.410> in<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.620> value<00:02:07.650> and

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
horizontal you can enter in a value and

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.340 
horizontal you can enter in a value and
it<00:02:08.340> really<00:02:08.520> doesn't<00:02:08.759> matter<00:02:08.910> where<00:02:09.840> your

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
it really doesn't matter where your

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.530 
it really doesn't matter where your
mouse<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:11.160> can<00:02:11.340> sketch<00:02:11.640> out<00:02:11.910> some

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
mouse is you can sketch out some

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.620 
mouse is you can sketch out some
horizontal<00:02:12.870> lines<00:02:13.430> okay<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:15.270> you<00:02:15.390> can<00:02:15.510> do

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
horizontal lines okay and you can do

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.480 
horizontal lines okay and you can do
this<00:02:15.810> pretty<00:02:16.020> quickly<00:02:16.320> the<00:02:17.010> other<00:02:17.160> thing<00:02:17.400> you

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
this pretty quickly the other thing you

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.810 
this pretty quickly the other thing you
can<00:02:17.610> do<00:02:17.760> is<00:02:17.880> sketch<00:02:18.120> vertically<00:02:18.660> now<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:20.640> face

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
can do is sketch vertically now the face

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.370 
can do is sketch vertically now the face
of<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.060> part<00:02:21.300> is<00:02:21.420> zero<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:21.900> this<00:02:22.020> is<00:02:22.170> gonna<00:02:22.290> be

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
of the part is zero and this is gonna be

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.170 
of the part is zero and this is gonna be
all<00:02:22.560> negative<00:02:22.770> so<00:02:23.040> we're<00:02:23.310> gonna<00:02:23.430> say<00:02:23.670> minus

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
all negative so we're gonna say minus

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.420 
all negative so we're gonna say minus
one<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:25.260> we'll<00:02:25.440> draw<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.740> one<00:02:25.890> there<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:26.310> then

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
one and we'll draw it one there and then

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.910 
one and we'll draw it one there and then
we'll<00:02:26.550> say<00:02:26.730> minus<00:02:27.950> one<00:02:28.950> point<00:02:30.350> seven<00:02:31.350> five<00:02:31.530> and

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
we'll say minus one point seven five and

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.610 
we'll say minus one point seven five and
we'll<00:02:32.010> draw<00:02:32.220> one<00:02:32.459> there<00:02:32.670> okay<00:02:33.510> all<00:02:34.470> right<00:02:34.590> just

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
we'll draw one there okay all right just

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.949 
we'll draw one there okay all right just
have<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.920> bunch<00:02:35.160> of<00:02:35.280> lines<00:02:36.270> that<00:02:36.600> are<00:02:36.690> on<00:02:36.720> the

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
have a bunch of lines that are on the

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.350 
have a bunch of lines that are on the
screen<00:02:37.110> really<00:02:37.560> at<00:02:37.770> this<00:02:37.890> point<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.760> next

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
screen really at this point the next

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.730 
screen really at this point the next
thing<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:39.630> you'd<00:02:39.780> want<00:02:39.990> to<00:02:40.050> look<00:02:40.200> at<00:02:40.380> doing

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
thing that you'd want to look at doing

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.300 
thing that you'd want to look at doing
is<00:02:40.890> trimming<00:02:41.670> up<00:02:41.790> some<00:02:42.000> of<00:02:42.090> this<00:02:42.180> geometry<00:02:42.840> so

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
is trimming up some of this geometry so

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.130 
is trimming up some of this geometry so
and<00:02:44.310> there<00:02:44.670> are<00:02:44.820> other<00:02:45.000> ways<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.420> draw<00:02:45.600> lines<00:02:45.900> I

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
and there are other ways to draw lines I

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.110 
and there are other ways to draw lines I
typically<00:02:46.440> use<00:02:46.560> parallel<00:02:47.340> line<00:02:47.550> line

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
typically use parallel line line

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.820 
typically use parallel line line
parallel<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:48.930> I<00:02:48.990> can<00:02:49.140> just<00:02:49.290> give<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.650> value

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
parallel and I can just give it a value

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.190 
parallel and I can just give it a value
and<00:02:50.370> then<00:02:50.490> tell<00:02:51.209> it<00:02:51.360> how<00:02:51.450> much<00:02:51.630> I<00:02:51.780> want<00:02:51.990> to<00:02:52.020> do<00:02:52.170> a

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
and then tell it how much I want to do a

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.490 
and then tell it how much I want to do a
parallel<00:02:52.560> for<00:02:53.450> there's<00:02:54.450> also<00:02:54.690> line

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
parallel for there's also line

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.350 
parallel for there's also line
continuous<00:02:56.340> where<00:02:56.670> you<00:02:56.850> can<00:02:57.030> just<00:02:57.209> do

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
continuous where you can just do

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.000 
continuous where you can just do
coordinates<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.170> you<00:02:58.230> can<00:02:58.380> type<00:02:58.620> in<00:02:58.860> your

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
coordinates and you can type in your

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.130 
coordinates and you can type in your
start<00:02:59.400> point<00:02:59.640> and<00:03:00.030> where<00:03:00.420> you<00:03:00.540> want<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.780> go<00:03:00.900> and

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
start point and where you want to go and

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.009 
start point and where you want to go and
X<00:03:01.350> and<00:03:01.620> where<00:03:01.739> you<00:03:01.830> want<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.070> go<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:02.280> Y<00:03:02.750> or<00:03:03.750> if

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
X and where you want to go and Y or if

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.440 
X and where you want to go and Y or if
you<00:03:04.110> have<00:03:04.290> an<00:03:04.410> interning<00:03:04.890> mode<00:03:05.130> be<00:03:05.970> turning<00:03:06.330> on

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
you have an interning mode be turning on

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.570 
you have an interning mode be turning on
turning<00:03:06.660> mode<00:03:06.989> you<00:03:07.200> do<00:03:07.380> line<00:03:07.620> continuous<00:03:08.370> then

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
turning mode you do line continuous then

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.000 
turning mode you do line continuous then
it's<00:03:08.760> Z<00:03:08.970> and<00:03:09.150> X<00:03:09.450> so<00:03:10.080> you<00:03:10.140> can<00:03:10.380> run<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.590> that<00:03:10.830> way

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
it's Z and X so you can run it that way

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.520 
it's Z and X so you can run it that way
as<00:03:11.160> well<00:03:11.370> but<00:03:11.930> basically<00:03:12.930> you're<00:03:13.170> gonna<00:03:13.260> end

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
as well but basically you're gonna end

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.470 
as well but basically you're gonna end
up<00:03:13.709> creating<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.310> bunch<00:03:14.459> of<00:03:14.610> lines<00:03:14.880> that

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
up creating a bunch of lines that

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.630 
up creating a bunch of lines that
represent<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:16.350> different<00:03:16.739> diameters<00:03:17.340> and

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
represent the different diameters and

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.820 
represent the different diameters and
how<00:03:17.760> far<00:03:18.330> back<00:03:18.510> off<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.930> face<00:03:19.140> and<00:03:19.380> then

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
how far back off the face and then

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.020 
how far back off the face and then
you're<00:03:19.950> gonna<00:03:20.040> come<00:03:20.280> up<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.550> trim<00:03:20.820> and

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
you're gonna come up and trim and

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.580 
you're gonna come up and trim and
there's<00:03:21.570> a<00:03:21.660> bunch<00:03:21.870> of<00:03:21.959> different<00:03:22.230> ways<00:03:22.320> that

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
there's a bunch of different ways that

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.320 
there's a bunch of different ways that
you<00:03:22.739> can<00:03:22.860> trim<00:03:23.160> you<00:03:23.340> can<00:03:23.370> quick<00:03:23.730> trim<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.299> just

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
you can trim you can quick trim and just

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.080 
you can trim you can quick trim and just
click<00:03:24.690> on<00:03:24.870> what<00:03:25.739> you<00:03:25.769> want<00:03:26.040> to<00:03:26.130> delete<00:03:26.459> so<00:03:27.060> I

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
as you drop your verticals and then you

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.300 
as you drop your verticals and then you
trim<00:03:59.690> it<00:03:59.720> up<00:03:59.959> and<00:04:00.140> then<00:04:00.230> from<00:04:00.829> here<00:04:01.010> you<00:04:01.220> know

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
this section I'm going to say arc fill

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.590 
this section I'm going to say arc fill
it<00:04:21.739> and<00:04:21.919> we're<00:04:22.010> gonna<00:04:22.130> make<00:04:22.340> this<00:04:22.520> point<00:04:22.820> 375

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
it and we're gonna make this point 375

it and we're gonna make this point 375
and<00:04:24.020> I'll<00:04:24.590> go<00:04:24.740> from<00:04:25.190> here<00:04:25.789> to<00:04:25.970> here<00:04:26.000> and<00:04:26.539> you're

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
and I'll go from here to here and you're

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.159 
and I'll go from here to here and you're
gonna<00:04:26.870> see<00:04:27.110> that<00:04:27.260> the<00:04:28.660> software<00:04:29.660> draws<00:04:29.960> up

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
gonna see that the software draws up

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.080 
gonna see that the software draws up
loop<00:04:30.410> and<00:04:31.010> basically<00:04:31.490> what<00:04:31.639> that's<00:04:31.760> telling

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
loop and basically what that's telling

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.690 
loop and basically what that's telling
you<00:04:32.389> is<00:04:32.419> that<00:04:32.720> from<00:04:33.080> here<00:04:33.500> to<00:04:33.650> here<00:04:34.130> is<00:04:34.310> less

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
you is that from here to here is less

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.790 
you is that from here to here is less
than<00:04:34.729> the<00:04:35.000> radius<00:04:35.419> that<00:04:35.720> you're<00:04:36.349> trying<00:04:36.620> to

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
than the radius that you're trying to

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.250 
than the radius that you're trying to
define<00:04:37.160> so<00:04:37.669> you<00:04:38.300> need<00:04:38.479> to<00:04:38.599> add<00:04:38.750> some<00:04:39.050> extra

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
define so you need to add some extra

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.950 
define so you need to add some extra
geometry<00:04:39.560> so<00:04:40.250> you<00:04:40.340> just<00:04:40.550> do<00:04:40.700> trim<00:04:41.060> screen<00:04:41.510> you

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
geometry so you just do trim screen you

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.620 
geometry so you just do trim screen you
click<00:04:42.169> on<00:04:42.320> this<00:04:42.530> line<00:04:42.770> you<00:04:43.760> drag<00:04:44.360> that<00:04:44.570> up

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
click on this line you drag that up

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.070 
click on this line you drag that up
there<00:04:44.990> then<00:04:45.380> you<00:04:45.530> can<00:04:45.560> do<00:04:45.830> arc<00:04:46.190> fill<00:04:46.550> it<00:04:46.960> put<00:04:47.960> in

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
there then you can do arc fill it put in

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.960 
there then you can do arc fill it put in
the<00:04:48.200> value<00:04:48.590> of<00:04:48.620> your<00:04:48.830> fill<00:04:49.070> it<00:04:49.220> now<00:04:49.370> there's

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
the value of your fill it now there's

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.580 
the value of your fill it now there's
enough<00:04:50.270> room<00:04:50.300> for<00:04:50.599> that<00:04:50.870> fill<00:04:51.139> it<00:04:51.289> to<00:04:51.410> fit

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
enough room for that fill it to fit

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.830 
enough room for that fill it to fit
there<00:04:51.860> so<00:04:52.580> then<00:04:52.729> you<00:04:52.880> can<00:04:53.060> see<00:04:53.270> there's<00:04:53.510> a<00:04:53.599> fill

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
there so then you can see there's a fill

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.839 
there so then you can see there's a fill
it<00:04:53.960> drawn<00:04:54.229> and<00:04:54.620> then<00:04:54.889> you<00:04:55.070> can<00:04:55.220> just<00:04:55.400> trim<00:04:55.669> up

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:55.849 
it drawn and then you can just trim up

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:57.460 
it drawn and then you can just trim up
these<00:04:56.000> two<00:04:56.300> shapes<00:04:56.599> so<00:04:56.810> you<00:04:56.840> can<00:04:57.020> do<00:04:57.110> a<00:04:57.139> trim

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
these two shapes so you can do a trim

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.320 
these two shapes so you can do a trim
there<00:04:57.710> and<00:04:57.979> then<00:04:58.280> now<00:04:58.460> you<00:04:58.520> have<00:04:58.700> that<00:04:59.060> trim

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
there and then now you have that trim

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.600 
there and then now you have that trim
shape<00:04:59.630> so<00:04:59.930> these<00:05:00.470> this<00:05:01.010> is<00:05:01.130> just<00:05:01.310> a<00:05:01.400> quick
