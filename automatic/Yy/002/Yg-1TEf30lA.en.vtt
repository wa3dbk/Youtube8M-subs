when<00:00:55.120> you're<00:00:55.270> contemplating<00:00:55.870> when<00:00:56.350> you're

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
when you're contemplating when you're

concentrating<00:00:56.739> and<00:00:57.250> by<00:00:58.120> doing<00:00:58.360> so<00:00:58.590> it'll

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
concentrating and by doing so it'll

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.470 
concentrating and by doing so it'll
allow<00:00:59.980> you<00:01:00.040> to<00:01:00.190> actually<00:01:00.820> use<00:01:00.970> the<00:01:01.239> Force

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
allow you to actually use the Force

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.799 
allow you to actually use the Force
robot<00:01:02.320> so<00:01:02.530> the<00:01:02.649> more<00:01:02.829> you<00:01:03.010> concentrate<00:01:03.809> the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
robot so the more you concentrate the

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.560 
robot so the more you concentrate the
more<00:01:05.680> most<00:01:06.189> signal<00:01:06.490> you<00:01:06.610> get<00:01:06.729> exactly<00:01:07.390> and

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
more most signal you get exactly and

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.630 
more most signal you get exactly and
then<00:01:07.780> the<00:01:08.110> funny<00:01:08.320> part<00:01:08.560> about<00:01:08.590> it<00:01:08.890> is<00:01:09.040> is<00:01:09.250> up

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
then the funny part about it is is up

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.890 
then the funny part about it is is up
until<00:01:09.850> maybe<00:01:10.000> even<00:01:10.270> three<00:01:10.450> or<00:01:10.540> four<00:01:10.659> years<00:01:10.840> ago

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
until maybe even three or four years ago

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.840 
until maybe even three or four years ago
these<00:01:11.530> devices<00:01:11.979> would<00:01:12.100> have<00:01:12.220> cost<00:01:12.400> the<00:01:12.640> three

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
these devices would have cost the three

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.870 
these devices would have cost the three
to<00:01:12.940> five<00:01:13.120> thousand<00:01:13.570> dollars<00:01:13.600> u.s.<00:01:14.729> with<00:01:15.729> this

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
to five thousand dollars u.s. with this

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.450 
to five thousand dollars u.s. with this
compact<00:01:16.300> chip<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:17.260> dry<00:01:17.470> sensor<00:01:17.830> technologies

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
compact chip the dry sensor technologies

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.370 
compact chip the dry sensor technologies
basically<00:01:19.330> you<00:01:19.450> can<00:01:19.600> affect<00:01:19.840> this<00:01:19.930> tool<00:01:20.170> for

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
basically you can affect this tool for

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.780 
basically you can affect this tool for
the<00:01:20.740> story<00:01:20.979> for<00:01:21.070> a<00:01:21.100> hundred<00:01:21.370> and<00:01:21.460> ninety-nine

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
the story for a hundred and ninety-nine

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.030 
the story for a hundred and ninety-nine
to<00:01:22.030> two<00:01:22.210> hundred<00:01:22.330> and<00:01:22.540> forty-nine<00:01:23.040> Australian

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
to two hundred and forty-nine Australian

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.580 
to two hundred and forty-nine Australian
so<00:01:24.670> it's<00:01:24.909> a<00:01:25.090> it<00:01:25.630> actually<00:01:25.900> accomplishes<00:01:26.320> a<00:01:26.350> lot

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
so it's a it actually accomplishes a lot

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.350 
so it's a it actually accomplishes a lot
even<00:01:27.220> though<00:01:27.370> it<00:01:27.580> looks<00:01:27.909> simple<00:01:28.180> it's

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
even though it looks simple it's

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.750 
even though it looks simple it's
actually<00:01:28.630> you<00:01:29.350> know<00:01:29.409> pretty<00:01:30.070> effective<00:01:30.580> use

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
actually you know pretty effective use

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.520 
actually you know pretty effective use
of<00:01:30.790> technology<00:01:31.000> in<00:01:31.600> a<00:01:31.930> toy<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:32.229> of<00:01:32.320> course

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
of technology in a toy and of course

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.730 
of technology in a toy and of course
what<00:01:32.890> better<00:01:33.070> platform<00:01:33.460> than<00:01:33.760> the<00:01:34.150> force

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
what better platform than the force

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.539 
what better platform than the force
would<00:01:35.740> you<00:01:35.830> want<00:01:35.950> me<00:01:36.010> to<00:01:36.130> show<00:01:36.280> you<00:01:36.340> how<00:01:36.460> it

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
would you want me to show you how it

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.640 
would you want me to show you how it
works<00:01:36.760> so<00:01:37.240> I<00:01:37.270> get<00:01:37.420> away<00:01:37.510> and<00:01:37.900> the<00:01:38.260> idea<00:01:38.530> behind

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
works so I get away and the idea behind

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.289 
works so I get away and the idea behind
the<00:01:38.799> toy<00:01:38.950> is<00:01:39.130> that<00:01:39.159> you<00:01:39.430> get<00:01:39.580> three<00:01:39.790> levels<00:01:40.090> of

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
the toy is that you get three levels of

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.300 
the toy is that you get three levels of
gameplay<00:01:40.840> you<00:01:41.560> start<00:01:41.799> out<00:01:41.890> as<00:01:41.950> a<00:01:42.040> Padawan

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
gameplay you start out as a Padawan

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.750

I<00:01:53.740> said<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.040> whole<00:01:54.130> idea<00:01:54.460> is<00:01:54.640> a<00:01:54.939> child<00:01:55.510> can<00:01:55.630> put

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
I said the whole idea is a child can put

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.870 
I said the whole idea is a child can put
this<00:01:55.840> on<00:01:56.020> use<00:01:56.350> it<00:01:56.560> before<00:01:57.220> he<00:01:57.280> goes<00:01:57.400> to<00:01:57.460> bed<00:01:57.670> or

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
this on use it before he goes to bed or

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.030 
this on use it before he goes to bed or
she<00:01:58.030> goes<00:01:58.180> to<00:01:58.330> bed<00:01:58.479> and<00:01:58.810> it'll<00:01:59.439> actually<00:01:59.500> relax

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
she goes to bed and it'll actually relax

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.499 
she goes to bed and it'll actually relax
them<00:02:00.310> maybe<00:02:00.820> so<00:02:00.880> I'm<00:02:00.939> gonna<00:02:01.060> put<00:02:01.240> this<00:02:01.330> on

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
them maybe so I'm gonna put this on

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.719 
them maybe so I'm gonna put this on
we've<00:02:02.380> had<00:02:02.530> pretty<00:02:02.710> good<00:02:02.830> luck<00:02:02.979> but<00:02:03.340> because

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
we've had pretty good luck but because

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.490 
we've had pretty good luck but because
it<00:02:03.909> is<00:02:03.939> like<00:02:04.509> I<00:02:04.540> said<00:02:04.780> it<00:02:04.900> I<00:02:05.020> am<00:02:05.140> generating

alpha<00:03:56.810> and<00:03:56.989> beta<00:03:57.079> then<00:03:57.379> you<00:03:57.500> generate<00:03:57.920> them

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
alpha and beta then you generate them

99%<00:04:12.439> of<00:04:12.680> people<00:04:12.769> can<00:04:12.980> do<00:04:13.099> if<00:04:13.189> you<00:04:13.340> know<00:04:13.459> very

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
99% of people can do if you know very

for<00:04:18.199> certain<00:04:18.620> people<00:04:18.949> and<00:04:19.310> then<00:04:19.609> eventually

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
for certain people and then eventually

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.789 
for certain people and then eventually
you<00:04:20.180> get<00:04:20.269> to<00:04:20.419> you<00:04:20.959> start<00:04:21.169> to<00:04:21.229> have<00:04:21.289> a<00:04:21.380> Pavlovian

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
response to the headset where as I put

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.360 
response to the headset where as I put
it<00:04:24.139> on<00:04:24.229> I'm<00:04:24.380> starting<00:04:24.710> to<00:04:24.740> get<00:04:24.860> into<00:04:25.039> that<00:04:25.160> mode

so you do learn to connect with the

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.189 
so you do learn to connect with the
parts<00:04:29.240> your<00:04:29.330> brain<00:04:29.479> that<00:04:29.570> allow<00:04:29.750> you<00:04:29.810> to<00:04:29.960> relax

for people with a DD ADHD it's a side
benefit<00:04:38.000> it's<00:04:38.300> kind<00:04:38.449> of<00:04:38.509> like<00:04:38.660> you<00:04:39.440> know<00:04:39.470> it's

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
benefit it's kind of like you know it's

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.370 
benefit it's kind of like you know it's
it's<00:04:40.699> a<00:04:40.820> bonus<00:04:41.030> but<00:04:41.720> we're<00:04:41.840> not<00:04:41.930> signed<00:04:42.139> as<00:04:42.289> a

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
course using the force I just wonder if

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.600 
course using the force I just wonder if
there's<00:04:53.510> if<00:04:54.320> there's<00:04:54.650> a<00:04:54.710> future<00:04:55.099> in<00:04:55.220> this<00:04:55.340> kind

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
there's if there's a future in this kind

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.909 
there's if there's a future in this kind
of<00:04:55.699> toy<00:04:55.940> for<00:04:56.419> being<00:04:57.139> able<00:04:57.229> to<00:04:57.349> train<00:04:57.620> your<00:04:57.740> wife

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
of toy for being able to train your wife

00:04:57.919 --> 00:04:59.680 
of toy for being able to train your wife
to<00:04:58.099> generate<00:04:58.460> three<00:04:59.240> or<00:04:59.330> four<00:04:59.510> different

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
to generate three or four different

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.110 
to generate three or four different
signals<00:05:00.229> can<00:05:00.440> you<00:05:00.560> you<00:05:01.400> know<00:05:01.520> that<00:05:01.669> is<00:05:01.820> one<00:05:02.030> of

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
signals can you you know that is one of

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.939 
signals can you you know that is one of
the<00:05:02.210> one<00:05:02.659> of<00:05:02.690> the<00:05:02.810> ideas<00:05:03.080> as<00:05:03.289> they're<00:05:03.650> able<00:05:03.800> to

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
the one of the ideas as they're able to

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:05.469 
the one of the ideas as they're able to
isolate<00:05:04.250> these<00:05:04.490> different<00:05:04.849> brain<00:05:05.030> waves<00:05:05.270> and

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
isolate these different brain waves and

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:08.170 
isolate these different brain waves and
create<00:05:06.110> a<00:05:06.139> low-cost<00:05:06.530> way<00:05:06.710> of<00:05:07.099> getting<00:05:08.060> these

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
create a low-cost way of getting these

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.899 
create a low-cost way of getting these
algorithms<00:05:08.510> to<00:05:08.930> up<00:05:09.080> to<00:05:09.229> a<00:05:09.380> light<00:05:10.070> switch<00:05:10.340> or<00:05:10.849> a

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:10.909 
algorithms to up to a light switch or a

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:12.550 
algorithms to up to a light switch or a
dip<00:05:11.330> switch<00:05:11.570> then<00:05:12.110> yeah<00:05:12.320> there'll<00:05:12.530> be

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
dip switch then yeah there'll be

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.960 
dip switch then yeah there'll be
different<00:05:12.710> play<00:05:13.009> patterns<00:05:13.370> that<00:05:13.490> will<00:05:13.610> emerge

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
different play patterns that will emerge

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.999 
different play patterns that will emerge
like<00:05:14.720> I<00:05:14.780> said<00:05:14.990> you<00:05:15.110> walk<00:05:15.289> into<00:05:15.530> your<00:05:15.590> room<00:05:15.770> and

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:16.009 
like I said you walk into your room and

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:17.469 
like I said you walk into your room and
you<00:05:16.190> lay<00:05:16.490> down<00:05:16.520> your<00:05:16.789> bed<00:05:16.940> and<00:05:17.060> when<00:05:17.150> you<00:05:17.180> start

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
you lay down your bed and when you start

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.510 
you lay down your bed and when you start
to<00:05:17.539> go<00:05:17.630> to<00:05:17.659> sleep<00:05:17.930> your<00:05:18.050> lights<00:05:18.229> go<00:05:18.380> down<00:05:18.560> you

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
to go to sleep your lights go down you

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.249 
to go to sleep your lights go down you
know<00:05:19.669> and<00:05:19.909> that's<00:05:20.300> kind<00:05:20.840> of<00:05:20.900> cool<00:05:21.050> though

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:21.259 
know and that's kind of cool though

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:22.260 
know and that's kind of cool though
there<00:05:21.440> there<00:05:21.650> will<00:05:21.800> be<00:05:21.830> more<00:05:22.099> and<00:05:22.159> more

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
there there will be more and more

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.249 
there there will be more and more
patterns<00:05:23.270> of<00:05:23.479> use<00:05:23.690> for<00:05:23.900> this<00:05:24.020> type<00:05:24.229> of

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:24.259 
patterns of use for this type of

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:26.350 
patterns of use for this type of
technology<00:05:24.460> okay<00:05:25.460> so<00:05:25.580> when<00:05:25.820> can<00:05:25.970> we<00:05:26.000> expect<00:05:26.090> to

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
technology okay so when can we expect to

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.879
