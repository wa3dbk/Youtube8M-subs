went<00:01:51.200> ahead<00:01:51.259> and<00:01:51.350> cauterize<00:01:51.890> those<00:01:52.280> just<00:01:52.640> so

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
went ahead and cauterize those just so

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.820 
went ahead and cauterize those just so
they<00:01:52.880> won't<00:01:53.000> be<00:01:53.210> an<00:01:53.299> issue<00:01:53.479> down<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:53.810> road<00:01:53.990> you

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
they won't be an issue down the road you

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.710 
they won't be an issue down the road you
know<00:01:54.890> and<00:01:55.070> it's<00:01:55.310> not<00:01:55.520> obtrusive<00:01:55.790> it's<00:01:56.240> private

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
know and it's not obtrusive it's private

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.870 
know and it's not obtrusive it's private
and<00:01:57.320> I<00:01:57.619> just<00:01:57.860> think<00:01:57.979> them<00:01:58.189> it's<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:58.400> benefits

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
and I just think them it's the benefits

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.969 
and I just think them it's the benefits
basically<00:01:59.240> in<00:01:59.330> today's<00:01:59.570> busy<00:01:59.960> world<00:01:59.990> where<00:02:00.890> we

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
basically in today's busy world where we

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.010 
basically in today's busy world where we
gotta<00:02:01.130> be<00:02:01.250> multiple<00:02:01.610> places<00:02:01.820> and<00:02:02.360> I<00:02:02.659> think<00:02:02.689> it

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
gotta be multiple places and I think it

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.440 
gotta be multiple places and I think it
also<00:02:03.170> kind<00:02:03.560> of<00:02:03.619> appeals<00:02:04.100> to<00:02:04.579> the<00:02:05.180> type<00:02:05.420> of

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
also kind of appeals to the type of

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.990 
also kind of appeals to the type of
patients<00:02:06.110> that<00:02:06.170> are<00:02:06.320> seeking<00:02:06.799> us<00:02:07.009> here<00:02:07.909> at

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
patients that are seeking us here at

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.580 
patients that are seeking us here at
Henry<00:02:08.269> Ford<00:02:08.539> for<00:02:08.599> this<00:02:08.929> type<00:02:09.140> of<00:02:09.170> surgery

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
Henry Ford for this type of surgery

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.920 
Henry Ford for this type of surgery
they're<00:02:10.369> seeking<00:02:10.930> state-of-the-art

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
they're seeking state-of-the-art

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.949 
they're seeking state-of-the-art
minimally<00:02:12.709> invasive<00:02:13.310> robotic<00:02:14.090> surgery<00:02:14.690> and

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
minimally invasive robotic surgery and

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.380 
minimally invasive robotic surgery and
we're<00:02:15.739> a<00:02:15.770> center<00:02:16.069> that<00:02:16.190> does<00:02:16.580> a<00:02:16.819> lot<00:02:17.090> of<00:02:17.150> these

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
we're a center that does a lot of these

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.900 
we're a center that does a lot of these
and

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
and

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.610 
and
sometimes<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.540> patients<00:02:19.020> who<00:02:19.080> are<00:02:19.110> seeking

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
technology and a way to improve their

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.290 
technology and a way to improve their
care<00:02:25.440> and<00:02:25.710> this<00:02:25.830> kind<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.220> fits<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.610> using

state-of-the-art technology to improve

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.550 
state-of-the-art technology to improve
communication<00:02:30.360> as<00:02:30.600> well<00:02:30.960> as<00:02:31.080> improving<00:02:31.440> the
