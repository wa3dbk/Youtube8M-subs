something<00:00:09.240> that<00:00:09.360> I'm<00:00:09.450> sure<00:00:09.480> has<00:00:09.870> happened<00:00:10.200> to

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
something that I'm sure has happened to

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.570 
something that I'm sure has happened to
everybody<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:10.860> we<00:00:10.950> could<00:00:11.070> all<00:00:11.160> relate<00:00:11.400> to

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
everybody and we could all relate to

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.610 
everybody and we could all relate to
this<00:00:11.700> I<00:00:11.940> guess<00:00:12.150> in<00:00:12.330> some<00:00:12.450> people<00:00:12.780> it's<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.440> bit

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
this I guess in some people it's a bit

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.279 
this I guess in some people it's a bit
more<00:00:13.889> awkward<00:00:14.370> timing<00:00:14.730> than<00:00:15.030> others<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.480> we

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
more awkward timing than others and we

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.810 
more awkward timing than others and we
were<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.440> little<00:00:16.650> bit<00:00:16.800> late<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.160> in<00:00:17.250> this<00:00:17.340> top<00:00:17.609> 10

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
were a little bit late to in this top 10

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.939 
were a little bit late to in this top 10
because<00:00:18.119> we<00:00:18.240> did<00:00:18.390> another<00:00:18.660> top<00:00:18.960> 10<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.410> last

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
because we did another top 10 of last

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.349 
because we did another top 10 of last
week<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.400> pretty<00:00:20.670> much<00:00:20.730> last<00:00:20.939> week<00:00:21.150> we<00:00:21.210> did<00:00:21.300> a

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
week so pretty much last week we did a

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.660 
week so pretty much last week we did a
top<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.750> any<00:00:21.869> just<00:00:22.590> cuz<00:00:22.710> we<00:00:22.830> had<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.160> many<00:00:23.279> great

top to any just cuz we had so many great
clips<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.720> really<00:00:24.900> does<00:00:25.050> make<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.260> huge

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
clips it really does make a huge

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.170 
clips it really does make a huge
