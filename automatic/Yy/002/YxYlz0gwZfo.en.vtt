for a while and Europe looked completely

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.210 
for a while and Europe looked completely
different<00:00:13.950> than<00:00:14.400> this<00:00:14.759> 2015<00:00:15.660> model<00:00:16.170> not<00:00:17.070> too

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
different than this 2015 model not too

many<00:00:17.369> Americans<00:00:17.789> have<00:00:17.940> have<00:00:18.330> had<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.600> chance<00:00:18.840> to

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
many Americans have have had a chance to

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.560 
many Americans have have had a chance to
ride<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.400> have<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:21.090> couple<00:00:21.449> of

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
ride it and I have a couple of

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.390 
ride it and I have a couple of
precedents<00:00:22.170> for<00:00:22.710> tire<00:00:22.890> tests<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.340> things

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
precedents for tire tests and things

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.929 
precedents for tire tests and things
like<00:00:23.580> that

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
like that

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.470 
like that
and<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.359> always<00:00:24.510> like<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.350> bike<00:00:25.529> now<00:00:26.400> with<00:00:26.699> its

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
and I always like the bike now with its

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.859 
and I always like the bike now with its
new<00:00:27.990> styling<00:00:28.500> in<00:00:29.130> coming<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.210> u.s.<00:00:30.359> I

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
new styling in coming to the u.s. I

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.440 
new styling in coming to the u.s. I
think<00:00:30.929> it's<00:00:31.349> going<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.590> be<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:32.130> hit<00:00:32.610> it's<00:00:33.300> got<00:00:33.420> a

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
think it's going to be a hit it's got a

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.900 
think it's going to be a hit it's got a
pretty<00:00:33.719> low<00:00:33.930> price<00:00:34.680> point<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.219> comparison<00:00:35.820> to

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
pretty low price point in comparison to

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.660 
pretty low price point in comparison to
other<00:00:36.059> adventure<00:00:36.989> type<00:00:37.200> bikes<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:38.399> can<00:00:38.460> get

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
other adventure type bikes you can get

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.180 
other adventure type bikes you can get
into<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.030> easy<00:00:39.210> it's<00:00:40.200> got<00:00:40.350> an<00:00:40.469> excellent<00:00:40.890> motor

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
into it easy it's got an excellent motor

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.410 
into it easy it's got an excellent motor
I<00:00:41.309> mean<00:00:41.520> it's<00:00:41.670> basically<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.090> same<00:00:42.210> motor

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
I mean it's basically the same motor

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.660 
I mean it's basically the same motor
that's<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.750> z1000<00:00:43.500> just<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.280> few<00:00:44.430> tweaks

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
that's in the z1000 just a few tweaks

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.200 
that's in the z1000 just a few tweaks
here<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:44.940> there

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
here and there

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.830 
here and there
these<00:00:45.840> gear<00:00:46.050> ratios<00:00:46.500> are<00:00:46.649> different<00:00:47.070> and

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
these gear ratios are different and

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.630 
these gear ratios are different and
overall<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:49.050> actually<00:00:49.200> like<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.800> better<00:00:49.829> than

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
overall I actually like it better than

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.720 
overall I actually like it better than
the<00:00:50.730> ninja1000<00:00:51.800> it's<00:00:52.800> more<00:00:53.309> comfortable<00:00:53.640> to

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
the ninja1000 it's more comfortable to

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.750 
the ninja1000 it's more comfortable to
sit<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.059> all<00:00:54.210> day<00:00:54.360> long<00:00:54.710> you've<00:00:55.710> got<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:56.670> know

get the wind off you get more wind on
you<00:01:02.910> whatever<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.300> need<00:01:03.449> with<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:05.040> twist

head screw adjuster that's on it

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.620 
head screw adjuster that's on it
it's<00:01:07.799> like<00:01:08.010> infinitely<00:01:08.610> adjustable<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.420> it's

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
it's like infinitely adjustable so it's

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.570 
it's like infinitely adjustable so it's
not<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:10.110> windshield<00:01:10.680> it's<00:01:10.890> step<00:01:11.250> where<00:01:11.490> you

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
not a windshield it's step where you

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.800 
not a windshield it's step where you
have<00:01:11.729> like<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.939> high<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.210> low<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.510> maybe

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
have like a high to low and maybe

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.050 
have like a high to low and maybe
something<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> middle<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:14.369> can<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.939> know

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
something in the middle you can you know

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.789 
something in the middle you can you know
set<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.720> exactly<00:01:16.049> where<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.530> want<00:01:16.740> it

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.999 
set it to exactly where you want it
which<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.009> pretty<00:01:17.159> cool<00:01:18.229> today<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
so we got a pretty good chance to test

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.770 
so we got a pretty good chance to test
the<00:01:25.590> traction<00:01:25.890> control<00:01:25.920> systems<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.780> you

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
the traction control systems and you

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.560 
the traction control systems and you
know<00:01:27.869> overall<00:01:28.259> it's<00:01:29.130> it's<00:01:29.549> as<00:01:29.759> good<00:01:29.939> as<00:01:30.150> any

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
see the light flashing more often than

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.789 
see the light flashing more often than
you<00:01:36.000> actually<00:01:36.180> feel<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.570> working<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.560> that's<00:01:37.650> a

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
you saw that light blinking I wrote it
