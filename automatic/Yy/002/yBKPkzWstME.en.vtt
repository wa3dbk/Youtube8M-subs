with the shoulder with the elbow it's

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.410 
with the shoulder with the elbow it's
really<00:00:25.680> tough<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:25.980> focus<00:00:26.670> simply<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
to place the stress on the form but

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.180 
to place the stress on the form but
you'll<00:00:33.719> see<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.899> lot<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.170> kids<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.649> tend<00:00:35.070> to

thinking that the soreness is going to

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.069 
thinking that the soreness is going to
relieve<00:00:50.399> itself<00:00:50.789> it's<00:00:51.149> simply<00:00:51.570> just<00:00:51.629> going<00:00:51.989> to

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
relieve itself it's simply just going to

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.310 
relieve itself it's simply just going to
delay<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.789> process<00:00:53.789> it's<00:00:54.420> delaying<00:00:55.170> the

delay the process it's delaying the
recovery<00:00:55.800> process<00:00:56.120> and<00:00:57.120> it's<00:00:57.239> not<00:00:57.449> good<00:00:57.719> for

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
recovery process and it's not good for

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
find an easy bounce where they can

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.149 
find an easy bounce where they can
control<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.259> movements<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.860> how<00:01:25.950> we're

control the movements and how we're

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.590 
control the movements and how we're
going<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.400> do<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.820> we're<00:01:26.970> going<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.150> focus<00:01:27.330> on

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
going to do that we're going to focus on

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.090 
the inside the elbow on the top we're
here<00:01:30.259> we're<00:01:31.259> simply<00:01:31.590> going<00:01:31.710> to

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
here we're simply going to

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.450 
here we're simply going to
that<00:01:33.290> try<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.320> keep<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.740> arm<00:01:34.920> in<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.220> steady

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
that try to keep the arm in a steady

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.950 
that try to keep the arm in a steady
position<00:01:35.580> you<00:01:36.150> don't<00:01:36.330> want<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.570> move<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.930> here

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
position you don't want to move it here

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.950 
position you don't want to move it here
or<00:01:37.290> there<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.770> try<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.369> keep<00:01:38.580> them<00:01:38.700> stock<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.840> a

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
or there so try to keep them stock in a

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.630 
or there so try to keep them stock in a
steady<00:01:40.170> position<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.950> then<00:01:41.310> you're<00:01:41.430> going<00:01:41.549> to

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
steady position and then you're going to

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.609 
steady position and then you're going to
see<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.909> further<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.600> lay<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.020> back<00:01:43.229> back

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
see the further that I lay the back back

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.789 
see the further that I lay the back back
the<00:01:44.610> more<00:01:44.820> stress<00:01:45.149> here<00:01:45.509> as<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:46.290> go<00:01:46.320> this

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
the more stress here as I go this

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.560 
the more stress here as I go this
direction<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.759> more<00:01:47.909> stress<00:01:48.210> I'm<00:01:48.360> going<00:01:48.509> to

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
direction the more stress I'm going to

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.999 
direction the more stress I'm going to
put<00:01:48.690> on<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.869> top<00:01:49.080> so<00:01:49.290> let's<00:01:49.320> err<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.740> really

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
put on the top so let's err a really

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.249 
put on the top so let's err a really
good<00:01:50.190> way<00:01:50.310> if<00:01:50.460> your<00:01:50.610> guys<00:01:50.790> get<00:01:51.090> sore<00:01:51.390> there<00:01:51.690> the

good way if your guys get sore there the

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.080 
good way if your guys get sore there the
next<00:01:52.619> way<00:01:52.740> we're<00:01:53.369> going<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.520> simply<00:01:53.759> hold<00:01:53.909> the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
next way we're going to simply hold the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.560 
next way we're going to simply hold the
bat<00:01:54.240> out<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.450> front<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.840> us<00:01:56.420> we're<00:01:57.420> going<00:01:57.509> to

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
bat out in front of us we're going to

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.700 
bat out in front of us we're going to
start<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.840> string<00:01:58.080> through<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.320> form<00:01:58.560> on<00:01:58.680> that

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
start to string through the form on that

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.420 
start to string through the form on that
way<00:01:59.720> we<00:02:00.720> can<00:02:00.869> come<00:02:01.049> up<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.860> obviously<00:02:02.159> anytime

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
way we can come up and obviously anytime

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.370 
way we can come up and obviously anytime
I<00:02:02.610> start<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.030> change<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.570> positioning<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.319> the

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
I start to change the positioning of the

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.730 
I start to change the positioning of the
forearm<00:02:04.950> or<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.759> or<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.390> elbow<00:02:06.600> as<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.259> turn<00:02:07.619> it

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
forearm or the or the elbow as I turn it

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.249 
forearm or the or the elbow as I turn it
in<00:02:08.600> you're<00:02:09.600> going<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.810> start<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.140> hit

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
in you're going to start to hit

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.920 
in you're going to start to hit
different<00:02:10.619> areas<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.450> then<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.630> third

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
different areas of that then the third

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.690 
different areas of that then the third
and<00:02:13.170> final<00:02:13.560> tip<00:02:13.739> and<00:02:13.980> it's<00:02:14.069> a<00:02:14.160> pretty<00:02:14.400> creative

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
and final tip and it's a pretty creative

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.930 
and final tip and it's a pretty creative
way<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.180> up<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.650> coach<00:02:17.340> had<00:02:17.550> showed<00:02:17.760> me

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
way that up to the a coach had showed me

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.100 
way that up to the a coach had showed me
the<00:02:18.060> other<00:02:18.090> day<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:18.720> thought<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:19.019> was

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
the other day and I thought it was

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.750 
the other day and I thought it was
fantastic<00:02:19.769> it<00:02:19.830> feels<00:02:20.069> it's<00:02:20.190> very<00:02:20.370> similar<00:02:20.640> to

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
fantastic it feels it's very similar to

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.729 
fantastic it feels it's very similar to
what<00:02:20.850> it<00:02:21.150> was<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.989> we<00:02:22.140> get<00:02:22.350> into<00:02:22.590> this

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
what it was and we get into this

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.800 
what it was and we get into this
position<00:02:23.010> we<00:02:23.400> put<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.760> elbow<00:02:23.880> by<00:02:24.330> our<00:02:24.390> heel

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
position we put the elbow by our heel

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
position we put the elbow by our heel
and<00:02:25.110> as<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.860> start<00:02:26.130> to<00:02:26.280> go<00:02:26.489> I<00:02:27.319> just<00:02:28.319> lay<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.620> bat

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
and as I start to go I just lay the bat

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.130 
and as I start to go I just lay the bat
by<00:02:29.069> just<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.790> weight<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.330> bats<00:02:30.630> going<00:02:31.019> to

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
by just the weight of the bats going to

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.670 
by just the weight of the bats going to
start<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.739> delay<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.970> arm<00:02:33.230> back<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.530> that's

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
start to delay the arm back and that's

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.800 
start to delay the arm back and that's
what<00:02:34.799> we<00:02:34.920> call<00:02:35.100> external<00:02:35.489> rotation<00:02:36.269> with

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
what we call external rotation with

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.660 
what we call external rotation with
pitchers<00:02:37.290> we<00:02:37.440> begin<00:02:37.769> to<00:02:37.920> get<00:02:38.010> deficits

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
pitchers we begin to get deficits

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.490 
pitchers we begin to get deficits
because<00:02:38.940> we<00:02:39.060> spend<00:02:39.329> so<00:02:39.390> much<00:02:39.690> time<00:02:39.750> moving<00:02:40.290> in

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
because we spend so much time moving in

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.319 
because we spend so much time moving in
this<00:02:40.680> direction<00:02:40.820> let's<00:02:41.820> call<00:02:41.970> it<00:02:42.030> internal

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
this direction let's call it internal

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.240 
this direction let's call it internal
rotation<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:43.230> we've<00:02:43.410> got<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.799> be<00:02:43.920> aggressive

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
rotation that we've got to be aggressive

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.000 
rotation that we've got to be aggressive
laying<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.360> arm<00:02:45.540> by<00:02:45.780> external<00:02:46.440> rotation<00:02:46.890> so

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
laying the arm by external rotation so
