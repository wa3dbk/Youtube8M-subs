00:00:20.069 --> 00:00:20.079 
two different cogs which operate in the

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:22.919 
two different cogs which operate in the
arm<00:00:20.230> in<00:00:20.470> the<00:00:20.589> bucket<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:22.210> the<00:00:22.359> one<00:00:22.480> on<00:00:22.599> the<00:00:22.689> left

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:22.929 
arm in the bucket so the one on the left

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:25.739 
arm in the bucket so the one on the left
makes<00:00:23.439> the<00:00:23.769> book<00:00:24.429> it<00:00:24.609> go<00:00:24.759> up<00:00:24.909> and<00:00:25.029> down<00:00:25.150> I<00:00:25.509> mean

makes the book it go up and down I mean
the<00:00:25.869> arm<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:29.019> then<00:00:29.140> obviously<00:00:29.409> the<00:00:29.679> one<00:00:29.769> on

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
the arm and then obviously the one on

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.979 
the arm and then obviously the one on
the<00:00:29.979> right<00:00:30.149> makes<00:00:31.149> the<00:00:31.590> bucket<00:00:33.239> go<00:00:34.239> out<00:00:34.390> in<00:00:34.780> in

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
the right makes the bucket go out in in

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
the wrong with it which makes the arm

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.920 
the wrong with it which makes the arm
golf<00:00:44.620> and<00:00:44.830> darling<00:00:45.310> it's<00:00:45.610> like<00:00:45.910> connected<00:00:46.810> to

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
golf and darling it's like connected to

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.690 
golf and darling it's like connected to
a<00:00:46.960> worm<00:00:47.200> gear<00:00:47.530> which<00:00:47.740> it<00:00:48.010> connects<00:00:48.490> to<00:00:48.520> this

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:48.700 
a worm gear which it connects to this

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.140 
a worm gear which it connects to this
big<00:00:49.000> cog<00:00:49.330> in<00:00:49.480> ear<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:51.070> then<00:00:51.610> what<00:00:51.790> that<00:00:51.820> does

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
big cog in ear and then what that does

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.010 
big cog in ear and then what that does
it<00:00:52.270> raises<00:00:52.960> this<00:00:53.170> bit<00:00:54.270> which<00:00:55.270> then<00:00:55.810> raises

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
it raises this bit which then raises

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.610 
it raises this bit which then raises
this<00:00:56.500> pit<00:00:56.710> which<00:00:56.829> raises<00:00:57.100> the<00:00:57.220> whole<00:00:57.460> long

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
this pit which raises the whole long

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.810 
this pit which raises the whole long
white<00:00:59.620> large<00:00:59.829> you<00:01:00.100> can<00:01:00.250> see<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.770> then<00:01:02.890> the<00:01:03.670> one

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
white large you can see and then the one

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.510 
white large you can see and then the one
on<00:01:03.850> the<00:01:03.970> right<00:01:05.340> which<00:01:06.340> use<00:01:06.579> the<00:01:06.790> bucket<00:01:08.219> as<00:01:09.219> you

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
on the right which use the bucket as you

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.489 
on the right which use the bucket as you
can<00:01:09.640> see<00:01:09.909> it's<00:01:10.119> like<00:01:10.240> its<00:01:10.780> net<00:01:10.960> to<00:01:11.109> talk<00:01:11.289> to<00:01:11.469> a

00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:11.499 
can see it's like its net to talk to a

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:14.370 
can see it's like its net to talk to a
cog<00:01:12.030> which<00:01:13.030> then<00:01:13.270> it's<00:01:13.659> a<00:01:13.719> touch<00:01:13.899> another<00:01:14.170> one

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
cog which then it's a touch another one

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.330 
cog which then it's a touch another one
which<00:01:14.530> goes<00:01:14.560> through<00:01:15.130> the<00:01:16.090> seat<00:01:16.329> down<00:01:16.659> here

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
which goes through the seat down here

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.059 
which goes through the seat down here
but<00:01:18.340> then<00:01:19.799> goes<00:01:20.799> on<00:01:20.829> to<00:01:20.979> a<00:01:21.100> little<00:01:21.369> cog<00:01:23.069> goes

00:01:24.059 --> 00:01:24.069 
but then goes on to a little cog goes

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:26.160 
but then goes on to a little cog goes
with<00:01:24.219> this<00:01:24.340> bit<00:01:24.639> goes<00:01:24.880> in<00:01:25.299> and<00:01:25.479> then<00:01:25.689> what<00:01:25.869> does

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
with this bit goes in and then what does

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.999 
with this bit goes in and then what does
is<00:01:26.439> it<00:01:26.710> gets<00:01:26.950> to<00:01:27.219> squirm<00:01:27.609> gear<00:01:28.649> which<00:01:29.649> is

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
is it gets to squirm gear which is

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.309 
is it gets to squirm gear which is
touched<00:01:30.310> a<00:01:30.490> little<00:01:30.759> cog<00:01:30.999> and<00:01:31.240> then<00:01:31.329> type<00:01:31.689> and

00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:32.319 
touched a little cog and then type and

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:36.510 
touched a little cog and then type and
then<00:01:32.530> makes<00:01:32.770> s<00:01:33.479> piece<00:01:34.479> go<00:01:34.719> up<00:01:34.780> and<00:01:34.929> down<00:01:35.520> which

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
then makes s piece go up and down which

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.559 
then makes s piece go up and down which
pulls<00:01:37.149> this<00:01:37.479> big<00:01:37.959> on<00:01:39.060> backwards<00:01:40.060> forwards

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569 
pulls this big on backwards forwards
