 that is on the home page what can 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.750
 look in what is 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.750

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.730
 kraft eo 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.580

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.660

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:27.060
 here normally and the ninth inning of 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:31.170
 1.5 1.5 does not come out or comes out I think not what 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.550
 they have published but if I do, I think the same 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.820
 here you look for mod 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:39.320
 of the 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:43.500
 gives it to you automatically and the releases 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.930
 well for this they need to on the internet 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.680
 it's here where it says rockets and like coconut 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.430
 from chicken court 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.350

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.349
 ney 1.5 points 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.920

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:26.260
 download and send it to the desk as well 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.360
 same do with the no less intense as 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.280
 tell them to do the same but what 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.660
 important is coaching because it gives 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.270
 as 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.480
 help the interest because run crime 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:41.540
 suman kraft and friends the classic would be 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.720
 go to the female in the fort minecraft 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.900
 have it and I'll leave a video 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.900
 my own 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:56.430
 the classic would be 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:58.140
 start more r app data or right here app 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.660
 touch 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.310
 I recommend you to do what a 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.620
 direct access to the desktop because it 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.450
 make them easier 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.240
 you have to continue where 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.120
 we will be 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.099
 and they copy these two here 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.540
 ready that's all it has folder 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:20.860
 Many remember as we want 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.860
 and now in the minecraft 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.930
 ok now we are going to open a minecraft 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.750
 and now we're not going to see ya opened from the 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.700
 inter, as always, what will appear 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.920
 of the fort that will always be normal 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.299
 as well in my previous video and the one that 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.299
 leave them in the video description 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.989
 and being normally 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.910
 but it's starting slow 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.540
 It is very similar to the hiding place but as 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.950
 the beginning of the video with more options 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.490
 and a little easier 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.880
 but 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:44.340
 I would recommend them 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.340
 this more than his little hands 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.280
 well I'm going to close it because it's 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.440
 too slow friends I hope they have 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.720
 enjoyed the video we see in a next 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.960
