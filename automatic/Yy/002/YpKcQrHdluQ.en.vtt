00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 jada very almere has a problem it 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.870
 wants to grow and people from outside 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.639
 and they should all be able to 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.290
 shopping in the center 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.700
 but that is not possible because the center is in danger 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.290
 become unreachable 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.849
 what we saw very often is the traffic jams 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.139
 were created for the 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.970
 parking garages 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.029
 That is why the officials in Almere thought up 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.170
 the customized accessibility plan that is 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.300
 a very complicated plan but 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.180
 check that almere for both the 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.060
 residents as for the people from outside 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.340
 easily accessible that you quickly 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.010
 see where to go 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.770
 and so did almere so who can see 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.170
 is that we have information boards 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.430
 placed in front of the city center 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.219
 then you know approximately where to go 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.410
 go if you want to park and if you want 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.629
 move on faster 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.579
 nice plan were how do those signs work 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.739
 exactly what is indicated on this board 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.370
 are the routes to the parking places 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.250
 then to the covered parking garage and 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.980
 the parking garages whether they are full or not 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.080
 and that seems very handy but we 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.580
 complaints were found in the case of cannabis truth 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.040
 those plates and that's why we have it 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.380
 marleen from new vennep and marga from 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.510
 Capelle aan de IJssel asked for 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.700
 our test whether they work drive here 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.630
 marga along the first sign in almere 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.100
 I've seen short tomorrow 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.829
 gives nothing further is a sign 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.100
 and have already seen you 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:30.469
 yes two seconds is allowed to filter loop 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.689
 well and that's the problem so the signs 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:35.420
 they flash past and the states a lot 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.189
 information because how much time do you have 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.689
 actually to see such a sign as you 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.700
 here normally underneath out with 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.350
 the allowed speed on you only one 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.020
 few seconds to get big in you 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.479
 Marga not to include from Almere 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.110
 but the almmers themselves then understand them 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.090
 well 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.970
 I don't understand anything at all about the plate and me 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.289
 really know for sure that 95% of the 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.939
 almmers 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.310
 and also understand nothing of that and that 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.990
 people coming from outside is that we are there 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.939
 none of it 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.439
 we take a look at marleen who is also ahead 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.759
 first met the 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.229
 electronic boards 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.720
 oh that will be driving laps again 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.740
 of course you get irritation h 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.560
 well back to ours 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.900
 traffic psychologist where should be a good one 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.430
 plate exactly 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.960
 report must it must becomes very simple 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.380
 his people need that at a glance 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.060
 able to understand and people absolutely 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.890
 do not confuse 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.940
 let's take a good look at it 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.240
 then look at the plate 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.730
 there are symbols on it we see station 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.040
 intersections with traffic lights roundabouts 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.850
 sections with traffic jams sections without 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.170
 traffic jams all free parking garages 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.240
 parking garages that are full 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.280
 and then there is also an arrow somewhere 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.850
 where you are and all in two 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.950
 seconds 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.810
 yes a lot of information 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.520
 traffic psychologist gerard ter toolen 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.240
 has a clear opinion about the 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.520
 plates 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.800
 I am concerned with or information 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.510
 is understandable for road users and me 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.700
 would this be labeled as absolute 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.280
 incomprehensible but alderman thinks that 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.350
 not anchor on December 4 last year 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.930
 during the commissioning of the plates 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.010
 they are this and it is really the 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.870
 intend that you do it at a glance 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.459
 can look it i think it should be no 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.500
 be a problem 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.709
 well let's see that cancer or 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.360
 no problem then tells 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:23.459
 we our seven in two seconds 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.950
 what a square means a movie 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.879
 look 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:32.450
 oh that is just seeing you a child 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:34.099
 place that is thereby the town hall 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.200
 so I am in front of my mind 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:40.670
 to get there we have the route 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:43.310
 roundabout and then well 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.880
 other example than you two now 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.180
 seconds start now 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.180
 round is 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.660
 I seen 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.890
 I think traffic lights are wrong it 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.570
 are roundabouts 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.220
 Meanwhile, the municipality of Almere is the same 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.870
 well behind that the signs maybe anyway 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.310
 not very clear 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.890
 an investigation has been done by the 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.590
 municipality showing that almeerders 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.050
 have to pass that sign five times 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.450
 ago to understand anything 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.250
 well let alone day trippers like 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.019
 tomorrow to marleen getting it 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.209
 but the alderman does not agree with that 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.400
 once we have to communicate well 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.960
 we have to explain it and people have to 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.640
 get used to it so there are also full of 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.230
 material for hole at the time yes one 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.150
 information board must be explained 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.700
 with a full there was no traffic sign 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.440
 but traffic sign 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.210
 alderman anchor van almere the 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.000
 traffic psychologist say it's one 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.160
 worthless sign is we admit it is 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.710
 also a bit experimental we we 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.120
 think that this way works how much 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.430
 and three plates actually cost well 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.440
 has already cost my bag or six tons 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.070
 but the documents speak of 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.410
 nine tons and a quarter of a million euros 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:58.950
 other costs third after added 1 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:01.050
 million 150,000 euros so frits huis van 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.470
 livable almere is going to ask questions 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.470
 the alderman
