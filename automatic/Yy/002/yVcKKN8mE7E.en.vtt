00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
anything away from those those wonderful

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.069 
anything away from those those wonderful
women<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:03.000> mean<00:02:03.180> they're<00:02:03.420> beautiful<00:02:03.930> they<00:02:04.049> are

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
women I mean they're beautiful they are

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.709 
women I mean they're beautiful they are
but<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.909> think<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:06.030> would<00:02:06.119> be<00:02:06.270> just<00:02:06.509> as

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
but I think that would be just as

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.199 
but I think that would be just as
beautiful<00:02:06.930> if<00:02:07.320> they<00:02:07.500> embraced<00:02:08.179> something<00:02:09.179> a

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
beautiful if they embraced something a

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.919 
beautiful if they embraced something a
little<00:02:09.330> bit<00:02:09.479> more<00:02:09.629> real<00:02:09.929> and

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
little bit more real and

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.259 
little bit more real and
I<00:02:10.989> don't<00:02:11.799> know<00:02:11.859> but<00:02:12.129> anyway<00:02:12.489> that's<00:02:13.030> just<00:02:13.090> the

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
I don't know but anyway that's just the

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.479 
I don't know but anyway that's just the
rebel<00:02:13.540> in<00:02:13.629> me<00:02:13.659> I<00:02:13.750> think<00:02:13.900> basically<00:02:14.680> damaged

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
rebel in me I think basically damaged

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.309 
rebel in me I think basically damaged
curiosity<00:02:16.299> and<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.599> fact<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:16.959> I<00:02:17.079> just

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
curiosity and the fact that I just

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.640 
curiosity and the fact that I just
refused<00:02:17.709> to<00:02:17.709> let<00:02:17.890> anybody<00:02:18.400> tell<00:02:18.670> me<00:02:18.730> that<00:02:19.650> what

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
refused to let anybody tell me that what

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.830 
refused to let anybody tell me that what
God<00:02:20.859> made<00:02:21.189> in<00:02:21.400> me<00:02:21.549> is<00:02:21.700> not<00:02:21.879> beautiful<00:02:22.269> all<00:02:22.629> by

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
God made in me is not beautiful all by

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.449 
God made in me is not beautiful all by
itself<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.620> I<00:02:24.069> was<00:02:24.280> determined<00:02:24.459> to<00:02:24.969> find<00:02:26.459> that

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
itself and I was determined to find that
