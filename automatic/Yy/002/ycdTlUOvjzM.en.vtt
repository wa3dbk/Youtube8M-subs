00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.129
 very good and welcome to minecraft 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.920
 15w 33c and as you are seeing I have a 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.840
 fixed diamond shield what else thing 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.060
 cool in this case I have to say that 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.560
 I'm doing a bit of cheating worth not 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.660
 is nothing that has been added in the 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.970
 Last snapshot may be something that is 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.649
 do in the future but possibly not 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.899
 because at the moment because we have the 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:33.880
 normal shields of govern are all 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:36.730
 edited because what I'm using is 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.070
 a surf pack that changes the model of the 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.390
 shield is worth as you are seeing this is 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.120
 a diamond shield that was proposed 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.800
 do a lot of time in minecraft 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.600
 good what was proposed in reddit for 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.089
 that we have it in mind of 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.920
 At the moment, it seems that for now, 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:53.320
 have taken into account but good is a 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.079
 idea that a user is very cool 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.609
 it has turned it into a playable shield 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.339
 as long as we have the result 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:01.899
 put in and at the same time we also have to 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:03.819
 see out there in the packages of 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.600
 resources I have a lot of variants 

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:06.400
 OK 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.560
 we have the enders and the one that I will go 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.950
 putting in here good as you see the one in 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.310
 gold the iron here we have the 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.930
 leather obsidian leather slide 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.490
 stone and the wooden 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.650
 Well, you can see a few 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.540
 all not but good for you to see in 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.910
 this case the only thing that I see bad to 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.070
 this series of surf back is that they can not 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.500
 be all together and we can not have a 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.240
 shield of each color for example with a 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.070
 different texture that would be ideal not 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.140
 would be what to me for example 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.880
 would like more unless in the future 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.740
 so say hey look let's do the 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.479
 wooden shield in the iron bucket the 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.270
 golden leku diamond shield and so on 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:46.119
 in the case in that case yes they could 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.369
 get to put these variants in each 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.740
 one of those shields not however however 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.630
 good here we have the one of as it is called 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.820
 the one in can be good no matter it 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.979
 we have here this after we have for 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.290
 another example that I liked a lot 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.180
 is this the leather one that was very very 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.570
 cool ficas stress how beautiful the round 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.160
 and he's pretty handsome is that this is me 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.050
 strange that I did not want to put 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.820
 moment in minecraft because it has 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.010
 It would be great it would be very cool 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.209
 then still I still do not lose the 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.520
 Hope I hope that in the future 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.410
 It can also be done after it hears 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.180
 you could also get to paint the 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.400
 the horn would also be very cool 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.440
 we also have the stone that has 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.860
 liked also a lot and that I 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.310
 love 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.750
 at the same time also that the wooden one and that 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.060
 it is also seen as with the cracks of 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.640
 foot is very cool is very cool is 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.410
 very handsome then we have is over here 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.580
 also that it is also very cool that 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.710
 it could also be red 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.780
 according to the wood with which I am and 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.060
 but for now as I say it is 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.140
 only one idea only one concept 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.030
 is something that can be done with the 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.580
 surf pac but with nothing else but good 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.020
 guys this has been the video remember 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.730
 that I'm going to leave the download link 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.950
 in the description you only have to 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.260
 unzip all the tips that are 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.970
 inside the main chip inside the 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.130
 folder turns out that inside minecraft 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.500
 and with this you can go here to 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.959
 options to resource pack and load 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.310
 in the shield that you want is worth 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.200
 the one you like the most because you can load it 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.430
 in this way so if you know but 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.750
 I've been a lot 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.270

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.270
