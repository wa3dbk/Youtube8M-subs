00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.380
 welcome back to the sun of our mix on 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.910
 millennium view of wells today 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:19.529
 let's face ciari with that complicated one 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:32.880
 little strange then respiratory proof of 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:34.550
 March second good good via non 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.730
 I know because who does not have many monsters 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:43.790
 london four star high defense 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.790
 I would never want to start with the second one 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.079
 then 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.949
 again for the velo due card 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.870
 take it off 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:06.489
 then let's put this down 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:06.489
 first and put a day to this 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.229
 let's put the game and this is it but 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.020
 after yes we have to activate this 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.020
 we can sacrifice those entries 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.340
 then 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.790
 we were putting in so many positions 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:43.020
 defense and after is in the next round 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:49.000
 let's recall this is a bit of a touchwiz 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:54.360
 been called by 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.360
 fanpage let's see some 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.210
 1500 and then we win 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:17.400
 the next round bum bum bum 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:19.860
 if you see it's a little then they do it 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:27.319
 to think 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:27.319
 since he has nothing he can do 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.470
 let's do like this 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.950
 hello so 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.110
 it is so 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:49.110
 but we have the most free camp we evoke 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:52.819
 let's celebrate this or we could 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.819
 we also do something like this 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.400
 the show listen when four don't 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.980
 let's vote this goes like this 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:50.090
 evil sword box and now we attack it 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:52.690
 directly 1 and 2 let it go down 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.690
 soon 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:05.600
 he did it 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:08.140
 to the ritual to the ones we won the 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.140
 report 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:20.700
 we bring him too much for now 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.700
 we did so it was with him 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:36.850
 then with the other and with another boom you win 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:50.680
 it will be easy it was right then it goes 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:56.710
 many of them are good elementals for the hero 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:05:05.880
 woman you make them this strength 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:05.880
 which is a bit 2100 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.470
 I know I'll get that card from 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.690

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.330
 then razzoli processes need everything 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:32.290
 next we will face hatred in the last 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.880
 will be more I believe as usual position 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.380

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.340
