project you can make over the weekend
this<00:00:14.969> weekend<00:00:15.389> we're<00:00:15.870> gonna<00:00:15.929> play<00:00:16.199> around

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
this weekend we're gonna play around

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.890 
this weekend we're gonna play around
with<00:00:16.590> some<00:00:16.800> teeny<00:00:17.100> tiny<00:00:17.460> robots<00:00:17.880> beam<00:00:18.660> BOTS

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
with some teeny tiny robots beam BOTS

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.929 
with some teeny tiny robots beam BOTS
are<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.170> brainchild<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.680> mark<00:00:20.279> Tilden<00:00:20.789> a

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
are the brainchild of mark Tilden a

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.730 
are the brainchild of mark Tilden a
really<00:00:21.359> cool<00:00:21.570> robot<00:00:21.720> assist<00:00:22.199> this<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.710> a

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
really cool robot assist this is a

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.519 
really cool robot assist this is a
CIMMYT<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.400> it's<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:24.150> solar<00:00:24.750> engine<00:00:25.350> that

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
CIMMYT and it's a solar engine that

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.740 
CIMMYT and it's a solar engine that
means<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.980> electricity<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:27.090> made<00:00:27.119> from

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
means that electricity is made from

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.480 
means that electricity is made from
sunlight<00:00:28.109> hitting<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:28.680> little<00:00:28.859> panel<00:00:29.160> and

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
sunlight hitting this little panel and

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.150 
sunlight hitting this little panel and
because<00:00:30.420> it's<00:00:30.599> not<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.810> lot<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.170> electricity<00:00:31.500> it

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
because it's not a lot of electricity it

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.709 
because it's not a lot of electricity it
gets<00:00:32.399> stored<00:00:32.610> in<00:00:32.759> these<00:00:32.820> capacitors<00:00:33.420> until

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
gets stored in these capacitors until

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:34.850 
gets stored in these capacitors until
there's<00:00:33.899> enough<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.260> make<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.500> little<00:00:34.710> motor

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
there's enough to make the little motor

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.799 
there's enough to make the little motor
turn<00:00:35.250> when<00:00:35.730> there's<00:00:35.910> enough<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.420> goes<00:00:36.540> blue

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
turn when there's enough it goes blue

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.110 
turn when there's enough it goes blue
and<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.320> turns<00:00:37.649> this<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.489> really<00:00:38.730> fun<00:00:38.940> because

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
and it turns this is really fun because

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.180 
and it turns this is really fun because
it's<00:00:39.660> completely<00:00:40.050> autonomous<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.950> moves

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
it's completely autonomous it moves

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.100 
it's completely autonomous it moves
right<00:00:41.399> along<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.180> if<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.390> hits<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.629> wall<00:00:42.780> it'll

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
right along and if it hits a wall it'll

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.630 
right along and if it hits a wall it'll
switch<00:00:43.379> directions<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.040> go<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.250> different<00:00:44.340> way

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
switch directions and go a different way

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.340 
switch directions and go a different way
let's<00:00:45.239> lift<00:00:45.510> up<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.660> hood<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.050> I'll<00:00:46.170> show<00:00:46.320> you

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
let's lift up the hood and I'll show you

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.110 
let's lift up the hood and I'll show you
how<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.620> works<00:00:46.829> underneath<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.730> solar<00:00:48.000> panel

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
how it works underneath this solar panel

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.770 
how it works underneath this solar panel
is<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:49.230> flashing<00:00:49.649> LED<00:00:50.100> two<00:00:50.789> transistors<00:00:51.480> a

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
is the flashing LED two transistors a

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.250 
is the flashing LED two transistors a
little<00:00:52.170> capacitor<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.489> resistor<00:00:53.989> this<00:00:54.989> all

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
little capacitor and a resistor this all

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.139 
little capacitor and a resistor this all
works<00:00:55.500> together<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:56.190> work<00:00:56.340> as<00:00:56.550> basically<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
works together to work as basically the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.420 
works together to work as basically the
circuit<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.870> when<00:00:58.770> there's<00:00:58.920> enough<00:00:59.219> power

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
circuit that when there's enough power

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.520 
circuit that when there's enough power
in<00:00:59.730> there<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.000> releases<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:01.050> may<00:01:01.260> look<00:01:01.410> a

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
in there it releases it this may look a

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.750 
in there it releases it this may look a
little<00:01:01.559> intimidating<00:01:02.250> for<00:01:02.280> somebody<00:01:02.670> who's

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
little intimidating for somebody who's

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.490 
little intimidating for somebody who's
never<00:01:02.850> done<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.120> bean<00:01:03.359> bot<00:01:03.570> project<00:01:04.049> but<00:01:04.379> this

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
never done a bean bot project but this

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.260 
never done a bean bot project but this
is<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.680> great<00:01:05.129> way<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.369> get<00:01:05.580> started<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:06.000> being

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
is a great way to get started in being
