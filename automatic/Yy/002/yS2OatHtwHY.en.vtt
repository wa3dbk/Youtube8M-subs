00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.359
 for what you love your knee just like 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.610
 it so you must need 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.759
 use belt 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:15.780
 mount the same donning technique 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:19.680
 even the most missing hand between two 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.650
 straps fixing time on the upper third 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.609
 shoulder 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:32.040
 we are delaying today because of the right 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:35.460
 side of the store and you already have a certificate of 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.000
 were fired from the knee pay 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.180
 note that the current link 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.320
 no longer need to hold on 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.219
 weapons 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:52.489
 it is clearly fixed by a triangle 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:58.949
 formed between the brush of the left hand 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:01:00.820
 elbow left hand and belt fixed 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.059
 on top 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.340
 necha whole field that no matter how you 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.229
 were engaged 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.430
 machine down and this is a significant 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.430
 degrees 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.530
 makes it possible to increase sustainability 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.660
 on hand 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.260
 shot ah and especially when produced in 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.260
 queues 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.800
 features of the position for shooting with 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.740
 the knee using the belt is the same as 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.970
 and in position for shooting from the knee without 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.970
 use belt 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.000
 you see a triangle formed 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:26.980
 The automatic knob of the machine is a belt buckle and 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.980
 bast left hand 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.990
 when using a belt for firing 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.370
 plays its length 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.610
 its length increases and decreases 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.790
 just like you know when 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.690
 increase the length of its turn pull 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:28.030
 a little more in this blind flint shorter 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.030
 on the contrary, the belt is longer
