piece<00:00:05.400> 684<00:00:06.150> was<00:00:06.330> divided<00:00:06.930> for<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.170> most<00:00:07.379> part

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
piece 684 was divided for the most part

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.890 
piece 684 was divided for the most part
into<00:00:08.099> three<00:00:08.460> sections<00:00:08.760> you<00:00:09.420> couldn't<00:00:09.719> say

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
into three sections you couldn't say

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.629 
into three sections you couldn't say
four<00:00:10.290> but<00:00:10.530> that<00:00:10.679> was<00:00:10.800> mostly<00:00:10.920> just<00:00:11.160> like<00:00:11.429> one

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
four but that was mostly just like one

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.970 
four but that was mostly just like one
page<00:00:11.910> at<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.240> end<00:00:12.389> so<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.170> first<00:00:13.380> section<00:00:13.620> is

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
page at the end so the first section is

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.260 
page at the end so the first section is
smoke<00:00:14.700> reverses<00:00:15.269> Virgo<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.490> it's<00:00:17.490> crazy<00:00:17.910> uh

we still don't get too much of verbal
powers<00:00:21.150> but<00:00:21.300> we<00:00:21.390> do<00:00:21.539> learn<00:00:21.750> one<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.109> his<00:00:22.260> things

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
blows away smoker but it was a pretty

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.440 
blows away smoker but it was a pretty
intense<00:00:34.170> little<00:00:34.500> scuffle<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:35.489> far<00:00:35.820> smoker

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
intense little scuffle so far smoker

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.360 
intense little scuffle so far smoker
tries<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:37.020> come<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.410> without<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.890> hook<00:00:38.100> and

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
tries to come in without the hook and

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.400 
tries to come in without the hook and
whatnot<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.210> was<00:00:39.329> staged<00:00:39.510> very<00:00:39.809> well<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.200> like

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
whatnot it was staged very well I like

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.380 
whatnot it was staged very well I like
the<00:00:40.590> fight<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.670> was<00:00:41.969> probably<00:00:42.090> my

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
the fight and that was probably my

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.790 
the fight and that was probably my
favorite<00:00:42.629> portion<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.350> chapter<00:00:43.680> not

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
favorite portion of the chapter not

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.920 
favorite portion of the chapter not
necessarily<00:00:44.460> because<00:00:44.789> uh<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.390> fighting<00:00:45.809> was

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
necessarily because uh the fighting was

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.410 
necessarily because uh the fighting was
just<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.289> way<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.620> was<00:00:46.739> staged<00:00:47.039> properly<00:00:47.879> and

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
just the way it was staged properly and

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.450 
just the way it was staged properly and
just<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:49.170> see<00:00:49.320> smoker<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.770> action<00:00:50.129> was<00:00:50.250> pretty

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
just to see smoker in action was pretty

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.700 
just to see smoker in action was pretty
awesome<00:00:50.690> because<00:00:51.690> last<00:00:52.079> time<00:00:52.320> we<00:00:52.440> saw<00:00:52.590> him<00:00:52.649> in

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
awesome because last time we saw him in

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.920 
awesome because last time we saw him in
action<00:00:52.890> was<00:00:53.190> against<00:00:53.399> law<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.090> law<00:00:54.360> kinda<00:00:54.809> you

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
action was against law and law kinda you

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.860 
action was against law and law kinda you
know<00:00:54.960> put<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.379> moves<00:00:55.649> down<00:00:56.239> but<00:00:57.239> um<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:57.719> that

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
know put the moves down but um so that

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.910 
know put the moves down but um so that
was<00:00:57.899> definitely<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.410> pretty<00:00:58.680> interesting

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
was definitely a pretty interesting

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.680 
was definitely a pretty interesting
fight<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.340> liked<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.760> part<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.120> chapter<00:01:00.510> I

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
fight I liked that part of the chapter I

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.660 
fight I liked that part of the chapter I
wonder<00:01:00.960> if<00:01:00.989> smoke<00:01:01.350> was<00:01:01.559> done<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:01.920> doubt<00:01:02.430> that

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
wonder if smoke was done I doubt that

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.230 
wonder if smoke was done I doubt that
he's<00:01:02.910> dead<00:01:03.239> but<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.830> know<00:01:04.949> cuz<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.250> foresee<00:01:06.000> him

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240

defeating burgle on this one and it's
really<00:01:08.250> interesting<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.640> see<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:08.820> Virgo

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
really interesting to see that Virgo

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.020 
really interesting to see that Virgo
just<00:01:09.479> does<00:01:09.630> not<00:01:09.840> give<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.590> damn<00:01:10.920> about<00:01:11.250> the

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
maybe this is leading towards Sanji and

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.240 
maybe this is leading towards Sanji and
Toshiki<00:03:00.480> romance<00:03:00.900> later<00:03:01.109> on<00:03:01.319> and<00:03:01.709> then<00:03:02.190> the

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
Toshiki romance later on and then the

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.190 
Toshiki romance later on and then the
third<00:03:02.459> part<00:03:02.730> of<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.849> chapter<00:03:03.060> was<00:03:03.510> focused<00:03:04.109> on

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
third part of the chapter was focused on

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.530 
third part of the chapter was focused on
Caesar<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:05.010> this<00:03:05.519> was<00:03:05.670> probably<00:03:05.849> my<00:03:06.299> least

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
Caesar and this was probably my least

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.240 
Caesar and this was probably my least
favorite<00:03:07.290> part<00:03:07.410> of<00:03:07.500> this<00:03:07.590> chapter<00:03:07.799> I<00:03:08.010> guess

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
favorite part of this chapter I guess

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.309 
favorite part of this chapter I guess
because<00:03:08.849> it<00:03:09.299> was<00:03:09.390> for<00:03:09.599> the<00:03:09.660> most<00:03:09.840> part<00:03:10.079> some

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
because it was for the most part some

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.349 
because it was for the most part some
stuff<00:03:10.650> that<00:03:10.769> we<00:03:10.950> didn't<00:03:11.489> know<00:03:11.640> but<00:03:12.180> at<00:03:12.299> the

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
stuff that we didn't know but at the

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.050 
stuff that we didn't know but at the
same<00:03:12.510> time<00:03:12.750> some<00:03:13.170> stuff<00:03:13.349> we<00:03:13.470> did<00:03:13.680> know

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
same time some stuff we did know

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.940 
same time some stuff we did know
basically<00:03:15.060> that<00:03:15.180> Caesar<00:03:15.750> is<00:03:15.900> kind<00:03:16.410> of<00:03:16.470> jealous

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
basically that Caesar is kind of jealous

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.159 
basically that Caesar is kind of jealous
and<00:03:17.220> he's<00:03:17.310> been<00:03:17.489> jealous<00:03:17.700> of<00:03:17.940> Vega<00:03:18.540> punk<00:03:18.870> for

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169 
and he's been jealous of Vega punk for

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:21.500 
and he's been jealous of Vega punk for
the<00:03:19.260> longest<00:03:19.590> time<00:03:19.859> and<00:03:20.099> that<00:03:20.910> was<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.120> little

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
the longest time and that was a little

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.360 
the longest time and that was a little
bit<00:03:21.630> interesting<00:03:21.930> but<00:03:22.380> I<00:03:22.560> guess<00:03:22.799> the<00:03:22.980> main

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
bit interesting but I guess the main

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.250 
bit interesting but I guess the main
thing<00:03:23.430> that<00:03:23.790> caught<00:03:24.540> my<00:03:24.690> interest<00:03:24.720> with<00:03:25.109> this

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
thing that caught my interest with this

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.199 
thing that caught my interest with this
particular<00:03:25.560> part<00:03:25.889> was<00:03:26.130> we<00:03:26.579> find<00:03:26.819> out<00:03:27.000> that<00:03:27.090> it

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
particular part was we find out that it

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.000 
particular part was we find out that it
wasn't<00:03:27.389> Vega<00:03:27.720> Punk's<00:03:28.139> madness<00:03:28.829> that

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
wasn't Vega Punk's madness that

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.259 
wasn't Vega Punk's madness that
destroyed<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.489> island<00:03:29.790> it<00:03:29.880> was<00:03:29.940> Caesar

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
destroyed the island it was Caesar

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.330 
destroyed the island it was Caesar
because<00:03:30.870> he<00:03:30.989> got<00:03:31.139> kicked<00:03:31.349> out<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:31.739> the

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
because he got kicked out of the

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.250 
because he got kicked out of the
scientists<00:03:33.000> squad<00:03:33.269> and<00:03:33.510> basically<00:03:33.750> Caesars

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
scientists squad and basically Caesars

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.240 
scientists squad and basically Caesars
goal<00:03:34.500> is<00:03:34.769> to<00:03:35.220> be<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.519> most<00:03:35.730> renowned

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
goal is to be the most renowned

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.400 
goal is to be the most renowned
scientist<00:03:38.250> so<00:03:38.459> it<00:03:38.849> just<00:03:39.180> shows<00:03:39.239> us<00:03:39.540> Caesars<00:03:40.260> of

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
scientist so it just shows us Caesars of

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.680 
scientist so it just shows us Caesars of
mad<00:03:40.590> scientist<00:03:41.130> that's<00:03:41.280> really<00:03:41.579> what<00:03:41.940> the

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
mad scientist that's really what the

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.180 
mad scientist that's really what the
depth<00:03:42.900> to<00:03:43.049> his<00:03:43.139> character<00:03:43.500> is<00:03:43.650> he<00:03:43.769> wants<00:03:43.980> to<00:03:44.069> be

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
depth to his character is he wants to be

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.150 
depth to his character is he wants to be
well<00:03:44.819> known<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.560> seemingly<00:03:46.560> he's<00:03:46.769> passing

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
well known and seemingly he's passing

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.250 
well known and seemingly he's passing
along<00:03:47.370> that<00:03:47.609> he<00:03:47.730> wants<00:03:48.030> his<00:03:48.510> science<00:03:48.870> to<00:03:49.019> build

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
along that he wants his science to build

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.930 
along that he wants his science to build
peace<00:03:49.739> and<00:03:50.010> whatnot<00:03:50.370> I<00:03:50.400> don't<00:03:50.669> really<00:03:50.849> think

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
peace and whatnot I don't really think

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.339 
peace and whatnot I don't really think
he<00:03:51.060> cares<00:03:51.269> about<00:03:51.450> that<00:03:51.630> he<00:03:51.900> just<00:03:52.079> wants<00:03:52.319> to

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
he cares about that he just wants to

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.099 
he cares about that he just wants to
recognition<00:03:52.889> under<00:03:53.130> glory<00:03:53.549> and<00:03:53.849> I<00:03:54.540> just<00:03:54.930> can't

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
recognition under glory and I just can't

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.180 
recognition under glory and I just can't
wait<00:03:55.200> to<00:03:55.290> see<00:03:55.440> Caesar<00:03:55.650> got<00:03:55.859> knocked<00:03:56.099> down

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
wait to see Caesar got knocked down

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.960 
wait to see Caesar got knocked down
because<00:03:57.079> he's<00:03:58.079> been<00:03:58.410> around<00:03:58.620> way<00:03:58.950> too<00:03:59.220> long

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
because he's been around way too long

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.819 
because he's been around way too long
laughing<00:04:00.540> a<00:04:00.599> smirking<00:04:01.079> so<00:04:01.290> he<00:04:01.680> definitely

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
laughing a smirking so he definitely

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.280 
laughing a smirking so he definitely
needs<00:04:02.250> to<00:04:02.340> get<00:04:02.430> took<00:04:02.609> it<00:04:02.760> down<00:04:02.989> overall<00:04:03.989> the

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
needs to get took it down overall the

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.530 
needs to get took it down overall the
chapter<00:04:04.680> was<00:04:04.829> all<00:04:04.980> right<00:04:05.310> maybe<00:04:05.760> I'm<00:04:06.060> not<00:04:06.269> to

for some other series and this for the

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:12.170 
for some other series and this for the
most<00:04:11.099> part<00:04:11.310> although<00:04:11.489> the<00:04:11.730> fight<00:04:11.940> in<00:04:12.090> the

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
most part although the fight in the

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.089 
most part although the fight in the
beginning<00:04:12.540> was<00:04:12.660> good<00:04:12.930> and<00:04:13.230> some<00:04:13.829> of<00:04:13.919> the<00:04:13.980> other

beginning was good and some of the other
parts<00:04:14.370> was<00:04:14.519> pretty<00:04:14.790> decent<00:04:15.239> it<00:04:16.139> just<00:04:16.829> didn't

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
parts was pretty decent it just didn't

parts was pretty decent it just didn't
have<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.459> impact<00:04:17.880> that<00:04:18.030> you<00:04:18.449> know<00:04:18.539> one<00:04:18.720> piece

the lines of the Dragon Ball manga if

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.860 
the lines of the Dragon Ball manga if
you<00:04:41.740> see<00:04:41.919> on<00:04:42.039> the<00:04:42.219> back<00:04:42.400> on<00:04:42.699> the<00:04:42.729> spine<00:04:43.389> that's

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
you see on the back on the spine that's

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.469 
you see on the back on the spine that's
like<00:04:44.110> a<00:04:44.139> Shenron<00:04:44.740> and<00:04:44.949> he<00:04:45.099> looks<00:04:45.279> exactly<00:04:45.969> like

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
like a Shenron and he looks exactly like

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.080 
like a Shenron and he looks exactly like
he<00:04:47.379> does<00:04:47.620> and<00:04:47.919> this<00:04:48.249> particular<00:04:48.520> chapter<00:04:48.879> at

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
he does and this particular chapter at

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.820 
he does and this particular chapter at
the<00:04:49.150> end<00:04:49.330> so<00:04:49.509> it's<00:04:49.930> quite<00:04:50.080> interesting<00:04:50.590> to<00:04:50.680> see

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
the end so it's quite interesting to see
