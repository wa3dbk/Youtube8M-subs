00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
at matching them $6.99 I'm not sure if I

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.010 
at matching them $6.99 I'm not sure if I
said<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:54.240> can<00:01:54.360> bring<00:01:54.450> out<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.659> real

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
thing as well so they can see the real

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.080 
thing as well so they can see the real
life<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.710> make<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.130> Association<00:01:59.399> that

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
life and it make that Association that

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.179 
life and it make that Association that
way<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.299> that's<00:02:00.750> really<00:02:01.380> really<00:02:01.680> good<00:02:01.890> and

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189
