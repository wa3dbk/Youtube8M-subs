00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.630
 Nine people I am the city wants to come 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.150
 to a new video channel today for 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.799
 weapons we to g36 target before which 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.840
 much desired is clearer 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.330
 winner and that's why it does now 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.550
 fang were with the damage of the s25 to 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.619
 I have to control 15.4 for a carbine 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.189
 For example, doctor e52 value one 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.160
 exception 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.539
 that makes 1 24 hits in the head 47 in 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.019
 the breast and five to seven in the 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.939
 legs 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.320
 so not really stands out because 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.210
 both do not drop much on them 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.660
 different from drop off start is at eight 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.160
 meters 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.590
 that is, to eight meter makes a 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.930
 damage of 25 then the damage falls off 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.850
 up to 50 meters and then we make minimal 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.800
 damage from 15 4 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.530
 the fire rate is unfortunately a bit very 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.120
 low with 650 apm it is already 100 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.539
 less than it is in Battlefield 3's case 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.730
 was 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.949
 the feature of my trial unfortunately 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.320
 clearly the balls are flying as well 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:57.260
 he only mediocre fast than around the 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.269
 national 5c is the clear carrier 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.219
 with 500 meters per second is always 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.440
 still nokia will be targets on distance 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.000
 It's not as easy as moving 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.070
 I stop with the ak 15 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.530
 The range is the result of 750 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.180
 meter is completely alright 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.730
 Capacity is as we know it 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.710
 with 30 plus one shot and the after 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.150
 long time is still 21 seconds 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.200
 a ball is in progress and if so for 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.250
 completely empty 28 5 seconds too okay me 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.050
 live well with it 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.090
 Especially because the weapon he is for distance 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.130
 thought it is not so important 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.510
 does not really stand out, too 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.160
 not bad at all 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.770
 kickback she does not hit the gun like that 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.590
 good as the ak 15 up is it with 0 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.170
 2 5 even better left and right 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.580
 but each 0 3 is next to worse 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.140
 because the weapon always wobbles back and forth 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.540
 you can not control it here 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.050
 also very strong in the background 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.810
 now here 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.120
 for that the multiplier with 18 is still 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.680
 quite good again bad as ak 15 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.680
 but a good value 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.920
 in electroless the g36 c does what 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.630
 a carbine without bull top design 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.800
 should do that in the visor if 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.380
 I would not move 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.880
 03 that's okay with me 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.470
 move 08 that still has one 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.060
 little better than a storm rifle that 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.040
 but still try you at the 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.930
 shoot if possible not to move 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.670
 the balls are simply much more 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.070
 go outward and less the goal 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.740
 hit from the hip are the values the 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.290
 of course we have here for 16 sc 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.630
 with the low fire rate he the 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.230
 bad melee possibilities nothing 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.700
 to use interesting but well that 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.430
 time not important trying as possible 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.910
 few 6 30 c is not likely to be too 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.700
 shoot 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.730
 that's why the stress has risen to 0 085 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.500
 pro shot top that's really top that 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.900
 is at the top with it beats the ak 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.310
 15 that is hardly better that's really 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.870
 one of the best carabiner values 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.670
 You should definitely go for it 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.380
 Remember when you could put on 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.870
 say you can play it as well as 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.360
 the ak 15 it will be called in the 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.190
 oral or compensatory 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.120
 short but I take it just that 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.160
 ak 15 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.350
 I have another one for the g6 30 c 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.030
 Variation with the visor one actually has 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.310
 free selection that runs over reflex 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.690
 culio the cobra until holos time and 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.209
 so on, you can be rough 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.800
 I would not take anything after that 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.270
 recourse may have to 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.820
 amplifier or whoever wilders second 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.470
 when two such things live laser day 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.630
 can actually everything changes r 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.180
 melee towers said at the who 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.370
 that would destroy it 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.350
 distance one would notice much more 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.940
 We have an essay about it 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.530
 For a long time my arms are gone 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.780
 have heard that is the hard run 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.340
 that is not as good as in 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.660
 Battlefield 3 The recoil rises sharply 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.040
 and only a little bit the precision 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.890
 gets better and does not hurt 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.720
 But there is more here 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.250
 who will increase our weapon even more 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.590
 can build distance because she has 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.120
 Much more accurate is the region up in 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.640
 it's not so bad to climb here 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.720
 as with the ak 15 is much better 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.180
 That's why I would control here 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.100
 really grab a run on the track 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.750
 would for balancing the heavy robbery 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.970
 I then take the wrapped handle 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.290
 because it ensures that the recoil in 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.330
 first shot gets a bit lower 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.950
 which is still more high but so 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.750
 The less the better I would be here with 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.050
 heavy running is a great combination 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.070
 I can definitely continue in the 4th 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:16.010
 now a conclusion to the g 36 c but it 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.810
 I miss the advantage to the field 15 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.340
 it is quite good on distance 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.160
 beautiful and everything not sooo 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.510
 radiation increase but the ak 15 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.680
 would shoot faster in close combat 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.900
 still faster overall 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.870
 the recoil is also easier to mine 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.030
 control housefly fast and 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.310
 I'm sure I'll ask myself there 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.940
 so a bit where does the g6 30 line up 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.350
 c 1 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.520
 there are still changes 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.840
 So exist if now 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.900
 always by a patch general motors 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.660
 inserted but otherwise I would not know 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.240
 why I currently play the g36 c 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.380
 should if I stop my eyes with 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.790
 the ak 15 better alternative 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.170
 that was it with these weapons ready 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.840
 again suggestions in the description 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:59.630
 last time there was still so before it 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.940
 rather 21 was mentioned quite often too 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.230
 So they were the ac weapons 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.640
 will see what next now 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.640
 comes skin pure people
