saliva<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.920> mean<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.690> think<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:37.200> acts<00:00:37.500> as<00:00:37.739> a

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
saliva I mean I think it it acts as a

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.940 
saliva I mean I think it it acts as a
little<00:00:38.129> protection<00:00:38.460> against<00:00:39.000> corrosion<00:00:39.120> and

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
little protection against corrosion and

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.069 
little protection against corrosion and
I<00:00:40.950> think<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.790> just<00:00:41.940> looks<00:00:42.180> good<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.629> know<00:00:42.750> so

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
I think it just looks good you know so

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:50.979 
I think it just looks good you know so
you<00:00:43.670> do<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.760> for<00:00:44.940> myself<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.629> like<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.050> design

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.010 

and<00:00:51.989> like<00:00:52.260> how<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.559> came<00:00:52.590> out<00:00:53.570> every<00:00:54.570> still<00:00:54.870> the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
and like how it came out every still the

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.959 
and like how it came out every still the
rear<00:00:55.170> axle<00:00:55.469> wheel<00:00:55.739> differently<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.670> one<00:00:56.820> has

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
rear axle wheel differently this one has

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.200 
rear axle wheel differently this one has
even<00:00:57.149> more<00:00:57.510> blue<00:00:57.870> spots<00:00:58.370> than<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.670> ones<00:00:59.879> i<00:01:00.030> did

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
even more blue spots than the ones i did

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.569 
even more blue spots than the ones i did
before<00:01:00.390> it's<00:01:01.379> always<00:01:01.559> hard<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.949> see<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.190> camera

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
before it's always hard to see on camera

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
white about the whole thing is 15 inches

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.910 
white about the whole thing is 15 inches
long<00:02:43.310> and<00:02:43.550> I<00:02:44.510> actually<00:02:44.660> have<00:02:45.050> it<00:02:45.200> one<00:02:45.470> side<00:02:45.740> is

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
long and I actually have it one side is

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.800 
long and I actually have it one side is
alway<00:02:46.960> this<00:02:47.960> will<00:02:48.260> be<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.530> compound<00:02:49.070> side<00:02:49.370> and

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
alway this will be the compound side and

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.810 
alway this will be the compound side and
I<00:02:50.810> had<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.230> leftover<00:02:51.740> for<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.070> other<00:02:52.190> side<00:02:52.460> I

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
I had the leftover for the other side I

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.300 
I had the leftover for the other side I
put<00:02:53.420> just<00:02:53.660> a<00:02:53.810> modest<00:02:54.290> polishing<00:02:54.770> paste<00:02:54.920> on<00:02:55.190> it

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
put just a modest polishing paste on it

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.280 
put just a modest polishing paste on it
so<00:02:55.460> that<00:02:55.490> will<00:02:55.820> be<00:02:55.940> forward<00:02:56.330> like<00:02:56.750> polishing

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
so that will be forward like polishing

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.960 
so that will be forward like polishing
and<00:02:57.530> this<00:02:58.130> will<00:02:58.310> be<00:02:58.430> for<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:58.730> actual

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
and this will be for the actual

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.470 
and this will be for the actual
strapping<00:02:59.650> so<00:03:00.650> you<00:03:00.770> know<00:03:00.890> nice<00:03:01.370> small<00:03:02.000> compact

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
strapping so you know nice small compact

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.590 
strapping so you know nice small compact
size<00:03:02.800> it's<00:03:03.800> not<00:03:04.010> as<00:03:04.160> small<00:03:04.370> as<00:03:04.550> those<00:03:04.820> paint

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
size it's not as small as those paint

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.190 
size it's not as small as those paint
sticks<00:03:05.960> but<00:03:06.350> it<00:03:07.130> will<00:03:07.280> work<00:03:07.460> perfect<00:03:08.050> which<00:03:09.050> is

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
sticks but it will work perfect which is

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.540 
sticks but it will work perfect which is
have<00:03:09.320> to<00:03:09.440> get<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:09.710> compound<00:03:10.160> for<00:03:10.400> it<00:03:10.990> and<00:03:11.990> just

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
have to get the compound for it and just

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.680 
have to get the compound for it and just
use<00:03:13.550> the<00:03:13.880> what<00:03:14.720> it<00:03:14.870> called<00:03:15.790> epoxy<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:17.239> glue<00:03:17.270> to

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
use the what it called epoxy to glue to

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.410 
use the what it called epoxy to glue to
glue<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:18.140> leather<00:03:18.350> on<00:03:18.470> it<00:03:19.180> from<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.330> other

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
glue the leather on it from the other

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.040 
glue the leather on it from the other
side<00:03:20.690> and<00:03:21.250> when<00:03:22.250> I<00:03:22.580> now<00:03:22.970> have<00:03:23.239> a<00:03:23.270> nice<00:03:23.540> strap

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.740 

will<00:03:27.050> go<00:03:27.230> like<00:03:27.470> that<00:03:27.709> nice<00:03:28.040> and<00:03:28.370> can<00:03:29.209> take<00:03:29.450> care

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
will go like that nice and can take care

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.280 
will go like that nice and can take care
even<00:03:30.910> can<00:03:31.910> nicely<00:03:32.120> take<00:03:32.510> care<00:03:32.720> of<00:03:32.870> even<00:03:33.020> the

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
even can nicely take care of even the

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.500 
even can nicely take care of even the
big-knives<00:03:33.640> without<00:03:34.640> any<00:03:34.820> problem<00:03:35.300> you<00:03:35.360> know

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
big-knives without any problem you know

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.380 
big-knives without any problem you know
it's<00:03:35.720> not<00:03:35.900> the<00:03:35.959> small<00:03:36.410> piece<00:03:36.620> of<00:03:36.650> leather<00:03:37.390> for

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
it's not the small piece of leather for

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.440 
it's not the small piece of leather for
small<00:03:38.720> one<00:03:38.930> you<00:03:39.560> have<00:03:39.680> nice<00:03:39.980> are<00:03:40.310> to<00:03:40.910> work<00:03:41.120> with

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
middle paper holder nicely you can do

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.759 
middle paper holder nicely you can do
that<00:04:11.209> you<00:04:11.390> don't<00:04:11.540> have<00:04:11.660> to<00:04:11.750> go<00:04:11.959> fancy<00:04:12.380> with<00:04:12.739> the

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
that you don't have to go fancy with the

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.120 
that you don't have to go fancy with the
epoxy<00:04:13.670> so<00:04:14.660> that<00:04:14.870> we<00:04:15.019> work<00:04:15.230> from<00:04:15.410> just<00:04:15.709> fine<00:04:15.890> for

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
epoxy so that we work from just fine for

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.349 
epoxy so that we work from just fine for
me<00:04:16.280> and<00:04:16.540> another<00:04:17.540> live<00:04:17.900> update<00:04:18.350> for<00:04:18.590> future
