00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
like consistency we're gonna use this

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.850 
like consistency we're gonna use this
machine<00:03:21.940> here<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:24.270> make<00:03:25.270> make<00:03:25.870> a<00:03:25.900> briquette<00:03:26.320> so

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
machine here to make make a briquette so

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.640 
machine here to make make a briquette so
what<00:03:26.980> we<00:03:27.070> do<00:03:27.190> is<00:03:27.340> we<00:03:27.459> just<00:03:27.959> drop<00:03:28.959> it<00:03:28.989> and<00:03:29.290> we
