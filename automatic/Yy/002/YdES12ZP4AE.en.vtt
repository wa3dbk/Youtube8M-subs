00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
look if anybody didn't see how Pascal

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.280 
look if anybody didn't see how Pascal
works<00:00:02.550> come<00:00:02.730> on<00:00:02.879> over<00:00:03.120> and<00:00:03.210> have<00:00:03.300> a<00:00:03.360> look<00:00:06.290> try

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
works come on over and have a look try

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.740 
works come on over and have a look try
to<00:00:07.319> do<00:00:07.680> it<00:00:07.940> broad<00:00:08.940> daylight<00:00:09.120> so<00:00:09.330> when<00:00:09.690> they

to do it broad daylight so when they

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.549 
to do it broad daylight so when they
come<00:00:09.929> see<00:00:11.570> the<00:00:12.570> idea<00:00:12.870> behind<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.200> spirits

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
come see the idea behind the spirits

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:14.749 
come see the idea behind the spirits
it's<00:00:13.650> not<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.799> marinate<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.340> doesn't<00:00:14.610> need<00:00:14.700> to

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
it's not a marinate it doesn't need to

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.040 
it's not a marinate it doesn't need to
be<00:00:14.849> pushed<00:00:15.030> by<00:00:15.560> co2<00:00:16.580> so<00:00:17.810> basically<00:00:18.810> this<00:00:18.990> is

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
be pushed by co2 so basically this is

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.599 
be pushed by co2 so basically this is
where<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.350> taps<00:00:19.590> going<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:19.920> go<00:00:20.010> at<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.189> top<00:00:20.400> so

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
where the taps going to go at the top so

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.750 
where the taps going to go at the top so
we<00:00:20.640> have<00:00:21.600> loosen<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.080> up<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.230> little<00:00:22.289> bit<00:00:22.760> give

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
we have loosen it up a little bit give

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.730 
we have loosen it up a little bit give
it<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.880> couple<00:00:24.060> packs<00:00:24.359> with<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.660> special<00:00:25.199> weapon

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
it a couple packs with a special weapon

from the kitchen also known as a steel
we're<00:00:30.990> going<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.170> put<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.380> tap<00:00:31.590> in<00:00:31.859> right<00:00:32.040> now

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
we're going to put the tap in right now

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.420 
we're going to put the tap in right now
this<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.700> old-school<00:00:33.000> right<00:00:33.390> here<00:00:34.250> we<00:00:35.250> just

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
this is old-school right here we just

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.060 
this is old-school right here we just
give<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.730> tight<00:00:35.969> little<00:00:36.149> tap<00:00:36.719> once<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.890> beer

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
give it a tight little tap once the beer

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.500 
give it a tight little tap once the beer
starts<00:00:38.370> hitting<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.760> wood<00:00:39.030> it's<00:00:39.270> going<00:00:39.300> to

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
starts hitting that wood it's going to

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.750 
starts hitting that wood it's going to
form<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.780> seal<00:00:40.440> around<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.829> inside<00:00:41.219> we

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
form that seal around the inside we

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.889 
form that seal around the inside we
always<00:00:41.910> want<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.120> make<00:00:42.270> sure<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.690> flow

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
always want to make sure that the flow

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.330 
always want to make sure that the flow
meters<00:00:43.230> pointing<00:00:43.620> inside<00:00:43.950> otherwise

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
meters pointing inside otherwise

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.830 
meters pointing inside otherwise
students<00:00:44.850> turn<00:00:45.059> on<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.360> side<00:00:45.539> it's<00:00:45.660> going<00:00:45.780> to

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
students turn on that side it's going to

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.520 
students turn on that side it's going to
start<00:00:46.020> worn<00:00:46.289> out<00:00:47.149> and<00:00:48.149> then<00:00:48.300> ever<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:49.500> gently

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
start worn out and then ever so gently

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.869 
start worn out and then ever so gently
turning<00:00:50.250> on<00:00:50.460> its<00:00:50.610> side

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:04.179 

put<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.269> couple<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.570> markers<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:58.050> here<00:00:58.289> like<00:00:58.769> so

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.809 

and<00:01:04.609> this<00:01:05.509> is<00:01:05.600> called<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:05.929> South<00:01:06.200> peg<00:01:06.819> hey

00:01:07.809 --> 00:01:07.819 
and this is called the South peg hey

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:09.399 
and this is called the South peg hey
come<00:01:08.090> and<00:01:08.119> have<00:01:08.359> a<00:01:08.390> look<00:01:08.539> afterwards<00:01:08.960> it<00:01:09.259> has

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
come and have a look afterwards it has

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.260 
come and have a look afterwards it has
it's<00:01:09.770> a<00:01:09.890> porous<00:01:10.310> piece<00:01:10.549> of<00:01:10.700> wood<00:01:10.880> and<00:01:11.060> then

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
it's a porous piece of wood and then

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.880 
it's a porous piece of wood and then
basically<00:01:11.840> allows<00:01:12.170> the<00:01:12.350> beer<00:01:12.530> to<00:01:12.710> keep

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
basically allows the beer to keep

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.309 
basically allows the beer to keep
breathing<00:01:13.369> we<00:01:13.909> let<00:01:14.090> it<00:01:14.210> breathe<00:01:14.390> for<00:01:14.659> about<00:01:14.840> 24

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:15.319 
breathing we let it breathe for about 24

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:17.529 
breathing we let it breathe for about 24
hours<00:01:15.740> before<00:01:16.310> we<00:01:16.579> put<00:01:16.759> the<00:01:16.850> hunter<00:01:17.090> peg<00:01:17.299> in

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
hours before we put the hunter peg in

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:20.529 
hours before we put the hunter peg in
this<00:01:18.109> will<00:01:18.520> keep<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.670> air<00:01:19.880> keep<00:01:20.240> it<00:01:20.359> air<00:01:20.509> tight

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
this will keep the air keep it air tight

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:22.870 
this will keep the air keep it air tight
until<00:01:21.200> you're<00:01:21.350> ready<00:01:21.469> to<00:01:21.560> pour<00:01:21.829> once<00:01:22.520> we<00:01:22.640> start

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
until you're ready to pour once we start

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.429 
until you're ready to pour once we start
form<00:01:23.149> we<00:01:23.299> have<00:01:23.420> about<00:01:23.599> three<00:01:23.869> to<00:01:23.959> five<00:01:24.140> days

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
form we have about three to five days

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.010 
form we have about three to five days
then<00:01:25.099> to<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.369> keg<00:01:25.579> with<00:01:26.359> your<00:01:26.539> support<00:01:26.899> we

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
then to the keg with your support we

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.029 
then to the keg with your support we
usually<00:01:27.289> get<00:01:27.409> it<00:01:27.500> done<00:01:27.619> within<00:01:27.859> the<00:01:27.920> hour

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
usually get it done within the hour

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.289 
usually get it done within the hour
so<00:01:31.039> right<00:01:31.310> now<00:01:31.459> we're<00:01:31.670> I'm<00:01:31.909> just<00:01:32.090> going<00:01:32.240> to

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
so right now we're I'm just going to

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.120 
so right now we're I'm just going to
give<00:01:32.810> you<00:01:32.899> guys<00:01:33.020> an<00:01:33.170> example<00:01:33.200> I'm<00:01:33.920> high

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
give you guys an example I'm high

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.469 
give you guys an example I'm high
speeding<00:01:34.670> this<00:01:34.819> but<00:01:35.030> I<00:01:35.090> thought<00:01:35.240> it'd<00:01:35.390> be

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
speeding this but I thought it'd be

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.839 
speeding this but I thought it'd be
interesting<00:01:35.599> to<00:01:35.929> try<00:01:36.280> to<00:01:37.280> pour<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.640> beer

00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:37.849 
interesting to try to pour the beer

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:40.149 
interesting to try to pour the beer
right<00:01:38.119> kind<00:01:38.810> of<00:01:38.899> the<00:01:38.989> tap<00:01:39.229> rather<00:01:39.799> than<00:01:39.979> use

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
right kind of the tap rather than use

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:41.469 
right kind of the tap rather than use
the<00:01:40.189> beer<00:01:40.520> engine<00:01:40.849> what<00:01:41.000> you<00:01:41.119> guys<00:01:41.239> have

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
the beer engine what you guys have

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:42.910 
the beer engine what you guys have
probably<00:01:41.659> seen<00:01:41.810> it's<00:01:42.140> just<00:01:42.289> a<00:01:42.379> hand<00:01:42.619> drawn

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
probably seen it's just a hand drawn

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.300 
probably seen it's just a hand drawn
pump<00:01:43.250> which<00:01:43.879> basically<00:01:44.500> creates<00:01:45.500> to<00:01:45.979> create

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
pump which basically creates to create

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.919 
pump which basically creates to create
the<00:01:46.429> effect<00:01:46.789> on<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.119> head<00:01:47.299> so<00:01:47.569> it's<00:01:47.719> going<00:01:47.840> to

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
the effect on the head so it's going to

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:49.749 
the effect on the head so it's going to
be<00:01:48.049> a<00:01:48.259> little<00:01:48.469> flatter<00:01:48.799> there<00:01:49.489> could<00:01:49.640> actually

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
be a little flatter there could actually

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.399 
be a little flatter there could actually
be<00:01:50.000> some<00:01:50.209> hops<00:01:50.390> I<00:01:50.569> guess<00:01:50.719> if<00:01:50.869> I'm<00:01:50.989> out<00:01:51.110> there's

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
be some hops I guess if I'm out there's

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.260 
be some hops I guess if I'm out there's
no<00:01:51.500> filter<00:01:51.890> on<00:01:51.950> it<00:01:52.099> but<00:01:52.579> you<00:01:52.759> know<00:01:52.789> what

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
no filter on it but you know what
