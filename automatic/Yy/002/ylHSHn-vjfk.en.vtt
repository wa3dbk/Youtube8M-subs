00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.859 
got this printer this evening and I was
confused<00:00:16.289> about<00:00:16.350> how<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.680> get<00:00:17.010> this<00:00:17.160> printer

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
confused about how to get this printer

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.210 
confused about how to get this printer
installed<00:00:18.869> wirelessly<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:19.830> all<00:00:20.010> my

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
installed wirelessly so that all my

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.370 
installed wirelessly so that all my
computers<00:00:20.789> everybody<00:00:21.449> in<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.750> family<00:00:22.199> can

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
computers everybody in the family can

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.640 
computers everybody in the family can
print<00:00:23.189> using<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.730> wireless<00:00:23.939> printer<00:00:24.510> now<00:00:25.350> I

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
print using the wireless printer now I

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.009 
print using the wireless printer now I
thought<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.430> installing<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.090> on<00:00:27.300> one<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.840> the

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
thought that installing it on one of the

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.439 
thought that installing it on one of the
devices<00:00:28.349> wirelessly<00:00:29.160> would<00:00:29.849> mean<00:00:30.179> that

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
devices wirelessly would mean that

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.900 
devices wirelessly would mean that
anybody<00:00:30.840> else<00:00:31.199> would<00:00:31.500> then<00:00:31.740> be<00:00:31.890> able<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.189> use

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
anybody else would then be able to use

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.840 
anybody else would then be able to use
the<00:00:33.090> printer<00:00:33.480> for<00:00:33.809> scan<00:00:34.140> fax<00:00:34.530> or<00:00:34.829> even<00:00:35.640> print

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
the printer for scan fax or even print

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.569 
the printer for scan fax or even print
well<00:00:36.540> but<00:00:36.719> that's<00:00:36.899> not<00:00:37.110> true<00:00:37.320> what<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.430> need

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
well but that's not true what you need

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.729 
well but that's not true what you need
to<00:00:38.700> do<00:00:38.850> first<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.480> when<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:39.960> get<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.260> printer

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
to do first is when you get the printer

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.530 
to do first is when you get the printer
you<00:00:41.010> need<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.640> know<00:00:41.760> after<00:00:42.000> you've<00:00:42.149> one-box

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
you need you know after you've one-box

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.150 
you need you know after you've one-box
the<00:00:42.690> print<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.110> connected<00:00:43.559> all<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.710> cables

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
the print and connected all the cables

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.970 
the print and connected all the cables
and<00:00:44.250> cartridges<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:45.629> would<00:00:45.780> need<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.079> you

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
and cartridges you would need to you

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.650 
and cartridges you would need to you
would<00:00:47.129> need<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.430> connect<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.850> printer<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.390> one

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
would need to connect the printer to one

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.500 
would need to connect the printer to one
of<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.930> computers<00:00:49.469> or<00:00:49.649> your<00:00:49.800> Mac<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.510> install

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
of the computers or your Mac and install

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.990 
of the computers or your Mac and install
it<00:00:51.660> using<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.260> wire<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.949> printer<00:00:53.309> wire<00:00:53.550> the

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
it using the wire the printer wire the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.959 
it using the wire the printer wire the
USB<00:00:54.360> cable<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.930> connects<00:00:55.199> your<00:00:55.440> computer<00:00:56.430> to

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
cabled connections so the first

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.810 
cabled connections so the first
installation<00:01:04.830> has<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.339> be<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> cable

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
installation has to be a cable

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.000 
installation has to be a cable
connection<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.420> with<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.320> help<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.799> CD

connection and with the help of the CD

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.469 
connection and with the help of the CD
that<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.250> get<00:01:08.520> with<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.880> printer<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.360> would

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
that you get with the printer you would

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.700 
that you get with the printer you would
need<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.780> install<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.260> one<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.530> the

need to install it on one of the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.490 
need to install it on one of the
machines<00:01:11.070> now<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.299> machine<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.140> second

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
button there's a search button you just

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:07.730 
button there's a search button you just
type<00:02:01.250> 4500<00:02:02.250> wireless<00:02:04.070> and<00:02:06.140> then<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.530> search

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
type 4500 wireless and then the search

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.229 
type 4500 wireless and then the search
