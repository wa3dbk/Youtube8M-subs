putting a car into their vehicle truck

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.380 
putting a car into their vehicle truck
into<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.750> learn<00:00:51.989> mode<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.680> do<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.460> relearn

procedure<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.920> course<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.370> can<00:00:56.610> do<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.270> on

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
procedure and of course you can do it on

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.619 
procedure and of course you can do it on
the<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:58.020> think<00:00:58.559> 2009<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.550> newer<00:00:59.699> with<00:01:00.000> change

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
the I think 2009 and newer with change

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.209 
the I think 2009 and newer with change
in<00:01:00.780> air<00:01:00.899> pressure<00:01:00.930> instead<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.800> using<00:01:01.949> one<00:01:02.160> of

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
in air pressure instead of using one of

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.420 
in air pressure instead of using one of
these<00:01:02.309> little<00:01:02.460> tools<00:01:02.760> but<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.750> thing's<00:01:04.019> nice

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
these little tools but this thing's nice

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.270 
these little tools but this thing's nice
the<00:01:05.510> manual<00:01:06.510> says<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.900> drive<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.439> vehicle<00:01:07.799> for

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
the manual says to drive the vehicle for

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.130 
the manual says to drive the vehicle for
20<00:01:08.820> miles<00:01:09.000> an<00:01:09.240> hour<00:01:09.330> for<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.689> couple<00:01:09.990> minutes

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
20 miles an hour for a couple minutes

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.649 
20 miles an hour for a couple minutes
first<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.890> find<00:01:11.580> that's<00:01:11.820> not<00:01:12.000> necessary<00:01:12.510> with

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
first I find that's not necessary with

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.969 
first I find that's not necessary with
this<00:01:12.810> thing<00:01:13.049> maybe<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.560> with<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.830> air

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
this thing maybe it is with the air

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.600 
this thing maybe it is with the air
change<00:01:14.960> pressure<00:01:15.960> change<00:01:16.799> method<00:01:17.310> but<00:01:17.490> it

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
change pressure change method but it

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.560 
change pressure change method but it
isn't<00:01:17.880> with<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:19.159> so<00:01:20.159> let's<00:01:20.850> put<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.210> truck

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
isn't with this so let's put the truck

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.320 
isn't with this so let's put the truck
in<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.780> learn<00:01:21.930> mode<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.409> will<00:01:22.560> zap<00:01:23.430> each<00:01:23.670> tire

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
in a learn mode and will zap each tire

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.899 
in a learn mode and will zap each tire
sensor<00:01:25.259> with<00:01:25.439> this<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.890> we'll<00:01:26.189> get<00:01:26.460> chirps<00:01:26.729> of

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
sensor with this and we'll get chirps of

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.810 
sensor with this and we'll get chirps of
the<00:01:26.970> horn<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.990> will<00:01:28.110> log<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.009> new<00:01:29.340> sensors

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
the horn and it will log the new sensors

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.580 
the horn and it will log the new sensors
into<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.780> TPMS<00:01:31.470> computer<00:01:33.049> first<00:01:34.049> got<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.439> put

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
into the TPMS computer first got to put

so we do it in that order I just push a

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:30.800 
so we do it in that order I just push a
little<00:02:29.579> button<00:02:29.939> you<00:02:30.180> can<00:02:30.329> see<00:02:30.480> little<00:02:30.689> red

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
little button you can see little red

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.440 
little button you can see little red
light<00:02:31.139> when<00:02:32.099> the<00:02:32.219> tool<00:02:32.459> is<00:02:32.639> transmitting<00:02:33.269> and

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
light when the tool is transmitting and

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.539 
light when the tool is transmitting and
we<00:02:33.510> got<00:02:33.689> a<00:02:33.719> hunk<00:02:33.959> of<00:02:34.049> the<00:02:34.139> horn<00:02:34.379> this<00:02:35.310> thing

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
we got a hunk of the horn this thing

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.069 
we got a hunk of the horn this thing
triggered<00:02:35.939> the<00:02:36.030> center<00:02:36.389> to<00:02:36.510> send<00:02:36.750> out<00:02:36.900> its

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
triggered the center to send out its

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.940 
triggered the center to send out its
data<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:38.120> Anna<00:02:39.120> TPMS<00:02:39.719> computer<00:02:40.260> received<00:02:40.739> it

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
data and Anna TPMS computer received it

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.910 
data and Anna TPMS computer received it
and<00:02:41.069> logged<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.459> into<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.760> memory<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.709> this<00:02:43.709> is

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
and logged it into a memory and this is

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.830 
and logged it into a memory and this is
the<00:02:44.040> right<00:02:44.219> front<00:02:44.579> just<00:02:45.209> put<00:02:45.480> this<00:02:45.599> on<00:02:45.780> a

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
the right front just put this on a

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.530 
the right front just put this on a
rubber<00:02:46.409> sidewall<00:02:47.099> of<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.310> tire<00:02:47.639> near<00:02:48.389> the

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
rubber sidewall of the tire near the

00:02:48.540 --> 00:03:04.920 
rubber sidewall of the tire near the
sensor<00:02:50.450> that's<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.629> right<00:02:51.810> front<00:02:55.010> right<00:02:56.010> rear

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:12.910 

with<00:03:05.930> a<00:03:05.960> left<00:03:06.230> rear<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:11.450> that<00:03:12.350> should<00:03:12.680> do<00:03:12.890> it

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
with a left rear and that should do it

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.700 
with a left rear and that should do it
we'll<00:03:13.310> take<00:03:13.700> a<00:03:13.730> look<00:03:13.970> inside<00:03:14.480> here<00:03:14.900> and<00:03:17.710> it

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
we'll take a look inside here and it

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.420 
we'll take a look inside here and it
says<00:03:19.070> training<00:03:20.030> complete<00:03:20.680> ok<00:03:21.680> I'll<00:03:21.980> push<00:03:22.250> the

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
says training complete ok I'll push the

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.950 
says training complete ok I'll push the
OK<00:03:22.700> button<00:03:22.940> I<00:03:23.030> don't<00:03:23.210> think<00:03:23.330> you<00:03:23.420> need<00:03:23.600> to<00:03:23.630> when

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:23.960 
OK button I don't think you need to when

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.540 
OK button I don't think you need to when
I<00:03:24.050> turn<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.440> ignition<00:03:24.500> off<00:03:24.920> we<00:03:25.160> should<00:03:25.190> get<00:03:25.490> a

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
I turn the ignition off we should get a

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.700 
I turn the ignition off we should get a
couple<00:03:25.760> beeps<00:03:26.180> if<00:03:26.390> it<00:03:26.540> didn't<00:03:26.900> work<00:03:27.110> if<00:03:27.410> it<00:03:27.530> did

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
couple beeps if it didn't work if it did

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.070 
couple beeps if it didn't work if it did
work<00:03:27.920> then<00:03:28.250> we're<00:03:28.880> done<00:03:29.090> and<00:03:29.660> we<00:03:29.840> shouldn't

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
work then we're done and we shouldn't

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.780 
work then we're done and we shouldn't
get<00:03:30.170> any<00:03:30.230> beeps<00:03:32.050> no<00:03:33.050> beeps<00:03:33.320> those<00:03:34.100> sensors<00:03:34.610> are

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
get any beeps no beeps those sensors are

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.360 
get any beeps no beeps those sensors are
logged<00:03:35.150> into<00:03:35.360> the<00:03:35.590> tire<00:03:36.590> pressure<00:03:36.860> monitor

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
logged into the tire pressure monitor

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.510 
logged into the tire pressure monitor
system<00:03:37.790> and<00:03:37.970> it's<00:03:38.720> as<00:03:38.870> simple<00:03:38.900> as<00:03:39.290> that<00:03:39.520> again

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
system and it's as simple as that again

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.010 
system and it's as simple as that again
you<00:03:40.700> can<00:03:40.820> do<00:03:40.940> it<00:03:41.060> by<00:03:41.180> changing<00:03:41.390> air<00:03:41.720> pressure

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
you can do it by changing air pressure

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.020 
you can do it by changing air pressure
and<00:03:42.290> then<00:03:42.440> tires<00:03:42.950> as<00:03:43.190> well<00:03:43.370> and<00:03:43.580> you<00:03:43.640> just<00:03:43.850> have

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
and then tires as well and you just have

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.920 
and then tires as well and you just have
to<00:03:44.060> have<00:03:44.390> a<00:03:44.420> air<00:03:44.900> source<00:03:45.200> compressor<00:03:46.810> you<00:03:47.810> know

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
to have a air source compressor you know

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.900 
to have a air source compressor you know
what<00:03:48.200> not<00:03:48.350> to<00:03:48.410> bring<00:03:49.070> your<00:03:49.250> tires<00:03:49.460> back<00:03:49.730> up

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
what not to bring your tires back up

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.570 
what not to bring your tires back up
normal<00:03:50.330> pressure<00:03:50.890> that's<00:03:51.890> how<00:03:52.250> to<00:03:52.310> do<00:03:52.550> it

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
normal pressure that's how to do it

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.330
