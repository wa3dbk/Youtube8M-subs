00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.960
 that a black and then good has a 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.689
 video more guys and good has been 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.820
 updated the sip and master and good with 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:26.250
 we already have the textures did not fit 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:28.860
 this were available for 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.090
 investments of 0.12 because they have already 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.279
 updated the sip and master the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.140
 updated today and good as 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.140
 they will know then with the previous edition we 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.830
 We were going in port of we were going to in this 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.030
 case let's texture and how I have 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.460
 this d 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.660
 the fiver pan seems to me that we can to 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:52.360
 give it by texture we give it restaura foul 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.490
 we do not give you to see here 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.650
 liszt texture will appear to you 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.300
 directly on it and if you do not have it 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.770
 installed 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.300
 there is a texture because then when 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.160
 you start automatically it sends you if 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.870
 do you want to upload some texture or if 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.490
 you want to download the one from there to be 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.300
 gaining life and read in upl and 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.960
 they would automatically be installed in start 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.690
 and as you see, the world begins to charge 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.180
 and they have to open the minecraft 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:22.910
 tantito hope that easy and ready 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.190
 and now what I do not know is if this 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.280
 texture is created by the developer 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.780
 of the application because if we do not leave 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.310
 to be getting into trouble later with 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.960
 this from the developers and the 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.390
 creators of content and that other the 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.570
 go up and have no credits and so on and 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.430
 all that but good that would already be in another 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.560
 theme guys what matters now is 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.620
 that the application is already working 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.250
 it works very well 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.250
 there is 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.060
 I'm not going much with the one that ends 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.380
 erase it a lot of cache memory to my 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.700
 device on top very fluid and good the 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.590
 truth is that you are doing very well 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.049
 the blog is not a very good alternative 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.080
 launcher in my opinion is better than 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.650
 blog launcher for this auto method 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.590
 auto installation 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.350
 apart from how good I've had 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.270
 problems with this and he has made me 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.070
 very stable, it does not close or anything 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.380
 that thing that with the bloc stain sometimes 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.850
 I still had to check the mods if 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.970
 are missing check the mods are missing 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.460
 activate that option so we can see how 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.900
 how it goes and in this case then with the 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.340
 textures we've already seen what's going well so 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.560
 nothing else is missing from the community that 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.060
 begin to upload the textures to this 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.700
 place to put it 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.900
 download them not even though repeating it I think 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.500
 that anyone is supposed to 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.630
 can upload it 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.970
 what we would have to do now 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.270
 would be to have more contact with the 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.370
 developer to put a little bit of 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.930
 order in that in that aspect so that 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.600
 anyone can upload textures but 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.220
 be guaranteed that you are a carrier of 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.660
 textures because I really do not know how 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.980
 work their textures but being me 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.080
 I know I think any judge judge 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.090
 what and they added these enchantments 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.680
 we can also give you guys 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.530
 enchantments to something and we give it to him intentionally 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.050
 and not creative I do not know if I will 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.120
 watch 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.920
 we go here from 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.800
 well do not add it I'm going to move on 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.080
 survival mode 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.470
 and now if I'm going to this mother 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:22.170
 I chingada life with mother 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.450
 represents no no fart no fart no 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.600
 there is fart has not lost anything or that neither 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.820
 even inventory we have lost 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.220
 let's see we give it here and we're going to access and 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:34.850
 there it is we have an enchanted sword is 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.770
 in this case you have to have sharpened one 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.690
 and well you can also add 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.040
 some other things enchantment by 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.560
 example are you injure the sword you want 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.820
 armor you want a little book you do not need 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.100
 it depends, I think nothing else is about 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.470
 Diamond 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.520
 nothing more until diamond I do not see 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.550
 other iron things like that 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.970
 the spells are the muse of the same as 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.020
 you put it without any problem it 's like this 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.580
 what good guys but you liked it 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.570
 in the description will be the application 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.280
 to download it now 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.720
 I had previously uploaded a version 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.220
 so I just filled everything and also 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.530
 if 10 and 10 are watching it because 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.080
 the last time I saw the video today this beam 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.790
 compatible with Annex 7 because in 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.100
 my case in minute 7 2013 second 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.120
 generation is not compatible 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.320
 application I have to go through 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.970
 from my gp motorcycle so that I can 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.049
 use in my nexuses and I do not understand 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.340
 because it is not compatible when they are 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.600
 watching right now I 'm perfectly 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.740
 minh excuses I do not have any problem 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.660
 ministers but he tells me it's not 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.710
 compatible with my niche are weird things 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.690
 of life not of the applications 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.629
 incompatibilities but then in this 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.639
 case 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:37.770
 and in this case 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.349
 I'm doing very well, it's enough for me without the one 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.270
 problems in nothing and the beauty of this is 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:43.710
 what will super fluid and texture 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.729
 that have gone up and you have uploaded them if 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.110
 it's not that it was the same developer 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.940
 it was beautiful 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.190
 what good guys for that taste everything is 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.330
 in the description there I will tell you what 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.680
 make it a little more compatible with 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.940
 devices put description the 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.380
 devices that are not compatible and 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.600
 well developed what I hope that what 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.980
 do and ask why the 7 minute 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.600
 it is not compatible that I already add a 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.710
 compatibility in what would be the beach 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.300
 store because that is happening to me 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.720
 very annoying applications today is very 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.980
 rare 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.410
 I repeat again when the application is 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.730
 He commands very, very well there. 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.740
 check but good if also 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.540
 I was getting to toy if there were 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.530
 Well, there I will warn you so that those who do not 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.080
 they have had it until now they can 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.970
 download without any problem and then 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.320
 nothing, guys, I always say goodbye 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.660
 we see in a next video you know that 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.290
 this is like a guy knock down items 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.810
 You can also add things 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.400
 teleport day night and so on 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.750
 et cetera etcetera and it is very but very 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.400
 easy to use not so nobody 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.020
 dismissal see you in a following video 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.500
 money until next time 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.500
 bye
