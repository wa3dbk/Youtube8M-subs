in<00:00:06.380> this<00:00:06.799> course<00:00:07.069> introduction<00:00:08.020> will<00:00:09.020> cover

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:09.290 
in this course introduction will cover

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.859 
in this course introduction will cover
the<00:00:09.910> terminology<00:00:10.910> around<00:00:11.090> clinical<00:00:11.750> and

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:11.869 
the terminology around clinical and

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:15.490 
the terminology around clinical and
translational<00:00:12.230> research<00:00:14.110> define<00:00:15.110> what<00:00:15.379> it

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
translational research define what it

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.370 
translational research define what it
means<00:00:15.740> how<00:00:16.309> it<00:00:16.340> impacts<00:00:17.000> society<00:00:17.570> and<00:00:17.779> then

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
means how it impacts society and then

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.870 
means how it impacts society and then
move<00:00:18.589> into<00:00:18.769> the<00:00:18.949> data<00:00:19.250> management<00:00:19.910> domain

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
move into the data management domain

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.220 
move into the data management domain
clinical<00:00:22.880> and<00:00:22.970> translational<00:00:23.269> research<00:00:23.630> can

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
clinical and translational research can

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.070 
clinical and translational research can
really<00:00:24.470> be<00:00:24.589> thought<00:00:24.890> of<00:00:24.919> many<00:00:25.880> ways<00:00:26.179> but<00:00:26.990> the

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
really be thought of many ways but the

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.390 
really be thought of many ways but the
way<00:00:27.199> I<00:00:27.230> think<00:00:27.349> about<00:00:27.650> clinical<00:00:28.070> and

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
way I think about clinical and

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.609 
way I think about clinical and
translational<00:00:28.699> research<00:00:29.089> it's<00:00:30.050> really<00:00:30.349> sort

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
translational research it's really sort

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.440 
translational research it's really sort
of<00:00:30.679> moving<00:00:31.180> discoveries<00:00:32.180> from<00:00:32.360> the

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
of moving discoveries from the

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.110 
of moving discoveries from the
laboratory<00:00:32.750> into<00:00:33.520> patient<00:00:34.520> oriented<00:00:34.760> or

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
laboratory into patient oriented or

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.720 
laboratory into patient oriented or
human<00:00:35.480> oriented<00:00:36.020> research<00:00:36.440> and<00:00:36.800> then<00:00:37.460> once

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
human oriented research and then once

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.060 
human oriented research and then once
findings<00:00:38.300> are<00:00:38.480> made<00:00:38.510> moving<00:00:39.260> that<00:00:39.379> out<00:00:39.410> into

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
findings are made moving that out into

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.540 
findings are made moving that out into
patient<00:00:40.699> delivery<00:00:41.090> and<00:00:41.300> community<00:00:41.840> uptake

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
patient delivery and community uptake

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.580 
patient delivery and community uptake
it's<00:00:43.550> important<00:00:44.090> though<00:00:44.239> it's<00:00:44.570> a<00:00:44.660> note<00:00:44.899> that

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
it's important though it's a note that

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.099 
it's important though it's a note that
this<00:00:45.739> is<00:00:45.920> not<00:00:45.949> a<00:00:46.100> unidirectional<00:00:46.629> process<00:00:47.629> in

00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:48.109 
this is not a unidirectional process in

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:51.040 
this is not a unidirectional process in
each<00:00:48.320> stage<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:49.579> findings<00:00:50.180> and<00:00:50.449> discoveries

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
each stage the findings and discoveries

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.580 
each stage the findings and discoveries
of<00:00:51.289> actually<00:00:51.890> implementing<00:00:53.050> can<00:00:54.050> move<00:00:54.260> back

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
of actually implementing can move back

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.009 
of actually implementing can move back
to<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:55.190> prior<00:00:55.429> stage<00:00:55.820> so<00:00:56.179> so<00:00:56.420> a<00:00:56.449> lot<00:00:56.660> of<00:00:56.690> times

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
to the prior stage so so a lot of times

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:58.930 
to the prior stage so so a lot of times
when<00:00:57.289> we<00:00:57.469> move<00:00:57.649> into<00:00:57.980> human<00:00:58.460> oriented

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
when we move into human oriented

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.540 
when we move into human oriented
research<00:00:59.359> or<00:00:59.570> patient-centered<00:01:00.350> research

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
research or patient-centered research

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.520 
research or patient-centered research
we'll<00:01:01.550> come<00:01:01.730> up<00:01:01.760> with<00:01:01.910> other<00:01:02.179> ideas<00:01:02.510> that<00:01:03.320> make

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
we'll come up with other ideas that make

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.550 
we'll come up with other ideas that make
it<00:01:03.679> back<00:01:03.890> into<00:01:04.160> the<00:01:04.339> laboratory<00:01:04.970> or<00:01:05.390> by<00:01:06.020> by<00:01:06.500> the

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
it back into the laboratory or by by the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.440 
it back into the laboratory or by by the
same<00:01:06.860> token<00:01:07.070> once<00:01:07.490> we<00:01:07.670> move<00:01:07.850> it<00:01:08.000> out<00:01:08.120> into

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
same token once we move it out into

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.440 
same token once we move it out into
patient<00:01:08.840> delivery<00:01:09.260> and<00:01:09.410> community<00:01:09.860> uptake

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
patient delivery and community uptake

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.810 
patient delivery and community uptake
realms<00:01:11.450> will<00:01:12.410> come<00:01:12.590> up<00:01:12.740> with<00:01:12.860> with<00:01:13.250> findings

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
realms will come up with with findings

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.940 
realms will come up with with findings
discoveries<00:01:14.510> or<00:01:14.660> new<00:01:14.690> ideas<00:01:14.990> that<00:01:15.320> move

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
discoveries or new ideas that move

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.950 
discoveries or new ideas that move
backwards<00:01:16.460> into<00:01:16.760> the<00:01:17.030> patient<00:01:17.450> oriented<00:01:17.690> or

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
backwards into the patient oriented or

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.380 
backwards into the patient oriented or
patient-centered<00:01:18.680> research<00:01:18.710> domain<00:01:19.610> so<00:01:20.330> it

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
patient-centered research domain so it

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.770 
patient-centered research domain so it
really<00:01:20.570> is<00:01:20.780> this<00:01:20.960> bi-directional<00:01:21.800> process

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
really is this bi-directional process

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.480 
really is this bi-directional process
we're<00:01:23.780> going<00:01:23.810> to<00:01:23.960> focus<00:01:24.170> in<00:01:24.500> this<00:01:24.770> course<00:01:24.830> on

we're going to focus in this course on

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.640 
we're going to focus in this course on

there are many people working together
to<00:04:16.489> make<00:04:16.640> this<00:04:16.880> happen

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
to make this happen

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.570 
to make this happen
we're<00:04:18.020> going<00:04:18.140> to<00:04:18.200> focus<00:04:18.590> in<00:04:18.799> this<00:04:18.980> course<00:04:19.040> on

going to be useful at the end of a study

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.490 
going to be useful at the end of a study
to<00:04:30.669> make<00:04:30.849> definitive<00:04:31.240> decisions<00:04:32.050> and<00:04:32.259> be<00:04:32.379> able

practical knowledge we're going to focus
on<00:04:45.009> practical<00:04:45.610> examples<00:04:46.180> and<00:04:46.539> we're<00:04:46.870> going<00:04:46.990> to

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
on practical examples and we're going to

Stephanie<00:04:50.889> and<00:04:51.039> I<00:04:51.099> we<00:04:51.340> all<00:04:51.789> work<00:04:52.000> in<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:52.300> real

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
Stephanie and I we all work in the real

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.480 
Stephanie and I we all work in the real
world<00:04:52.509> we<00:04:53.259> wake<00:04:53.469> up<00:04:53.500> every<00:04:53.949> morning<00:04:54.310> and<00:04:54.430> we

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
world we wake up every morning and we

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.520 
world we wake up every morning and we
think<00:04:54.789> about<00:04:55.030> this<00:04:55.210> stuff<00:04:55.539> we<00:04:55.750> really<00:04:56.289> work

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
think about this stuff we really work

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.800 
think about this stuff we really work
around<00:04:57.159> a<00:04:57.340> lot<00:04:57.610> of<00:04:57.789> different<00:04:58.180> study<00:04:58.479> teams

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
around a lot of different study teams

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.050 
around a lot of different study teams
and<00:04:59.139> domains<00:04:59.560> and<00:04:59.860> so<00:05:00.490> hopefully<00:05:00.849> we're<00:05:00.969> going

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
and domains and so hopefully we're going

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.779 
and domains and so hopefully we're going
to<00:05:01.120> bring<00:05:01.419> that<00:05:02.009> in<00:05:03.009> the<00:05:03.069> form<00:05:03.430> that

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:03.789 
to bring that in the form that

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:05.369 
to bring that in the form that
experienced<00:05:04.330> in<00:05:04.449> the<00:05:04.539> form<00:05:04.780> of<00:05:04.870> practical

instruction<00:05:05.979> to<00:05:06.250> this<00:05:06.460> course<00:05:06.849> but<00:05:07.629> we<00:05:07.780> all

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
instruction to this course but we all

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.110 
instruction to this course but we all
know<00:05:08.110> that<00:05:08.560> learning<00:05:08.949> works<00:05:09.340> best<00:05:09.669> when<00:05:09.940> it's

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
know that learning works best when it's

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.149 
know that learning works best when it's
bi-directional<00:05:10.530> we're<00:05:11.530> excited<00:05:11.889> to<00:05:12.039> bring

platform<00:05:15.330> we're<00:05:16.330> excited<00:05:16.690> because<00:05:16.900> we<00:05:17.199> think

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
platform we're excited because we think

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.800 
platform we're excited because we think
it's<00:05:17.590> a<00:05:17.680> great<00:05:18.009> way<00:05:18.340> to<00:05:18.389> share<00:05:19.389> what<00:05:19.599> we've

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
it's a great way to share what we've

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.869 
it's a great way to share what we've
learned<00:05:19.840> through<00:05:20.590> many<00:05:20.830> many<00:05:21.009> years<00:05:21.370> of<00:05:21.550> study

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:21.879 
learned through many many years of study

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:24.209 
learned through many many years of study
in<00:05:22.090> many<00:05:22.539> many<00:05:22.750> years<00:05:23.080> of<00:05:23.219> practical

00:05:24.209 --> 00:05:24.219 
in many many years of practical

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:26.610 
in many many years of practical
implementation<00:05:25.060> out<00:05:25.599> there<00:05:25.900> to<00:05:26.080> others<00:05:26.379> doing

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
implementation out there to others doing

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.129 
implementation out there to others doing
this<00:05:26.919> same<00:05:27.159> type<00:05:27.430> of<00:05:27.460> work<00:05:27.849> but<00:05:28.599> again<00:05:28.689> in<00:05:28.960> that

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 
this same type of work but again in that

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:31.439 
this same type of work but again in that
bi-directional<00:05:29.919> sense<00:05:30.219> every<00:05:30.879> time<00:05:31.060> we<00:05:31.240> teach

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449 
bi-directional sense every time we teach

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:33.809 
bi-directional sense every time we teach
every<00:05:31.870> time<00:05:32.050> we<00:05:32.259> talk<00:05:33.069> one-on-one<00:05:33.400> with

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:33.819 
every time we talk one-on-one with

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:37.230 
every time we talk one-on-one with
individuals<00:05:34.569> it's<00:05:35.110> a<00:05:35.259> great<00:05:35.680> time<00:05:36.129> for<00:05:36.240> for

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
individuals it's a great time for for

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.089 
individuals it's a great time for for
bi-directional<00:05:37.479> learning<00:05:38.440> and<00:05:38.620> so<00:05:38.770> we<00:05:38.919> look

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:39.099 
bi-directional learning and so we look

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:41.309 
bi-directional learning and so we look
forward<00:05:39.460> to<00:05:39.580> the<00:05:40.150> exchanges<00:05:40.810> that<00:05:40.870> we<00:05:41.139> have

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:41.319 
forward to the exchanges that we have

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:43.649 
forward to the exchanges that we have
with<00:05:41.529> with<00:05:41.800> you<00:05:42.039> as<00:05:42.250> participants<00:05:43.240> in<00:05:43.449> this
