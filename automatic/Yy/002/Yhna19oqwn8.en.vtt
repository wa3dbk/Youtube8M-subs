we<00:00:35.370> start<00:00:35.610> off<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:35.850> episode<00:00:36.030> going<00:00:36.540> straight

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
we start off this episode going straight

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.740 
we start off this episode going straight
into<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:36.989> game<00:00:37.320> with<00:00:37.590> Middlesbrough<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.750> we

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
into a game with Middlesbrough and we

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.389 
into a game with Middlesbrough and we
give<00:00:39.899> away<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> bit<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.680> silly<00:00:40.829> penalty<00:00:41.190> at<00:00:41.370> a

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
give away a bit of a silly penalty at a

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.330 
give away a bit of a silly penalty at a
beginning<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:42.420> think<00:00:43.200> for<00:00:43.440> once<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:44.040> one

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
beginning I think for once it this one

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.430 
beginning I think for once it this one
might<00:00:44.520> actually<00:00:44.670> been<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.030> penalty<00:00:45.390> but<00:00:46.079> and

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
might actually been a penalty but and

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.350 
might actually been a penalty but and
this<00:00:46.680> sets<00:00:46.860> us<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.039> take<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.219> penalty<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.850> I

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
this sets us to take the penalty and I

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.660 
this sets us to take the penalty and I
was<00:00:48.660> pretty<00:00:49.170> much<00:00:49.260> sure<00:00:50.039> he<00:00:50.190> was<00:00:50.280> gonna<00:00:50.370> score

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
was pretty much sure he was gonna score

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.610 
was pretty much sure he was gonna score
but<00:00:51.030> he<00:00:51.059> hit<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.449> crossbar<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.440> think

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
but he hit the crossbar and I think

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.959 
but he hit the crossbar and I think
we've<00:00:52.710> caught<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.980> excitement<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.730> even

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
we've caught that excitement I even

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.160 
we've caught that excitement I even
disconnect<00:00:54.210> him<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.510> pulled<00:00:55.079> out<00:00:55.110> my

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
disconnect him I pulled out my

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.170 
disconnect him I pulled out my

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
controller in celebration or I think the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.150

didn't want someone's morale being low
in<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:19.020> team<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.470> uh<00:01:19.729> Taylor<00:01:20.729> has<00:01:20.850> proven<00:01:21.090> to

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
in the team and uh Taylor has proven to

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.580 
in the team and uh Taylor has proven to
me<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.420> he's<00:01:21.750> actually<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.259> very<00:01:22.470> good

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
me that he's actually a very good

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.320 
me that he's actually a very good
goalkeeper<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.670> don't<00:01:23.729> know<00:01:23.909> why<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.090> didn't

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
goalkeeper and I don't know why I didn't

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.280 
goalkeeper and I don't know why I didn't
think<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.869> beginning<00:01:24.990> it's

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
think that this is beginning it's

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.570 
think that this is beginning it's
because<00:01:25.530> when<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.710> just<00:01:25.860> do<00:01:25.920> my<00:01:26.040> mill<00:01:26.220> versus

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
because when I just do my mill versus

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.160 
because when I just do my mill versus
youtube<00:01:26.880> series<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.420> used<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.720> always<00:01:27.869> play

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
youtube series I used to always play

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.530
