00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:03.080 

this<00:00:01.589> is<00:00:01.709> a<00:00:01.740> short<00:00:02.010> video<00:00:02.190> detailing<00:00:02.909> the

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
this is a short video detailing the

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.300 
this is a short video detailing the
differences<00:00:03.600> in<00:00:03.840> cytokinesis<00:00:04.650> between

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
differences in cytokinesis between

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.400 
differences in cytokinesis between
plants<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:05.790> animal<00:00:06.060> cells<00:00:06.270> many<00:00:07.230> of<00:00:07.350> the

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
plants and animal cells many of the

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.990 
plants and animal cells many of the
things<00:00:07.649> when<00:00:07.799> it<00:00:07.919> comes<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.340> process<00:00:08.790> of

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
things when it comes to the process of

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.419 
things when it comes to the process of
mitosis<00:00:09.269> is<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:10.380> same<00:00:10.650> with<00:00:10.889> both<00:00:11.010> plant<00:00:11.400> and

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
mitosis is the same with both plant and

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.459 
mitosis is the same with both plant and
animal<00:00:11.519> cells<00:00:11.790> but<00:00:12.509> cytokinesis<00:00:13.200> works<00:00:13.380> a

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
animal cells but cytokinesis works a

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.720 
animal cells but cytokinesis works a
little<00:00:13.559> bit<00:00:13.710> differently<00:00:14.099> because<00:00:14.309> plant

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
little bit differently because plant

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.700 
little bit differently because plant
cells<00:00:15.000> have<00:00:15.480> an<00:00:15.660> extra<00:00:15.929> piece<00:00:16.139> that<00:00:16.410> animal

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
cells have an extra piece that animal

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.560 
cells have an extra piece that animal
cells<00:00:16.740> don't<00:00:17.190> they're<00:00:17.460> dealing<00:00:17.820> with<00:00:17.970> the

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
cells don't they're dealing with the

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.660 
cells don't they're dealing with the
cell<00:00:19.109> wall<00:00:19.380> as<00:00:19.560> well<00:00:19.710> as<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.920> cell<00:00:20.250> membrane

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
cell wall as well as the cell membrane

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.300 
cell wall as well as the cell membrane
so<00:00:20.910> if<00:00:21.420> you<00:00:21.510> remember<00:00:21.689> going<00:00:22.410> from<00:00:22.710> telophase

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
so if you remember going from telophase

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.700 
so if you remember going from telophase
in<00:00:23.640> plant<00:00:24.000> cells<00:00:24.300> where<00:00:24.869> we've<00:00:25.109> got<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.529> two

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
in plant cells where we've got the two

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.859 
in plant cells where we've got the two
nuclei<00:00:26.130> starting<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.699> reform<00:00:27.150> we<00:00:27.630> got<00:00:27.779> this

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
nuclei starting to reform we got this

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.300 
nuclei starting to reform we got this
little<00:00:28.080> thing<00:00:28.320> called<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.590> cleavage<00:00:29.039> furrow

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
little thing called the cleavage furrow

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.310 
little thing called the cleavage furrow
forming<00:00:29.880> in<00:00:30.029> between<00:00:30.390> what's<00:00:31.080> eventually

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
forming in between what's eventually

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.340 
forming in between what's eventually
going<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.800> be<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.009> two<00:00:32.369> cells<00:00:32.899> now<00:00:33.899> once<00:00:34.170> we

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
going to be the two cells now once we

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.770 
going to be the two cells now once we
get<00:00:34.530> into<00:00:34.760> cytokinesis<00:00:35.760> that's<00:00:36.360> when<00:00:36.630> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
get into cytokinesis that's when the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.380 
get into cytokinesis that's when the
cells<00:00:37.050> actually<00:00:37.770> pinch<00:00:38.129> in<00:00:38.309> half<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.239> end

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
cells actually pinch in half and you end

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.420 
cells actually pinch in half and you end
up<00:00:39.480> with<00:00:39.719> two<00:00:40.050> daughter<00:00:40.410> cells<00:00:40.530> at<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.160> end<00:00:41.309> of

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
up with two daughter cells at the end of

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.049 
up with two daughter cells at the end of
the<00:00:41.489> process

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
the process

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.810 
the process
this<00:00:43.020> step<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.410> relatively<00:00:43.950> quick<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.460> simple

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
this step is relatively quick and simple

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.540 
this step is relatively quick and simple
in<00:00:45.210> animal<00:00:46.050> cells<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.590> plant<00:00:46.980> cells<00:00:47.280> things

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
in animal cells in plant cells things

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.400 
in animal cells in plant cells things
get<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> little<00:00:47.969> bit<00:00:48.090> more<00:00:48.239> complex<00:00:48.690> because<00:00:49.350> of

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
get a little bit more complex because of

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.939 
get a little bit more complex because of
the<00:00:49.530> cell<00:00:49.829> wall<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.670> we<00:00:50.760> blow<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:51.270> one<00:00:51.480> up<00:00:51.629> and

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
the cell wall so we blow this one up and

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.310 
the cell wall so we blow this one up and
take<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.010> look<00:00:53.250> at<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.600> anaphase<00:00:54.600> still<00:00:55.020> pretty

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
take a look at it anaphase still pretty

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.779 
take a look at it anaphase still pretty
much<00:00:55.500> looks<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.860> same<00:00:56.129> remember<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.610> word

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
much looks the same remember the word

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.310 
much looks the same remember the word
we're<00:00:57.000> associating<00:00:57.180> with<00:00:57.539> anaphase<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.260> a

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
we're associating with anaphase is a

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.470 
we're associating with anaphase is a
part<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.609> this<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.820> where<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.120> chromosomes

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
part so this is where the chromosomes

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.389 
part so this is where the chromosomes
are<00:01:00.840> pulled<00:01:01.020> apart<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.440> either<00:01:01.649> pole<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.309> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
are pulled apart to either pole of the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.700 
are pulled apart to either pole of the
cell<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.390> thing<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.750> begins<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.320> happen

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
cell the thing that begins to happen

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.399 
cell the thing that begins to happen
then<00:01:04.890> during<00:01:05.220> telophase<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.689> vesicles

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
then during telophase is that vesicles

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.990 
then during telophase is that vesicles
and<00:01:07.590> if<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.740> remember<00:01:07.860> vesicles<00:01:08.549> from<00:01:08.850> our

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
and if you remember vesicles from our

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.030 
and if you remember vesicles from our
chapter<00:01:09.360> on<00:01:09.479> cells<00:01:09.810> those<00:01:10.590> are<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.830> things

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
chapter on cells those are the things

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.410 
chapter on cells those are the things
that<00:01:11.130> are<00:01:11.280> coming<00:01:11.610> from<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.939> Golgi<00:01:12.299> apparatus

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
that are coming from the Golgi apparatus

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.380 
that are coming from the Golgi apparatus
that<00:01:12.990> carry<00:01:13.320> cell<00:01:13.650> products<00:01:14.130> they're<00:01:14.880> coming

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
that carry cell products they're coming

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.700 
that carry cell products they're coming
and<00:01:15.570> they're<00:01:15.930> filled<00:01:16.229> with<00:01:16.320> what<00:01:16.590> are<00:01:16.680> called

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
and they're filled with what are called

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.730 
and they're filled with what are called
cell<00:01:17.250> wall<00:01:17.460> components<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.840> cell<00:01:19.259> wall<00:01:19.500> in

cell wall components the cell wall in
plant<00:01:20.040> cells<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.580> made<00:01:20.820> out<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:20.970> something

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
plant cells is made out of something

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.960 
plant cells is made out of something
called<00:01:21.450> cellulose<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.290> these<00:01:23.250> vesicles<00:01:23.700> are

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
called cellulose and these vesicles are

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.969 
called cellulose and these vesicles are
going<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.180> start<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.509> build<00:01:24.720> up<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:25.140> cellulose

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
going to start to build up a cellulose

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.670 
going to start to build up a cellulose
barrier<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:27.180> thing<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.170> called

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
barrier the thing that this is called

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.520 
barrier the thing that this is called
this<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.070> referred<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.490> as<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.509> cell<00:01:30.810> plate<00:01:31.229> on

this is referred to as the cell plate on
the<00:01:32.100> inside<00:01:32.490> there<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.299> that's<00:01:33.450> one<00:01:33.689> thing

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
the inside there so that's one thing

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.590 
the inside there so that's one thing
that's<00:01:34.799> not<00:01:35.159> in<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.430> diagram<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:36.420> we're

the materials and those vesicles and
then<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.310> says<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:45.119> vesicles<00:01:45.659> fuse<00:01:45.960> forming<00:01:46.619> a

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
then it says the vesicles fuse forming a

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.230 
then it says the vesicles fuse forming a
new<00:01:46.829> cell<00:01:47.100> wall<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.430> can<00:01:47.549> see<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.850> happening

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
new cell wall you can see it happening

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.569 
new cell wall you can see it happening
there<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.689> then<00:01:49.140> during<00:01:49.399> cytokinesis<00:01:50.399> in

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
there and then during cytokinesis in

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.789 
there and then during cytokinesis in
plant<00:01:50.880> cells<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.810> new<00:01:52.079> cell<00:01:52.409> wall<00:01:52.619> is

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
plant cells that new cell wall is

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.190 
plant cells that new cell wall is
complete<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.909> cell<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.329> completely<00:01:54.540> divided

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
complete the cell is completely divided

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.170 
complete the cell is completely divided
and<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.619> like<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.040> way<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.310> picture<00:01:56.549> portrays

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
and I like the way this picture portrays

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.510 
and I like the way this picture portrays
things<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:58.110> does<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.500> very<00:01:58.799> good<00:01:59.009> job<00:01:59.070> of

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
things it does a very good job of

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.819 
things it does a very good job of
showing<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.090> chromosomes<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:01.290> this<00:02:01.590> stage

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
showing the chromosomes in this stage

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.469 
showing the chromosomes in this stage
there's<00:02:02.189> still<00:02:02.460> chromosomes<00:02:03.030> but<00:02:03.210> here

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
there's still chromosomes but here

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.109 
there's still chromosomes but here
they're<00:02:03.630> starting<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.079> D<00:02:04.799> condense<00:02:05.219> back<00:02:05.820> into

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
they're starting to D condense back into

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.240 
they're starting to D condense back into
the<00:02:06.210> chromatin<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:06.869> also<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:07.740> can<00:02:07.950> see<00:02:08.129> the

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
the chromatin and also you can see the

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.150 
the chromatin and also you can see the
dashed<00:02:08.610> nucleus<00:02:09.390> in<00:02:09.599> this<00:02:09.959> stage<00:02:10.229> becoming

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
dashed nucleus in this stage becoming

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.940 
dashed nucleus in this stage becoming
even<00:02:11.670> closer<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.480> being<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.870> fully<00:02:13.170> reformed

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
even closer to being a fully reformed

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.949 
even closer to being a fully reformed
in<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.580> last<00:02:14.760> picture<00:02:15.209> they're<00:02:15.390> representing

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
in the last picture they're representing

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.500 
in the last picture they're representing
cytokinesis<00:02:16.740> where<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.010> cells<00:02:17.250> divide<00:02:17.510> so

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
cytokinesis where the cells divide so

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.790 
cytokinesis where the cells divide so
this<00:02:18.630> picture<00:02:18.840> does<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.110> very<00:02:19.410> good<00:02:19.590> job

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
this picture does a very good job

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.229 
this picture does a very good job
filling<00:02:20.160> in<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.430> lot<00:02:20.550> of<00:02:20.610> those<00:02:20.760> important

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
filling in a lot of those important

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.530 
filling in a lot of those important
details<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.980> make<00:02:23.130> it<00:02:23.250> simple<00:02:23.610> all<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.360> really

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
details to make it simple all you really

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.880 
details to make it simple all you really
need<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.930> know<00:02:25.080> with<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.349> difference<00:02:25.739> between

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
need to know with the difference between

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.699 
need to know with the difference between
the<00:02:26.190> two<00:02:26.370> is<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:27.390> whole<00:02:27.750> concept<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:28.470> cell

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
the two is the whole concept of the cell

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.190 
the two is the whole concept of the cell
plate<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.940> extra<00:02:30.510> step<00:02:30.720> that<00:02:30.900> needs<00:02:30.959> to

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
plate and that extra step that needs to

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.440 
plate and that extra step that needs to
be<00:02:31.230> taken<00:02:31.680> just<00:02:31.950> because<00:02:32.250> plants<00:02:32.580> have<00:02:33.150> the

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
be taken just because plants have the

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.870 
be taken just because plants have the
cell<00:02:33.690> wall<00:02:33.959> to<00:02:34.170> develop<00:02:34.620> as<00:02:34.770> well<00:02:35.280> as<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.640> cell

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
cell wall to develop as well as the cell

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.910 
cell wall to develop as well as the cell
membrane<00:02:36.270> that<00:02:36.480> we're<00:02:37.260> seeing<00:02:37.500> in<00:02:37.620> animal

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
membrane that we're seeing in animal

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.190 
membrane that we're seeing in animal
cells<00:02:38.100> so<00:02:38.940> as<00:02:39.120> always<00:02:39.480> thank<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.140> for

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
cells so as always thank you for

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.449 
cells so as always thank you for
watching<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:40.769> I<00:02:41.040> hope<00:02:41.069> you<00:02:41.280> learned

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
watching and I hope you learned

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.700 
watching and I hope you learned
something
