00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.899
 in brittany we have essentially a problem 

00:00:09.899 --> 00:00:12.899
 so what you have to bear in mind is that it's a weight problem 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:16.679
 it's not a drinking water problem 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:19.039
 drinking and health treatments 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.810
 for philippe drinking europe 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.830
 it's really the raw waters that brain behind water business 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.359
 so there are action plans 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.260
 title of the directive 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.470
 10,991 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.830
 and that 6% effect that in each 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.590
 we have price levels 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.590
 attractive rates over 40 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.790
 dia actions 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.790
 reduce m 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.610
 measures to limit transfers to watercourses with bands 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.610
 grass 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.090
 you really have a major problem 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.330
 in certain Breton watersheds 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.330
 we talked about green algae but we also have nine watersheds 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.040
 European litigation 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.040
 enough 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.820
 even more actions 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.820
 of precisely limiting the installation and 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.680
 animals 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.640
 the idea of ​​going back to a situation 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.470
 but all that can be learned 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.580
 and it's true that 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.870
 there is an environmental issue 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.170
 f behind via that m 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.170
 he had worked on these themes 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.200
 environmental measures 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.200
 there were consequences on the economy 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.460
 there is a whole program thorgan destination of 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.910
 it goes through both training 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.789
 advocacy actions of the agricultural council 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.109
 to explain to them 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:12.809
 this mandate may be that by driving their culture a little differently it 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:15.389
 must 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:18.389
 and then come say 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:21.939
 that farmers voluntarily subscribe 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.089
 and then there can also be scenes in case news 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.169
 obligations
