00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
then um one problem I have with this is

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.190 
then um one problem I have with this is
the<00:00:35.010> law<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.700> don't<00:00:36.480> know<00:00:36.540> if<00:00:36.630> it's<00:00:36.750> just<00:00:36.840> mine

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
the law I don't know if it's just mine

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.389 
the law I don't know if it's just mine
but<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:38.180> very<00:00:39.180> easy<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.719> open<00:00:40.110> your<00:00:40.950> hand<00:00:41.250> me

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
but it's very easy to open your hand me

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.260 
but it's very easy to open your hand me
of<00:00:41.520> course<00:00:41.790> can't<00:00:42.120> push<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.540> open<00:00:42.690> but<00:00:43.110> still<00:00:43.530> a

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
of course can't push it open but still a

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.340 
of course can't push it open but still a
little<00:00:45.270> flawed<00:00:46.110> design<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:48.079> doesn't<00:00:49.079> stay<00:00:49.289> out

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
little flawed design is doesn't stay out

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.170 
little flawed design is doesn't stay out
there<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.710> have<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.950> reach<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.579> when<00:00:51.090> you're

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
there you have to reach in when you're

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.950 
there you have to reach in when you're
cleaning<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:53.000> cleaning<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.360> not<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.719> easy

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
cleaning it cleaning is not the easy

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.360 
cleaning it cleaning is not the easy
thing<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.320> do<00:00:57.500> it's<00:00:58.500> got<00:00:58.680> quite<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.949> bit<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.129> room

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
thing to do it's got quite a bit of room

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.119 
thing to do it's got quite a bit of room
without<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.910> shelf<00:01:00.449> with<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.320> Shelf<00:01:01.739> not<00:01:01.980> as

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
much room like I took the wheel off but

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.719

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
actually very very very very noisy so I

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.359 
actually very very very very noisy so I
would<00:01:17.100> take<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.280> off<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.520> replace<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:19.130> okay<00:01:20.130> I

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
would take it off and replace it okay I

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.440 
would take it off and replace it okay I
would<00:01:20.640> do<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.820> just<00:01:21.299> any<00:01:21.750> day<00:01:22.850> this<00:01:23.850> shelf<00:01:24.210> I

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
would do that just any day this shelf I

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.870 
would do that just any day this shelf I
usually<00:01:24.659> put<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.229> these<00:01:25.380> bars<00:01:25.590> which<00:01:25.979> are

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
usually put on these bars which are

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.780 
usually put on these bars which are
actually<00:01:27.180> pretty<00:01:27.600> story<00:01:28.380> my<00:01:29.369> hamster

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790

actually likes to climb deep bars but
that's<00:01:32.759> absolutely<00:01:33.210> fine<00:01:33.390> because<00:01:33.600> it

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
that's absolutely fine because it

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.730

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
but then someone just

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.310 
but then someone just
