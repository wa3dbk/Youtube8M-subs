00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
of bleeding in the abdomen so I mean

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.009 
of bleeding in the abdomen so I mean
animals<00:02:54.069> like<00:02:54.400> arethusa<00:02:55.180> have<00:02:55.540> been<00:02:55.690> escaping

from<00:02:56.350> from<00:02:56.799> these<00:02:56.980> waters<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.549> she<00:02:58.060> is<00:02:58.180> a

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
from from these waters and she is a

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.750 
from from these waters and she is a
classic<00:02:59.170> example<00:02:59.290> of<00:02:59.799> the<00:03:00.160> kind<00:03:00.370> of<00:03:00.400> injuries

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
classic example of the kind of injuries

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.490 
classic example of the kind of injuries
that<00:03:01.000> some<00:03:01.239> animals<00:03:01.569> can<00:03:01.780> come<00:03:01.959> across<00:03:02.079> in

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
that some animals can come across in

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.440 
that some animals can come across in
these<00:03:02.739> kind<00:03:02.980> of<00:03:03.010> situations<00:03:03.190> so<00:03:03.760> she's

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
these kind of situations so she's

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.690 
these kind of situations so she's
certainly<00:03:04.930> here<00:03:05.290> under<00:03:05.530> a<00:03:05.560> lot<00:03:05.799> of<00:03:05.920> treatment

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
certainly here under a lot of treatment

particularly<00:06:38.590> burrowing<00:06:39.100> species<00:06:39.520> like<00:06:39.940> the

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060 
particularly burrowing species like the

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.969 
particularly burrowing species like the
echidnas<00:06:40.419> that<00:06:40.570> we've<00:06:40.690> seen<00:06:40.960> platypus<00:06:41.770> that

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:41.979 
echidnas that we've seen platypus that

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:43.580 
echidnas that we've seen platypus that
have<00:06:42.070> their<00:06:42.220> burrows<00:06:42.490> along<00:06:42.789> creek<00:06:43.030> beds

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590 
have their burrows along creek beds

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.140 
have their burrows along creek beds
bandicoot's<00:06:44.590> any<00:06:45.190> ground<00:06:45.610> dwelling<00:06:46.000> animals

bandicoot's any ground dwelling animals

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.290 
bandicoot's any ground dwelling animals
a<00:06:46.479> direct<00:06:47.410> risk<00:06:48.190> and<00:06:48.490> impact<00:06:48.880> from<00:06:49.120> those

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:49.300 
a direct risk and impact from those

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.390 
a direct risk and impact from those
flood<00:06:49.539> waters<00:06:49.570> I<00:06:50.080> mean<00:06:50.470> other<00:06:50.650> species<00:06:51.160> like

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 
flood waters I mean other species like

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.420 
flood waters I mean other species like
kangaroos<00:06:52.360> and<00:06:52.690> wallabies<00:06:53.229> and<00:06:53.800> possums<00:06:54.220> and

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:54.430 
kangaroos and wallabies and possums and

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:55.920 
kangaroos and wallabies and possums and
all<00:06:54.490> those<00:06:54.669> other<00:06:54.910> animals<00:06:55.330> that<00:06:55.389> that<00:06:55.810> are

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:55.930 
all those other animals that that are

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.110 
all those other animals that that are
also<00:06:56.050> in<00:06:56.349> fairly<00:06:56.800> urbanized<00:06:57.280> areas<00:06:57.759> often

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.120 
also in fairly urbanized areas often

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.330 
also in fairly urbanized areas often
don't<00:06:58.840> really<00:06:59.199> have<00:06:59.380> places<00:06:59.650> to<00:06:59.979> run<00:07:00.130> either

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:00.340 
don't really have places to run either

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.480 
don't really have places to run either
so<00:07:00.729> they<00:07:01.060> can<00:07:01.210> be<00:07:01.300> swept<00:07:01.570> away<00:07:01.690> by<00:07:01.780> floods

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.490 
so they can be swept away by floods

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.740 
so they can be swept away by floods
trees<00:07:03.490> that<00:07:03.759> are<00:07:03.849> going<00:07:03.940> to<00:07:04.000> die<00:07:04.240> lots<00:07:04.660> of

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:04.750 
trees that are going to die lots of

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.450 
trees that are going to die lots of
habitat<00:07:05.259> all<00:07:05.500> of<00:07:05.680> that<00:07:05.800> is<00:07:05.919> going<00:07:06.039> to<00:07:06.130> impact

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:06.460 
habitat all of that is going to impact

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.550 
habitat all of that is going to impact
on<00:07:06.669> species<00:07:06.940> so<00:07:07.389> I<00:07:07.570> guess<00:07:07.960> if<00:07:08.139> people<00:07:08.169> can<00:07:08.530> just

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 
on species so I guess if people can just

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.200 
on species so I guess if people can just
be<00:07:08.740> aware<00:07:09.070> if<00:07:09.280> there's<00:07:09.490> an<00:07:09.610> animal<00:07:09.910> that<00:07:10.090> is

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.210 
be aware if there's an animal that is

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:11.879 
be aware if there's an animal that is
not<00:07:10.360> in<00:07:10.660> a<00:07:10.720> place<00:07:10.930> where<00:07:10.960> it<00:07:11.289> probably<00:07:11.410> should

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:11.889 
not in a place where it probably should

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:14.070 
not in a place where it probably should
be<00:07:11.919> if<00:07:12.639> they're<00:07:12.910> in<00:07:13.060> rubes<00:07:13.419> they're<00:07:13.750> obviously

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 
be if they're in rubes they're obviously

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.740 
be if they're in rubes they're obviously
trying<00:07:14.620> to<00:07:15.160> escape<00:07:15.550> these<00:07:15.789> flood<00:07:16.090> waters<00:07:16.120> and

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:16.750 
trying to escape these flood waters and

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.480 
trying to escape these flood waters and
and<00:07:17.020> people<00:07:17.560> will<00:07:17.740> find<00:07:17.949> that<00:07:18.159> a<00:07:18.250> lot<00:07:18.460> of

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:18.490 
and people will find that a lot of

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.250 
and people will find that a lot of
wildlife<00:07:19.000> is<00:07:19.180> going<00:07:19.539> to<00:07:19.599> come<00:07:19.780> into<00:07:19.930> urban

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:20.260 
wildlife is going to come into urban

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.649 
wildlife is going to come into urban
areas<00:07:20.650> looking<00:07:20.979> for<00:07:21.190> food<00:07:21.400> looking<00:07:22.360> for<00:07:22.539> other

00:07:22.649 --> 00:07:22.659 
areas looking for food looking for other

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:25.409 
areas looking for food looking for other
places<00:07:23.080> to<00:07:23.289> build<00:07:23.860> their<00:07:24.070> homes<00:07:24.280> again<00:07:24.669> I<00:07:24.849> mean

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:25.419 
places to build their homes again I mean

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:27.210 
places to build their homes again I mean
they<00:07:25.570> don't<00:07:25.720> have<00:07:25.990> a<00:07:26.020> voice<00:07:26.289> and<00:07:26.530> we<00:07:26.860> really

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:27.220 
they don't have a voice and we really

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.779 
they don't have a voice and we really
have<00:07:27.370> to<00:07:27.400> be<00:07:27.639> here<00:07:27.940> to<00:07:28.659> work<00:07:29.110> for<00:07:29.530> them<00:07:29.740> and<00:07:30.580> I

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:30.789 
have to be here to work for them and I

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:32.040 
have to be here to work for them and I
just<00:07:31.000> want<00:07:31.180> people<00:07:31.240> to<00:07:31.510> be<00:07:31.720> out<00:07:31.810> on<00:07:31.840> the

lookout for certain species and you know

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:36.060 
lookout for certain species and you know
that<00:07:34.630> can<00:07:34.810> be<00:07:34.840> severely<00:07:35.320> impacted<00:07:35.889> by<00:07:36.010> these
