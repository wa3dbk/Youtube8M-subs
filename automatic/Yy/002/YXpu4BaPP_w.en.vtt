00:00:06.402 --> 00:00:10.140
 Welcome to the World of Warcraft crash arcane magician course. 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.093
 In this video, you'll learn what you need to do 

00:00:14.093 --> 00:00:17.331
 to start with an Arcane Mage at level 90. 

00:00:18.819 --> 00:00:23.341
 Arcane relies on accumulating so-called Arcane charges 

00:00:23.841 --> 00:00:27.787
 to unleash. You can have up to 4 Arcane charges, 

00:00:27.787 --> 00:00:31.590
 which each increase the damage of your arcane single-target spells, 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.371
 but at the same time increase the mana cost, 

00:00:34.371 --> 00:00:36.737
 to keep your arcane charges active. 

00:00:36.737 --> 00:00:39.277
 So you have to strike a balance between high damage 

00:00:39.402 --> 00:00:41.518
 and find mana efficiency to play Arcane. 

00:00:42.318 --> 00:00:45.470
 Before the fight, you should have Arcane Brilliance 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.971
 which will greatly increase your spell power and critical strike chance. 

00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:54.026
 In combat, your most important spell is Arcane Strike. 

00:00:54.026 --> 00:00:56.645
 He deals damage and creates an Arcane charge, 

00:00:56.845 --> 00:00:59.977
 but quickly costs too much mana to use it permanently. 

00:01:00.177 --> 00:01:03.641
 Continue with Arcane projectiles. They are only available 

00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:06.387
 when unlocked by another spell. 

00:01:06.684 --> 00:01:11.168
 But you can accumulate up to 3 activations and receive visual notifications. 

00:01:11.168 --> 00:01:14.594
 showing you how many times you can work them. 

00:01:14.594 --> 00:01:18.206
 They also create an Arcane charge, but unlike Arcane Strike 

00:01:18.206 --> 00:01:22.390
 no mana, so you should save Arcane Missiles better, 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.742
 until you have multiple Arcane charges. 

00:01:26.142 --> 00:01:28.288
 Lastly, you still have Arcane Fire, 

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:30.574
 bringing all of your active Arcane charges 

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:33.233
 consumed to cause a lot of damage. 

00:01:33.233 --> 00:01:37.170
 Use Arcane Bombardment if you have 4 Arcane charges, 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.598
 Can not use Arcane Missiles to reduce the mana cost of 

00:01:40.598 --> 00:01:43.724
 Reset Arcane Strike and rebuild it. 

00:01:44.324 --> 00:01:47.380
 There is much more to learn to master your magician, 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.679
 but we hope this first insight will get you on the right track. 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.911
 Once you have mastered the basics, 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.988
 look at your spellbook, your talents and glyphs, 

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:02.215
 to get to know even more skills. 

00:02:02.215 --> 00:02:05.493
 Thank you for watching! See you at Draenor.
