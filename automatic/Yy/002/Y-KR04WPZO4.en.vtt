00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.080 

we've<00:01:34.740> been<00:01:34.890> working<00:01:35.190> the<00:01:35.280> tricep<00:01:35.790> with<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
we've been working the tricep with the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.030 
we've been working the tricep with the
first<00:01:36.330> two<00:01:36.510> moves<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.080> we<00:01:37.650> want<00:01:37.830> to<00:01:37.890> balance

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
first two moves and we want to balance

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.980 
first two moves and we want to balance
it<00:01:38.310> out<00:01:38.400> by<00:01:38.580> working<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.000> bicep<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.570> again<00:01:39.810> we

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
it out by working the bicep and again we

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.510 
it out by working the bicep and again we
always<00:01:40.260> want<00:01:40.440> to<00:01:40.500> be<00:01:40.620> mindful<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.160> we're<00:01:41.400> not

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
always want to be mindful that we're not

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.460 
always want to be mindful that we're not
trying<00:01:41.760> to<00:01:41.790> bulk<00:01:42.060> up<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.870> it's<00:01:42.990> about<00:01:43.200> light

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
trying to bulk up so it's about light

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.460 
trying to bulk up so it's about light
weight<00:01:43.740> higher<00:01:44.340> reps<00:01:44.720> so<00:01:45.720> what<00:01:45.870> we<00:01:45.960> have<00:01:46.290> here

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
weight higher reps so what we have here

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.110 
weight higher reps so what we have here
I<00:01:46.560> like<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.190> the<00:01:47.250> neutral<00:01:47.580> position<00:01:47.640> which

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 
I like you in the neutral position which

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.790 
I like you in the neutral position which
