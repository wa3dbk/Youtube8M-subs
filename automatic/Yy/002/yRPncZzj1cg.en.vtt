00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:08.900 
voiceover this is the workflow I lav up

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.680 
voiceover this is the workflow I lav up
I<00:00:09.139> plug<00:00:09.770> the<00:00:09.920> lab<00:00:10.100> straight<00:00:10.760> into<00:00:11.300> a<00:00:11.330> digital

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
I plug the lab straight into a digital

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.839 
I plug the lab straight into a digital
recorder<00:00:12.410> and<00:00:12.650> then<00:00:13.130> I<00:00:13.160> go<00:00:13.370> ahead<00:00:13.490> and<00:00:13.639> read

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:13.849 
recorder and then I go ahead and read

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.450 
recorder and then I go ahead and read
the<00:00:14.000> script<00:00:14.300> now<00:00:14.929> editor's<00:00:15.679> key<00:00:15.950> sent<00:00:16.250> over

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
the script now editor's key sent over

this<00:00:16.610> portable<00:00:17.060> voice<00:00:17.779> recording<00:00:18.470> booth<00:00:18.710> and

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
this portable voice recording booth and

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.070 
this portable voice recording booth and
basically<00:00:20.300> we're<00:00:20.510> going<00:00:20.600> to<00:00:20.660> put<00:00:20.810> it<00:00:20.869> to<00:00:20.990> the

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
basically we're going to put it to the

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.779 
basically we're going to put it to the
test<00:00:21.109> and<00:00:21.619> see<00:00:21.770> if<00:00:21.800> this<00:00:22.010> could<00:00:22.130> be<00:00:22.189> a<00:00:22.279> new<00:00:22.460> tool

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
test and see if this could be a new tool

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.359 
test and see if this could be a new tool
that<00:00:23.359> I<00:00:23.390> implement<00:00:24.050> in<00:00:24.260> doing<00:00:24.710> Olivia<00:00:25.100> tech

the<00:00:42.890> portable<00:00:43.250> sound<00:00:43.520> booth<00:00:43.730> works<00:00:44.030> by

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
the portable sound booth works by

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:45.639 
the portable sound booth works by
allowing<00:00:44.360> the<00:00:44.750> sound<00:00:45.020> to<00:00:45.200> pass<00:00:45.410> through

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
allowing the sound to pass through

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.979 
allowing the sound to pass through
individual<00:00:46.309> layers<00:00:46.520> of<00:00:46.820> foam<00:00:47.149> and<00:00:47.420> aluminum

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
individual layers of foam and aluminum

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.369 
individual layers of foam and aluminum
that<00:00:48.530> diffuses<00:00:48.980> the<00:00:49.129> acoustic<00:00:49.760> waves

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
that diffuses the acoustic waves

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.750 
that diffuses the acoustic waves
surrounding<00:00:51.379> the<00:00:51.500> microphone<00:00:51.950> now<00:00:52.520> this

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
surrounding the microphone now this

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.549 
surrounding the microphone now this
prevents<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:53.390> sound<00:00:53.750> from<00:00:54.020> bouncing<00:00:54.379> back

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
prevents the sound from bouncing back

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.380 
prevents the sound from bouncing back
toward<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:55.160> mic<00:00:55.370> which<00:00:55.789> can<00:00:55.969> ultimately

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
toward the mic which can ultimately

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.540 
toward the mic which can ultimately
change<00:00:56.750> the<00:00:56.899> sound<00:00:57.140> of<00:00:57.289> your<00:00:57.410> recording<00:00:57.890> so

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
change the sound of your recording so

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.060 
change the sound of your recording so
basically<00:00:58.879> this<00:00:59.270> wall<00:00:59.660> is<00:00:59.960> meant<00:01:00.230> to<00:01:00.410> trap<00:01:00.739> my

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
basically this wall is meant to trap my

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.670 
basically this wall is meant to trap my
vocals<00:01:01.640> now<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:02.270> pop<00:01:02.719> filter<00:01:02.960> is<00:01:03.440> gonna

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
vocals now the pop filter is gonna

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.609 
vocals now the pop filter is gonna
prevent<00:01:04.100> plosives<00:01:04.910> or<00:01:05.180> those<00:01:05.449> harsh<00:01:05.810> P's<00:01:06.590> and

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
prevent plosives or those harsh P's and

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.179 
prevent plosives or those harsh P's and
B's<00:01:07.369> or<00:01:07.790> T's<00:01:08.150> that<00:01:08.540> you<00:01:08.659> get<00:01:08.900> that<00:01:09.740> what<00:01:10.010> can

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
B's or T's that you get that what can

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.310 
B's or T's that you get that what can
really<00:01:10.460> make<00:01:10.760> a<00:01:10.790> popping<00:01:11.299> sound<00:01:11.330> into<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.110> mic

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
really make a popping sound into the mic

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.219 
really make a popping sound into the mic
okay<00:01:13.130> so<00:01:13.189> another<00:01:13.610> aspect<00:01:14.299> to<00:01:14.540> note<00:01:14.869> about

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
okay so another aspect to note about

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.249 
okay so another aspect to note about
using<00:01:15.470> a<00:01:15.740> USB<00:01:15.890> microphone<00:01:16.490> is<00:01:17.090> that<00:01:17.720> this<00:01:18.049> is

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
using a USB microphone is that this is

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.679 
using a USB microphone is that this is
actually<00:01:18.560> plugged<00:01:18.799> straight<00:01:19.159> into<00:01:19.400> my<00:01:19.939> laptop

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
actually plugged straight into my laptop

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.499 
actually plugged straight into my laptop
so<00:01:21.439> instead<00:01:22.009> of<00:01:22.070> me<00:01:22.400> laughing<00:01:23.000> up<00:01:23.180> and<00:01:23.420> then

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
so instead of me laughing up and then

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.960 
so instead of me laughing up and then
going<00:01:23.869> into<00:01:24.290> an<00:01:24.500> external<00:01:24.860> recorder<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:25.610> then

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
going into an external recorder and then

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.700 
going into an external recorder and then
later<00:01:26.180> on<00:01:26.360> having<00:01:26.659> to<00:01:26.750> transfer<00:01:27.170> those<00:01:27.320> audio

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
later on having to transfer those audio

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.429 
later on having to transfer those audio
files<00:01:28.009> this<00:01:28.790> USB<00:01:29.600> mic<00:01:29.810> is<00:01:29.960> actually<00:01:30.259> going<00:01:30.350> to

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
files this USB mic is actually going to

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:32.530 
files this USB mic is actually going to
record<00:01:30.830> straight<00:01:31.340> into<00:01:31.759> Final<00:01:32.090> Cut<00:01:32.270> Pro<00:01:32.329> X

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
record straight into Final Cut Pro X

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.100 
record straight into Final Cut Pro X
which<00:01:33.380> is<00:01:33.650> the<00:01:34.009> program<00:01:34.310> that<00:01:34.640> I'm<00:01:34.759> using<00:01:35.110> so

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
which is the program that I'm using so

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.929 
which is the program that I'm using so
what<00:01:36.259> I<00:01:36.290> did<00:01:36.500> is<00:01:36.650> I<00:01:36.770> just<00:01:36.799> simply<00:01:37.070> plugged<00:01:37.640> the

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
what I did is I just simply plugged the

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.929 
what I did is I just simply plugged the
sl150<00:01:38.840> into<00:01:39.320> my<00:01:39.439> Mac<00:01:39.680> I<00:01:39.920> made<00:01:40.460> sure<00:01:40.640> that<00:01:40.670> the

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
sl150 into my Mac I made sure that the

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.660 
sl150 into my Mac I made sure that the
input<00:01:41.450> was<00:01:41.720> assigned<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.829> editors<00:01:43.250> keys

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
input was assigned to the editors keys

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.340 
input was assigned to the editors keys
sl150<00:01:44.659> and<00:01:45.079> then<00:01:45.530> I<00:01:45.560> simply<00:01:46.009> just<00:01:46.430> hit<00:01:46.579> record

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
sl150 and then I simply just hit record

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.899 
sl150 and then I simply just hit record
okay<00:01:48.350> so<00:01:48.409> now<00:01:48.799> I'm<00:01:48.920> gonna<00:01:49.009> read<00:01:49.220> a<00:01:49.250> portion<00:01:49.520> of
