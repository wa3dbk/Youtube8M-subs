setup<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:41.100> will<00:00:41.670> use<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.300> muscle<00:00:42.899> break

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
setup I will use the muscle break

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.040 
setup I will use the muscle break
instead<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.489> using<00:00:44.790> a<00:00:45.059> red<00:00:45.210> outside<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.660> I

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
instead of using a red outside and I

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.040 
instead of using a red outside and I
kind<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.770> kind<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.940> regret<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.420> because<00:00:48.660> I

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
kind of kind of regret that because I

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.780 
kind of kind of regret that because I
found<00:00:49.350> out<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.829> haven't<00:00:50.280> used<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.579> come

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
found out the I haven't used this come

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.680 
found out the I haven't used this come
before<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.719> found<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.130> iron<00:00:54.090> sight<00:00:54.510> on

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
before so I found that the iron sight on

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.860 
before so I found that the iron sight on
this<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.200> not<00:00:56.100> really<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.879> best<00:00:57.030> iron<00:00:57.480> sights

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
this is not really the best iron sights

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.139 
this is not really the best iron sights
are<00:00:58.410> used<00:00:59.600> but<00:01:00.980> you<00:01:01.980> can<00:01:02.219> give<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.820> try<00:01:02.850> and

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
are used but you can give it a try and

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.039 
are used but you can give it a try and
see<00:01:03.750> if<00:01:04.259> you<00:01:04.469> like<00:01:04.649> dang<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.039> sighs<00:01:05.159> better<00:01:06.049> and

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.750 
see if you like dang it sighs better and
just<00:01:07.079> say<00:01:07.440> I<00:01:07.470> think<00:01:07.830> not<00:01:08.190> like<00:01:08.250> their<00:01:08.610> own

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
sites but i really liked our insides of

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.330 
sites but i really liked our insides of
any

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
any

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.679 
any

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
very few guns and this game that I like

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.950 
very few guns and this game that I like
that<00:01:18.049> inside<00:01:18.289> of<00:01:18.560> but<00:01:18.979> anyway<00:01:19.630> you<00:01:20.630> can<00:01:20.780> try

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
that inside of but anyway you can try

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.959 
that inside of but anyway you can try
with<00:01:21.229> muscle<00:01:21.979> break-in<00:01:22.310> without<00:01:22.579> musselburgh

with muscle break-in without musselburgh

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:24.190 
with muscle break-in without musselburgh
maybe<00:01:23.179> it<00:01:23.299> isn't<00:01:23.479> that<00:01:23.659> much<00:01:23.869> different

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
maybe it isn't that much different
