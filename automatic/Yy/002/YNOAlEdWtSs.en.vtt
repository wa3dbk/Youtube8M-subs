00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.680 
show you guys like what it is and how to
build<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:23.790> basically<00:00:24.090> this<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.300> just<00:00:24.600> the

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:24.690 
build it so basically this is just the

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.080 
build it so basically this is just the
demo<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:25.860> kind<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.190> looks<00:00:26.250> like<00:00:26.430> this<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:27.030> you

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
demo it kind of looks like this so you

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.850 
demo it kind of looks like this so you
have<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.450> have<00:00:27.540> the<00:00:27.570> surrounding<00:00:28.110> walls<00:00:28.290> and

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860 
have to have the surrounding walls and

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.350 
have to have the surrounding walls and
let<00:00:28.980> me<00:00:29.070> just<00:00:29.100> put<00:00:29.400> creepers<00:00:29.850> cuz<00:00:30.030> i've<00:00:30.120> got<00:00:30.330> a

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:30.360 
let me just put creepers cuz i've got a

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.420 
let me just put creepers cuz i've got a
wall<00:00:30.540> on<00:00:30.690> top<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:31.080> look<00:00:31.200> they<00:00:31.830> all<00:00:31.980> get<00:00:32.129> pushed

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
wall on top and look they all get pushed

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.799 
wall on top and look they all get pushed
off<00:00:33.050> so<00:00:34.050> it's<00:00:34.410> kind<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.649> like<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.829> magnet<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:35.809> i

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
off so it's kind of like a magnet so i

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.330 
off so it's kind of like a magnet so i
don't<00:00:37.440> know<00:00:37.530> it's<00:00:37.649> just<00:00:37.739> like<00:00:37.829> pushing<00:00:38.219> them

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
don't know it's just like pushing them

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.819 
don't know it's just like pushing them
off<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.670> edge<00:00:38.900> it's<00:00:39.900> alright<00:00:40.110> how<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.380> build

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
off the edge it's alright how to build

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.100 
off the edge it's alright how to build
it<00:00:41.130> what<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.090> want<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.300> do<00:00:42.420> first<00:00:42.720> is<00:00:43.050> just

then<00:00:51.960> find<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.500> middle<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.090> do<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:54.560> build<00:00:55.560> a

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
then find the middle and do this build a

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.870 
then find the middle and do this build a
full<00:00:56.310> by<00:00:56.460> forfeit<00:00:57.090> yep<00:00:57.840> full<00:00:58.500> rifle<00:00:58.920> bit<00:00:59.160> and

in the middle you want to take normal

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.359 
in the middle you want to take normal
rails<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.899> put<00:01:04.049> them<00:01:04.199> down<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.619> have<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.219> make

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
pushed off wait

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.200 
pushed off wait
I<00:01:59.530> think<00:02:00.530> you<00:02:00.590> need<00:02:00.680> to<00:02:00.740> put<00:02:00.920> a<00:02:00.950> bit<00:02:01.100> more<00:02:01.210> and

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
I think you need to put a bit more and

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.740 
I think you need to put a bit more and
obviously<00:02:02.509> the<00:02:03.189> wider<00:02:04.189> the<00:02:04.729> area<00:02:05.210> is<00:02:05.360> the

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
obviously the wider the area is the

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.870 
obviously the wider the area is the
longer<00:02:06.140> it<00:02:06.200> takes<00:02:06.289> for<00:02:06.530> mobs<00:02:06.829> to<00:02:07.610> fall<00:02:07.850> down

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
longer it takes for mobs to fall down

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.210 
longer it takes for mobs to fall down
but<00:02:08.569> look<00:02:08.750> for<00:02:08.959> example<00:02:09.410> if<00:02:09.470> i<00:02:09.590> go<00:02:09.739> over<00:02:09.769> here

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
but look for example if i go over here

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.880 
but look for example if i go over here
if<00:02:10.819> I<00:02:11.120> stand<00:02:11.480> here<00:02:11.630> I'll<00:02:11.930> get<00:02:12.080> pushed<00:02:12.349> off<00:02:12.530> wait

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
if I stand here I'll get pushed off wait

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.470 
if I stand here I'll get pushed off wait
how<00:02:13.930> you<00:02:14.930> see<00:02:15.700> wait<00:02:16.700> I<00:02:16.730> want<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:17.000> go<00:02:17.120> up<00:02:17.300> and
