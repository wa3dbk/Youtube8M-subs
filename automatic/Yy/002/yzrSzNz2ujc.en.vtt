00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
like why you have one of these things

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:55.720 
like why you have one of these things
but<00:02:50.290> there's<00:02:51.290> that<00:02:51.590> one<00:02:51.769> for<00:02:52.010> you<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:54.700> you<00:02:55.700> can

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
but there's that one for you and you can

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.039 
but there's that one for you and you can
also<00:02:56.120> chart<00:02:57.109> or<00:02:57.349> play<00:02:57.650> it<00:02:57.680> through<00:02:58.250> here<00:02:59.049> with

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
also chart or play it through here with

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:06.250 
also chart or play it through here with
this<00:03:00.230> little<00:03:00.440> cord<00:03:04.390> it's<00:03:05.390> just<00:03:05.599> not<00:03:05.659> nearly<00:03:06.109> as

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
this little cord it's just not nearly as

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:13.050

loud

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.089
