I've<00:04:41.009> never<00:04:41.520> ever<00:04:41.789> seen<00:04:42.180> Kings<00:04:42.479> folded

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
I've never ever seen Kings folded

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.010 
I've never ever seen Kings folded
preflop<00:04:43.289> in<00:04:43.470> this<00:04:43.590> format<00:04:43.949> before<00:04:44.190> and<00:04:44.789> I<00:04:45.120> mean

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
preflop in this format before and I mean

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.689 
preflop in this format before and I mean
that's<00:04:46.830> one<00:04:46.949> of<00:04:46.979> the<00:04:47.099> greatest<00:04:47.280> lay<00:04:47.520> downs

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
that's one of the greatest lay downs

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:50.510 
that's one of the greatest lay downs
we've<00:04:47.849> ever<00:04:47.970> seen<00:04:48.240> yeah<00:04:48.690> one<00:04:48.960> of<00:04:48.990> the<00:04:49.110> worst<00:04:49.520> it

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
we've ever seen yeah one of the worst it

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.520 
we've ever seen yeah one of the worst it
was<00:04:50.669> a<00:04:50.729> great<00:04:51.000> lay<00:04:51.180> down<00:04:51.419> he<00:04:52.320> had<00:04:52.410> the

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
was a great lay down he had the

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.469 
was a great lay down he had the
instincts<00:04:52.979> that<00:04:53.009> kalakeyas<00:04:53.669> had<00:04:54.000> a<00:04:54.030> hand<00:04:54.270> and

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
instincts that kalakeyas had a hand and

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.600 
instincts that kalakeyas had a hand and
he<00:04:54.599> did<00:04:54.780> so<00:04:55.080> he<00:04:55.229> was<00:04:55.349> right<00:04:55.620> you<00:04:56.310> just<00:04:56.370> can't

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
he did so he was right you just can't

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.290 
he did so he was right you just can't
take<00:04:56.789> that<00:04:56.849> away<00:04:57.030> from<00:04:57.449> the<00:04:57.570> guy<00:04:58.039> 98<00:04:59.039> 99<00:04:59.880> times

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
take that away from the guy 98 99 times

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.510 
take that away from the guy 98 99 times
it's<00:05:00.660> the<00:05:00.900> correct<00:05:01.770> move<00:05:01.949> to<00:05:02.070> put<00:05:02.220> the<00:05:02.280> chips

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
it's the correct move to put the chips

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.620 
it's the correct move to put the chips
in<00:05:02.639> the<00:05:02.669> middle<00:05:02.759> but<00:05:03.090> this<00:05:03.210> time<00:05:03.389> it<00:05:03.539> was

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
in the middle but this time it was

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.659 
in the middle but this time it was
