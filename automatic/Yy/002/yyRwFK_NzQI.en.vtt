00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 whatsapp everybody is saying that 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.259
 I hope you have well we find ourselves 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.730
 today for a new video on 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.830
 my chain it was a lot of time 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.599
 that I have not propose you so more 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.179
 a review I told myself we're going to get 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.690
 get up we're going to make a video is what a 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.460
 review on tille on arturo vidal wholesale 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.410
 this week's players still in 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.689
 the toque celia is one of the best 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.980
 by the way and I thought I'd like 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.689
 already tested the version a form 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.029
 the basic version that really do not have 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.980
 more why not tested the tots version 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.199
 and this version touch game test them 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.270
 she's really a cut above gold 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.219
 so directly the statins game I 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.480
 propose you to pause if that 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.739
 go a little too fast but in any case 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.570
 case you can see that at the level of 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.250
 stats it's really very very clean there 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.230
 really has more than 80 in all 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.579
 areas virtually at the level of 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.890
 strikes on the strikes 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.239
 we will see directly on the first 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.629
 clips that at the level of the strikes it's a 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.430
 limit monster better than guarin freddy 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.079
 guarin even if freddy guarin and would 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.699
 very good just watch me this clip 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.280
 I am all alone what am I doing 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.609
 I'm going to hit and look at this 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.799
 just amazing punching power 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.970
 I farted a cable when I scored this 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.799
 goal by the way it was my second 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.990
 third match I said it's not 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.720
 possible a player as good everywhere 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.750
 defensively offensively speed 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.549
 pass head dribbles he's good everywhere 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.110
 but I said no we can not 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.540
 do not we can create a game too 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.790
 good everywhere and ben if arturo vidal is 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.200
 good everywhere so I'll talk to you a 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.659
 little bit now positive points 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.350
 and negative points 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.210
 personally I did not find any 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.520
 negative point on this player 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.869
 we would have thought that at the head 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.030
 maybe it would have been bad but 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.590
 no no head he is as good he is 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.180
 very very good in the lead even if he does not 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.950
 as a meter 81 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.180
 frankly I saw that in the lead he was 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.610
 very very good he has marked me elsewhere 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.259
 two goals from the lead a goal only 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.600
 will be in the video puts besides a 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.520
 very nice goal but apart from that's it 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.770
 it's true that when you look at your map 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.560
 1.84 speed we really feel them 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.060
 especially his acceleration 89 years hits 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.399
 it's just amazing 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.890
 I believe that there is 98 in power of 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.180
 strikes and 98 years the ong shock it's not 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.009
 for nothing you can do long 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.450
 shot with him wood all you 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.520
 want it is really very very good 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.470
 in this area there at the level of the passes 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.160
 I did not do a lot you go 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.280
 to see that in 13 matches I have not 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.230
 finally I 'm doing three assists 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.450
 but on the other hand here it is very very 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.950
 good level exceeds even if it's not 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.110
 a lot of assists very very 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.270
 good quality on the way and that I you 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.460
 want a lot of dribbling 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.050
 maybe it's going to go fishing a bit 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.820
 more ie it is very very 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.230
 good technical gesture he very good 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.360
 agility he connects quickly 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.500
 the only thing is that he only has three 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.730
 stars in technical gesture 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.050
 then you will tell me yeah but 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.700
 three stars is enough for the 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.080
 midfield yeah that's enough 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.030
 for sure but it's true that 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.220
 fourth star in technical gesture 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.390
 would be welcome even if there are three 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.930
 stars governed technical is very 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.510
 correct 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.520
 then in defense frankly me I 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.420
 the beloved we like it i tested a little bit 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.210
 in a word but it is still 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.350
 best MC I found in defense he 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.360
 was very very good besides I you 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.220
 have put some phases like this one of 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.900
 recovery or there I get the ball 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.400
 I am a small technical gesture I will 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.140
 to strike is very dangerous 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.060
 unfortunately the guardian and above 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.470
 but it's very dangerous so not bad 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.300
 recovery phases anyway 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.370
 in this review and at the level of 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.290
 head sees what I told you 70-80 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.490
 is we could believe that with his little 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.650
 80 meter 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.390
 he is not very good but if he is very 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.980
 very good a big plus too 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.300
 for this player it is his performance 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.530
 so this purr it's true that 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.240
 if it's a little bit incredible it's up to 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.100
 to say that he is good in performance because 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.290
 that he's high-performing in attack and 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.780
 high returns in defense are they going and 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.340
 concretely everywhere it is everywhere 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.700
 see him in all areas of play one 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.320
 really sees it everywhere concretely 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.880
 go left he goes right he goes to wholesale 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.480
 he's going downstairs he's really a player 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.130
 perfect 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.780
 this is one of the best field environments 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.970
 that I could test it is true that I 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.830
 tested the liter which is very very good 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.630
 but hey it's not the same price when 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.239
 even because gulli that costs to 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.070
 around 2 3 4 million credits 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.709
 there is still talk of an arturo vidal 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:59.050
 at 241 1000 credits so there is a big 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:02.020
 big difference in terms of budget 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.060
 but overall it's a very good 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.040
 player here he may not be 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.170
 as sweet as gullit because gullit 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.190
 is maybe a bit more physical than 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.630
 vidal 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.980
 and more technical with his four 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.680
 stars a technical gesture but set to 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.080
 share that frankly here they are all 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.120
 both very good players and vidal 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.130
 I have a very good point for him 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.620
 at the level of my team so it's a 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.850
 team in 4-3-3 single with 3m was 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.670
 so third that of high quality 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.710
 Bottom poc do you are in and in vidal 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.650
 toth version at the stages of 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.510
 vidal so his thirteen matches 12 goals 3 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.670
 assists so still a very 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.900
 good ratio I saw better like racial 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.210
 but in any case it is a very very good 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.800
 ratio still more offensive than 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.780
 defensive I still found for this 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.520
 player even though here is defensively he 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.170
 is very good very present and recovers 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.110
 a lot of balloons and I like a lot 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:52.180
 so we're going to capture all those points 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.040
 positive the negative points of arturo 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.800
 vidal towards his friend so the points 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.300
 positive just beat he did 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.940
 no negative it while 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.620
 positive the speed that is really very 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.410
 very good good acceleration I have 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.450
 felt a game the hit I have nothing to 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.460
 to say in front of the guardian or that it is 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.350
 in front of the caretaker or at the other end of 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.240
 midfield this is all there 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.490
 goal time at the very very low passes 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.500
 good also dribbles very correct even though 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.850
 a fourth star would be welcome 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.590
 at the level of the defense and the head 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.120
 it's perfect here bah listen guys 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.250
 I think I said everything about arturo vidal 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.900
 do not necessarily listen very dearly for the 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.580
 quality player around 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.390
 200 thousand two hundred and fifty thousand on 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.340
 all platforms 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.660
 what is still expensive but enough 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.240
 correct compared to other players 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.590
 of the ton anyway here I hope 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.140
 you will have enjoyed this little video 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.460
 on arturo vidal towards his friend we 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.870
 found very very quickly for next 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.800
 video within booster remedies 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.800
 like everyone
