00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
bit more variety see i'll try to get

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.830 
bit more variety see i'll try to get
that<00:01:05.080> going<00:01:05.320> now<00:01:06.040> the<00:01:06.790> comments<00:01:07.690> that<00:01:07.750> i'm

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
that going now the comments that i'm

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.480 
that going now the comments that i'm
using<00:01:07.870> here<00:01:08.110> have<00:01:08.590> been<00:01:08.710> nerfed<00:01:08.920> a<00:01:09.070> bit<00:01:09.220> too

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
using here have been nerfed a bit too

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.920 
using here have been nerfed a bit too
because<00:01:09.880> they<00:01:10.120> were<00:01:10.180> considered<00:01:10.720> too

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
because they were considered too

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.360 
because they were considered too
powerful<00:01:11.380> against<00:01:11.980> infantry<00:01:12.460> and<00:01:13.050> i'm<00:01:14.050> also

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
powerful against infantry and i'm also

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.630 
powerful against infantry and i'm also
using<00:01:15.370> the<00:01:15.910> charge<00:01:16.330> instead<00:01:16.780> of<00:01:17.110> zoe<00:01:17.770> because

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
using the charge instead of zoe because

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.610 
using the charge instead of zoe because
over<00:01:18.940> is<00:01:19.210> not<00:01:19.420> nearly<00:01:19.750> as<00:01:19.870> effective<00:01:20.110> it<00:01:20.410> used

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:20.620 
over is not nearly as effective it used

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.410 
over is not nearly as effective it used
to<00:01:20.710> be<00:01:20.830> I'm<00:01:21.340> still<00:01:21.580> doing<00:01:21.670> fairly<00:01:21.940> well<00:01:22.060> though

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
to be I'm still doing fairly well though

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.750 
to be I'm still doing fairly well though
and<00:01:22.720> the<00:01:23.470> versatility<00:01:23.800> of<00:01:24.070> being<00:01:24.430> able<00:01:24.580> to

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
and the versatility of being able to

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.520 
and the versatility of being able to
like<00:01:25.270> you<00:01:25.420> saw<00:01:25.540> in<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:25.750> early<00:01:26.200> part<00:01:26.380> of<00:01:26.410> this

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
like you saw in the early part of this

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.250 
like you saw in the early part of this
video<00:01:26.710> take<00:01:27.610> out<00:01:27.790> to<00:01:28.120> sundra<00:01:28.510> help<00:01:28.840> take<00:01:29.110> out

video take out to sundra help take out

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.550 
video take out to sundra help take out
to<00:01:29.410> sundra<00:01:29.830> is<00:01:30.070> well<00:01:30.670> with<00:01:30.910> the<00:01:31.290> less<00:01:32.290> server

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
to sundra is well with the less server

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.530 
to sundra is well with the less server
power<00:01:32.950> against<00:01:33.400> the<00:01:33.460> infantry<00:01:33.850> now<00:01:34.060> of<00:01:34.360> course

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
power against the infantry now of course

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.690 
power against the infantry now of course
in<00:01:34.870> a<00:01:34.960> situation<00:01:35.140> like<00:01:35.440> this<00:01:35.560> I<00:01:35.980> would<00:01:36.400> do<00:01:36.670> a

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
in a situation like this I would do a

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.820 
in a situation like this I would do a
lot<00:01:36.910> better<00:01:37.090> with<00:01:37.450> let's<00:01:37.870> say<00:01:38.050> the<00:01:38.170> blue<00:01:38.500> shift

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
lot better with let's say the blue shift

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.590 
lot better with let's say the blue shift
I<00:01:39.100> think<00:01:39.640> that's<00:01:39.850> the<00:01:39.940> one<00:01:40.180> I'm<00:01:40.300> going<00:01:40.450> to<00:01:40.510> go

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
I think that's the one I'm going to go

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.360 
I think that's the one I'm going to go
for<00:01:40.840> later<00:01:41.050> and<00:01:41.380> that<00:01:41.860> which<00:01:41.980> is<00:01:42.010> the<00:01:42.160> same

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
for later and that which is the same

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.610 
for later and that which is the same
thing<00:01:42.430> about<00:01:42.760> the<00:01:43.300> mercy<00:01:43.780> which<00:01:44.020> is<00:01:44.290> what<00:01:44.530> i'm

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
thing about the mercy which is what i'm

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.640 
thing about the mercy which is what i'm
using<00:01:44.830> on<00:01:45.160> my<00:01:45.190> TR<00:01:46.000> max<00:01:46.330> and<00:01:47.020> also<00:01:47.320> think<00:01:47.500> that<00:01:47.560> i

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
using on my TR max and also think that i

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.130 
using on my TR max and also think that i
will<00:01:47.950> go<00:01:48.100> for<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.460> mattock<00:01:48.790> for<00:01:49.390> my<00:01:49.540> NC<00:01:49.930> max

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
will go for the mattock for my NC max

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.900 
will go for the mattock for my NC max
I'm<00:01:50.470> not<00:01:50.650> sure<00:01:50.800> yet<00:01:50.950> though<00:01:51.160> so<00:01:51.640> there's<00:01:51.820> been
