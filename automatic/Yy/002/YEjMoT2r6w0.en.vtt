00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 Welcome to the world games top 10 games 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.620
 2012 we come to the last 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.210
 three places in my top 10 represented 12 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.460
 really a fantastic gaming 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.840
 yes we had absolute top titles and it 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.030
 It was extremely difficult for ten players 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.619
 there was really so many top 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.779
 Titles we had had fun 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.420
 igge ko if action cool stories and 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.019
 a lot more laugh we start now the 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.510
 top three games from 2012 in third place 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.490
 hitman absolution for me is hitman 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.500
 absolution the best hitman ever 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.030
 has been made backwards in the block 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.280
 money third January agent 47 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.590
 Contact person at the agency completely 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.210
 sabotages the agency and puts 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.129
 hard on the public 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.140
 ailing picks up the agency and 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.850
 regroups to kill the neck 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.410
 recognize you and 40 should complete the order 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.360
 he will do that immediately 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.890
 after shoots and wounded jan 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.629
 but first hesitates to kill her 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.489
 Also he must had in victoria 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.710
 The proximity of the January attracts with the 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.690
 agency but what does not do 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.280
 must have interactive is managed 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.850
 to make it as accessible as never before 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.739
 before 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.570
 the game is easier but 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.339
 At the same time, all are hardcore aspects 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.799
 make as hitman to what it is 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.260
 contained in hitman absolution exist 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.790
 a point system that is more discreet and loud 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.860
 the pink you go the more points 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.780
 gets her for the mission you kill 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.700
 someone who is not the target 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.409
 gets him min points hidden but 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.119
 The corpse gets these points again 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.650
 best it is credited 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.450
 to sneak through the level and the 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.259
 killing a target so that's what it looks like 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.030
 like an accident 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.979
 so that you rang the pillar of Hesse 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.750
 Every area offers you 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.460
 different ways as he too 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.990
 want to do that means shoot yourself 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.970
 not always across the landscape 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.799
 but just throw her yours 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.810
 Parents, you can do just as well 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.159
 just keep what they do 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.259
 the higher degrees of difficulty almost 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.360
 difficulty is just impossible 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.950
 Pure is very violent there you almost have 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.000
 no tools and since complete 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.070
 although I'm on my own 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.509
 the new instinctiveness is simple 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.829
 great and relieved by the work 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.869
 instinct could be the time 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.530
 mark slow goals and easy 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.240
 to move away 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.560
 Here opponents see through the walls and 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.930
 you can see what your paths really are 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.549
 You can also be extremely helpful 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.500
 disguised walls just be easy on the 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.420
 watch over there watch 740 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.960
 a little bit aside and you are already 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.880
 by 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.530
 Instincts are replenished by him 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.060
 just a few wakes kill you 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.500
 There are various weapons to choose from 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.970
 which are distributed in the areas 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.470
 Of course, the silver too 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.150
 bar with the party and the 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.610
 piano strings you can get a knife on 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.740
 just throw them with axes colleague on 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.930
 brutal downstretching of the conject 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.970
 Mode or orders mode is new 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.650
 There you can create your own orders 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.870
 and orders from other players 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.459
 accept orders by creating her 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.319
 the mission plays and certain things 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.600
 marks as the target person 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.860
 or the exit beforehand you can too 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.580
 the weapons you choose 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.290
 should use 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.140
 hitman absolution is easy 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.640
 incredible interactive is done 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.950
 to make the game much more accessible 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.230
 but at the same time, the game always offers 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.370
 still a crisp difficulty 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.170
 without being fair 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.700
 you can be really creative 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.920
 either with your kills you are firing 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.830
 make you look like an accident 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.780
 becomes pointless with a knife so one 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.300
 nice sniper position and turn it on 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.850
 your goal is the possibilities are 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.920
 almost limitless the artwork is not from 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.080
 bad parents the glacier 2 engine 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.579
 There is really everything here that lifts 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.019
 absolution just got me into the 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.910
 said world and never let go 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.070
 it just makes fun with that 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.780
 bald guy neat to kill 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.940
 and that's why it's the third one 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.960
 definitely in my top ten 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.450
 earned 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:29.180
 [Music] 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.180
 is relaxation announced yes 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.379
 [Music] 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.930
 you first with 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.170
 Let's come to another title of 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.970
 is not in my top ten has managed 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.010
 mario party 9 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.319
 probably at the beginning of the year 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.330
 best parties ever you move 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.920
 Everyone is on a game board forward 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.629
 once with dice and on the 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.549
 playgrounds many fields distributed the 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.290
 either hurt you or you too well 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:19.040
 to come at the end of every round there is 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:23.630
 at least play a little after that 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:26.520
 makes makes nothing I will 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.660
 attracted goldstein 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.950
 the new part is not always one 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.110
 top 10 managed because nintendo the 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.120
 typical mario party formula has changed 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.280
 what is certainly refreshing is the 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.170
 time for a game has been shortened and 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.850
 that we are all in a vehicle 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.380
 I do not like sitting that well either 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.150
 bosses at the end of the prince but quite 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.190
 funny anyway also mario party only 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.420
 much fun 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.950
 be sure to check it in tomorrow 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.180
 Find out which game is up 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.180
