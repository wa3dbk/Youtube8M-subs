00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.940 
little tip for this look that the
magazine<00:04:49.040> said<00:04:49.360> so<00:04:50.360> the<00:04:51.170> magazine<00:04:51.650> says<00:04:51.920> that

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
magazine said so the magazine says that

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.280 
magazine said so the magazine says that
you<00:04:52.790> should<00:04:52.850> use<00:04:53.090> it<00:04:53.210> baby<00:04:53.630> pink<00:04:54.050> lip<00:04:54.260> gloss

you should use it baby pink lip gloss

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.000 
you should use it baby pink lip gloss
because<00:04:54.880> it<00:04:55.880> keeps<00:04:56.090> the<00:04:56.330> focus<00:04:56.510> on<00:04:56.930> just<00:04:57.770> your

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
because it keeps the focus on just your

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.510 
because it keeps the focus on just your
eyes<00:04:58.070> so<00:04:59.060> if<00:04:59.330> you<00:04:59.450> put<00:04:59.840> a<00:04:59.900> darker<00:05:00.380> lip<00:05:00.560> like<00:05:00.980> it

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
eyes so if you put a darker lip like it

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.500
