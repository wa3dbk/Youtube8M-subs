single<00:01:15.810> stack<00:01:17.689> it<00:01:18.689> uses<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.409> gas<00:01:19.740> piston

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
operating system under the barrel much

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.730 
operating system under the barrel much
like<00:01:22.680> an<00:01:22.830> HK<00:01:23.280> p7<00:01:25.220> has<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.630> nice<00:01:27.630> trigger<00:01:28.049> long

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
like an HK p7 has a nice trigger long

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.560 
like an HK p7 has a nice trigger long
enough<00:01:29.100> for<00:01:29.310> defensive<00:01:29.820> area<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.390> not<00:01:30.509> a

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
enough for defensive area so it's not a

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.149 
enough for defensive area so it's not a
danger<00:01:31.079> but<00:01:31.290> still<00:01:31.530> very<00:01:33.680> it<00:01:34.680> does<00:01:34.890> have<00:01:35.130> a

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
danger but still very it does have a

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.249 
danger but still very it does have a
manual<00:01:35.820> safety<00:01:36.060> much<00:01:36.479> like<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.840> Smith<00:01:37.079> &amp;

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259

and<00:01:40.890> off<00:01:41.100> over<00:01:41.400> here<00:01:42.350> just<00:01:43.350> flick<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.659> putting

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
and off over here just flick it putting

and off over here just flick it putting
it<00:01:45.810> on<00:01:46.040> taking<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.130> off<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.549> don't<00:01:47.880> mind<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.479> it's

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
it on taking it off I don't mind it it's

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.469 
it on taking it off I don't mind it it's
low<00:01:48.899> profile<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.829> also<00:01:49.979> has<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.310> slide<00:01:51.119> release

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
low profile it also has a slide release

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.889 
low profile it also has a slide release
here<00:01:51.720> as<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.960> can<00:01:52.110> see<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:54.360> other<00:01:54.540> unique

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
here as you can see the other unique

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.990 
here as you can see the other unique
feature<00:01:55.200> about<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:55.710> gun<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.790> has<00:01:56.969> a

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
feature about this gun is that it has a

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.969 
feature about this gun is that it has a
fixed<00:01:57.360> barrel<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.079> barrel<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.439> fixed<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.860> the

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
fixed barrel the barrel is fixed to the

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.010 
fixed barrel the barrel is fixed to the
flame<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.460> doesn't<00:01:59.790> recall<00:02:00.149> that's<00:02:00.719> why<00:02:00.960> it

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
flame it doesn't recall that's why it

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.740 
flame it doesn't recall that's why it
has<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.409> gas<00:02:01.619> piston<00:02:02.130> system<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:03.329> benefit<00:02:03.719> of

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
has the gas piston system the benefit of

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.350 
has the gas piston system the benefit of
this<00:02:03.960> piston<00:02:04.439> system<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.610> slide<00:02:05.969> is

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
this piston system is that the slide is

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.559 
this piston system is that the slide is
much<00:02:07.020> easier<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.439> pull<00:02:07.710> back<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:08.250> lot<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.209> small

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
much easier to pull back a lot of small

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.420 
much easier to pull back a lot of small
guns<00:02:09.810> it's<00:02:10.050> just<00:02:10.200> easy<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.649> grab<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:10.950> hold<00:02:11.280> of

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
guns it's just easy to grab a hold of

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.940 
guns it's just easy to grab a hold of
people<00:02:11.580> like<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.270> also<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:13.260> gas<00:02:13.440> pissed

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
people like that also the gas pissed

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.300 
people like that also the gas pissed
system<00:02:14.370> softens<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.420> felt<00:02:15.660> recoil<00:02:16.129> so<00:02:17.129> that

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
system softens the felt recoil so that

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.009 
system softens the felt recoil so that
that's<00:02:17.520> nice<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:17.970> doesn't<00:02:18.150> have<00:02:18.360> as<00:02:18.480> much<00:02:18.629> flip

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
that's nice it doesn't have as much flip

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.680 
that's nice it doesn't have as much flip
or<00:02:19.260> snap<00:02:19.560> as<00:02:19.800> a<00:02:19.830> lot<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.160> small<00:02:20.400> guns<00:02:20.700> again

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
or snap as a lot of small guns again

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.869 
or snap as a lot of small guns again
it's<00:02:21.900> not<00:02:21.989> tiny<00:02:22.410> it<00:02:22.980> has<00:02:23.129> about<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.430> three<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:23.790> a

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
it's not tiny it has about a three and a

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.509 
it's not tiny it has about a three and a
half<00:02:24.030> inch<00:02:24.300> barrel<00:02:24.830> I'd<00:02:25.830> be<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.010> little<00:02:26.220> smaller

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
half inch barrel I'd be a little smaller

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.030 
half inch barrel I'd be a little smaller
three<00:02:26.819> and<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:26.940> quarter<00:02:27.120> but<00:02:27.959> it's<00:02:28.650> kind<00:02:28.890> of<00:02:28.920> a

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
it is a new Walther it's kind of the

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.979 
it is a new Walther it's kind of the
updated<00:02:55.290> version<00:02:55.560> of<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.840> PPS<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:59.810> little<00:03:00.810> more

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
updated version of the PPS a little more

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.710 
updated version of the PPS a little more
ergonomic<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:01.829> put<00:03:02.340> it<00:03:02.430> against<00:03:02.760> my<00:03:02.880> PPS<00:03:03.390> and

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
ergonomic I put it against my PPS and

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.550 
ergonomic I put it against my PPS and
it's<00:03:04.380> no<00:03:04.650> heavier<00:03:05.489> or<00:03:05.910> really<00:03:06.840> much<00:03:07.019> larger

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
it's no heavier or really much larger

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.020 
it's no heavier or really much larger
actually<00:03:08.010> it's<00:03:08.099> a<00:03:08.160> little<00:03:08.250> smaller<00:03:08.670> in<00:03:08.849> some

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
actually it's a little smaller in some

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.880 
actually it's a little smaller in some
dimensions<00:03:09.540> it's<00:03:09.959> a<00:03:10.049> little<00:03:10.290> wider<00:03:10.560> because

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
dimensions it's a little wider because

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.890 
dimensions it's a little wider because
of<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.190> curved<00:03:11.549> slide<00:03:12.030> as<00:03:12.360> you<00:03:12.450> can<00:03:12.599> see<00:03:12.750> the

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
of the curved slide as you can see the

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.170 
of the curved slide as you can see the
centre<00:03:13.230> line<00:03:13.410> is<00:03:13.590> a<00:03:13.680> little<00:03:13.769> thick<00:03:14.220> but<00:03:15.060> then

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
centre line is a little thick but then

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.900 
centre line is a little thick but then
it<00:03:15.299> tapers<00:03:15.560> so<00:03:16.560> again<00:03:17.519> it's<00:03:17.700> kind<00:03:17.760> of

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
it tapers so again it's kind of

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.759 
it tapers so again it's kind of
following<00:03:18.209> a<00:03:18.420> how<00:03:18.780> it<00:03:18.900> is<00:03:19.049> but<00:03:19.319> the<00:03:19.410> taper<00:03:19.620> is

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
following a how it is but the taper is

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.289 
following a how it is but the taper is
nice<00:03:19.980> because<00:03:20.100> it<00:03:20.220> lets<00:03:20.400> you<00:03:20.489> grasp<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.910> slide

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
nice because it lets you grasp the slide

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.750 
nice because it lets you grasp the slide
very<00:03:21.540> easily<00:03:21.810> I<00:03:22.200> like<00:03:22.889> that<00:03:23.100> and<00:03:23.340> it<00:03:23.430> does<00:03:23.579> have

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
very easily I like that and it does have

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.620 
very easily I like that and it does have
a<00:03:23.790> very<00:03:24.000> nice<00:03:24.209> trigger<00:03:29.209> carry<00:03:30.209> gun<00:03:30.420> that's

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
back to disassemble and I wish it was

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.150 
back to disassemble and I wish it was
just<00:03:50.989> you<00:03:51.989> know<00:03:52.109> more<00:03:52.350> of<00:03:52.470> a<00:03:52.530> field-strip

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
just you know more of a field-strip

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.759 
just you know more of a field-strip
style<00:03:53.489> but<00:03:53.850> that's<00:03:54.630> one<00:03:54.870> small<00:03:55.230> complaint<00:03:55.530> I

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
style but that's one small complaint I

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.949 
style but that's one small complaint I
have<00:03:55.950> about<00:03:55.980> it<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:57.090> safety<00:03:57.480> doesn't<00:03:57.690> really

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
have about it the safety doesn't really

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.550 
have about it the safety doesn't really
bug<00:03:58.170> me<00:03:58.200> but<00:03:59.090> there<00:04:00.090> it<00:04:00.209> is<00:04:00.329> in<00:04:00.540> my<00:04:00.660> bunk<00:04:00.930> some

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
bug me but there it is in my bunk some

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.569 
bug me but there it is in my bunk some
might<00:04:01.709> actually<00:04:01.889> like<00:04:02.160> it<00:04:02.340> it<00:04:02.459> does

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
might actually like it it does

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.220 
might actually like it it does
completely<00:04:03.180> block<00:04:03.450> and<00:04:03.690> disconnect<00:04:04.109> the

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
completely block and disconnect the

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.990 
completely block and disconnect the
trigger<00:04:04.440> so<00:04:04.739> it's<00:04:04.859> a<00:04:04.920> good<00:04:05.069> safety<00:04:05.310> then<00:04:05.700> just

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
trigger so it's a good safety then just

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.780 
trigger so it's a good safety then just
you<00:04:06.780> know<00:04:06.900> keep<00:04:07.319> it<00:04:07.470> from<00:04:07.590> going<00:04:07.829> back<00:04:08.010> also

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
you know keep it from going back also

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.979 
you know keep it from going back also

of<00:04:18.030> mag<00:04:18.269> that<00:04:18.570> Smith<00:04:18.840> &amp;<00:04:18.989> Wesson<00:04:19.320> used<00:04:19.530> in<00:04:19.709> the

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
of mag that Smith &amp; Wesson used in the

of mag that Smith &amp; Wesson used in the
M&amp;P<00:04:20.010> shield<00:04:20.459> which<00:04:20.789> they<00:04:20.970> called<00:04:21.209> a<00:04:21.329> 1.5<00:04:22.079> mag

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.230 
M&amp;P shield which they called a 1.5 mag
because<00:04:23.190> it<00:04:23.310> kind<00:04:23.520> of<00:04:23.580> staggers<00:04:24.060> the

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
because it kind of staggers the

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.240 
because it kind of staggers the
cartridges<00:04:24.690> down<00:04:24.960> and<00:04:25.260> it<00:04:25.560> allows<00:04:25.770> an<00:04:25.950> extra

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
cartridges down and it allows an extra

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
they could have got away with this on

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.980 
they could have got away with this on
this<00:04:29.220> gun<00:04:29.460> and<00:04:29.610> maybe<00:04:29.700> had<00:04:29.940> a<00:04:29.970> nine<00:04:30.330> or<00:04:30.570> even<00:04:30.750> 10

shot<00:04:31.290> magazine<00:04:32.450> I<00:04:33.450> can<00:04:33.600> figure<00:04:33.780> they<00:04:33.960> didn't

shot magazine I can figure they didn't

shot magazine I can figure they didn't
it<00:04:34.380> was<00:04:34.440> economy<00:04:35.100> probably<00:04:35.670> that<00:04:35.910> mag<00:04:36.120> is<00:04:36.330> more

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
it was economy probably that mag is more

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.140 
it was economy probably that mag is more
expensive<00:04:36.840> to<00:04:37.080> make<00:04:37.320> and<00:04:37.620> design<00:04:38.060> and<00:04:39.060> they

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
expensive to make and design and they

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.400
