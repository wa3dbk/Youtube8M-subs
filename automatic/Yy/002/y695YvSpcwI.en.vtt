00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:03.230 
hi guys I've had a couple of requests to

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.150 
hi guys I've had a couple of requests to
put<00:00:03.440> up<00:00:03.560> video<00:00:04.009> of<00:00:04.339> the<00:00:05.319> frog<00:00:06.319> table<00:00:06.890> in

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.160 
put up video of the frog table in

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.300 
put up video of the frog table in
operation<00:00:08.560> this<00:00:09.560> is<00:00:09.710> just<00:00:09.860> going<00:00:10.040> to<00:00:10.100> be<00:00:10.190> a

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:10.310 
operation this is just going to be a

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.890 
operation this is just going to be a
kind<00:00:10.550> of<00:00:10.670> a<00:00:10.730> dry<00:00:10.970> jemel<00:00:11.420> I'm<00:00:11.480> not<00:00:11.660> cutting

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
kind of a dry jemel I'm not cutting

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.380 
kind of a dry jemel I'm not cutting
anything<00:00:12.230> right<00:00:12.560> now<00:00:12.590> but<00:00:13.090> want<00:00:14.090> to<00:00:14.150> give<00:00:14.300> you

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:14.390 
anything right now but want to give you

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.119 
anything right now but want to give you
a<00:00:14.450> sense<00:00:14.690> of<00:00:14.900> what<00:00:15.200> the<00:00:15.350> machine<00:00:15.650> looks<00:00:15.920> like

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:16.129 
a sense of what the machine looks like

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.400 
a sense of what the machine looks like
and<00:00:16.309> how<00:00:16.429> it<00:00:16.460> operates<00:00:16.970> and<00:00:17.240> how<00:00:17.269> I<00:00:17.990> use<00:00:18.199> the

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
and how it operates and how I use the

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.019 
and how it operates and how I use the
software<00:00:18.859> to<00:00:19.070> run<00:00:19.249> it<00:00:20.320> right<00:00:21.320> now<00:00:22.029> obviously

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
software to run it right now obviously

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.659 
software to run it right now obviously
it's<00:00:23.210> sitting<00:00:23.589> stationary<00:00:24.589> I<00:00:25.189> have<00:00:25.490> the

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:25.669 
it's sitting stationary I have the

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:28.899 
it's sitting stationary I have the
vacuum<00:00:26.570> table<00:00:26.989> I<00:00:27.800> know<00:00:28.220> if<00:00:28.339> you<00:00:28.429> can<00:00:28.579> see<00:00:28.759> but

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:28.909 
vacuum table I know if you can see but

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:30.999 
vacuum table I know if you can see but
I've<00:00:29.029> got<00:00:29.210> plastic<00:00:29.989> covering<00:00:30.499> most<00:00:30.739> of<00:00:30.890> the

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
I've got plastic covering most of the

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.869 
I've got plastic covering most of the
holes<00:00:31.359> except<00:00:32.359> for<00:00:32.390> the<00:00:33.010> this<00:00:34.010> piece<00:00:34.309> of<00:00:34.520> the

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
holes except for the this piece of the

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:36.910 
holes except for the this piece of the
particle<00:00:35.750> board<00:00:35.960> that<00:00:36.170> I<00:00:36.199> could

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
particle board that I could

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.310 
particle board that I could
theoretically<00:00:37.280> cut<00:00:37.850> and<00:00:38.149> as<00:00:38.719> you<00:00:38.840> can<00:00:38.989> see<00:00:39.019> it

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
theoretically cut and as you can see it

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.509 
theoretically cut and as you can see it
moves<00:00:39.559> around<00:00:39.710> pretty<00:00:40.129> easy<00:00:40.399> once<00:00:40.699> I<00:00:41.480> turn<00:00:41.750> the

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:42.519 
moves around pretty easy once I turn the

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:49.210 
moves around pretty easy once I turn the
vacuum<00:00:43.519> on

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:57.980 

this<00:00:50.220> is<00:00:50.430> rock<00:00:50.700> solid

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:57.990 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.860 

it's<00:00:58.990> pretty<00:00:59.260> noisy<00:00:59.470> I<00:00:59.890> have<00:01:00.400> a<00:01:00.870> standalone

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
it's pretty noisy I have a standalone

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.020 
it's pretty noisy I have a standalone
vacuum<00:01:02.590> motor<00:01:02.890> coming<00:01:03.430> that<00:01:03.580> will<00:01:03.670> replace

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
vacuum motor coming that will replace

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.050 
vacuum motor coming that will replace
the<00:01:04.090> shop<00:01:04.750> back<00:01:05.160> as<00:01:06.160> you<00:01:06.310> may<00:01:06.460> notice<00:01:06.670> in<00:01:06.940> one

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
the shop back as you may notice in one

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.990 
the shop back as you may notice in one
of<00:01:07.150> my<00:01:07.240> posts<00:01:07.720> the<00:01:08.470> shop<00:01:08.770> decks<00:01:09.100> are<00:01:09.730> not

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
of my posts the shop decks are not

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.440 
of my posts the shop decks are not
really<00:01:10.720> not<00:01:10.960> made<00:01:11.230> for<00:01:11.410> that<00:01:11.560> kind<00:01:11.800> of<00:01:11.860> service

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
really not made for that kind of service

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.170 
really not made for that kind of service
anyway<00:01:13.450> so<00:01:13.510> here<00:01:13.960> we<00:01:14.110> are<00:01:14.230> we<00:01:14.380> have<00:01:14.500> the<00:01:14.620> table

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
anyway so here we are we have the table

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.650 
anyway so here we are we have the table
obviously<00:01:16.180> we<00:01:16.300> have<00:01:16.510> the<00:01:17.520> various<00:01:18.660> motors

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
obviously we have the various motors

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.070 
obviously we have the various motors
they<00:01:19.900> got<00:01:20.050> the<00:01:20.940> let's<00:01:21.940> get<00:01:22.210> down<00:01:22.450> here<00:01:22.780> you<00:01:22.900> can

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
they got the let's get down here you can

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.760 
they got the let's get down here you can
see<00:01:23.290> the<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:24.870> this<00:01:25.870> would<00:01:26.080> be<00:01:26.200> the<00:01:26.380> one<00:01:26.590> of<00:01:26.680> the

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
see the the this would be the one of the

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.260 
see the the this would be the one of the
slaved<00:01:27.250> X<00:01:27.670> motors<00:01:28.620> the<00:01:29.620> x<00:01:29.860> and<00:01:30.100> y<00:01:30.280> this<00:01:30.340> is<00:01:30.759> y<00:01:30.910> up

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
slaved X motors the x and y this is y up

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:39.030 
slaved X motors the x and y this is y up
here<00:01:31.690> are<00:01:32.229> both<00:01:33.690> the<00:01:35.369> belt<00:01:36.369> and<00:01:36.580> pinion<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.710> z

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
here are both the belt and pinion the z

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.969 
here are both the belt and pinion the z
axis<00:01:39.070> is<00:01:39.850> a<00:01:39.880> rack<00:01:40.300> and<00:01:40.570> pinion<00:01:40.900> so<00:01:41.590> let's<00:01:41.800> do<00:01:41.950> a

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
axis is a rack and pinion so let's do a

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.830 
axis is a rack and pinion so let's do a
little<00:01:42.130> moving<00:01:42.580> the<00:01:43.119> software<00:01:43.570> that<00:01:43.600> I'm

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
little moving the software that I'm

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.719 
little moving the software that I'm
using<00:01:44.050> is<00:01:44.410> Mach<00:01:44.740> 3<00:01:45.330> I<00:01:46.330> use<00:01:47.020> it<00:01:47.200> also<00:01:47.590> for<00:01:47.950> a<00:01:47.979> I

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
using is Mach 3 I use it also for a I

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.380 
using is Mach 3 I use it also for a I
have<00:01:49.240> a<00:01:49.330> CNC<00:01:50.280> plasma<00:01:51.280> table<00:01:51.910> over<00:01:52.119> here<00:01:52.150> it's

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
have a CNC plasma table over here it's

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.700 
have a CNC plasma table over here it's
covered<00:01:52.750> right<00:01:52.900> now<00:01:53.080> but<00:01:53.229> there's<00:01:53.410> a<00:01:53.470> water

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
covered right now but there's a water

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.609 
covered right now but there's a water
bed<00:01:53.950> under<00:01:54.220> that<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:55.479> anyway<00:01:55.869> getting<00:01:56.320> back<00:01:56.440> to

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
bed under that so anyway getting back to

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.680 
bed under that so anyway getting back to
the<00:01:56.860> Mach<00:01:57.070> 3<00:01:58.140> i've<00:01:59.140> reset<00:01:59.979> it<00:02:00.190> and<00:02:00.360> if<00:02:01.360> i<00:02:01.479> use

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
the Mach 3 i've reset it and if i use

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.570 
the Mach 3 i've reset it and if i use
the<00:02:01.900> keyboard<00:02:02.380> controls<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.190> cursor

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
the keyboard controls the cursor

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.930 
the keyboard controls the cursor
controls<00:02:04.000> I<00:02:04.300> can<00:02:05.200> move<00:02:07.560> move<00:02:08.580> let's<00:02:09.580> get<00:02:09.760> this

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
controls I can move move let's get this

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.120 
controls I can move move let's get this
thing<00:02:10.000> going<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:11.739> is<00:02:12.459> the<00:02:12.640> x<00:02:12.850> axis<00:02:13.390> moving

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
thing going the is the x axis moving

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.759 
thing going the is the x axis moving
it's<00:02:15.130> moving<00:02:15.220> at<00:02:15.610> a<00:02:15.700> slow<00:02:15.970> jog<00:02:16.299> speed<00:02:16.750> I<00:02:17.049> can

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
it's moving at a slow jog speed I can

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.729 
it's moving at a slow jog speed I can
also<00:02:17.950> push<00:02:18.459> if<00:02:18.820> i<00:02:19.000> push<00:02:19.269> shift<00:02:19.600> and<00:02:19.870> then<00:02:20.560> the

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
also push if i push shift and then the

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.080 
also push if i push shift and then the
arrow<00:02:21.299> it<00:02:22.299> moves<00:02:22.540> fair<00:02:23.230> bit<00:02:23.440> quicker<00:02:23.769> in<00:02:24.160> any

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
arrow it moves fair bit quicker in any

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.340 
arrow it moves fair bit quicker in any
axis<00:02:25.690> and<00:02:26.160> also<00:02:27.160> move<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.370> white<00:02:27.760> of<00:02:28.350> forward

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
axis and also move the white of forward

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.460 
axis and also move the white of forward
and<00:02:29.470> back

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.920 

you<00:02:33.010> get<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.220> sense<00:02:33.460> it's<00:02:33.730> pretty<00:02:33.970> smooth<00:02:34.330> you

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
you get a sense it's pretty smooth you

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.290 
you get a sense it's pretty smooth you
know<00:02:35.020> mean<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.290> operation<00:02:35.890> has<00:02:36.070> been<00:02:36.300> quite

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
know mean the operation has been quite

reliable<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:39.670> z-axis<00:02:40.090> is<00:02:40.810> very<00:02:41.740> hard<00:02:42.040> to<00:02:42.160> do

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
reliable the z-axis is very hard to do

with<00:02:42.400> one<00:02:42.610> hand<00:02:42.910> on<00:02:43.090> this<00:02:43.240> keyboard<00:02:43.540> but<00:02:44.050> it<00:02:44.400> it

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
with one hand on this keyboard but it it

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.240 
with one hand on this keyboard but it it
moves<00:02:46.170> obviously<00:02:47.170> with<00:02:47.350> the<00:02:47.470> rack<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:47.710> pinion

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
moves obviously with the rack and pinion

moves obviously with the rack and pinion
right<00:02:48.910> now<00:02:49.540> what<00:02:49.720> you<00:02:49.870> see<00:02:50.110> here<00:02:50.410> is<00:02:50.470> the

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
right now what you see here is the

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.310 
right now what you see here is the
there's<00:02:51.460> a<00:02:51.610> partially<00:02:52.360> constructed<00:02:52.690> dust

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320

boot<00:02:53.670> this<00:02:54.670> is<00:02:54.820> one<00:02:55.000> of<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.180> parts<00:02:55.600> that<00:02:55.690> I<00:02:55.840> cut

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
boot this is one of the parts that I cut

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.290 
boot this is one of the parts that I cut
I<00:02:56.350> cut<00:02:57.310> a<00:02:57.340> couple<00:02:57.550> of<00:02:57.820> them<00:02:58.000> just

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
I cut a couple of them just

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.100 
I cut a couple of them just
experimentally<00:03:00.150> did<00:03:01.150> a<00:03:01.180> real<00:03:01.510> nice<00:03:01.720> cutting

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
experimentally did a real nice cutting

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.790 
experimentally did a real nice cutting
job<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.650> accuracy<00:03:03.250> has<00:03:03.400> been<00:03:03.580> terrific<00:03:03.820> and

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
job the accuracy has been terrific and

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.330 
job the accuracy has been terrific and
this<00:03:05.800> part<00:03:06.070> right<00:03:06.130> here<00:03:07.680> took<00:03:08.680> no<00:03:08.920> more<00:03:09.100> than<00:03:09.280> a

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
this part right here took no more than a

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.540 
this part right here took no more than a
minute<00:03:09.610> to<00:03:10.410> to<00:03:11.410> cut<00:03:11.650> a<00:03:11.860> little<00:03:12.070> longer<00:03:12.340> the

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
minute to to cut a little longer the

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.360 
minute to to cut a little longer the
design<00:03:12.910> but<00:03:13.560> anyway<00:03:14.560> it<00:03:14.650> did<00:03:14.770> all<00:03:14.920> those<00:03:15.070> cuts

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
design but anyway it did all those cuts

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.800 
design but anyway it did all those cuts
and<00:03:15.550> then<00:03:15.640> I<00:03:15.730> decided<00:03:16.120> you<00:03:16.240> see<00:03:16.420> I<00:03:16.450> have<00:03:16.660> the

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
and then I decided you see I have the

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.500 
and then I decided you see I have the
magnet<00:03:17.260> holes<00:03:17.500> right<00:03:18.490> here<00:03:18.550> that<00:03:18.910> go<00:03:19.120> through

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
magnet holes right here that go through

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.290 
magnet holes right here that go through
I<00:03:19.780> decided<00:03:20.590> decided<00:03:21.130> instead<00:03:21.760> to<00:03:21.820> make<00:03:22.120> them

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
I decided decided instead to make them

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.940 
I decided decided instead to make them

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
little pockets animal if you can see the

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.100 
little pockets animal if you can see the
little<00:03:24.070> pockets<00:03:24.550> under<00:03:24.730> there<00:03:25.030> but<00:03:25.870> that

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
little pockets under there but that

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.170

of material to the cutting I'll lower

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.300 
of material to the cutting I'll lower
the<00:04:59.750> z<00:05:00.140> axis<00:05:00.170> and<00:05:00.740> it's<00:05:00.860> going<00:05:00.980> to<00:05:01.040> be<00:05:01.160> a<00:05:01.190> little

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
the z axis and it's going to be a little

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.640 
the z axis and it's going to be a little
awkward<00:05:01.580> here<00:05:02.060> and<00:05:02.810> hang<00:05:03.080> on<00:05:03.290> i'll<00:05:03.440> deal<00:05:03.620> with

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
awkward here and hang on i'll deal with

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.880 
awkward here and hang on i'll deal with
this<00:05:04.120> it's<00:05:05.120> a<00:05:05.300> funk<00:05:05.900> this<00:05:06.350> is<00:05:06.530> not<00:05:06.710> the

this it's a funk this is not the

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.870 
this it's a funk this is not the
greatest<00:05:07.100> keyboard<00:05:07.670> for<00:05:07.880> this<00:05:08.560> so<00:05:09.560> i'll<00:05:09.650> lower

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
greatest keyboard for this so i'll lower

you<00:05:11.360> can't<00:05:11.630> see<00:05:11.840> it<00:05:11.960> but<00:05:11.990> I'm<00:05:12.200> lowering<00:05:12.560> the

anything<00:05:20.300> so<00:05:20.570> I'll<00:05:20.690> raise<00:05:20.900> it<00:05:20.930> up<00:05:21.140> a<00:05:21.320> little

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
anything so I'll raise it up a little

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.980 
anything so I'll raise it up a little
bit<00:05:21.850> and<00:05:22.850> it's<00:05:23.090> out<00:05:23.300> of<00:05:23.330> harm's<00:05:23.780> way<00:05:25.990> that's

bit and it's out of harm's way that's

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.510

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
but you'll get a sense of how it

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.860 
but you'll get a sense of how it
operates<00:05:51.050> that's<00:05:52.360> what<00:05:53.360> i'll<00:05:53.450> do<00:05:53.600> is<00:05:53.720> i'll

operates that's what i'll do is i'll

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.770 
operates that's what i'll do is i'll
push<00:05:54.110> cycle<00:05:54.770> start<00:05:55.130> and<00:05:56.120> here<00:05:56.600> we<00:05:56.630> go<00:05:58.660> you<00:05:59.660> get

push cycle start and here we go you get

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:01.920 
a sense for moving

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700 
back up a little bit it's doing it in 8

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.210 
back up a little bit it's doing it in 8
inch<00:06:05.970> passes<00:06:06.540> I<00:06:06.780> could<00:06:07.470> probably<00:06:07.710> go<00:06:07.980> a<00:06:08.010> little

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
inch passes I could probably go a little

inch passes I could probably go a little
deeper<00:06:08.460> /<00:06:08.910> pass<00:06:09.180> but<00:06:10.040> I<00:06:11.040> just<00:06:11.310> didn't<00:06:12.000> i'm

still learning the machine that's a

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.770 
still learning the machine that's a
fairly<00:06:14.490> new<00:06:14.760> bid<00:06:14.970> on<00:06:15.120> there<00:06:15.300> i<00:06:15.330> could<00:06:15.450> probably

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
fairly new bid on there i could probably

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.000 
fairly new bid on there i could probably
do<00:06:16.050> it<00:06:16.080> in<00:06:16.290> two<00:06:16.560> maybe<00:06:16.920> even<00:06:17.010> one<00:06:17.460> pass<00:06:17.760> and<00:06:19.010> you

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
do it in two maybe even one pass and you

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.840 
do it in two maybe even one pass and you
can<00:06:20.160> see<00:06:20.340> the<00:06:20.490> z-axis<00:06:20.750> now<00:06:21.750> it's<00:06:21.990> cutting<00:06:22.890> the

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:23.850 
can see the z-axis now it's cutting the

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:29.929 
can see the z-axis now it's cutting the
next<00:06:24.210> pattern<00:06:25.430> that's<00:06:26.430> the<00:06:26.670> outer<00:06:26.850> pattern

and<00:06:32.399> now<00:06:33.399> I<00:06:33.459> did<00:06:33.699> make<00:06:33.879> a<00:06:33.909> mistake<00:06:34.029> earlier<00:06:34.809> I

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:34.929 
and now I did make a mistake earlier I

00:06:34.929 --> 00:06:38.279 
and now I did make a mistake earlier I
cut<00:06:35.319> the<00:06:36.029> pockets<00:06:37.029> for<00:06:37.179> the<00:06:37.299> magnets<00:06:37.719> after<00:06:38.169> it

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:38.289 
cut the pockets for the magnets after it

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:39.899 
cut the pockets for the magnets after it
cut<00:06:38.469> out<00:06:38.619> the<00:06:38.799> whole<00:06:38.949> piece<00:06:39.249> so<00:06:39.459> I<00:06:39.489> had<00:06:39.669> to<00:06:39.699> make

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:39.909 
cut out the whole piece so I had to make

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:44.939 
cut out the whole piece so I had to make
sure<00:06:39.969> I<00:06:40.149> held<00:06:40.479> it<00:06:40.659> in<00:06:40.809> place<00:06:42.809> obviously<00:06:43.949> I'll

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:44.949 
sure I held it in place obviously I'll

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:46.949 
sure I held it in place obviously I'll
fix<00:06:45.279> that<00:06:45.489> in<00:06:45.609> the<00:06:45.729> next<00:06:45.849> time<00:06:46.119> I<00:06:46.149> run<00:06:46.449> it<00:06:46.629> if<00:06:46.839> I

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:46.959 
fix that in the next time I run it if I

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:50.220 
fix that in the next time I run it if I
run<00:06:47.169> it<00:06:47.289> again

that's the show and look forward to
