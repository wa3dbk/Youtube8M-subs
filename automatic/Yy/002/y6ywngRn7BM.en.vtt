00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hey people martin nice that you are back 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.540
 since and guests of honor in the cinema have us 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.849
 In the movie looked at ten billion means 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.820
 he and he went up the problem 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.960
 how to get the world population in the future 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.750
 so if you feed these then 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.470
 magic limit of 10 billion 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:22.710
 has reached people in this world 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.519
 and for those who know my videos or 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.769
 who know me 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.199
 I think we have no 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.650
 problem of overpopulation that is quite 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.180
 very nasty propaganda that there 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.950
 is operated in my opinion 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.070
 rather a distribution problem and a 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.129
 ask what we eat and how we eat 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.710
 to deal with the resources 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.910
 the point is always the customer to 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.649
 For example, now I want two 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.940
 points very briefly enter one I will 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.980
 just briefly mentioned on 1 a bit 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.230
 more exactly there was for example the 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.660
 proposal expressed work for example 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.510
 bayer works on it and other big ones 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.340
 corporations who want artificial meat 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.980
 breed that is the refer to the 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.019
 example in cattle stem cells like let 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.460
 you grow a solution 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:11.670
 yes and then are relatively good at the moment 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.470
 while these are already manage what 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.390
 Now the problem is where is 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.009
 that they would have to add fat 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.710
 a bit the consistency and 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.060
 taste but let them 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.070
 that already grow like in one 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.860
 blood bank practical and factor 2 or 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.850
 point 2 of the quasi as a point came in 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:36.030
 this movie was that you just insects 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.630
 as nutrition as a new nutritional form 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.790
 The whu could win for itself 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.079
 favors that because they are there because 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.229
 they just say hey man that you 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:49.079
 we could cover the protein requirement 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:53.369
 So in my opinion 22 were 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.409
 funny ideas for the now smart 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.899
 propaganda or for the already one 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.070
 little propaganda is done 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.290
 certainly one or two sheep 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.110
 Of course we do not fall for that 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.310
 that have enough card system no 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.600
 but you can already see, for example 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.000
 these insects the whole 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.750
 Tip sell as cool as disconnect and 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.510
 It's a fine food and that's how it is 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.790
 also that more and more tourists 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.620
 you can see on youtube then such 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.819
 Things to try this meat where 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.260
 the stem cells are taken and 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:30.380
 bred that I leave now 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:32.459
 complete link 1 1 point to the insects 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.709
 you have to look at it like that 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.080
 so if what they are fed with 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.720
 what a solution very very extreme 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.650
 one-sided why one insects at all 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.959
 I have not said that yet 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.690
 one takes insect gentleman finds wise 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.000
 Now insects are so great because the three times 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.530
 So strong is your biomass weight 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.030
 enlarge ago 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.890
 how the others use 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.690
 quotes, for example 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.670
 Swine cattle are a relative 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.069
 bad in the feed conversion in 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.580
 then quotes will be the 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.860
 first idea everything has to stop in 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.069
 efficiency and productions 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.959
 Everything is expressed in a march 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.480
 Poultry is already a bit better and 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.650
 the insects are almost unbeatable 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.790
 when it comes to this story 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.190
 and what do we have at the end if 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.930
 the insects, for example, locusts 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.549
 Scorpion some beetles in the 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.470
 fryers are thrown out of the pan 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.630
 with a lot of fat and end up 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.519
 a food with 90 percent 80 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.260
 percent fat is calories and the rest 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.850
 protein is the animal protein 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.470
 criticism and so on 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.690
 you know that insects exist 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.290
 mainly and I think everyone is 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.269
 clearly that is absolutely an absolute 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.970
 shitty unhealthy grocer 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.590
 would get such problems if the 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.459
 make people a base now 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.890
 90 percent fat would be calories heated 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:55.130
 transfer tz I think you know you know 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.060
 enough to know what's going on there 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.100
 it will be one or the other maybe 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.329
 a member market you do not have to 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.609
 with feldmann and you can do that too 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:05.150
 a few drops of lemon ale 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:09.739
 I have heard everything already 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:12.140
 try 400 grams or 500 grams 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.699
 Locusts with a few droplets 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.430
 lemons ajar sweated on 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:18.630
 Panning to eat is the cee that is 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.530
 which we also what you around there 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.560
 herb 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.200
 It is absolutely ridiculous I think that 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:30.750
 is clear to everyone that maybe for 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:32.400
 a few superficial people patrice 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.770
 or whatever or couple of people that 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.710
 because it's easy to be brainwashed 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.270
 as a snack in between, that's one thing 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.010
 Half grasshopper is as crispy 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.110
 sting okay but if you really think so 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.720
 imagine should there are a 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.600
 Low percentage of calories come from that 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.700
 absolutely not feasible to this 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.410
 two things especially at the on 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.550
 Meat looks for stem cells 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.380
 was won a quasi without 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.970
 artificial flesh you have it 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.030
 madness so much for the people themselves 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:03.810
 knowledgeable attracts you the new items could 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.650
 she wants to recognize very well in principle 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.080
 no one change 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.820
 nobody wants to change that's it 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.710
 crucial point the whole 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.940
 bad habits should 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.380
 to be kept 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.290
 you're just trying somehow now 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:19.729
 to find other alternatives though we 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:22.370
 really the very best 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:25.440
 have options in the home 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.940
 it can not be that it must be 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.350
 Do not be that production until it 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.780
 can not be the production 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.940
 Of course, it keeps increasing 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.800
 then the people are just fine 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.200
 how much can I reap in weight 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.030
 stÃ¼ckzahl weight ingredients 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.410
 No health care 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.810
 no sauces we have the 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:46.110
 Solution and the solution is a vegan 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:48.060
 herbal nutrition and it is always 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:52.140
 again the same point in principle wants 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.669
 no one really changes then the 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.650
 people say that was okay yes the whole 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:57.630
 fucking animals all over the zoo 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.160
 is all shit there with the with the 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.710
 we will not be able to bear that burden 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.720
 So we need some now 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:07.500
 gigantic factories on where we are in 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:11.669
 then redemption then the flesh grow 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:13.350
 let artificial and is just like that 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.810
 the point very briefly my mine 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.789
 my opinion and yes I would 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.780
 Of course, your feedback to be happy as 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:25.460
 you see that as insects above all as new ones 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:29.610
 source of food for mankind 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:32.180
 it is getting crazy the thinking work 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.910
 light on the tunnel was at the end 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.190
 tunnel write your feedback about it 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:40.750
 topsy people in this sense skin 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.750
 race until next time
