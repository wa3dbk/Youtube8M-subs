 as with subscribers on my channel 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.510
 it was enough that I know what they want to see so the Belgian did not 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.160
 so I did not take any chances that prices 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.400
 for me what is the best club of the type 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.400

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.310
 appearing these products can not be obtained 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.310
 of the team pass him because that's where I started 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.670
 but so far 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.980
 a little bit to patrol ps unfortunately leaves a lot 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.410
 I try to do 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.410

 three most popular ballets 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.400

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.670
 I am wrong 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.240
 those who have already gone out 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.670
 I would hate 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.339
