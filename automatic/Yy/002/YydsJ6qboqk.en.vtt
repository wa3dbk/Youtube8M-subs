scene<00:00:11.080> and<00:00:11.980> we're<00:00:12.099> going<00:00:12.250> to<00:00:12.280> take<00:00:12.490> DNA

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:12.700 
scene and we're going to take DNA

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.430 
scene and we're going to take DNA
samples<00:00:13.120> and<00:00:13.570> we're<00:00:13.750> going<00:00:13.900> to<00:00:13.930> try<00:00:14.139> and<00:00:14.200> find

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
samples and we're going to try and find

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.950 
samples and we're going to try and find
out<00:00:14.620> from<00:00:15.129> the<00:00:15.309> DNA<00:00:15.670> the<00:00:15.850> culprit<00:00:16.330> I<00:00:16.540> want<00:00:16.869> you

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:16.960 
out from the DNA the culprit I want you

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.269 
out from the DNA the culprit I want you
to<00:00:17.110> tell<00:00:17.320> me<00:00:17.439> where<00:00:17.560> you<00:00:17.680> think<00:00:17.950> you<00:00:18.070> might<00:00:18.250> be

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.279 
to tell me where you think you might be

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:19.710 
to tell me where you think you might be
able<00:00:18.430> to<00:00:18.550> find<00:00:18.759> DNA<00:00:18.970> which<00:00:19.300> would<00:00:19.450> be<00:00:19.540> useful

whose whose blood is it likely to be is
there<00:00:24.009> anything<00:00:24.250> in<00:00:24.400> the<00:00:24.490> room<00:00:24.640> which<00:00:24.760> might

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
there anything in the room which might

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000 
there anything in the room which might
suggest<00:00:25.269> you<00:00:25.720> that<00:00:26.439> there<00:00:26.560> might<00:00:26.680> be<00:00:26.710> another

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.010 
suggest you that there might be another

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.880 
suggest you that there might be another
sample<00:00:27.430> of<00:00:27.519> DNA<00:00:27.849> somewhere<00:00:28.359> else<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.650> take

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
sample of DNA somewhere else so take

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.430 
sample of DNA somewhere else so take
some<00:00:33.129> from<00:00:33.250> the<00:00:33.370> couch<00:00:33.580> a<00:00:34.170> little<00:00:35.170> snippet

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
some from the couch a little snippet

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.110 
some from the couch a little snippet
from<00:00:35.620> the<00:00:35.769> floor<00:00:38.699> protect<00:00:39.699> the<00:00:39.760> samples

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
from the floor protect the samples

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.530 
from the floor protect the samples
downstairs<00:00:40.570> we're<00:00:41.469> going<00:00:41.649> to<00:00:41.739> put<00:00:41.920> the<00:00:42.040> DNA

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
downstairs we're going to put the DNA

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.310 
downstairs we're going to put the DNA
into<00:00:43.540> a<00:00:44.550> gel<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.780> we're<00:00:46.930> going<00:00:47.079> to<00:00:47.110> do<00:00:47.289> a

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
into a gel and we're going to do a

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.310 
into a gel and we're going to do a
process<00:00:47.590> called<00:00:47.829> electrophoresis<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:50.079> we

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
process called electrophoresis so we

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.760 
process called electrophoresis so we
pass<00:00:50.620> a<00:00:50.920> current<00:00:51.160> through<00:00:51.489> the<00:00:52.090> DNA<00:00:52.510> on<00:00:52.780> a<00:00:53.500> lump

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
pass a current through the DNA on a lump

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.590 
pass a current through the DNA on a lump
of<00:00:53.890> jelly<00:00:54.160> and<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:55.510> heavier<00:00:55.960> the<00:00:56.100> DNA<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:58.270> sir

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
of jelly and the heavier the DNA the sir

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.310 
of jelly and the heavier the DNA the sir
it<00:00:58.870> will<00:00:59.050> move<00:00:59.260> down<00:01:00.070> the<00:01:00.250> gel<00:01:00.489> and<00:01:00.870> each<00:01:01.870> of<00:01:02.140> us

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
it will move down the gel and each of us

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.060 
it will move down the gel and each of us
you<00:01:02.800> you<00:01:03.250> you<00:01:03.760> me<00:01:04.270> you<00:01:04.750> always<00:01:05.170> have<00:01:06.039> a

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
you you you me you always have a

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.310 
you you you me you always have a
slightly<00:01:06.399> different<00:01:06.550> DNA<00:01:07.119> so<00:01:07.780> we<00:01:07.930> will<00:01:08.080> see

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
slightly different DNA so we will see

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.950 
slightly different DNA so we will see
different<00:01:08.830> bands<00:01:09.509> for<00:01:10.509> different<00:01:10.780> people

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
different bands for different people

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.630 
different bands for different people
we're<00:01:11.560> going<00:01:11.680> to<00:01:11.740> give<00:01:11.860> you<00:01:12.009> the<00:01:12.130> samples

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
we're going to give you the samples

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.669 
we're going to give you the samples
labeled<00:01:13.569> C<00:01:13.840> which<00:01:14.080> is<00:01:14.229> the<00:01:14.319> one<00:01:14.470> from<00:01:14.590> the

00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:14.679 
labeled C which is the one from the

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:17.040 
labeled C which is the one from the
crime<00:01:14.979> scene<00:01:15.340> and<00:01:16.060> the<00:01:16.209> sample<00:01:16.509> was<00:01:16.599> labeled<00:01:16.899> a

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
crime scene and the sample was labeled a

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.690 
crime scene and the sample was labeled a
and<00:01:17.259> B<00:01:17.380> which<00:01:17.590> are<00:01:17.709> from<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:17.979> two<00:01:18.160> suspects

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
and B which are from the two suspects

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.999 
and B which are from the two suspects
and<00:01:19.539> you<00:01:19.660> then<00:01:19.840> load<00:01:20.050> those<00:01:20.319> into<00:01:20.649> your<00:01:20.679> gel

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
and you then load those into your gel

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.559 
and you then load those into your gel
and<00:01:21.399> then<00:01:21.610> we're<00:01:21.700> going<00:01:21.819> to<00:01:21.849> turn<00:01:22.149> the<00:01:22.330> current

00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:22.569 
and then we're going to turn the current

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:24.690 
and then we're going to turn the current
on<00:01:22.780> and<00:01:23.080> it's<00:01:23.229> professor<00:01:23.530> Winston<00:01:23.770> said<00:01:24.220> the

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
on and it's professor Winston said the

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.279 
on and it's professor Winston said the
DNA<00:01:24.849> will<00:01:25.179> move<00:01:25.450> out<00:01:25.660> and<00:01:25.840> give<00:01:25.990> you<00:01:26.110> different

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:26.289 
DNA will move out and give you different

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:29.160 
DNA will move out and give you different
patterns<00:01:27.250> for<00:01:27.490> different<00:01:27.520> people<00:01:27.970> and<00:01:28.720> you

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
patterns for different people and you

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.559 
patterns for different people and you
should<00:01:29.380> be<00:01:29.500> able<00:01:29.590> to<00:01:29.740> work<00:01:30.130> out<00:01:30.369> who<00:01:31.119> did<00:01:31.420> the

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:31.569 
should be able to work out who did the

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:45.600 
should be able to work out who did the
crime<00:01:43.440> that's<00:01:44.440> done<00:01:44.679> it<00:01:44.800> I'll<00:01:45.190> tell<00:01:45.429> you<00:01:45.489> I'm

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
crime that's done it I'll tell you I'm

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.760 
crime that's done it I'll tell you I'm
really<00:01:45.910> bad<00:01:46.090> at<00:01:46.119> loading<00:01:46.569> gels<00:01:46.840> I<00:01:47.170> once<00:01:47.380> said

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
really bad at loading gels I once said

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.199 
really bad at loading gels I once said
to<00:01:47.800> one<00:01:48.039> of<00:01:48.069> my<00:01:48.250> surgeons<00:01:48.759> might<00:01:48.910> have<00:01:49.060> I'm

00:01:49.199 --> 00:01:49.209 
to one of my surgeons might have I'm

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:50.309 
to one of my surgeons might have I'm
going<00:01:49.330> to<00:01:49.420> come<00:01:49.539> back<00:01:49.660> and<00:01:49.810> do<00:01:49.899> some<00:01:50.050> more<00:01:50.080> work

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:50.319 
going to come back and do some more work

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:52.109 
going to come back and do some more work
in<00:01:50.440> the<00:01:50.530> lab<00:01:50.709> and<00:01:51.310> she<00:01:51.489> said<00:01:51.700> look<00:01:51.849> please

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
in the lab and she said look please

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.219 
in the lab and she said look please
don't<00:01:52.149> do<00:01:52.420> that<00:01:52.539> cuz<00:01:52.660> you'll<00:01:52.780> mess<00:01:52.899> up<00:01:52.929> all<00:01:53.140> the

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
don't do that cuz you'll mess up all the

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.100 
don't do that cuz you'll mess up all the
gels

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.860 

that's<00:01:56.500> it<00:01:56.740> keep<00:01:57.490> it<00:01:57.610> level<00:01:59.610> terrific

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
that's it keep it level terrific
