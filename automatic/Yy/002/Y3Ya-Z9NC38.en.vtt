00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:12.570
 it's more in the kitchen 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.519
 today I do not want for summer because 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.550
 that outside it is super nice 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.439
 that changes world version 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.029
 smartphone and I must say that I am 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.390
 a large deck board and who 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.800
 said at 10.5 ria today I offer myself 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.720
 twenty hours spent the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.849
 family who is super good 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.420
 poly gift for the ten who say he 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.270
 must from south to orange and sail to 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.730
 mas adria I would say that a rosÃ© 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.890
 or a red wine are going to be more appropriate 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.059
 I prefer rosich not a 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.180
 big fan of red wine 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.610
 so this rosÃ© that costs about 10 outside 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.450
 and who for the thinker 5 suits me 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.969
 perfectly 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.399
 and as for the fruits I have 3 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.030
 watermelon now an orange in 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:00.120
 do and we really take the superb mix 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.129
 in general in drink so I started 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.869
 by the non- watermelon verse in my 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:12.600
 great sin like these next but 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:14.340
 orange is it finally the chronos the 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.960
 musical Freemasons to fester on 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.970
 the top because otherwise the mayor and 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:24.810
 the arrangements crush them and 11 have 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.259
 poured liquid so really still junk 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:33.470
 currency exchange 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:33.470

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.680

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.990

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.049

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:02.750
 thirty minutes 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.340
 I had to force myself to take the 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:09.110
 gardening activities not obsessed about the 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.140
