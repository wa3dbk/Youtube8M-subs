so<00:01:14.640> after<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.150> have<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.479> mixture<00:01:15.960> all<00:01:16.229> nice

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
so after you have that mixture all nice

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.520 
so after you have that mixture all nice
and<00:01:17.000> dissolved<00:01:18.229> you<00:01:19.229> need<00:01:19.409> 6<00:01:19.920> cups<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.640> snow

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
and dissolved you need 6 cups of snow

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.950 
and dissolved you need 6 cups of snow
we're<00:01:22.530> gonna<00:01:22.619> dump<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.009> in<00:01:23.400> here<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:24.030> this

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
we're gonna dump that in here in this

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.140 
we're gonna dump that in here in this
bowl<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.619> then<00:01:26.580> basically<00:01:26.820> what<00:01:26.939> we're<00:01:27.060> gonna

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
bowl and then basically what we're gonna

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.330 
bowl and then basically what we're gonna
do<00:01:27.270> after<00:01:27.360> 6<00:01:27.720> cups<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.080> snow<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.890> we're<00:01:29.189> going

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
do after 6 cups of snow is we're going
