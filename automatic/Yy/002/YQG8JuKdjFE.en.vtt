00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
this is marksman with laptop magazine

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.880 
this is marksman with laptop magazine
and<00:00:03.330> today<00:00:03.629> we're<00:00:03.750> taking<00:00:03.840> a<00:00:04.080> look<00:00:04.110> at<00:00:04.589> the

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
and today we're taking a look at the

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.900 
and today we're taking a look at the
Lenovo<00:00:05.370> k<00:00:05.580> 1<00:00:06.080> tablet<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:07.490> this<00:00:08.490> is<00:00:08.670> different

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
Lenovo k 1 tablet and this is different

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.490 
Lenovo k 1 tablet and this is different
from<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:09.269> lot<00:00:09.300> of<00:00:09.450> other<00:00:09.630> honeycomb<00:00:10.230> slates

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
from a lot of other honeycomb slates

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.379 
from a lot of other honeycomb slates
that<00:00:10.620> we've<00:00:10.740> seen<00:00:11.010> in<00:00:11.280> a<00:00:11.639> couple<00:00:11.910> significant

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
that we've seen in a couple significant

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.600 
that we've seen in a couple significant
ways<00:00:12.509> starting<00:00:13.170> with<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.769> display<00:00:14.190> actually

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
ways starting with the display actually

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.820 
ways starting with the display actually
this<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:14.820> an<00:00:14.910> IPS<00:00:15.330> panel<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:16.170> has<00:00:16.289> really<00:00:16.650> wide

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
this is an IPS panel it has really wide

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.349 
this is an IPS panel it has really wide
viewing<00:00:17.160> angles<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.699> it's<00:00:17.789> nice<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.240> bright

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
viewing angles and it's nice and bright

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.779 
viewing angles and it's nice and bright
so<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:19.020> lot<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.289> other<00:00:19.500> honeycomb<00:00:20.100> tablets<00:00:20.699> that

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
so a lot of other honeycomb tablets that

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.310 
so a lot of other honeycomb tablets that
we've<00:00:20.939> tested<00:00:21.180> really<00:00:21.630> wash<00:00:21.900> out<00:00:22.109> when<00:00:22.230> you

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
we've tested really wash out when you

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.630 
we've tested really wash out when you
hold<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.560> from<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.769> side<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.250> makes<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.490> huge

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
hold it from the side so it makes a huge

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.040 
hold it from the side so it makes a huge
difference<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.539> other<00:00:24.689> thing<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:24.869> you'll

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
difference the other thing that you'll

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.509 
difference the other thing that you'll
notice<00:00:25.080> right<00:00:25.350> off<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.769> bat<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.400> this

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
notice right off the bat is that this

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.810 
notice right off the bat is that this
has<00:00:26.760> Lenovo<00:00:27.720> launcher<00:00:28.140> software<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:28.830> it

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
has Lenovo launcher software so you it

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.130 
has Lenovo launcher software so you it
doesn't<00:00:30.090> necessarily<00:00:30.150> prevent<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.109> from

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
doesn't necessarily prevent you from

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.709 
doesn't necessarily prevent you from
using<00:00:31.410> honeycomb<00:00:32.070> as<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.120> but<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.570> just

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
using honeycomb as it is but it just

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.030 
using honeycomb as it is but it just
prevent<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.290> know<00:00:34.380> present<00:00:34.739> some<00:00:34.890> nice

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
prevent you know present some nice

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
into any one of these you can also

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.920 
into any one of these you can also
change<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.489> quickly<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:41.969> decide<00:00:42.629> what<00:00:42.840> you

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930

sense<00:01:19.290> because<00:01:19.830> honeycomb<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.520> sort<00:01:20.729> of

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
sense because honeycomb is sort of

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.270 
sense because honeycomb is sort of
optimized<00:01:21.810> for<00:01:21.990> landscape<00:01:22.650> experience

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
optimized for landscape experience

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.060 
optimized for landscape experience
except<00:01:24.060> when<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.299> have<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:25.070> orientation

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
lock on so let me get that off so the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.160 
lock on so let me get that off so the
other<00:01:29.729> thing<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:29.970> lenovo<00:01:30.509> has<00:01:30.600> done<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.020> make
