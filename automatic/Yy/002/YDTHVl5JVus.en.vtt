00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.320
 I'll show you a utility model 

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:08.480
 it's been a battery 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.869
 anti theft 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:16.390
 here comes based on these packages 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:20.810
 come in the instructions I'm going to show 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:24.110
 how simple to put it together 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.010
 these are the hooks are solvents of 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.090
 batteries 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.090
 5 16 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:36.390
 one is made on each side 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.390
 you have a bet on one here 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:45.440
 and another one like this is the battery base of 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.860
 your car 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.130
 Caramba 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.730
 there it is and immediately we have the 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.730
 accumulator 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.000
 in that position 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:07.920
 immediately we grab that chain that 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.920
 contains a nut 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.280
 he gets in that position and turns 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.979
 efe 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:40.899
 back by getting to the base with the 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.899
 top of the accumulator 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:56.869
 us and so on 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.860
 There is immediately that round that does not 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.770
 has a nut and we 're going rum or crazy 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:09.619
 he stays there 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:13.959
 and follow the continuous work 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.959
 so that more badly solid 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:26.070
 and so on 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.720
 and gets into the round that contains a 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.720
 also rotating nut 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.050
 Y 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.230
 once already subject to bush is the 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.040
 another hole in the crazy area 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.120
 you have in that position 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:56.510
 you put the padlock 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:03:00.530
 try to pass the padlock on another 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.980
 by another link to make it for greater 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.980
 security 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.940
 in that way that the part where you speak 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.240
 that is down 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.240
 you close 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:25.880
 it would be all that what I would give is very 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:29.740
 simple to hold the accumulator and tape 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:34.600
 and protects you against theft 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:39.610
 It's easy to carry 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:43.330
 instructive in its packaging also for 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.110
 that if the nest is not very intendent here 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.830
 it is explained 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.160
 in this 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.730
 it would be every moment thanks for watching 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.730
