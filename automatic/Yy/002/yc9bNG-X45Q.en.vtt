00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.560
 June 2007 an international team of 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.799
 French Swiss astronomers and 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.869
 Portuguese discovered what they claim is 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:14.160
 the planet most like the earth that 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:17.130
 it is known so far 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.380
 We believe that it contains liquid water because 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.310
 It has the right mass and temperatures 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.740
 have declared adding because of that already 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.359
 its relative proximity to our system 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.910
 solar 20 light years that super land 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.449
 It could be a possible future 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.490
 objective to look for there life 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:40.070
 alien 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.740
 s exorbitant optimism from the group of 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.920
 European astronomers plus other findings 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:48.920
 of supposedly promising planets 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.260
 that every time they announce themselves in certain 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.400
 shape remind us of the plot of a 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.530
 1954 movie titled the last 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.370
 surviving the circuit hits 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.360
 present our in show 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.980
 universe 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.340
 five minutes touring our world 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.619
 surprising 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.310
 an independent national production of 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:15.310
 rafael silva certified number 3 thousand 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.310
 664 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.250
 in that movie they mentioned the 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.800
 start a military engineer who 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.050
 I found in the last desert basement 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:30.070
 and very complex communications center 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:33.010
 5 km underground during a hecatomb 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:37.080
 Nuclear discovers that it is the only 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.080
 living on the whole planet 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.960
 with the latest technology and 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.080
 plenty of water and food 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.300
 devotes all his time to contact some 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.740
 sign of human presence in any 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.740
 place of the earth 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.100
 but through the months that then are 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.890
 years and even decades all their 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.410
 efforts do not lead to anything despite 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.630
 that analyzes and scrutinizes banks 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.780
 computers that work day and night 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.380
 without stopping in search of possible 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.380
 designs that could be interpreted as 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.380
 smart 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.980
 finally ends up accepting the sad 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:27.500
 reality humanity has become extinct and 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.500
 there is no one else on the planet earth 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.170
 the film ends with an aerial shot of the 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.650
 character surrounded by paraphernalia 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.710
 technology in its underground shelter 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.240
 while the plane starts to move away 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.570
 gradually to emerge towards the 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.750
 outside and then an open frame 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:55.080
 covers outer space 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.290
 there shine millions of stars suns 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.780
 remote and indifferent to the pathetic 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.650
 loneliness of the only inhabitant who still 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.650
 it remains on earth 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:13.069
 the dilemma of that character in the 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:16.190
 The film described already reflected in 1954 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:18.230
 that of the scientific community in this 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.090
 third millennium 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.989
 technologically gifted insists 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.390
 now more than ever they should have 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.659
 that there are countless solar systems 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.440
 with planets capable of harboring life in 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:36.500
 the vast immensity of the cosmos 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.410
 since the mid-20th century radio 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.530
 telescopes space probes stations 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.690
 orbitals and infrared telescopes 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.930
 satellites as well as observatories 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.780
 ultra modern land 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.750
 they scrutinize space in search of 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.780
 any indication or signal that suggests 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:00.920
 somehow we are not alone in the 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.120
 universe clinging to that chimera and of a 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.940
 time to this part 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.570
 said observatories constantly 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.700
 announce new findings in that sense 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:13.730
 as in the case indicated at the beginning in 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.370
 relationship to a very promising planet that 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:20.230
 it is only 20 light years away from 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.790
 distance is to say that a light ray 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:26.090
 traveling three hundred thousand kilometers 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.920
 per second it would take 20 years to 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.010
 travel there 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.500
 but and even in the case denied from 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:37.400
 science I managed to develop a vehicle 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:41.230
 space that travel to say 50 thousand 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:44.780
 kilometers per hour this would take you 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:47.060
 560 thousand Earth years in doing that 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.940
 improbable trip 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.270
 but there will be the human race for 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.550
 then and will be inhabited to that super 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:59.150
 land that astronomers talk about 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:01.450
 Europeans will not be that maybe it had 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.100
 reason professor michael hart 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:08.150
 astrophysicist at trinity university in 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:11.180
 san antonio texas when he said there are 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.280
 thousands of billions of stars with 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:17.720
 possible planetary bodies to your 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:20.720
 around but ultimately it's 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:24.860
 very possible that the phenomenon of life in 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:27.260
 the land is a unique accident and 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.280
 unique in the whole universe 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:33.139
 successful circuit presented our 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:36.680
 Unusual universe
