issue with this game is is the maps I

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.120 
issue with this game is is the maps I
love<00:01:30.729> the<00:01:30.909> flow<00:01:31.119> of<00:01:31.149> the<00:01:31.299> maps<00:01:31.570> by<00:01:32.409> Flo<00:01:32.740> I<00:01:32.770> mean

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
love the flow of the maps by Flo I mean

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.190 
love the flow of the maps by Flo I mean
I<00:01:33.460> don't<00:01:33.939> like<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.390> maps<00:01:34.630> with<00:01:34.840> that<00:01:35.020> have

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
I don't like the maps with that have

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.350 
I don't like the maps with that have
like<00:01:35.409> one<00:01:35.680> side<00:01:35.950> and<00:01:36.340> then<00:01:36.729> it's<00:01:36.939> a<00:01:37.030> narrow

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
like one side and then it's a narrow

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.389 
like one side and then it's a narrow
bridge<00:01:37.750> or<00:01:38.079> quarter<00:01:38.500> and<00:01:38.710> then<00:01:39.130> it's<00:01:39.280> another

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
bridge or quarter and then it's another

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.280 
bridge or quarter and then it's another
side<00:01:39.880> I<00:01:40.119> don't<00:01:40.540> like<00:01:40.600> that<00:01:40.840> bottleneck

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
side I don't like that bottleneck

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.980 
side I don't like that bottleneck
feeling<00:01:41.829> because<00:01:42.219> it<00:01:42.640> eats<00:01:42.880> people<00:01:43.329> and<00:01:43.750> being

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
feeling because it eats people and being

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.539 
feeling because it eats people and being
able<00:01:44.170> to<00:01:44.320> just<00:01:44.380> snipe<00:01:44.710> and<00:01:44.920> get<00:01:45.070> collateral

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
able to just snipe and get collateral

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.520 
able to just snipe and get collateral
damage<00:01:45.820> or<00:01:45.939> whatnot<00:01:46.090> so<00:01:46.450> I<00:01:46.719> like<00:01:46.960> the<00:01:47.140> flow<00:01:47.350> but

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
damage or whatnot so I like the flow but

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.100

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.770 
running care packages I don't like care
packages<00:03:58.280> because<00:03:58.970> they<00:03:59.120> take<00:03:59.330> you<00:03:59.480> away<00:03:59.720> from

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
packages because they take you away from

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.449 
packages because they take you away from
the<00:03:59.989> fight<00:04:00.200> you<00:04:00.650> have<00:04:00.770> to<00:04:00.920> run<00:04:01.100> off<00:04:01.250> and

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
the fight you have to run off and

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.310 
the fight you have to run off and
collect<00:04:01.760> it<00:04:01.910> and<00:04:02.030> then<00:04:02.390> on<00:04:02.540> this<00:04:02.720> map<00:04:02.989> the<00:04:03.170> map

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
collect it and then on this map the map

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.710 
collect it and then on this map the map
is<00:04:03.530> so<00:04:03.650> small<00:04:03.950> you<00:04:04.190> can't<00:04:04.220> really<00:04:04.730> get<00:04:04.940> away<00:04:04.970> to

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
is so small you can't really get away to

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.620 
is so small you can't really get away to
get<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:05.989> care<00:04:06.170> package<00:04:06.590> so<00:04:07.390> that's<00:04:08.390> another

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
get the care package so that's another

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.210 
get the care package so that's another
thing<00:04:08.870> but<00:04:09.080> I'm<00:04:09.230> hearing<00:04:09.530> so<00:04:09.709> many<00:04:09.830> people

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:05.129 
not good enough to jump on this game and

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:07.430 
not good enough to jump on this game and
string<00:06:05.370> together<00:06:05.580> a<00:06:06.029> real<00:06:06.389> long<00:06:06.659> kill<00:06:07.110> streaks

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.730 
even if it's three ducks in between all
of<00:06:12.300> his<00:06:12.539> three<00:06:12.779> kills<00:06:13.050> when<00:06:13.409> you<00:06:13.469> get<00:06:13.620> that

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740
