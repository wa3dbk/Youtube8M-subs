about WrestleMania 32 nights so here's

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.180 
about WrestleMania 32 nights so here's

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
how it Brock here's how I booked Rollins

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.950 
how it Brock here's how I booked Rollins
Rollins<00:01:02.850> would<00:01:03.149> still<00:01:03.359> be<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.539> champion

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
Rollins would still be the champion

Rollins would still be the champion
WrestleMania<00:01:04.379> 32<00:01:04.650> until<00:01:04.979> he<00:01:05.070> left<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.640> Brock

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
WrestleMania 32 until he left and Brock

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.670 
WrestleMania 32 until he left and Brock
would<00:01:06.060> win<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.390> being<00:01:06.900> cut<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.260> returning

would win it being cut the returning

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.359 
would win it being cut the returning
conquering<00:01:08.610> babyface<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:10.080> think<00:01:10.770> he<00:01:10.920> would<00:01:11.070> it

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
conquering babyface I think he would it

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.530 
conquering babyface I think he would it
would<00:01:11.490> be<00:01:11.640> something<00:01:12.090> extraordinary

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
would be something extraordinary

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.990 
would be something extraordinary
especially<00:01:13.500> if<00:01:13.619> it's<00:01:13.799> I'm<00:01:14.070> winning<00:01:14.790> or<00:01:14.909> I'm

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
especially if it's I'm winning or I'm

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.670 
especially if it's I'm winning or I'm
going<00:01:15.240> hunting<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.900> I'm<00:01:16.200> going<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.409> hunt<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
going hunting and I'm going to hunt the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.170 
going hunting and I'm going to hunt the
rest<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.009> my<00:01:17.130> life<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.640> I'm<00:01:17.729> done

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
rest of my life and I'm done

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.620 
rest of my life and I'm done
so<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:19.080> think<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.979> WrestleMania<00:01:20.430> 32<00:01:20.700> since

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
so I think it WrestleMania 32 since

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.350 
so I think it WrestleMania 32 since
we're<00:01:21.750> talking<00:01:21.869> about<00:01:21.990> women<00:01:22.820> one<00:01:23.820> woman<00:01:24.330> that

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
mentioned mark that was so important

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.600 
mentioned mark that was so important
because<00:01:30.650> if<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.979> look<00:01:32.130> at<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.400> baseball
