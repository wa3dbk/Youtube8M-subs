00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:08.429
 I still have a tutorial on copying 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.790
 machine 145 she copies precious 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.790
 blocks 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.940
 settings 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:21.990
 you will need a red torch 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:24.289
 Arm sticky piston usual redstone 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:30.029
 block block 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:32.790
 energy start you need to do 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:50.960
 short pulse generator which 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:55.829
 you can turn off every pulse 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:58.230
 I will dismiss on the one hand away by the way 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.969
 here the lever as soon as I click 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:05.159
 the generator will stop turning on and with this 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:10.890
 hand we make this design 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:18.540
 very easy to put the piston yet 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:21.200
 Plug-set as well so it 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:27.170
 need for more efficient work 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:29.700
 now we constantly connect the piston and 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:34.820
 insert common rails slowly 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.820
 neatly and answer two blocks already 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.119
 three blocks and that's when you don't 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.310
 did it cut down and again 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.840
 I put the goods let you 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.840
 will demonstrate it with a diamond 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:58.720
 greeted us connect sorry for 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:04.240
 lags just now the cop lags a little 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:12.040
 so put race 2 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:15.250
 and this is how Well Well it was a small 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.340
 tutorial subscribe put likes 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.060
 I hope you liked with you was max 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.060
 until
