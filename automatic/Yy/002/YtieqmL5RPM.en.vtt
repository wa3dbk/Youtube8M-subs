00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.010 
i'm diluting my sodium levels or
something<00:02:05.610> because<00:02:05.759> I've<00:02:05.880> been<00:02:06.090> craving<00:02:06.270> salt

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
but I mean it's been going pretty

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.280 
but I mean it's been going pretty
decently<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:16.150> first<00:02:16.450> week<00:02:16.630> was<00:02:16.810> pretty<00:02:17.020> easy

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
decently the first week was pretty easy

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.010 
decently the first week was pretty easy
I<00:02:17.830> mean<00:02:18.100> I<00:02:18.250> fell<00:02:18.790> through<00:02:19.060> it<00:02:19.240> like<00:02:19.420> nothing<00:02:19.630> I

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
I mean I fell through it like nothing I

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.120 
I mean I fell through it like nothing I
just<00:02:20.050> thought<00:02:20.380> this<00:02:20.590> was<00:02:20.740> gonna<00:02:20.890> be<00:02:21.010> a

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
just thought this was gonna be a

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.460 
just thought this was gonna be a
cakewalk<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:21.880> then<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.840> second<00:02:23.140> we<00:02:23.260> came

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
cakewalk and then the second we came

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.140 
cakewalk and then the second we came
around<00:02:23.650> usually<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.640> first<00:02:24.790> week<00:02:25.000> is<00:02:25.120> the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
around usually the first week is the

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.490 
around usually the first week is the
hardest<00:02:25.270> and<00:02:25.810> this<00:02:26.440> time<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:26.830> hit<00:02:27.100> me<00:02:27.220> on<00:02:27.250> the

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
hardest and this time it hit me on the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.530 
hardest and this time it hit me on the
started<00:02:29.500> creeping<00:02:30.400> like<00:02:30.610> really<00:02:30.940> rich<00:02:31.150> foods

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
started creeping like really rich foods

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.040 
started creeping like really rich foods
and<00:02:32.100> smells<00:02:33.100> we're<00:02:33.430> getting<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.940> me<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.510> oh

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
and smells we're getting to me and oh

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.340 
and smells we're getting to me and oh
man<00:02:35.680> I<00:02:35.710> wanted<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.220> save<00:02:36.550> so<00:02:36.820> many<00:02:37.030> times<00:02:37.300> but<00:02:38.110> I

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
man I wanted to save so many times but I

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.180 
man I wanted to save so many times but I
stayed<00:02:38.620> strong<00:02:38.770> and<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:40.890> continued<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:41.920> stay

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
stayed strong and I continued to stay

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.190 
stayed strong and I continued to stay
strong<00:02:42.490> it's<00:02:42.700> been<00:02:43.060> really<00:02:43.570> for<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:43.960> apart

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
strong it's been really for the apart

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.990 
strong it's been really for the apart
its<00:02:44.530> second<00:02:45.460> going<00:02:45.610> into<00:02:45.790> third<00:02:46.000> week<00:02:46.210> now<00:02:48.000> so

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
its second going into third week now so

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.120 
its second going into third week now so
I<00:02:49.420> guess<00:02:49.750> it's<00:02:49.930> just<00:02:49.990> different<00:02:50.380> every<00:02:50.890> round

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
I guess it's just different every round

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.630 
I guess it's just different every round
is<00:02:51.310> gonna<00:02:51.490> be<00:02:51.580> so<00:02:51.730> completely<00:02:52.120> different<00:02:52.590> I

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
is gonna be so completely different I

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.020 
is gonna be so completely different I
made<00:02:54.640> you<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:54.820> reload<00:02:55.360> on<00:02:55.720> about<00:02:56.050> day<00:02:56.320> 21<00:02:57.010> 22<00:02:57.760> or

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
made you a reload on about day 21 22 or

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.850 
made you a reload on about day 21 22 or
somewhere<00:02:58.390> around<00:02:58.510> there<00:02:58.900> which<00:02:59.560> is<00:02:59.710> my

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
somewhere around there which is my

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.710 
somewhere around there which is my
three-week<00:03:00.280> mark<00:03:00.550> and<00:03:00.820> basically

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
three-week mark and basically

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.630 
three-week mark and basically
freeloading<00:03:02.290> is<00:03:02.650> doing<00:03:03.100> just<00:03:03.280> like<00:03:03.400> what<00:03:03.520> she

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
freeloading is doing just like what she

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.030 
freeloading is doing just like what she
did<00:03:03.790> on<00:03:03.820> phase<00:03:04.150> one<00:03:04.570> where<00:03:05.020> you<00:03:05.170> loaded<00:03:05.650> up<00:03:05.800> on

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
did on phase one where you loaded up on

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.380 
did on phase one where you loaded up on
fats<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:06.930> fatty<00:03:07.930> foods<00:03:08.020> and<00:03:08.470> rich<00:03:08.680> foods<00:03:09.010> and

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
fats and fatty foods and rich foods and

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.210 
fats and fatty foods and rich foods and
just<00:03:10.390> to<00:03:10.510> kind<00:03:10.630> of<00:03:10.750> get<00:03:10.900> your<00:03:11.020> system<00:03:11.350> give<00:03:12.070> it

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
just to kind of get your system give it

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.060 
just to kind of get your system give it
a<00:03:12.310> boost<00:03:12.550> again<00:03:13.510> and<00:03:13.750> especially<00:03:14.560> since<00:03:14.860> if

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
a boost again and especially since if

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.070 
a boost again and especially since if
I'm<00:03:15.220> still<00:03:15.430> having<00:03:15.610> cravings<00:03:15.940> coming<00:03:16.570> at<00:03:16.930> my

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
I'm still having cravings coming at my

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.930 
I'm still having cravings coming at my
three-week<00:03:17.530> mark<00:03:17.770> I<00:03:17.920> may<00:03:18.250> go<00:03:18.520> ahead<00:03:18.550> and<00:03:18.670> do<00:03:18.910> a

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
three-week mark I may go ahead and do a

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.520 
three-week mark I may go ahead and do a
reload<00:03:19.270> because<00:03:19.480> I<00:03:19.660> did<00:03:19.870> it<00:03:19.900> on<00:03:20.080> my<00:03:20.200> second

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
reload because I did it on my second

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.980 
reload because I did it on my second
round<00:03:20.770> and<00:03:21.160> it<00:03:21.310> seems<00:03:21.580> to<00:03:21.700> really<00:03:21.850> help<00:03:22.270> get<00:03:22.840> me

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
round and it seems to really help get me

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.300 
round and it seems to really help get me
through<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.290> last<00:03:23.440> three<00:03:23.620> weeks<00:03:24.720> so<00:03:26.130> I'll<00:03:27.130> be

through the last three weeks so I'll be

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:34.280 
through the last three weeks so I'll be
back<00:03:27.490> in<00:03:27.760> a<00:03:28.300> few<00:03:28.360> one<00:03:28.600> that<00:03:28.840> but<00:03:29.680> anyway<00:03:29.980> I<00:03:30.010> know

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
program but it's really really worth it

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.910 
program but it's really really worth it

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
but because everyone's a little bit

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.029 
but because everyone's a little bit
