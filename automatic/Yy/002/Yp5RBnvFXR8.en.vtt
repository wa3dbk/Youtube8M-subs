 I will show you the issue which is very 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:14.280
 convenient commands in the console in order to

 facilitate playing in dota 2 you start eating 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.960

 very often miss coils so 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.330
 how not to know their exact range and you 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:20.040
 you have to direct billions of times or 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.259
 just throwing coils for nothing 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.640
 a profession here we remember what distance

 second victories and go and we 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.780
 forever remain before which we 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:59.040
 have chosen 450 we can safely 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:03.750
 use 2 coil knowing how he 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:08.759
 we are far away how much we 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:11.570
 enough to and grandchildren what time 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.570
 the distance is necessary 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.190
 it is very convenient there for example when you 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:24.170
 play puja and on the same thing 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:27.319
 steps and money we have to do before 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:31.269
 on klokverk or even about someone from at 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:34.930
 very handy command in the console many 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:40.390
 it doesn't seem like it 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:45.230
 okay come to you door and team and 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.959
 third team we will have no idea how 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:52.250
 useful not useful well incomprehensible at all 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:54.349
 what is it like you know here are the stripes 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:59.510
 on minibar mean new division by 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:04.540
 mini couple life means that 350 250 hp 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:07.940
 from one strip to another well if you 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:16.420
 uncomfortable both of these 250 for example are looking at 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:21.670
 we are 127 ron relatives go to the console 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.670
 prescribe dota 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:36.629
 dota fills the vertical 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:41.700
 marker and write how much we have at home 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:41.700
 127 we will register 127 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.040
 now in the game we need to say so 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:52.000
 it will show how many strokes 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:56.540
 enough for us to kill 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:03.790
 they just shut up the character 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:03.790
 poke mr 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.590
 for example fax 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:23.810
 Here he has a classic minibar to share on 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:32.610
 127 homes are only part of it is funny 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:35.010
 will be wrong and sorry for me 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:40.949
 slightly pledged internet flew out 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:45.169
 dota i wanted to show you sasha 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:49.620
 show, I wanted to show you 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:52.880
 teams now 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.880
 Aksa prescribe 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:11.920
 so here we have a fax melee 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:16.490
 and in the department show the division of his 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:18.110
 to the camp shows how many blows to us 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:22.720
 enough to sweep it away 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.720
 although hardly see 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:36.290
 Well, although so it has one measure and there is 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:36.290
 one of his division is our one because 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:49.400
 here so here so with 131 gpk departure with 131 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.400
 almost a day at home 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.470
 so ok 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:06.870
 Turn now I'll show you in short yet 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:08.729
 very useful commands and so now i am you 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:13.680
 I will show the very last very useful 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:16.319
 team for beginners she will be very 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.370
 useful here for example to drive creep 

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:21.539
 we have to press 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:25.259
 letter and then already on the kaypo salute 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:28.169
 him but there is a very, very team 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:31.219
 good especially well for beginners 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:42.889
 it will be very useful we leave in the console 

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:42.889
 write here is a nap pile 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:55.979
 Wright right click 

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:57.020
 as well as 1 go dota and see here how 

00:06:55.979 --> 00:07:02.949
 usually 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:05.020
 letter on there to conceive creeps 

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:10.430
 now we find 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:12.139
 around of course and now look don't click 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:16.639
 on letter p ' 

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:18.800
 and I paid it very well as me 

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:21.199
 seems like a very very helpful team there 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.800
 for beginners can not only for 

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:26.470
 newbies 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.470
 anyway it is very useful very convenient 

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:35.449
 I donâ€™t know very profitably somehow how 

00:07:30.889 --> 00:07:37.880
