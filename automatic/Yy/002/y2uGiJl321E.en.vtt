and<00:01:05.700> it's<00:01:05.909> becoming<00:01:06.210> apparent<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.840> has

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
and it's becoming apparent that it has

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
important part of conservation

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.020 
important part of conservation
photography<00:01:28.439> but<00:01:29.009> also<00:01:29.159> we<00:01:29.460> want<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.729> be<00:01:29.820> able

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
photography but also we want to be able

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.340 
photography but also we want to be able

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
messages back to the media so

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.819 
messages back to the media so
photography<00:01:33.780> can<00:01:33.960> play<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.140> huge<00:01:34.439> role<00:01:34.590> in

photography can play a huge role in

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.260 
photography can play a huge role in
conservation<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.640> we're<00:01:35.729> just<00:01:35.850> beginning<00:01:36.030> to

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
conservation and we're just beginning to

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.810 
conservation and we're just beginning to
tap<00:01:36.540> into<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:37.020> now<00:01:37.860> you've<00:01:38.040> already<00:01:38.310> done<00:01:38.549> some

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
concerns I've heard about is that

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.090 
concerns I've heard about is that

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:05.230 
biodiversity as much as we should you

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:06.540 
biodiversity as much as we should you
have<00:06:05.350> any<00:06:05.500> thoughts<00:06:05.650> about<00:06:05.800> that<00:06:05.980> that<00:06:06.430> we

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
have any thoughts about that that we

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.670 
have any thoughts about that that we

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
might be going for the easy maintenance

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.700 
might be going for the easy maintenance
of<00:06:09.130> forests<00:06:09.670> and<00:06:09.970> overlooking<00:06:10.510> the<00:06:10.690> very<00:06:11.050> real

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
of forests and overlooking the very real

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.340 
of forests and overlooking the very real
hot<00:06:12.010> spots<00:06:12.310> of<00:06:12.540> well<00:06:13.540> that's<00:06:13.870> been<00:06:14.020> one<00:06:14.140> of<00:06:14.260> the

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:14.350 
hot spots of well that's been one of the

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:15.780 
hot spots of well that's been one of the
concerns<00:06:14.740> and<00:06:15.010> now<00:06:15.160> there's<00:06:15.520> several

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:15.790 
concerns and now there's several

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.790 
concerns and now there's several
mechanisms<00:06:16.060> by<00:06:16.840> which<00:06:16.870> we're<00:06:17.440> trying<00:06:17.680> to

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
mechanisms by which we're trying to

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.830 
mechanisms by which we're trying to
mitigate<00:06:18.010> that<00:06:18.430> from<00:06:18.640> happening<00:06:18.820> I<00:06:19.300> think<00:06:19.720> the

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
mitigate that from happening I think the

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.450 
mitigate that from happening I think the
bigger<00:06:20.020> danger<00:06:20.290> is<00:06:20.560> not<00:06:20.740> doing<00:06:20.980> anything<00:06:21.070> at

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
bigger danger is not doing anything at

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.640 
bigger danger is not doing anything at
all<00:06:21.580> just<00:06:21.790> going<00:06:22.600> forward<00:06:23.020> without<00:06:23.170> taking

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
all just going forward without taking

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:24.860 
all just going forward without taking
forced<00:06:23.980> into<00:06:24.250> account

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
forced into account

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.530 
forced into account
we<00:06:25.080> have<00:06:25.320> done<00:06:25.530> so<00:06:25.800> far<00:06:25.830> I<00:06:26.730> think<00:06:27.150> any<00:06:27.300> step

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:27.540 
we have done so far I think any step

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:28.940 
we have done so far I think any step
that<00:06:27.690> we<00:06:27.780> make<00:06:27.990> in<00:06:28.110> that<00:06:28.260> direction<00:06:28.560> is<00:06:28.740> going

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:28.950 
that we make in that direction is going

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.530 
that we make in that direction is going
to<00:06:29.010> be<00:06:29.070> positive<00:06:29.280> and<00:06:29.730> we<00:06:29.880> can<00:06:30.060> iron<00:06:30.180> out<00:06:30.360> the

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:30.540 
to be positive and we can iron out the

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:38.730 
to be positive and we can iron out the
details<00:06:30.660> as<00:06:31.050> we<00:06:31.170> go

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:38.740 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.800
