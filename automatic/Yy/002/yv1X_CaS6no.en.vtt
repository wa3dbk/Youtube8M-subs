00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.980
 which will give his cut in small 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.760
 dice so that it is easier to cook 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:49.140
 then wash them take a saucepan 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:52.980
 put water in it so it's 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.410
 amount of water should correspond to little 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.719
 close to 2 2 to 3 times the amount of 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.300

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.780
 vis-Ã -vis the number of people they 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:12.330

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.840
