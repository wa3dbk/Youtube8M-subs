it puts up 365 horsepower and 420
pound-feet<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.740> torque<00:00:16.859> but<00:00:17.130> let<00:00:17.220> me<00:00:17.310> choose

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
pound-feet of torque but let me choose

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.840 
pound-feet of torque but let me choose
you<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.789> this<00:00:17.910> this<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.289> V<00:00:19.500> box<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.640> a

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
you to this this is the V box it is a

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.240 
you to this this is the V box it is a
performance<00:00:21.779> diagnostic<00:00:22.590> tool<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:23.039> lets

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
performance diagnostic tool and it lets

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.089 
performance diagnostic tool and it lets
us<00:00:23.460> be<00:00:24.060> very<00:00:24.510> accurate<00:00:24.779> 0<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.410> 60<00:00:25.680> times<00:00:25.920> and

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
us be very accurate 0 to 60 times and

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.470 
us be very accurate 0 to 60 times and
while<00:00:26.189> we<00:00:26.279> were<00:00:26.369> testing<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.910> V<00:00:27.029> box<00:00:27.269> we

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
while we were testing the V box we

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.140 
while we were testing the V box we
figured<00:00:27.869> out<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.849> acceleration<00:00:29.849> times

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
figured out that acceleration times

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.150 
figured out that acceleration times
differ<00:00:30.630> based<00:00:30.929> on<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.289> number<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.650> people<00:00:31.830> in

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
differ based on the number of people in

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.630 
differ based on the number of people in
the<00:00:32.430> vehicle<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:32.910> I've<00:00:33.059> got<00:00:33.270> some<00:00:33.480> ballast

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
the vehicle so I've got some ballast

is<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.500> most<00:00:47.070> accurate<00:00:47.399> tool<00:00:47.910> we<00:00:48.149> could<00:00:48.390> find

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
is the most accurate tool we could find

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.729 
is the most accurate tool we could find
copper<00:00:49.070> so<00:00:50.070> let's<00:00:50.610> do<00:00:50.789> 3<00:00:51.090> 0-60<00:00:51.690> runs<00:00:51.930> me<00:00:52.350> you

and all of us and find out how fast or

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.900 
and all of us and find out how fast or
how<00:00:55.020> slow<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.500> expedition<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.250> when<00:00:56.670> we<00:00:56.760> load

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
how slow this expedition is when we load

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:15.960 
how slow this expedition is when we load
it<00:00:57.030> up<00:00:57.149> with<00:00:57.180> some<00:00:58.039> ballast<00:00:59.039> ballast

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.550 

now<00:01:16.970> this<00:01:17.120> truck<00:01:17.390> is<00:01:17.690> a<00:01:17.720> truck<00:01:17.960> because<00:01:18.230> this

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
now this truck is a truck because this

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.380 
now this truck is a truck because this
is<00:01:18.650> an<00:01:18.740> f-150<00:01:19.130> basically<00:01:19.760> does<00:01:19.940> weigh<00:01:20.150> a<00:01:20.180> lot

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
is an f-150 basically does weigh a lot

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.710 
is an f-150 basically does weigh a lot
6100<00:01:21.260> pounds<00:01:21.590> and<00:01:21.680> I'm<00:01:21.740> about<00:01:21.950> 250<00:01:22.700> pounds<00:01:23.090> so

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
6100 pounds and I'm about 250 pounds so

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.730 
6100 pounds and I'm about 250 pounds so
now<00:01:23.900> we're<00:01:24.110> at

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
now we're at

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.300 
now we're at
well<00:01:25.460> 6100<00:01:26.300> plus<00:01:26.540> 250<00:01:27.110> I'm<00:01:27.440> going<00:01:27.560> to<00:01:27.650> leave<00:01:28.130> it

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
well 6100 plus 250 I'm going to leave it

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.450 
well 6100 plus 250 I'm going to leave it
in<00:01:28.520> too<00:01:29.090> high<00:01:29.330> I've<00:01:29.690> got<00:01:29.930> it<00:01:30.080> in<00:01:30.260> Drive<00:01:30.710> I'm

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
in too high I've got it in Drive I'm

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.100 
in too high I've got it in Drive I'm
gonna<00:01:31.670> hit<00:01:31.820> start<00:01:32.180> on<00:01:32.360> this<00:01:32.660> and<00:01:32.900> I'm<00:01:33.080> just

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
gonna hit start on this and I'm just

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.500 
gonna hit start on this and I'm just
gonna<00:01:33.290> mash<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.190> accelerator<00:01:34.700> as<00:01:34.940> hard<00:01:35.330> as<00:01:35.450> I

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
gonna mash the accelerator as hard as I

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.180 
gonna mash the accelerator as hard as I
can<00:01:35.570> and<00:01:35.780> let's<00:01:36.380> see<00:01:36.500> how<00:01:36.590> fast<00:01:36.770> it<00:01:36.980> goes<00:01:37.070> from

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
can and let's see how fast it goes from

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:50.420 
can and let's see how fast it goes from
0-60<00:01:37.520> here<00:01:37.910> we<00:01:38.000> go

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.520 

all<00:01:51.430> right<00:01:51.580> there<00:01:51.850> we<00:01:51.970> have<00:01:52.000> it<00:01:52.299> so<00:01:52.509> zero<00:01:53.439> to

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
all right there we have it so zero to

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.859 
all right there we have it so zero to
twenty<00:01:53.979> was<00:01:54.189> two<00:01:54.430> point<00:01:54.729> four<00:01:55.030> second<00:01:55.509> zero<00:01:55.750> to

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
twenty was two point four second zero to

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.200 
twenty was two point four second zero to
forty<00:01:56.170> was<00:01:56.290> four<00:01:56.590> point<00:01:56.920> eight<00:01:57.100> and<00:01:57.430> zero<00:01:57.460> to

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
forty was four point eight and zero to

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.370 
forty was four point eight and zero to
sixty<00:01:58.570> eight<00:01:58.840> point<00:01:59.439> three<00:02:00.189> seconds<00:02:01.060> so<00:02:01.380> I

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
sixty eight point three seconds so I

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.950 
sixty eight point three seconds so I
wonder<00:02:02.649> how<00:02:02.770> fast<00:02:03.070> it'll<00:02:03.310> be<00:02:03.549> when<00:02:04.360> I<00:02:04.600> get<00:02:04.659> some

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
wonder how fast it'll be when I get some

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.410 
wonder how fast it'll be when I get some
ballast<00:02:05.320> in<00:02:05.470> here<00:02:05.740> I<00:02:05.890> keep<00:02:06.369> in<00:02:06.549> mind<00:02:06.729> we<00:02:06.880> are<00:02:06.909> at

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
ballast in here I keep in mind we are at

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.880 
ballast in here I keep in mind we are at
a<00:02:07.479> mile<00:02:07.780> above<00:02:08.050> sea<00:02:08.110> level<00:02:08.319> which<00:02:08.709> means

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
a mile above sea level which means

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.830 
a mile above sea level which means
there's<00:02:09.220> less<00:02:09.489> air<00:02:09.940> density<00:02:10.179> which<00:02:10.600> means

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
there's less air density which means

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.840 
there's less air density which means
there's<00:02:11.709> basically<00:02:12.190> less<00:02:12.400> power

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
there's basically less power

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.540 
there's basically less power
even<00:02:13.090> though<00:02:13.209> turbos<00:02:13.660> do<00:02:13.900> help<00:02:14.170> make<00:02:14.920> up<00:02:15.130> for

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
even though turbos do help make up for

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.910 
even though turbos do help make up for
that<00:02:15.930> it's<00:02:16.930> still<00:02:17.260> not<00:02:18.000> as<00:02:19.290> much<00:02:20.290> power<00:02:20.620> as<00:02:20.769> you

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
that it's still not as much power as you

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.970 
that it's still not as much power as you
