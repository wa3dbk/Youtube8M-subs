its matte texture just blend together

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.910 
its matte texture just blend together
very<00:01:14.490> nicely<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:15.270> mean<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.080> colors<00:01:16.409> do<00:01:16.619> match

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
very nicely I mean the colors do match

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.880 
very nicely I mean the colors do match
but<00:01:17.340> they<00:01:18.090> do<00:01:18.150> have<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> different<00:01:19.229> lightness

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890

to<00:01:19.920> them<00:01:20.250> once<00:01:20.909> darker<00:01:21.420> than<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.750> other<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.710> it

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
to them once darker than the other so it

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.789 
to them once darker than the other so it
just<00:01:23.040> gives<00:01:23.250> off<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.580> nice<00:01:23.759> two-tone<00:01:24.270> look

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799
