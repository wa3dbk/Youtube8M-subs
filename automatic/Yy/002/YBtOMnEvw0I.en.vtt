00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
had one so there are two sides as this

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.100 
had one so there are two sides as this
size<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.430> like<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:06.259> large<00:02:07.259> size<00:02:07.649> but<00:02:09.020> just<00:02:10.020> keep

colors<00:02:23.590> for<00:02:23.620> this<00:02:23.950> thing<00:02:24.189> you<00:02:24.489> could<00:02:24.670> you<00:02:25.120> know

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
colors for this thing you could you know

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.860 
colors for this thing you could you know
Titan<00:02:26.709> pretty<00:02:26.950> much<00:02:27.129> anything<00:02:27.719> but<00:02:28.719> we'll

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
Titan pretty much anything but we'll

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.039 
Titan pretty much anything but we'll

know they're not going anywhere trim
these<00:03:49.840> off<00:03:52.019> make<00:03:53.019> it<00:03:53.199> nicely<00:03:53.409> taper<00:03:53.919> the<00:03:54.159> head

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
these off make it nicely taper the head

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.809 
these off make it nicely taper the head
here<00:03:54.819> and<00:03:55.169> that's<00:03:56.169> something<00:03:56.439> a<00:03:56.919> lot<00:03:57.790> of

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
here and that's something a lot of

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.309 
here and that's something a lot of
people<00:03:57.909> don't<00:03:58.239> understand<00:03:58.689> what<00:03:58.870> fly<00:03:59.019> tying

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
people don't understand what fly tying

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.339 
people don't understand what fly tying
is<00:03:59.530> it<00:03:59.709> you<00:04:00.280> control<00:04:00.819> you<00:04:01.750> know<00:04:01.810> fly<00:04:02.109> tying

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
is it you control you know fly tying

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:04.770 
is it you control you know fly tying
isn't<00:04:02.620> necessarily<00:04:03.009> exactly<00:04:03.400> about<00:04:03.790> learning

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
isn't necessarily exactly about learning

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.860 
isn't necessarily exactly about learning
how<00:04:04.930> to<00:04:05.049> tie<00:04:05.259> individual<00:04:05.799> patterns<00:04:06.040> it's<00:04:06.519> more

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
how to tie individual patterns it's more

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.539 
how to tie individual patterns it's more
learning<00:04:07.870> the<00:04:08.079> behavior<00:04:08.560> of<00:04:08.590> materials<00:04:08.829> like

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
about how the materials act then you

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.790 
about how the materials act then you
