primary model of set four four zero two

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.959 
primary model of set four four zero two
and<00:00:12.450> four<00:00:13.200> four<00:00:13.410> zero<00:00:13.440> two<00:00:13.710> was<00:00:14.099> released<00:00:14.280> in

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969

2003 and the kit has 547 pieces now this
like<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:22.080> said<00:00:22.320> in<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.830> video<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.400> released

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
like I said in the video that I released

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.500 
like I said in the video that I released
a<00:00:24.269> few<00:00:24.390> days<00:00:24.449> ago<00:00:24.600> on<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.789> jet<00:00:26.789> ski<00:00:27.029> which<00:00:27.300> I

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
a few days ago on the jet ski which I

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.759 
a few days ago on the jet ski which I
will<00:00:27.720> link<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:28.140> right<00:00:28.320> here

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
will link to it right here

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.089 
will link to it right here
it's<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.660> designer<00:00:31.019> series<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.650> lot<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.070> a

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
it's the designer series is a lot is a

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.280 
it's the designer series is a lot is a
precursor<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.270> creator<00:00:33.690> series<00:00:33.960> and

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
precursor to the creator series and

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.410 
precursor to the creator series and
isn't<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.559> lot<00:00:34.739> like<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.340> creator<00:00:35.700> series<00:00:36.239> in

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
isn't a lot like the creator series in

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.530 
isn't a lot like the creator series in
that<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.110> offers<00:00:37.469> three<00:00:37.800> different<00:00:37.829> builds<00:00:38.540> so

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
that it offers three different builds so

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.299 
that it offers three different builds so
the<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:40.140> offers<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.620> easy<00:00:40.770> build<00:00:41.070> which<00:00:41.280> is

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
the it offers the easy build which is

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.100 
the it offers the easy build which is
the<00:00:41.550> jet<00:00:41.760> ski<00:00:42.000> which<00:00:42.210> my<00:00:42.420> other<00:00:42.600> video<00:00:42.930> is

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
the jet ski which my other video is

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.720 
the jet ski which my other video is
posted<00:00:43.500> then<00:00:43.620> it's<00:00:43.770> got<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.010> medium<00:00:44.430> build

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
posted then it's got the medium build

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.670 
posted then it's got the medium build
and<00:00:45.000> then<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.660> advanced<00:00:46.020> build<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:46.500> we're

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
and then the advanced build so we're

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.990 
and then the advanced build so we're
gonna<00:00:46.800> look<00:00:46.980> at<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.190> advanced<00:00:47.489> build<00:00:47.789> today

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
gonna look at the advanced build today

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.020 
gonna look at the advanced build today
and<00:00:48.390> another<00:00:48.750> thing<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:50.399> designer<00:00:50.730> sets

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
and another thing the the designer sets

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.680 
and another thing the the designer sets
have<00:00:51.539> enough<00:00:52.530> pieces<00:00:53.210> that<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.390> can<00:00:54.539> actually

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
have enough pieces that you can actually

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.779 
have enough pieces that you can actually
build<00:00:55.050> ten<00:00:55.440> different<00:00:55.890> sets<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.430> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
build ten different sets and the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.069 
build ten different sets and the
instructions<00:00:57.360> kind<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.750> give<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.020> some

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
instructions kind of give you some

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.840 
instructions kind of give you some
pictures<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.710> some<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.219> other<00:00:59.250> sets<00:00:59.670> that

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
pictures of some of the other sets that

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.790 
pictures of some of the other sets that
you<00:01:00.000> can<00:01:00.180> build<00:01:00.420> but<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.140> does<00:01:01.289> not<00:01:01.410> give<00:01:01.649> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
you can build but it does not give the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.439 
you can build but it does not give the
instructions<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:02.820> actually<00:01:03.239> one<00:01:03.420> of

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
instructions and that is actually one of

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.140 
instructions and that is actually one of
the<00:01:04.309> complaints<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.430> lot<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.700> people<00:01:05.909> had

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
the complaints that a lot of people had

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.730 
the complaints that a lot of people had
on<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:07.729> series<00:01:08.729> on<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.270> designer<00:01:09.630> series<00:01:10.110> so

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
on this series on the designer series so

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.300 
on this series on the designer series so
we're<00:01:10.860> gonna<00:01:10.979> look<00:01:11.130> at<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> primary<00:01:11.610> model

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
we're gonna look at the primary model

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.950 
we're gonna look at the primary model
you<00:01:14.310> can<00:01:14.430> see<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.670> here<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.390> jet<00:01:15.720> boat

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
you can see it here and it is a jet boat

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.890 
you can see it here and it is a jet boat
and<00:01:16.259> just<00:01:17.159> real<00:01:17.340> quickly<00:01:17.610> here<00:01:18.450> are<00:01:18.689> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
and just real quickly here are the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.929 
and just real quickly here are the
leftover<00:01:19.439> pieces<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:21.439> 547<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:23.430> only<00:01:23.729> a

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
leftover pieces of the 547 so only a

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.990 
leftover pieces of the 547 so only a
handful<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.570> pieces<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.439> were<00:01:25.979> left<00:01:26.220> over<00:01:26.400> so

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
handful of pieces that were left over so

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.270 
handful of pieces that were left over so
I<00:01:27.030> like<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:27.810> set<00:01:28.110> did<00:01:28.409> use<00:01:28.710> most<00:01:29.100> of

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
I like that so this set did use most of

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.960 
I like that so this set did use most of
the<00:01:29.340> pieces<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.229> enormous<00:01:31.759> I've<00:01:32.759> got

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
the pieces and it is enormous I've got

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.160 
the pieces and it is enormous I've got
my<00:01:33.119> my<00:01:33.720> ruler<00:01:34.049> here<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.290> want<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.560> show<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:36.170> this

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
my my ruler here I want to show you this

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.460 
my my ruler here I want to show you this
is<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.409> 1<00:01:37.740> foot<00:01:37.950> long<00:01:37.979> ruler<00:01:38.630> and<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.869> much

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
is a 1 foot long ruler and it is much

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.490 
is a 1 foot long ruler and it is much
much<00:01:40.710> larger<00:01:41.009> than<00:01:41.509> the<00:01:42.509> 1<00:01:42.750> foot<00:01:42.990> long<00:01:43.020> it's

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
much larger than the 1 foot long it's

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.760 
much larger than the 1 foot long it's
probably<00:01:44.009> well<00:01:44.880> let<00:01:45.000> me<00:01:45.680> it's<00:01:46.680> probably

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
probably well let me it's probably

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.219 
probably well let me it's probably
closer<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.399> foot<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.850> half<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.360> 18<00:01:48.990> inches

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
closer to a foot and a half so 18 inches

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.899 
closer to a foot and a half so 18 inches
total<00:01:50.540> okay<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:52.079> remarkably<00:01:52.740> as<00:01:53.040> large<00:01:53.549> as<00:01:53.820> it

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
total okay and remarkably as large as it

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.810 
total okay and remarkably as large as it
is<00:01:54.560> it<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.740> actually<00:01:56.780> minifig<00:01:57.780> scale<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:59.700> I'll

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
is it is actually minifig scale and I'll

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.490 
is it is actually minifig scale and I'll
show<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.030> what<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.240> mean<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:00.990> there's<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.259> mini

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
show you what I mean so there's a mini

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.980 
show you what I mean so there's a mini
figure<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:02.340> when<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.729> say<00:02:02.939> minifig<00:02:03.420> scale<00:02:03.719> this

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
figure and when I say minifig scale this

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.190 
figure and when I say minifig scale this
is<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.799> drivers<00:02:05.670> area<00:02:06.030> here<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.570> here<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.170> a

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
is the drivers area here and here is a

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.190 
is the drivers area here and here is a
seat<00:02:09.709> in<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.860> steering<00:02:11.220> wheel<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.200> mini

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
seat in the steering wheel and that mini

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.110 
seat in the steering wheel and that mini
figure

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
figure

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.950 
figure
would<00:02:15.120> actually<00:02:15.560> fit<00:02:16.560> in<00:02:16.680> there<00:02:17.630> so<00:02:18.630> it<00:02:18.810> is

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
would actually fit in there so it is

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.010 
would actually fit in there so it is
built<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:20.010> minifigure<00:02:20.820> scale<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.360> little<00:02:21.900> bit

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
built to minifigure scale a little bit

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.500 
built to minifigure scale a little bit
larger<00:02:22.620> than<00:02:22.770> minifigure<00:02:23.250> scale<00:02:23.520> but<00:02:24.150> it

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
larger than minifigure scale but it

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.910 
larger than minifigure scale but it
wouldn't<00:02:24.840> be<00:02:24.960> unrealistic<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:25.620> think<00:02:25.740> that

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
wouldn't be unrealistic to think that

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.000 
wouldn't be unrealistic to think that
you<00:02:26.100> could<00:02:26.250> fit<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.430> minifigure<00:02:26.850> in<00:02:27.030> there<00:02:28.010> okay

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
you could fit a minifigure in there okay

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.200 
you could fit a minifigure in there okay
so<00:02:29.070> that<00:02:29.280> was<00:02:29.400> one<00:02:29.520> of<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.700> features<00:02:30.000> there

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
so that was one of the features there

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.100 
so that was one of the features there
that<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.740> canopy<00:02:32.190> opens<00:02:32.490> up<00:02:33.020> and<00:02:34.020> it

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
that the that the canopy opens up and it

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.980 
that the that the canopy opens up and it
shows<00:02:34.350> some<00:02:34.920> engine<00:02:35.250> detail<00:02:35.580> there<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:36.780> does

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
shows some engine detail there it does

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.120 
shows some engine detail there it does
have<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.970> steering<00:02:39.390> wheel<00:02:39.830> okay<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.040> this

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
have the steering wheel okay and this

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.480 
have the steering wheel okay and this
steering<00:02:41.490> wheel<00:02:41.610> actually<00:02:42.240> controls<00:02:42.720> the

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
steering wheel actually controls the

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.120 
steering wheel actually controls the
propellers<00:02:44.490> back<00:02:44.790> here<00:02:45.410> so<00:02:46.410> you<00:02:46.440> can<00:02:46.680> see<00:02:46.890> up

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
propellers back here so you can see up

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.290 
propellers back here so you can see up
there<00:02:47.370> when<00:02:47.640> I<00:02:49.730> well<00:02:50.730> it's<00:02:50.910> kind<00:02:51.060> of<00:02:51.090> hard<00:02:51.270> to

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
there when I well it's kind of hard to

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.660 
there when I well it's kind of hard to
see<00:02:51.450> on<00:02:51.570> this<00:02:51.660> angle<00:02:51.870> but<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:53.100> does<00:02:53.280> control

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
see on this angle but it does control

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.270 
see on this angle but it does control
that<00:02:54.140> there<00:02:55.140> is<00:02:55.320> some<00:02:55.470> more<00:02:55.680> engine<00:02:55.950> detail

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
that there is some more engine detail

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.360 
that there is some more engine detail
here<00:02:56.580> where<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:56.850> can<00:02:57.000> lift<00:02:57.180> these<00:02:57.420> up<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:59.220> it

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
here where you can lift these up and it

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.729 
here where you can lift these up and it
shows<00:02:59.610> some<00:02:59.940> detail<00:03:02.989> and<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.200> same<00:03:04.410> on<00:03:04.560> this

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
shows some detail and the same on this

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.990 
shows some detail and the same on this
side<00:03:06.860> now<00:03:07.860> one<00:03:08.010> of<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.190> neat<00:03:08.340> things<00:03:08.370> because

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
side now one of the neat things because

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.850 
side now one of the neat things because
this<00:03:09.150> is<00:03:09.300> an<00:03:09.420> older<00:03:09.660> set<00:03:09.930> Lego<00:03:10.230> has<00:03:10.530> kind<00:03:10.770> of

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
this is an older set Lego has kind of

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.430 
this is an older set Lego has kind of
changed<00:03:10.920> their<00:03:11.459> approach<00:03:11.730> on<00:03:12.060> design<00:03:12.510> over

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
changed their approach on design over

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.770 
changed their approach on design over
time<00:03:13.680> so<00:03:14.280> this<00:03:14.459> set<00:03:14.760> is<00:03:14.790> built<00:03:15.239> up<00:03:15.510> using

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
time so this set is built up using

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.960 
time so this set is built up using
plates<00:03:16.290> and<00:03:16.590> is<00:03:16.680> very<00:03:16.860> very<00:03:17.190> solid<00:03:17.550> it<00:03:17.880> is

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
three inches at the top of the canopy so

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.539 
three inches at the top of the canopy so
it's<00:03:32.910> got<00:03:33.120> a<00:03:33.390> good<00:03:33.810> inch<00:03:34.019> and<00:03:34.200> a<00:03:34.230> half<00:03:34.260> of<00:03:34.799> solid

brick built all this is solid there's no
hollow<00:03:38.100> space<00:03:38.549> well<00:03:39.060> no<00:03:39.420> we<00:03:40.080> were<00:03:40.200> wrong<00:03:40.350> there

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
hollow space well no we were wrong there

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.310 
hollow space well no we were wrong there
is<00:03:40.620> some<00:03:41.400> hollow<00:03:41.580> space<00:03:41.940> under<00:03:42.239> there<00:03:42.390> for<00:03:42.420> the

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
is some hollow space under there for the

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.229 
is some hollow space under there for the
steering<00:03:43.830> wheel<00:03:44.070> and<00:03:44.370> how<00:03:44.820> the<00:03:44.880> steering

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
steering wheel and how the steering

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.990 
steering wheel and how the steering
wheel<00:03:45.450> controls<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.830> propellers<00:03:47.310> there<00:03:47.580> but

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
wheel controls the propellers there but

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.880 
wheel controls the propellers there but
it<00:03:48.180> is<00:03:48.330> mostly<00:03:48.720> solid<00:03:49.260> built<00:03:49.440> so<00:03:49.560> this<00:03:49.680> thing

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
it is mostly solid built so this thing

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.500 
it is mostly solid built so this thing
is<00:03:50.010> very<00:03:50.070> very<00:03:50.489> solid<00:03:53.000> so<00:03:54.000> they're<00:03:54.150> just<00:03:54.299> from

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
is very very solid so they're just from

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.000 
is very very solid so they're just from
the<00:03:54.600> front<00:03:57.140> very<00:03:58.140> pleased<00:03:58.440> with<00:03:58.590> its<00:03:58.830> good

the front very pleased with its good

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.770 
the front very pleased with its good
size<00:03:59.220> the<00:03:59.790> fact<00:04:00.030> that<00:04:00.120> you<00:04:00.330> can<00:04:00.540> fit<00:04:00.750> a

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
size the fact that you can fit a

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.120 
size the fact that you can fit a
minifigure<00:04:01.230> in<00:04:01.410> there<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.680> it<00:04:01.739> doesn't<00:04:02.010> look

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
minifigure in there and it doesn't look

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.330 
minifigure in there and it doesn't look
ridiculously<00:04:02.700> too<00:04:02.940> big<00:04:03.410> but<00:04:04.410> is<00:04:04.530> a<00:04:04.560> huge<00:04:05.010> huge
