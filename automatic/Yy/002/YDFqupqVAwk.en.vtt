of<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.519> speech<00:00:29.820> because<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.269> started<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.900> and

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
of a speech because I started to and

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.889 
of a speech because I started to and
then<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.560> saw<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:31.800> was<00:00:32.040> on<00:00:32.189> after<00:00:32.579> Heath<00:00:33.450> epic

airy<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.410> figured<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.860> whole<00:00:35.040> stage<00:00:35.460> is

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760

airy and I figured the whole stage is
like<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.120> little<00:00:36.390> area<00:00:36.690> wouldn't<00:00:37.140> be

and<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.750> whole<00:00:39.930> region<00:00:40.170> would<00:00:40.530> just<00:00:40.800> be

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
and this whole region would just be

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.060 
and this whole region would just be
police<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.489> fire<00:00:41.730> officials<00:00:42.329> by<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.600> point
