00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.150
 Y 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.330
 whatsapp or my dear gamers again 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.640
 for you your friend gene ix in this 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.849
 I come to you bringing a tip and a 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.490
 glitch on the street map this very 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:26.279
 thank you very much to our friend four 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.039
 seasons that made us the great favor 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.320
 to have a good time first of all let's go 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.690
 starting with the tip which 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.180
 we call in the same way we call 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.269
 the previous one and this one is sniper 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.460
 that would be the shadow of the sniper and 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:44.909
 here we are showing you on the map the 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.049
 area where this guy is made this 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:48.510
 advice 

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:52.739
 well I would adapt it very much to what 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.780
 is the domain mode without 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.269
 However, it also has functions in 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.640
 other modes and right now you will see 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:02.189
 what do I mean with this there is our 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.220
 friend who is having a good time the area 

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:07.619
 where are we going to make this this advice 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.080
 this tip that for the truth is very 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.000
 functional it made me very good 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.159
 first of all break the crystals 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.530
 right now we will be showing how 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.509
 straighten it there are two very simple ways 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.329
 that good apart from that you already know that 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.369
 is to hit him or shoot him good it 's here 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:26.520
 the demonstration of how to do it well 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.609
 Well first of all, you guys are going away 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.350
 to go closer to this crystal must already 

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:33.689
 to bring to you in advance the 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.549
 sniper that logically is what 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.840
 that we are going to be killing preferably 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.670
 and well there it is with a couple of blows if 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.939
 the crystals are fixed 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.250
 that did not break, they do not create good 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.709
 here we are closing them a little bit good 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.250
 there with him with the bow the 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:54.840
 crystals at a stroke and well it would be more 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.489
 simple a little bit below for 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.039
 break the crystals that are of the 

00:01:56.489 --> 00:02:01.409
 bottom and that the best thing look there 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.780
 is where the hoop appears in domain and 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.539
 It would be good to give them in the head 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.759
 the players that are in that area and 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:11.760
 good and their peers could to 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.160
 this one with that hoop not good there in 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.290
 that other area that I show you is 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.230
 where you can give 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.359
 to the campers that are put there with 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.709
 the hammer of dawn especially that 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:25.829
 you will already know that it is one of the 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.140
 areas that many hold very very good 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:29.609
 well to change however good to 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.439
 Sometimes he expects us not to be giving 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:33.450
 then one day they come to you and give you 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:35.760
 there they bring in their heads and they will see that 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.459
 they will be removed that morning I do believe 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.129
 good but that area is very good 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.850
 to now move to a very good click that 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:47.030
 he also passed us our gamer 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.030
 in the same area where the 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:54.260
 bow we call it glick sondermann fit 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.210
 that would be under my feet what 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.430
 we call it that because now they will see how 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.100
 our friend shows it to us 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.470
 they roll there and they stay floating in that area 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.570
 it made me very good now I'm going to 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.340
 show there I will do the same 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.960
 movement and see how it is in the 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.640
 upper part 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.370
 we are going down look there 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.200
 we will change those who go by and in 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.300
 many times no account will be given 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.160
 then you are in the part 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.800
 inferior we almost step on them why 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.260
 we call this great this way 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.780
 glitch that happened to our friend and 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.700
 Well, I hope you liked this 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.040
 is what they bring us this time 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.140
 our friend and I wanted good 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.780
 share the whole community so that 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.270
 we start using it and good to give it 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.660
 Thanks a lot, thank you, all of us. 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:44.150
 coming up from the subscribers very fast 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.340
 It gives me great pleasure I hope to be 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.050
 soon again with you if I will be 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.090

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.580

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.130
 jungle that we are already I hope in this
