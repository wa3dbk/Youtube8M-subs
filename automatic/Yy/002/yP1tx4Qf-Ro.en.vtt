farming<00:00:11.849> runs<00:00:12.059> is<00:00:12.450> to<00:00:12.660> keep<00:00:12.809> moving<00:00:13.049> over<00:00:13.469> a

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
farming runs is to keep moving over a

farming runs is to keep moving over a
large<00:00:13.740> area<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.910> reason<00:00:15.210> for<00:00:15.240> this<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:15.480> that

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
large area the reason for this is that

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.420 
large area the reason for this is that

the longer mobs have been alive the more

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.950 
the longer mobs have been alive the more
they<00:00:17.580> mature<00:00:17.850> which<00:00:18.240> gives<00:00:18.510> them<00:00:18.660> bonus

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
they mature which gives them bonus

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.660 
they mature which gives them bonus
