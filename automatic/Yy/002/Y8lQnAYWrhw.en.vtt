00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.159
 I totally want to lay down on the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.590
 ground had hit my skirts 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.509
 and horses called his stiff limb 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.280

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.960
 His tail tickled me not a little 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.890
 all on her belly and otherwise 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.020
 All around he drove to one 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.299
 other book the book at all if it 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.520
 the french revolution goes where 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.909
 written by revolutionary story 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.619
 from the Scot Thomas Kallay to today 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.259
 this book is considered one of the 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.520
 standard works on this topic everyone 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.350
 historian who lasts longer with the 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.440
 The French Revolution has dealt with this 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.570
 already in 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.130
 The only problem was this book had 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.930
 twice written 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.610
 the first version was carlisle namely 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.440
 sent to a buddy in with the 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.180
 had mandated writing and the 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.030
 households because this coupes thought 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.340
 that would be rubbish and has the only one 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.740
 manuscript that exists from the book 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.450
 has burnt what with the 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.520
 housekeeper happened is unfortunately 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.820
 not known 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.050
 1493 christoph columbus is on big 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.090
 discovery trip he sails over the sea 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.040
 and suddenly discovers something completely 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.560
 amazing something about it later 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.450
 writing in his diary I was three 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.700
 mermaids rising from the sea 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.470
 However , they were not so 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.080
 beautiful as you know from paintings 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.120
 although in some a kind of human 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.190
 you could tell face recognition 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.570
 there was at columbus was one or 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.400
 others beat rom in the game 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.320
 what he saw was not 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.830
 Mermaids as you know today 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:03:00.160
 is sea cows apropos alcohol a small 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.140
 jump into the year 1991 it is the year in 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.090
 in Poland a very special one 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.980
 parties to the parliament 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:13.450
 with 3.27 percent of all votes comes 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:15.250
 ppp a total of 16 seats from ppp that is 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.010
 a polish abbreviation for the 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.239
 polish party of beer friends in the 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.640
 party program states among other things 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.430
 We are not subject to the error of 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.920
 poles can only be abstinenzler 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.739
 he does not drink vodka a tasty 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.930
 cool aromatic beer can do the same 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.820
 serve to deploy a sector 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.190
 one of the main concerns of the party was 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:39.130
 by the way, the fight against alcoholism 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.180
 Unfortunately, only partially worked and we 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.700
 stay with the topic 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.700
 this is the national anthem of the usa 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.660
 so far nothing new but the origin 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.340
 this height only few know the 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.370
 melody of the song comes from 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.170
 a song londoner they have 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.750
 in the eighteenth century the one 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.000
 called criticism society and the cup 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.580
 among other things the song trilled the 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.770
 Today the anthem of the USA is natural 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.450
 still with a slightly different text 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.190
 that was natural, of course, intellectually 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.160
 not where we are at intellectual 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.930
 this is francisco matthias 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.180
 chandler and even if he is here completely 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:26.620
 This man was kind 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.360
 beast from 1968 to 1979 he was the 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.630
 first president of the african country 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.460
 equatorial guinea and extremely dreaded 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.140
 his government time is one 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.740
 third of the population from the country 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.140
 fled 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.090
 those who stayed were tortured 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.810
 executions and persecution about themselves 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.550
 endure 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.500
 it even went so far as to go for one 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:48.070
 certain word in the jail come 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.170
 that word could be intellectual 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.150
 has hated francisco matthias ramer 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.890
 probably also because he prefers 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.360
 his presidency three times through the 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.180
 officials had attacked ex 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.520
 and another strange dictator next to it 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.160
 was the strongman for three decades 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.720
 in burma today's myanmar just before 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.070
 At the end of his reign he became himself 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.610
 even a very special request 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.320
 he has 45 he and 90 he seems 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.030
 print the currency of the country 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.550
 not because that was absolutely necessary 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:18.460
 but because nine is his favorite number 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.140
 has been and 45 and 90 can be 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.700
 great by nine parts 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.860
 today these are not anymore 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.320
 Valid for this is worldwide 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.970
 name mel sounds a bit like that 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.950
 Melchior of the holy three kings 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:33.340
 But it is something completely different 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:35.590
 short for marx angel lenin stalin 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.600
 october revolution and was in the 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.210
 Soviet Union a very popular name 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.640
 but really only in the 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.810
 soviet union and only as long as josef 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.540
 Stalin is still in power 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:49.030
 Luckily one can only say for everybody 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.650
 future children yes that's what she was 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.630
 already the crazy story I hope 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.070
 you liked it if you already liked it 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.000
 in the comments when writing 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.980
 Of course, also in the comments 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.600
 and you can share this video too 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.100
 i will post it on my facebook 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.870
 page post so divides among all 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.520
 you know about this series 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.200
 little bit the round makes it you 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.750
 has fallen then that will continue in the future 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.300
 If I continue then it stays with this one 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.500
 a part thanks for watching and until
