00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.469 
day I think PlayStation Magazine PSM
back<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.710> they<00:01:43.950> when<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.189> existed<00:01:44.670> even<00:01:45.090> ran

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
back and they when it existed even ran

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.999 
back and they when it existed even ran
you<00:01:45.720> know<00:01:45.810> games<00:01:46.140> who<00:01:46.290> wants<00:01:46.470> equals<00:01:46.770> 2<00:01:46.920> and

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
you know games who wants equals 2 and

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.080 
Vincent story quite well there's I think
a<00:03:05.260> ton<00:03:06.130> of<00:03:06.160> different<00:03:06.340> endings<00:03:06.670> like<00:03:06.760> I<00:03:06.910> think

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
a ton of different endings like I think

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.310 
a ton of different endings like I think
it's<00:03:07.210> eight<00:03:07.420> different<00:03:07.690> endings<00:03:08.050> but<00:03:08.140> there's

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
it's eight different endings but there's

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.680 
it's eight different endings but there's
three<00:03:08.560> like<00:03:08.830> core<00:03:09.220> endings<00:03:09.610> there's<00:03:09.820> like<00:03:10.030> he

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
three like core endings there's like he

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.000 
three like core endings there's like he
either<00:03:10.930> ends<00:03:11.230> up<00:03:11.350> with<00:03:11.470> higher<00:03:11.590> of<00:03:11.770> the<00:03:11.830> girls

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
assume he dies as the portal to Hell

assume he dies as the portal to Hell
closes<00:04:36.199> and<00:04:37.090> then<00:04:38.090> you<00:04:38.210> see<00:04:38.360> him<00:04:38.449> ride<00:04:38.629> by<00:04:38.780> it's

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
closes and then you see him ride by it's

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.390 
closes and then you see him ride by it's
like<00:04:39.050> is<00:04:39.169> that<00:04:39.199> a<00:04:39.319> ghost<00:04:39.590> is<00:04:39.860> that<00:04:39.979> actually

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
like is that a ghost is that actually

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.399 
like is that a ghost is that actually
him<00:04:40.639> it's<00:04:40.909> very<00:04:41.210> unclear<00:04:41.659> and<00:04:41.930> I<00:04:41.990> guess<00:04:42.169> that's

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:42.409 
him it's very unclear and I guess that's

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:43.960 
him it's very unclear and I guess that's
the<00:04:42.740> great<00:04:43.129> part<00:04:43.340> about<00:04:43.430> the<00:04:43.639> ending<00:04:43.849> it

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
the great part about the ending it

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.909 
the great part about the ending it
leaves<00:04:44.090> it<00:04:44.210> ambiguous<00:04:44.479> but<00:04:45.349> also<00:04:45.500> leaves<00:04:45.800> it

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
leaves it ambiguous but also leaves it

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.659 
leaves it ambiguous but also leaves it
open<00:04:45.979> for<00:04:46.159> a<00:04:46.310> sequel<00:04:46.370> and<00:04:47.270> I<00:04:47.360> think<00:04:47.569> this<00:04:47.810> game
