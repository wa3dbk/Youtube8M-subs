out<00:00:25.199> there<00:00:25.439> today<00:00:25.650> but<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.340> good<00:00:26.519> performance

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
out there today but a good performance

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.900 
out there today but a good performance
all<00:00:27.060> around<00:00:27.090> by<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.480> team<00:00:27.689> yeah<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:29.130> started<00:00:29.849> a

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
all around by the team yeah it started a

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.569 
all around by the team yeah it started a
little<00:00:29.970> bit<00:00:30.210> slow<00:00:30.480> but<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:31.800> think<00:00:32.430> that's

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
little bit slow but I think that's

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.549 
little bit slow but I think that's
expected<00:00:32.910> with<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.390> field<00:00:33.809> conditions<00:00:34.260> and

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
expected with the field conditions and

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.560 
expected with the field conditions and
we<00:00:35.430> picked<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.700> up<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:35.969> second<00:00:36.270> half<00:00:37.040> come<00:00:38.040> out

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
said to them they lost a little bit of

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.959

confidence<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.619> he<00:01:56.430> started<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.939> game

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
confidence and he started the game

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.030 
confidence and he started the game
really<00:01:57.329> well<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:58.259> game<00:01:58.439> never<00:01:58.469> looked<00:01:58.890> in

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
really well the game never looked in

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.280 
really well the game never looked in
doubt<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.579> they<00:02:00.420> just<00:02:00.659> lost<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:01.110> bit<00:02:01.259> of

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
doubt and they just lost a bit of

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.630 
doubt and they just lost a bit of
confidence<00:02:01.649> there<00:02:02.040> was<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.159> bit<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.520> mistake

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
confidence there was a bit of a mistake

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.630 
confidence there was a bit of a mistake
on<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.270> back<00:02:03.509> and

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
on the back and

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.850 
on the back and
yeah<00:02:05.640> we<00:02:06.360> just<00:02:06.540> seem<00:02:06.810> again<00:02:07.320> let<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.740> affect

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
yeah we just seem again let that affect

yeah we just seem again let that affect
us<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.490> I<00:02:08.550> think<00:02:08.580> we<00:02:08.819> have<00:02:08.850> to<00:02:08.970> work<00:02:09.240> on<00:02:09.450> that

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
us and I think we have to work on that

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.650 
us and I think we have to work on that
we<00:02:10.800> stop<00:02:11.400> building<00:02:11.790> up<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.300> we<00:02:12.390> let<00:02:12.540> the

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
we stop building up and we let the

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.520 
we stop building up and we let the
Mexicans<00:02:13.220> precious<00:02:14.720> so<00:02:15.720> we're<00:02:16.260> going<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.470> look

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
into that there's a mental thing and in

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.290 
into that there's a mental thing and in
the<00:02:19.020> middle<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.350> game<00:02:19.590> not<00:02:20.060> you<00:02:21.060> know<00:02:21.150> when

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
the middle of the game not you know when

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.670

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
those things up we just have to move

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.010 
those things up we just have to move
past<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.190> keep<00:02:23.370> playing<00:02:23.520> our<00:02:23.790> game<00:02:24.060> but

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
past it and keep playing our game but

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.690 
past it and keep playing our game but
you<00:02:25.110> still<00:02:25.350> came<00:02:25.530> through<00:02:25.739> then<00:02:25.920> after<00:02:26.340> Mexico

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
you still came through then after Mexico

tied and again restart another goal yeah
look<00:02:30.360> I<00:02:30.480> didn't<00:02:30.750> think<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.989> game<00:02:31.170> was<00:02:31.350> ever<00:02:31.530> in

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
look I didn't think the game was ever in

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.979 
look I didn't think the game was ever in
doubt<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.190> not<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.580> was<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.970> crazy<00:02:33.690> thing

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
doubt and not that was the crazy thing

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.410 
doubt and not that was the crazy thing
about<00:02:34.020> our<00:02:34.410> team<00:02:34.680> I<00:02:34.920> think<00:02:35.580> we<00:02:35.670> just<00:02:35.819> looked

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
about our team I think we just looked

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.210 
about our team I think we just looked
like<00:02:36.569> we<00:02:36.720> always<00:02:36.870> had<00:02:37.110> another<00:02:37.380> gear<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.890> it

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
like we always had another gear and it

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.860 
like we always had another gear and it
was<00:02:38.340> almost<00:02:38.550> like<00:02:38.940> it<00:02:39.150> need<00:02:39.300> a<00:02:39.330> little<00:02:39.690> bit<00:02:39.810> of

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
was almost like it need a little bit of

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.290 
was almost like it need a little bit of
adversity<00:02:40.200> before<00:02:41.010> we<00:02:41.340> shifted<00:02:41.730> gears<00:02:41.760> so

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
adversity before we shifted gears so

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.390 
adversity before we shifted gears so
that's<00:02:43.110> what<00:02:43.350> we've<00:02:43.500> got<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.709> learn<00:02:43.920> from<00:02:44.220> we

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
that's what we've got to learn from we

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.770 
that's what we've got to learn from we
actually<00:02:44.670> have<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:44.880> start<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.300> game<00:02:45.330> a<00:02:45.510> little

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
actually have to start the game a little

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.320 
actually have to start the game a little
bit<00:02:45.900> quicker<00:02:46.260> so<00:02:46.680> we<00:02:46.920> had<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.040> few<00:02:47.280> chances<00:02:47.340> in

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
bit quicker so we had a few chances in

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.330 
bit quicker so we had a few chances in
the<00:02:48.510> open<00:02:48.810> in<00:02:48.930> their<00:02:49.170> 20<00:02:49.709> minutes<00:02:50.010> one<00:02:50.220> of

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
the open in their 20 minutes one of

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.070 
the open in their 20 minutes one of
them's<00:02:50.489> got<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.790> go<00:02:50.910> in<00:02:51.060> in<00:02:51.209> future<00:02:51.600> and<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:51.989> I

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
them's got to go in in future and and I

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.100 
them's got to go in in future and and I
think<00:02:52.110> if<00:02:52.410> they<00:02:52.500> do<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:53.370> changes<00:02:53.850> the

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
think if they do it and that changes the

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.920 
think if they do it and that changes the
reception<00:02:55.110> person<00:02:55.530> in<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:55.980> mental<00:02:56.310> state

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
reception person in the mental state

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.110 
reception person in the mental state
thank<00:02:57.930> you
