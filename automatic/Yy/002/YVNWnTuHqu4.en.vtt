00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
but show you take them off just lift up

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.980 
but show you take them off just lift up
on<00:01:48.210> one<00:01:48.360> side<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.630> them<00:01:50.630> try<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.690> get<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.840> good

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
on one side of them try to get a good

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:59.180 
on one side of them try to get a good
angle<00:01:52.110> for<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.530> guys<00:01:55.610> lift<00:01:56.610> up<00:01:57.770> pull<00:01:58.770> up<00:01:59.010> on

one side just snaps right off it will go

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.580 
one side just snaps right off it will go
on<00:02:03.930> like<00:02:04.230> that<00:02:04.460> um<00:02:05.990> that's<00:02:06.990> what<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.230> top<00:02:07.440> of

on like that um that's what the top of

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.300 
on like that um that's what the top of
it<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.980> the<00:02:08.070> top<00:02:09.110> then<00:02:10.110> well<00:02:10.320> got<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.070> NY

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
it to the top then well got the NY

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.550 
it to the top then well got the NY
little<00:02:11.760> trigger<00:02:11.970> button<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:13.110> then<00:02:13.290> push<00:02:13.530> down

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
little trigger button and then push down

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
little trigger button and then push down
the<00:02:13.710> bottom<00:02:15.500> you'll<00:02:16.500> hear<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:17.100> snapping

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.980 
so yeah I do think they're good they do
help<00:02:32.550> um<00:02:34.640> compared<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.730> an<00:02:35.790> Xbox<00:02:36.420> controller

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.370 

there's<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.260> xbox<00:02:40.680> controller<00:02:42.050> the<00:02:43.050> angle

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
there's the xbox controller the angle

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.350 
there's the xbox controller the angle
Matt<00:02:45.260> then<00:02:46.260> ps3<00:02:46.770> controller<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:47.730> one<00:02:47.970> that<00:02:48.150> so

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
Matt then ps3 controller and one that so

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.150 
Matt then ps3 controller and one that so
I<00:02:48.390> mean<00:02:48.570> it<00:02:49.290> does<00:02:49.440> have<00:02:49.620> more<00:02:50.010> angle<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:52.160> but

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
I mean it does have more angle to it but

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.990 
I mean it does have more angle to it but
