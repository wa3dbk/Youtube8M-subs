I'm<00:00:07.649> going<00:00:07.770> to<00:00:07.890> show<00:00:08.040> you<00:00:08.069> how<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.309> change

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
I'm going to show you how to change

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.009 
I'm going to show you how to change

filters on a conventional reverse
osmosis<00:00:10.380> system<00:00:10.889> where<00:00:11.040> you<00:00:11.130> do<00:00:11.340> have<00:00:11.370> to<00:00:11.550> turn

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
osmosis system where you do have to turn

osmosis system where you do have to turn
the<00:00:11.969> water<00:00:12.120> off<00:00:12.240> purge<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.170> pressure<00:00:13.410> on<00:00:14.179> to

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
the water off purge the pressure on to

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.820 
the water off purge the pressure on to
do<00:00:15.299> it<00:00:15.420> correctly<00:00:15.599> so<00:00:16.109> first<00:00:16.590> thing<00:00:16.710> we're

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
do it correctly so first thing we're

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.230 
do it correctly so first thing we're
going<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.220> finding<00:00:17.550> where<00:00:17.670> your<00:00:17.789> water<00:00:17.940> comes

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
going to finding where your water comes

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.540 
going to finding where your water comes
in<00:00:18.420> that<00:00:19.109> side<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.680> pretty<00:00:19.980> much<00:00:20.160> always<00:00:20.400> going

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
in that side is pretty much always going

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.040 
in that side is pretty much always going
to<00:00:20.699> be<00:00:20.760> your<00:00:20.939> pre-filter<00:00:21.539> followed<00:00:21.900> by<00:00:22.020> a

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
to be your pre-filter followed by a

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.340 
to be your pre-filter followed by a
carbon<00:00:22.500> block<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.400> normal<00:00:23.779> sequence<00:00:24.779> so

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
carbon block is the normal sequence so

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.050 
carbon block is the normal sequence so
this<00:00:25.740> one<00:00:26.010> if<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.220> was<00:00:26.310> coming<00:00:26.550> in<00:00:26.670> on<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.029> left

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
this one if it was coming in on the left

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.089 
this one if it was coming in on the left
then<00:00:27.630> your<00:00:27.840> pre-filter<00:00:28.710> would<00:00:28.800> be<00:00:28.890> on<00:00:28.980> the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
then your pre-filter would be on the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.540 
then your pre-filter would be on the
left

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
left

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.800 
left
followed<00:00:29.820> by<00:00:29.849> carbon<00:00:30.210> block<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.510> right<00:00:30.660> but

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
followed by carbon block and right but

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.600 
followed by carbon block and right but
in<00:00:30.900> this<00:00:30.990> case<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.380> feed<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:32.040> feed<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.460> coming

in this case the feed the feed is coming

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.370 
in this case the feed the feed is coming
in<00:00:32.880> on<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.090> right<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:33.719> we're<00:00:33.809> going<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:33.960> turn

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
in on the right so we're going to turn

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.410 
in on the right so we're going to turn
that<00:00:34.590> off<00:00:34.649> we're<00:00:35.520> going<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.700> turn<00:00:35.850> off<00:00:36.120> the

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
that off we're going to turn off the

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.340 
that off we're going to turn off the
valve<00:00:36.570> on<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.870> tank

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
system happens to be in a basement we're

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.430 
system happens to be in a basement we're
going<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.030> open<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.450> RO<00:00:48.600> faucet<00:00:49.140> which<00:00:49.260> we

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
going to open the RO faucet which we

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.229 
going to open the RO faucet which we
already<00:00:49.739> did<00:00:49.890> once<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.520> stops<00:00:50.760> dripping<00:00:51.030> we're

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
already did once it stops dripping we're

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.400 
already did once it stops dripping we're
just<00:00:51.360> going<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.510> close<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:52.020> we've

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
just going to close it we've

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.959 
just going to close it we've
depressurize<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.129> system<00:00:53.309> which<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.879> going

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
depressurize the system which is going

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.939 
depressurize the system which is going
to<00:00:54.090> allow<00:00:54.270> us<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.629> remove<00:00:54.899> these<00:00:55.110> housings

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
to allow us to remove these housings

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.310 
to allow us to remove these housings
much<00:00:56.280> easier<00:00:57.000> if<00:00:57.180> they're<00:00:57.480> under<00:00:57.660> pressure

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
much easier if they're under pressure

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.889 
much easier if they're under pressure
um<00:00:58.469> just<00:00:59.340> with<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.059> water<00:01:00.270> off<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.809> you

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
um just with the water off and you

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.000 
um just with the water off and you
didn't<00:01:01.140> purge<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.469> pressure<00:01:01.680> they'll<00:01:01.920> be

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
didn't purge the pressure they'll be

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.139 
didn't purge the pressure they'll be
under<00:01:02.219> pressure<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.550> they're<00:01:02.670> very<00:01:02.850> hard<00:01:03.059> to

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
under pressure and they're very hard to

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.329 
under pressure and they're very hard to
remove<00:01:03.390> at<00:01:03.570> times<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.650> could<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.100> could

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
remove at times and you could you could

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.800 
remove at times and you could you could
hurt<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.640> little<00:01:05.909> leaning<00:01:06.299> et<00:01:06.390> cetera<00:01:06.600> so

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
hurt a little leaning et cetera so

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.300 
hurt a little leaning et cetera so
they're<00:01:06.960> depressurize<00:01:07.530> we're<00:01:08.130> going<00:01:08.250> to

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
they're depressurize we're going to

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.580 
they're depressurize we're going to
remove<00:01:08.820> these<00:01:09.060> I've<00:01:09.659> got<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.869> special<00:01:10.170> strap

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
remove these I've got a special strap

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.050 
remove these I've got a special strap
wrench<00:01:10.830> usually<00:01:11.520> you've<00:01:11.610> got<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> plastic

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
wrench usually you've got a plastic

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.330 
wrench usually you've got a plastic
wrench<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.810> unit<00:01:13.020> came<00:01:13.170> with<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:14.280> I'm

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
wrench that the unit came with so I'm

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.230 
wrench that the unit came with so I'm
going<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.520> take<00:01:14.670> these<00:01:14.850> off

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
going to take these off

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.359 
going to take these off
keep<00:01:16.229> them<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.560> same<00:01:16.740> order<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.070> don't<00:01:17.280> like

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
keep them in the same order I don't like

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.609 
keep them in the same order I don't like
moving<00:01:17.610> housings<00:01:18.119> around<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.409> going<00:01:19.560> to

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
moving housings around this is going to

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:20.840 
moving housings around this is going to
be<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.799> cleaner<00:01:20.040> housing<00:01:20.310> because<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.729> was

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
be the cleaner housing because it was

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.499 
be the cleaner housing because it was
the<00:01:20.970> carbon<00:01:21.299> block<00:01:22.970> so<00:01:23.970> we're<00:01:24.119> just<00:01:24.150> going<00:01:24.420> to

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
the carbon block so we're just going to

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.280 
the carbon block so we're just going to
pour<00:01:24.720> out<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.049> water<00:01:26.509> that<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.720> this<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.259> a

pour out this water that is a this is a

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.980 
pour out this water that is a this is a
carbon<00:01:28.710> block<00:01:28.860> filter<00:01:29.390> it<00:01:30.390> looks<00:01:30.630> white<00:01:30.780> but

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
carbon block filter it looks white but

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.330 
carbon block filter it looks white but
that's<00:01:31.079> carbon<00:01:31.500> block<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.799> it's<00:01:31.890> still<00:01:32.070> clean

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
that's carbon block and it's still clean

this is the final polishing filter and

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.360 
this is the final polishing filter and
that<00:04:27.000> can<00:04:27.960> go<00:04:28.080> that<00:04:28.380> can<00:04:28.500> go<00:04:28.620> a<00:04:28.650> bit<00:04:28.860> longer<00:04:29.070> if

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
that can go that can go a bit longer if

then every other time maybe do the the

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.950 
then every other time maybe do the the
post-carbon<00:04:49.139> on<00:04:49.380> the<00:04:49.470> top<00:04:49.970> um<00:04:50.970> thank<00:04:51.389> you<00:04:51.450> it's
