00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:10.110
 health and lose weight and today I'm going to teach 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.380
 how to prepare a spinach soup that 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.940
 It is super simple and very nutritious good 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:20.210
 here we have the ingredients this I have 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:24.150
 spinach this spinach is already stuck 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.190
 but if you do not get the one that already 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.860
 is washed from 10 infected then 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:32.160
 Well, they can disinfect with some 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:36.300
 iodine droplets and wash it 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.790
 and come out here I have my onion I have 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.540
 frozen that I normally had already 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:47.540
 said I have it 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:51.020
 already seasoned sauté with garlic and it 's for me 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.980
 much more practical and simple to put it in 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:58.930
 any soup that I'm going to prepare 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:02.620
 and I put her in these he was good 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.500
 ice bin and a little water 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.530
 Water 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.630
 and milk can be cow's milk if 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.090
 they want how can it be almond milk 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.240
 or coconut milk and this is a mixture of 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.520
 almond milk with coconut milk here 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.090
 Ana Paula is going to help me 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.909
 shoot a bit of my video thanks to the 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.299
 paula 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:30.799
 and here we have Paula eating her 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:33.280
 delicious spinach soup move them 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.280
 Like very much 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:44.400
 I like Paula is good 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:47.370
 ok thank you vice 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.060
 The first thing I'm going to do is put a 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.060
 little water 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.240
 in saucepan 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:03.510
 this this makes the functions like 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.270
 put spinach on low 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:10.680
 but it is much simpler and more 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.150
 practical and fast and everything then I go 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.960
 to put about a pound of 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.960
 spinach 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.290
 then I do it like bumps I do 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.250
 something first a part because it does not put it 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.010
 all 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.069
 Then I'm going to turn it around 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.120
 weather 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:38.489
 we do not want you to have a green color 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.409
 like an olive tree because that means 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.359
 that already the spinach lost 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:44.939
 many of their vitamins and their 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:49.849
 properties if we do not want rather than 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:49.849
 have a very bright green color 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.120
 for that we have to do it very 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.120
 very fast not to leave it more than 5 minutes 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.260
 cooking then what I do is 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.690
 I cook this part 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.850
 and then I put it in the blender and then 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.569
 another part and so that everything comes out more 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:26.050
 or less couple that if not cooking 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.050
 equal 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:33.359
 ok let's leave it for another two minutes 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:39.540
 how do they see the volume that I had that was 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:44.040
 filled the pan was reduced to this 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:47.370
 small amount and that allows us to be able 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:51.239
 eat a lot of in this case 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.489
 green leaves of spinach in just 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.530
 a soup that you do not have to be 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:59.700
 chewing for a long time but that 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:03.610
 we can not eat it very fast 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:07.060
 then I will put in blender the 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.800
 spinach also wanted to comment that 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.220
 about the blender that I'm using 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:16.209
 which is a pod mix is ​​a blender 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:19.120
 super super good that leaves the soups 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:22.300
 we believe and you are and grinds very well those 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.090
 food but good if you do not have this 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.710
 blender can use any other 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.750
 blender that you have but 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:33.630
 I really recommend them if you can 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:37.020
 buy one of these is a pod mix 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:40.920
 and I have my third the third portion 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:44.010
 to cook and for video purposes what 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.540
 I'm going to do is I'm going to separate this 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.930
 dallas 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.800
 the spinach that you cook 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.020
 why 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.100
