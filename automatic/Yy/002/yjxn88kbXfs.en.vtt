requested<00:00:21.029> base<00:00:21.449> video<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:22.050> lot<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.949> people<00:00:23.100> had

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
requested base video a lot of people had

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.490 
requested base video a lot of people had
noticed<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:23.880> changed<00:00:24.300> my<00:00:24.449> base<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:25.230> i'm

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
noticed that I changed my base so i'm

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.960 
noticed that I changed my base so i'm
going<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.710> show<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:25.920> guys<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.430> walk<00:00:26.760> you

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
going to show you guys and walk you

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.269 
going to show you guys and walk you
through<00:00:27.240> everything<00:00:27.449> about<00:00:27.930> my<00:00:28.080> base<00:00:28.279> first

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
through everything about my base first

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.980 
through everything about my base first
off<00:00:29.519> let's<00:00:29.849> take<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.060> look<00:00:30.300> at<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.539> symmetry<00:00:30.960> of

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
off let's take a look at the symmetry of

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.930 
off let's take a look at the symmetry of
my<00:00:31.199> base<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.650> lot<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.250> guys<00:00:32.309> know<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.910> i

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
my base a lot of you guys know that i

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.790 
my base a lot of you guys know that i
have<00:00:33.000> like<00:00:33.239> an<00:00:33.329> OCD<00:00:33.719> thing<00:00:33.840> for<00:00:34.290> symmetrical

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
have like an OCD thing for symmetrical

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.100 
have like an OCD thing for symmetrical
basis<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:35.640> let's<00:00:35.820> start<00:00:36.030> out<00:00:36.149> with<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.809> top

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
basis so let's start out with the top

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.200 
basis so let's start out with the top
corners<00:00:37.590> first<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.100> how<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.550> walls<00:00:38.850> are<00:00:39.059> set

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
corners first and how the walls are set

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.510 
corners first and how the walls are set
up<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:40.290> top<00:00:40.530> left<00:00:40.770> corner<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.280> have<00:00:41.489> a

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
up so in this top left corner I have a

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.119 
up so in this top left corner I have a
set<00:00:42.000> up<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.210> one<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.660> three<00:00:42.690> walls<00:00:43.170> up<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:44.040> the

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
set up of one to three walls up in the

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.400 
set up of one to three walls up in the
corner<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.579> if<00:00:45.210> we<00:00:45.329> go<00:00:45.480> diagonally<00:00:46.230> across

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
corner and if we go diagonally across

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.190 
corner and if we go diagonally across
the<00:00:47.100> base<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> same<00:00:48.270> thing<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:49.020> as<00:00:49.110> you

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
the base it is the same thing so as you

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.080 
the base it is the same thing so as you
see<00:00:49.410> one<00:00:49.800> two<00:00:50.039> three<00:00:50.309> wells<00:00:50.460> right<00:00:50.640> there<00:00:50.879> and

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
see one two three wells right there and

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.840 
see one two three wells right there and
then<00:00:51.809> for<00:00:52.440> all<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.770> other<00:00:52.920> walls<00:00:53.250> as<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.730> if

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
then for all the other walls as in if

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.729 
then for all the other walls as in if
they<00:00:53.969> move<00:00:54.149> right<00:00:54.510> over<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.989> left<00:00:55.230> this

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
they move right over to the left this

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.369 
they move right over to the left this
bottom<00:00:56.190> left<00:00:56.399> side<00:00:56.610> has<00:00:56.760> 1<00:00:56.789> 2<00:00:57.210> 3<00:00:57.239> 4<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.930> know<00:00:58.260> I

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
bottom left side has 1 2 3 4 I know I

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.990 
bottom left side has 1 2 3 4 I know I
only<00:00:58.680> click<00:00:58.859> on<00:00:59.010> three<00:00:59.280> but<00:00:59.489> there<00:00:59.640> are<00:00:59.730> four

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
only click on three but there are four

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.029 
only click on three but there are four
there<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.420> then<00:01:01.140> if<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.320> go<00:01:01.440> diagonally

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
there and then if you go diagonally

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.380 
there and then if you go diagonally
across<00:01:02.100> from<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.489> it's<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.120> same<00:01:03.359> thing

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
across from that it's the same thing

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.380 
across from that it's the same thing
with<00:01:04.229> one<00:01:04.530> two<00:01:04.830> three<00:01:05.189> four<00:01:05.460> walls<00:01:05.700> instead<00:01:06.270> of

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
with one two three four walls instead of

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.539 
with one two three four walls instead of
just<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.930> one<00:01:07.140> space<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:08.100> if<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.340> can

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
just that one space so if you can

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.149 
just that one space so if you can
imagine<00:01:08.580> like<00:01:09.210> taking<00:01:10.140> one<00:01:10.350> corner<00:01:10.740> piece<00:01:10.950> in

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
imagine like taking one corner piece in

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.440 
imagine like taking one corner piece in
another<00:01:11.340> corner<00:01:11.610> piece<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.090> kind<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.330> like

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
another corner piece and kind of like

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.179 
another corner piece and kind of like
folding<00:01:12.869> them<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.200> each<00:01:13.320> other<00:01:13.500> that's<00:01:14.010> pretty

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
folding them to each other that's pretty

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.920 
folding them to each other that's pretty
much<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.460> same<00:01:14.700> concept<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.540> taking<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.900> look

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
much the same concept so taking a look

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.499 
much the same concept so taking a look
at<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.409> bottom<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.070> base<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.880> have<00:01:18.270> two

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
at the bottom of the base I have two

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.420 
at the bottom of the base I have two
defenses<00:01:18.990> there<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.500> lower<00:01:19.799> level<00:01:20.070> wizard

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
defenses there and a lower level wizard

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.280 
defenses there and a lower level wizard
and<00:01:20.790> then<00:01:21.240> i<00:01:21.270> have<00:01:21.330> my<00:01:21.450> clan<00:01:21.780> Council<00:01:21.960> right

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
and then i have my clan Council right

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.710 
and then i have my clan Council right
there<00:01:22.560> now<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.130> strategically<00:01:23.909> placed<00:01:24.270> my<00:01:24.420> clan

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
there now I strategically placed my clan

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.960 
there now I strategically placed my clan
castle<00:01:24.930> right<00:01:25.350> towards<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.070> bottom<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.820> not

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
castle right towards the bottom and not

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.730 
castle right towards the bottom and not
right<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.360> center<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.500> because

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
right in the center and that is because

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.580 
right in the center and that is because
the<00:01:29.520> lower<00:01:29.820> section<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.360> my<00:01:30.509> base<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.930> little

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
the lower section of my base is a little

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.740 
the lower section of my base is a little
bit<00:01:31.710> weaker<00:01:32.009> than<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.280> top<00:01:32.460> section<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.119> I

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
bit weaker than the top section and I

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.300 
bit weaker than the top section and I
will<00:01:33.900> explain<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.470> just<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.799> second<00:01:35.189> but

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
will explain that in just a second but

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.100 
will explain that in just a second but
if<00:01:35.729> we<00:01:35.850> look<00:01:35.880> towards<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.360> center<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.659> my<00:01:36.900> base

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
if we look towards the center of my base

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.179 
if we look towards the center of my base
I<00:01:37.860> have<00:01:38.310> like<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.210> five<00:01:39.600> rolls<00:01:39.930> set<00:01:40.229> up<00:01:40.380> on<00:01:40.590> that

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
I have like a five rolls set up on that

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.010 
I have like a five rolls set up on that
starts<00:01:41.520> with<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.790> air<00:01:41.970> defense<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.720> then<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
starts with the air defense and then the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.840 
starts with the air defense and then the
gold<00:01:43.229> storage<00:01:43.649> wizard<00:01:44.009> tower<00:01:44.159> gold<00:01:44.490> storage

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
gold storage wizard tower gold storage

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.880 
gold storage wizard tower gold storage
and<00:01:45.060> another<00:01:45.479> air<00:01:45.659> defense<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.470> then

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
and another air defense and then

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.469 
and another air defense and then
obviously<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.430> have<00:01:47.610> all<00:01:47.759> my<00:01:47.790> storage<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.360> in

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
obviously I have all my storage is in

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.569 
obviously I have all my storage is in
the<00:01:48.570> middle<00:01:48.750> protecting<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.530> resources<00:01:50.130> and

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
the middle protecting the resources and

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.850 
the middle protecting the resources and
then<00:01:50.939> if<00:01:51.180> we<00:01:51.329> take<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.540> look<00:01:51.659> at<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.619> right<00:01:52.829> side

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
then if we take a look at the right side

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.190 
then if we take a look at the right side
of<00:01:53.460> my<00:01:53.610> base<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:54.090> have<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.689> two<00:01:54.840> level<00:01:55.170> three

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
of my base I have the two level three

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.920 
of my base I have the two level three
Tesla's<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.159> only<00:01:56.969> three<00:01:57.240> defenses<00:01:57.719> over

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
Tesla's and only three defenses over

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.840 
Tesla's and only three defenses over
there<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.350> then<00:01:58.770> on<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.979> left<00:01:59.189> side<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.820> have

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
there and then on the left side I have

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.600 
there and then on the left side I have
for<00:02:00.390> defenses<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.170> one<00:02:01.320> Tesla<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.430> right

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
for defenses and one Tesla so the right

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.160 
for defenses and one Tesla so the right
side<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.000> little<00:02:03.090> bit<00:02:03.450> weaker<00:02:03.810> but<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.020> have

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
side is a little bit weaker but I have

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.709 
side is a little bit weaker but I have
higher<00:02:04.350> level<00:02:04.680> Tesla's<00:02:05.070> um<00:02:05.549> but<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.450> upper

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
higher level Tesla's um but the upper

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.300 
higher level Tesla's um but the upper
half<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:07.049> stronger<00:02:07.469> because<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.829> has<00:02:07.950> three

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
half is stronger because it has three

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.270 
half is stronger because it has three
mortars<00:02:08.700> all<00:02:08.910> facing<00:02:09.330> up<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.660> then

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
mortars all facing up and then

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.070 
mortars all facing up and then
has<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.520> two<00:02:10.700> stronger<00:02:11.150> wizard<00:02:11.510> towers<00:02:11.900> that
