tried that it didn't work at all doesn't
even<00:02:19.010> have<00:02:19.129> to<00:02:19.220> be<00:02:19.250> like<00:02:19.340> a<00:02:19.640> pen<00:02:20.390> with<00:02:20.540> any<00:02:20.629> ink

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
even have to be like a pen with any ink

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.229 
even have to be like a pen with any ink
in<00:02:20.989> it<00:02:21.110> which<00:02:21.980> I<00:02:22.190> actually<00:02:22.340> recommend<00:02:22.910> because

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
in it which I actually recommend because

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.059 
in it which I actually recommend because
if<00:02:23.810> you<00:02:23.930> use<00:02:24.049> one<00:02:24.200> with<00:02:24.319> in<00:02:24.410> APA<00:02:24.650> it's<00:02:24.859> going<00:02:25.010> to

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
if you use one with in APA it's going to

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.949 
if you use one with in APA it's going to
use<00:02:25.160> up<00:02:25.280> a<00:02:25.340> lot<00:02:25.370> of<00:02:25.579> ink<00:02:25.760> so<00:02:26.030> find<00:02:26.600> a<00:02:26.660> pen<00:02:26.780> that's

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
use up a lot of ink so find a pen that's

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.550 
use up a lot of ink so find a pen that's
running<00:02:27.139> out<00:02:27.380> I<00:02:27.560> think<00:02:27.799> this<00:02:27.950> one<00:02:28.100> is<00:02:28.310> anyway

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
running out I think this one is anyway

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.470 
running out I think this one is anyway
then<00:02:30.560> you're<00:02:30.650> just<00:02:30.709> going<00:02:30.920> to<00:02:30.950> try<00:02:31.100> to<00:02:31.480> do

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
then you're just going to try to do

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.940 
then you're just going to try to do
screw<00:02:32.840> lines<00:02:33.170> across<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.920> whole<00:02:34.190> thing

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.270 

just<00:02:40.950> throw<00:02:41.579> like<00:02:41.730> this<00:02:41.760> drop<00:02:42.359> a<00:02:42.780> whole<00:02:43.560> piece

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
just throw like this drop a whole piece

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.009 
just throw like this drop a whole piece
of<00:02:44.459> art<00:02:44.840> music<00:02:45.840> hands<00:02:46.409> up<00:02:46.530> that's<00:02:46.889> smoother

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
of art music hands up that's smoother

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:53.929 
of art music hands up that's smoother
still<00:02:50.719> as<00:02:51.719> I<00:02:51.900> said<00:02:52.219> don't<00:02:53.219> push<00:02:53.400> too<00:02:53.430> hard<00:02:53.579> cuz

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:53.939 
still as I said don't push too hard cuz

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:55.550 
still as I said don't push too hard cuz
they<00:02:54.030> can<00:02:54.180> rip<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.719> that'll<00:02:55.109> really<00:02:55.260> bad

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
they can rip and that'll really bad

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.410 
they can rip and that'll really bad
thing<00:02:55.769> but<00:02:56.430> if<00:02:56.489> you<00:02:56.579> do<00:02:56.670> it<00:02:56.790> right<00:02:56.909> it's<00:02:57.209> really

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
thing but if you do it right it's really

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.690 
thing but if you do it right it's really
cool<00:02:57.659> so<00:02:58.560> go<00:02:58.709> home<00:02:58.859> process<00:02:59.280> what<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.549> half

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
cool so go home process what the half

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.459 
cool so go home process what the half
invisible<00:03:00.329> things<00:03:00.540> just<00:03:00.989> demonstrations

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:01.469 
invisible things just demonstrations

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:09.679 
invisible things just demonstrations
like<00:03:04.760> that<00:03:06.709> okay<00:03:07.879> that's<00:03:08.879> just<00:03:09.120> like<00:03:09.269> a<00:03:09.419> rough

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:09.689 
like that okay that's just like a rough

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.629 
like that okay that's just like a rough
version<00:03:09.870> of<00:03:10.169> what<00:03:10.349> I<00:03:10.379> would<00:03:10.530> usually<00:03:10.650> do<00:03:10.950> then

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
version of what I would usually do then

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.240 
version of what I would usually do then
take<00:03:12.060> your<00:03:12.180> exacto<00:03:12.450> knife<00:03:12.829> go<00:03:13.829> up<00:03:13.889> to<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.099> very

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
take your exacto knife go up to the very

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.050 
take your exacto knife go up to the very
edge<00:03:14.459> of<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:14.639> paper

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
edge of the paper

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.209 
edge of the paper
from<00:03:15.599> the<00:03:15.689> newspaper<00:03:15.840> cut<00:03:16.500> then<00:03:17.419> cut<00:03:18.419> off<00:03:18.599> the

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:19.219 
from the newspaper cut then cut off the

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:22.610 
from the newspaper cut then cut off the
edges<00:03:20.219> of<00:03:20.669> the<00:03:21.659> tape<00:03:21.870> that<00:03:22.169> are<00:03:22.260> pulling<00:03:22.439> it

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
edges of the tape that are pulling it

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.979 
edges of the tape that are pulling it
down<00:03:22.799> and<00:03:23.389> then<00:03:24.389> you'll<00:03:24.510> be<00:03:24.540> able<00:03:24.689> to<00:03:24.840> pick<00:03:24.959> it

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
down and then you'll be able to pick it

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.740 
down and then you'll be able to pick it
up<00:03:25.169> and<00:03:26.659> see<00:03:27.659> the<00:03:27.870> meat<00:03:29.150> always<00:03:30.150> close<00:03:30.719> your

really cool effects here's why I did the

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:40.330 
really cool effects here's why I did the
other<00:04:35.750> day<00:04:38.020> some<00:04:39.020> graph<00:04:39.500> paper<00:04:39.530> if<00:04:40.069> I<00:04:40.190> my

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
other day some graph paper if I my

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.879 
other day some graph paper if I my
school<00:04:41.169> maybe<00:04:42.169> hardest<00:04:42.530> because<00:04:42.620> there's

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
school maybe hardest because there's

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.240 
school maybe hardest because there's
something<00:04:43.039> on<00:04:43.190> the<00:04:43.250> other<00:04:43.280> side<00:04:43.430> but<00:04:45.129> it's<00:04:46.129> a
