00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.910
 and we're already back here in our romi theater and house testing room 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.250
 digital we have already received 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.160
 other manufacturers that advocates passive 3d technology 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.029
 today we are here with Raphael to find the sanction or veto of evil 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.099
 for the worse 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.220
 the formal sitting 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:30.039
 different from the other manufacturer defends another 3d technology is the active 3d 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.319
 this screen 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:35.050
 What we are seeing here with the speech was lacking with more on this tv 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.660
 this in technology will do 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.800
 what are the big benefits besides active crisis technology 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.020
 as to the first place after losing the little saint 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.530
 ric is more modern 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.530
 I doubt the maximum possible quality because the final consumer 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.080
 I got it very different. 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.720
 and we're looking for a field 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.730
 the best band 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.730
 my differential because that's it 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.290
 vice leader of the key 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.760
 why they continue to have a consumer difficulty 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.510
 however the agreement with tv that varies from 4 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.270
 and has a 3d image is preserved 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.450
 the Democratic Deputies 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.390
 then you will understand then when you put on an active glasses 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.270
 after the TV is preserved if the preservation in each of the mothers is the 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.590
 consumer to spend what happens with the goal of delivering the maximum life 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.400
 each one of them 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.400
 the retired sister 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.290
 And then with the laptop. 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.910
 to live together 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.890
 he connects each patient to some victim 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.050
 politely 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.780
 only part of the screen 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.740
 and then it opens and closes 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.740
 the setting of penalty 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.099
 the registration of the closing 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.099
 anthony malkin military 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:17.689
 that's when you talk 

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:21.559
 because it's not like this 

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:29.369
 I had a run 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.429
 it was too good 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:35.299
 arrives to the part of those 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.339
 the frontier striker 

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:41.639
 The grace is interesting that this sudden in the plans the pink filter to 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.259
 people year 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:47.069
 This brazilian filter was developed in North Korea and speaks little about itself. 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.839
 this accessory sense it will be used in point-of-sale promotion of 

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:53.249
 consumer believes in this in the 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:56.439
 then how does active technology work so that the goal is that the 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:57.649
 up next year 

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:59.219
 the panel is the same 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:03.189
 is the way the adobe software party has been working in those three months none 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:04.339
 difference 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:07.599
 this panel there is not much difference in the panel 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.209
 when you go to technology 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:11.219
 passive 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:14.649
 there is a filter not over the top panel 

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:18.719
 that divided paredÃ£o in little piece then practically to divide more everything 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:21.409
 makes more groups 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.669
 after passing through the filter is divided by these lines 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:28.019
 and ariela to play little bit of luck with our conversion 

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:31.789
 there will be no 

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:34.109
 I do not have much help, please. 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.489
 that's why it marks the river bowl and 30 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.439
 companies such as sound 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:43.859
 every hotel has tried carlota account 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.859
 this is another episode of modesty participate here 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.939
 A maximum of 15 40 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:54.029
 the proposal 

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:57.029
 you almost whistled glasses now 

00:03:57.529 --> 00:04:01.389
 well we have one the models that with accompanies the classic had the idea is 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:04.989
 that this is a mere myth are mere god of the past year that come with the 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.569
 treta epoch of the cacimbo of 58 thousand lives the deposit 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.949
 if you will have yes to keep on top of own line 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:13.230
 and how such a decision 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.289
 right here 

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:16.299
 right 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.299
 he accompanies with the scoreboard 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.299
 are votes to win four thousand 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.049
 2010 is the same model there same model 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.060
 she belatedly can and should maintain practically the same team 

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:33.219
 cooperative we are not bringing the cost of transportation said 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.020
 more confortable 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.990
 which is sold separately as an accessory 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.419
 where you can have 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.909
 although they were slightly lighter and much more compound 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:45.860
 pinto monkey 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.300
 it's incoming 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.380
 we also have another intermediate model that will complain with the 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:55.570
 final price to the consumer the game from here short percent he will leave for 3 7 9 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.169
 3 7 years everton the others 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.080
 Perondi who had it as 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.180
 few because the 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.660
 the asset he has a new technology began to see with that in the career to 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.360
 main tip 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.759
 the loaded osb 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.419
 and what should 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:18.629
 perfect is that the difference of the other 2010 is very complicated ambulances 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:21.839
 were sent old 

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:25.089
 no further restrictions 

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:27.189
 5 

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:30.189
 completely different situation 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.580
 and you can comment how many votes you had 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:41.569
 and one or the other 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:45.020
 not everyone has differentiated is loading loading blocks with 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.860
 3min 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.870
 it happens positively the stretch of via usb the chrysler 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:51.720
 right 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.409
 He must have come up 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:56.080
 It's loading three minutes. 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.080
 the theme 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:03.969
 cel if you charge for 30min 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.060
 which we have one more dead and 45 to have the same time as the two 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.939
 manufacturers 

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:13.689
 I have come up with some final considerations on 

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:16.810
 technology the pass some differential was left out 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.820
 I think I have to account also for a good viewing angle 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.159
 active technology nutrition 

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:26.679
 they have been much sought after by the genome moves 

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:30.879
 the uncle of the victim 

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:37.400
 the omission of the police 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.720
 the other the differential for what the other is possible today because it is a 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.849
 south of the wetland 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:45.849
 is a marta quality athlete 

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:47.469
 what image 

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:49.110
 has a greater brightness 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.110
 remarked 

00:06:57.839 --> 00:07:00.839
 you see this distortion that's why we have 

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:03.300
 to show dexterity 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.330
 of the condominium 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.809
 his toys 

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:09.809
 and mostly erase the picture buy a gun 

00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:13.869
 which today costs the same volume that motivates 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.830
 the mother at the time the team 

00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:33.209
 with these were the final considerations the opera and the sentra wait for the 

00:07:33.209 --> 00:07:37.840
 coverage of this historical weight is that the two technologies of 3 3 

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.150
 in our July issue of the journal I broke the surgical technique
