00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.310
And there,
my simple Bagna Cauda is ready to serve.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.200
I would like you to try one with your choice of vegetables.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.140
Hello, again.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.140
Today,
I am going to make my simple Bagna Cauda.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.530
Then ingredients are as follows;

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.960
Garlic, anchovy, milk, olive oil, salt and...

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.070
Fresh vegetables that you want to eat.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.740
Now, let's get started.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.240
Let's get started.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.640
First,
simmer the garlic cloves.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.650
The garlic (diced).

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:47.400
Then add just enough water to barely cover the garlic.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.400
Turn on heat.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.490
by simmering the garlic,
you can get rid of the garlic smell.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:07.430
When it has come to a boil like this,
reduce the heat.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.280
And simmer until the liquid is gone.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.960
Here, the liquid has been gone like this.
Add the milk.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.300
The milk.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.030
In the same way, simmer until the liquid is gone.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.840
But if the milk boils too hard,
it becomes separated the protein.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.400
Simmer until the liquid is gone, 
but do not boil.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:49.510
Look, they just have simmered like this, 
mush with a spatula.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.710
They are just soft like a boiled potato.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.170
They have already removed the garlic strong smell.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:10.880
Next,
add the anchovy fillets (chopped).

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.420
The chopped anchovy.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.710
Briefly stir each.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:27.930
Then, add the olive oil.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.520
Then, mix in.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.650
Finally,
cook on low heat for more 10 minutes.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.810
Here, 10 minutes passed.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.580
During simmering, mash the sauce with the spatula.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.290
Make a thick paste, like this.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.680
It's aromatic.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.100
Turn off the heat, and move to a dish.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.980
It looks delicious!

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.530
Place to a serving dish

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.490
Here, it's ready to serve.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.730
And there,
my simple and easy Bagna Cauda is ready to serve.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.200
I would like you to try one with your choice of vegetables.
