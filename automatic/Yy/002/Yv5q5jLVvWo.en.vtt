won't even work period and then you have
to<00:02:32.519> do<00:02:32.640> this<00:02:32.819> crap<00:02:33.980> but<00:02:35.630> if<00:02:36.630> that<00:02:36.989> happens

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560

no<00:02:40.590> actually<00:02:41.040> way<00:02:41.340> besides<00:02:42.060> that<00:02:42.540> just

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
no actually way besides that just

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.110 
no actually way besides that just
waiting<00:02:43.709> for<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.160> actually<00:02:44.459> load<00:02:44.940> up<00:02:47.120> then

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
waiting for it to actually load up then

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.720 
waiting for it to actually load up then

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
won't so it's it's a win-lose situation

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.370 
won't so it's it's a win-lose situation

if it's above first prestige then
there's<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.620> chance<00:03:28.829> that<00:03:29.010> it<00:03:29.100> will<00:03:29.190> not<00:03:29.370> stay

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
there's a chance that it will not stay
