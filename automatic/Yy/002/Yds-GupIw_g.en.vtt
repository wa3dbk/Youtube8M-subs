for<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.730> part<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:34.070> yeah<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.360> this

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
for this part so yeah this is this this

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.479 
for this part so yeah this is this this
part<00:00:38.790> 18<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.420> gonna<00:00:39.930> be<00:00:40.110> shorter<00:00:40.530> because<00:00:40.710> I

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
part 18 is gonna be shorter because I

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.959 
part 18 is gonna be shorter because I
can<00:00:42.300> find<00:00:42.570> anything<00:00:42.809> any<00:00:43.620> emissions<00:00:44.129> are<00:00:44.309> sure

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
can find anything any emissions are sure

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.750 
can find anything any emissions are sure
enough<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.329> fix<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.719> but<00:00:46.379> now<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:47.309> YouTube

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
enough to fix it but now that YouTube

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.760 
enough to fix it but now that YouTube
made<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.030> new<00:00:48.239> thingy<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.289> could<00:00:49.590> have

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
made a new thingy that you could have

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.459 
made a new thingy that you could have
your<00:00:49.890> videos<00:00:50.280> up<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.579> 15<00:00:50.940> minutes<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.870> can

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
your videos up to 15 minutes so I can

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.330 
your videos up to 15 minutes so I can
have<00:00:52.739> more<00:00:53.960> more<00:00:54.960> footage<00:00:55.260> into<00:00:55.530> an<00:00:55.800> out<00:00:55.980> are

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
have more more footage into an out are

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.970 
have more more footage into an out are
not<00:00:56.850> under<00:00:57.270> alignments<00:00:58.050> anymore<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:58.710> that's

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
not under alignments anymore so that's

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.510 
not under alignments anymore so that's
good<00:00:59.539> so<00:01:00.539> that's<00:01:01.199> why<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.440> means<00:01:01.890> more<00:01:02.190> less

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
good so that's why that means more less

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.280 
good so that's why that means more less
editing<00:01:03.030> for<00:01:03.300> me<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:05.240> I<00:01:06.240> think<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:07.020> next

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
missions it is uh it's a death rates so

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.140 
missions it is uh it's a death rates so
