 research the blue world ong puts in 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.970
 alerts the Peruvian authorities about

 shark killing is a crime 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.960
 ecological in a law is not a 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.570
 and administrative order the fishery is 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.990
 a law creates that penal code punishable with 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.240
 3 to 5 years ecological crime taking into 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.880
 account that a dolphin has a calf each 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.980
 3 years in the 90's there was a 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.590
 law on indiscriminate hunting of 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.530
 dolphin according to studies in those years 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.320
 there were only 20,000 species 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.140
 consumption in the nineties we had a 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.360
 direct human consumption that was too much 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.030
 Up to 20 thousand dolphins were fished for 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.860
 human consumption endangered the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.479
 survival of the species for which 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.160
 this law was created ok 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.250
 the boats that are used to 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.830
 the realization of this ecological crime 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.290
 they remain 24 days a month at sea and 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.090
 40 miles from the Peruvian coast 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.580
 presumes that they are fishermen 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.710
 allegedly financed crafts 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.450
 by companies not yet identified 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.090
 considering using 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.850
 boats valued at more than 30 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.729
 thousand dollars the institute of the Peruvian sea 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.130
 imarpe recommended that in the absence of 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.770
 everything is allowed fishing for others 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.310
 sharks but is not allowed the 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.770
 works 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.409
 ska of this species but unfortunately 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.710
 more than 10 years ago this group is already 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.570
 about fish for which about 65 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.369
 years were Marbella votes of 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.320
 government institutions began to 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.929
 recommend good I'm no longer like 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.789
 fish then lopez is great some 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.489
 of the alternatives that present us 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.530
 the managers of this NGO is to feed 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.540
 to sharks with squid and not with 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.519
 dolphins in order not to 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.519
 propitiate the extinction of this species
