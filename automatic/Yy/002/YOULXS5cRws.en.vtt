00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 yes hello together group more 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.330
 unboxing video here on the channel we 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.250
 here are the g-forces twelve games 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.570
 Storm event now covers completely new on the 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.759
 market as always provided by 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.040
 Thanks a lot for all that 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.839
 also in the video description and yes 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.600
 the walls are a bit more elaborate 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.369
 Two are still set up at the 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.670
 Do not pay five like the intro packs 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:27.330
 we have the event ceiling here 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.550
 and spoil that but I wanted to agree 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.990
 look go behind it so the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.300
 Products idea is that you see the showcase 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.710
 I can play vettel level 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.210
 a bit wary as still 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.590
 a little bit off but they 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.660
 just deliver a much better 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.710
 grundstock than they cost in pÃ©cs yes 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.230
 also a few euros more 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.940
 but we have good cards for that 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.739
 come and arrive is four times 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.370
 much more in there and in there 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.809
 Immediately a sideboard so 15 cards 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.070
 and between the round addition to 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.079
 actually plays my best of street 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.879
 so you have magic between the round 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.710
 deck on the counterpart a bit 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.320
 then we can reshape and adapt 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.409
 always the two brochures once to the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.909
 way and how to play magic the infos 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.140
 After all, of course, also contributes here 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.750
 Then we have a coach 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.290
 around main deck and sideboard from each other 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.729
 separate and yes we'll look at it 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.220
 all grossly could now talk to then 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.090
 you get the idea like that 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.439
 works in the end, you can also find how 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.810
 to shake a link to the track 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.220
 where I then directly each card in the 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.200
 discuss detail and also from dirt 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.369
 just a few improvements 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.439
 then give and yes I should that 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.000
 someone a bit apart 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.700
 so they are actually pretty colorful 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.560
 but who still gives me a slight splash so 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.040
 the dext actually smoke green blue 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.659
 so light red share something completely new 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.060
 for the event experts so far still there 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.619
 not a three-color event, I think 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.009
 should have countries where we get 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:54.049
 you can sacrifice yourself twice at sacrifice 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.049
 then select standard country by choice 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.160
 47 inputs and serene 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.070
 They are standard countries in total 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.190
 also a mountain as mentioned as 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.860
 easy roadster can take a look 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.900
 It's a pretty high turn 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.130
 I could say so in advance 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.310
 look at that so we try 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.010
 much more to produce and then 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.360
 Swiss expensive fur to play and we 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.070
 would definitely be about creature and 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.440
 The stages help the four arbors 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.090
 So forests actually become the first 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.620
 defense we have fog banks the 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.750
 that is because they do not have a fight and 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.930
 also do not make 0 2 fly defenders 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.030
 we have three probably very beautiful 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.170
 with other 21 hurry they come 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.870
 again when they die 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.120
 pretty good then more grams or what 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.730
 to pick out the canon two countries 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.250
 runners here like the first row respectively 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.020
 flash the fashion in nature for 444 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.760
 We can call these cancer form fans 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.290
 but play and other green returns 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.320
 Turks comment Turks as if they were 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.610
 on glittering so all ours can 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.350
 drove the greens are as of hans but 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.950
 this is very much about the opponent 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.330
 to surprise 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.270
 then we also left spirit very much 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.310
 nice against abo 633 flying that 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.750
 you can enter the playing field for that 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.010
 g have class and the competitors 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.959
 not so long left on the 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.150
 Field is definitely that 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.820
 nice then he manier here in this 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.410
 deck is a push request verdi porto 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.330
 had played very often played 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.430
 card which is worth a few euros 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.170
 very strong for 553 when the playing field 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.510
 Enter blade 5 live in the games and 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.890
 as leaves there are 33 green bit 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.870
 plays really strong is also one 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.060
 I will give you a lot of nice energy 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.580
 the filiago will be showing at the same time 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.350
 flat silver holds 12 44 with halls 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.780
 he bound himself and a strong one 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.900
 plus 4 + 4 right really strong and 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.970
 everyone navigate only for the fall request 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.850
 meant for six men 55 souls 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.840
 tied as long as he is with a creature 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.370
 it is much more connected and the creature is connected 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.780
 for two times from how this creature ins 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.670
 exile and then bring it under your 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.170
 control back to the game of course 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.080
 really cool with the stoos request in 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.030
 later game for two fix exile 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.769
 Injured game gives a token he 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.320
 Immediately come back in there are five lives 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:01.019
 So really nice synergy here on 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.959
 start left and do are new cards 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:06.000
 and then we have the good ones 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.710
 green zones best for 766 if that's it 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.560
 matchfield 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:12.200
 so you can this criminal creature 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.570
 let's fight so they will fit together 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.210
 each other's strength to us of course 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:21.560
 very strong with this pretty strong 

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:23.210
 creatures 46 yes, do not look for forests 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.940
 cards out of course is good in the 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.680
 Broad away very strong attack 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.210
 Creatures removal shoots damage in 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.400
 amount of departure of your countries here 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.350
 again a bit in the form of the 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.480
 glowing refuge points of life and 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.160
 additional times after also the beautiful one 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.690
 Sequences of the knitted destroyed one 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.760
 permanent so not one 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.320
 Creatures permanent card of the company 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.870
 shoot down planpotter and 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.390
 Finally, the city development for 5 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.280
 Drag or drop three x mas cards 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:53.420
 play additional land 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.820
 we have a lot of strong creatures 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.100
 that is here as well as the goal of this 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.320
 textes times tricolor as event I very much 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.750
 nice nice energy output request and 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.760
 the navigate nice synergies 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.170
 Every case has you here now 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.000
 maybe spontaneously 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.270
 we always wanted exactly the sideboard 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.530
 then you can see on the left 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.300
 click on the deck check if directly 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.160
 you want other unboxing forwarded 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.630
 you can see the storm approach 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.620
 right click in any case with you 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.620
 Have a nice day until soon
