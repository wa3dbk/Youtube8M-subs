options and so you know we obviously we

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.100 
options and so you know we obviously we
should<00:01:54.119> have<00:01:54.210> went<00:01:54.329> back<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.720> core<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:54.930> our

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
should have went back to the core of our

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.569 
should have went back to the core of our
game<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.560> make<00:01:55.680> sure<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.130> was<00:01:56.310> sound

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
game and make sure that that was sound

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.039 
game and make sure that that was sound
and<00:01:56.850> would<00:01:57.060> still<00:01:57.270> works<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.600> free-to-play

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
and would still works a free-to-play

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.539 
and would still works a free-to-play
game<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.530> then<00:01:58.649> just<00:01:58.799> continue<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.280> iterate

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
game and then just continue to iterate

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.209 
game and then just continue to iterate
on<00:01:59.729> that<00:02:00.000> well<00:02:00.600> really<00:02:00.869> letting<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.409> sort<00:02:02.159> of

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
on that well really letting the sort of

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.800 
on that well really letting the sort of
monetization<00:02:02.700> free-to-play<00:02:03.240> elements<00:02:03.630> grow

around it we didn't want to become a
business<00:02:05.909> model<00:02:06.060> looking<00:02:06.450> for<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.659> game

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
business model looking for a game

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.169 
business model looking for a game
we'd<00:02:06.979> rather<00:02:07.130> make<00:02:07.280> a<00:02:07.370> great<00:02:07.580> game<00:02:07.790> then<00:02:08.030> work

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
out how to make money off of it and that

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.710 
out how to make money off of it and that
was<00:02:10.399> when<00:02:10.580> we<00:02:10.729> were<00:02:10.819> a<00:02:10.880> box<00:02:11.120> product<00:02:11.450> that<00:02:11.600> was

was when we were a box product that was

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.180 
was when we were a box product that was
the<00:02:11.780> case<00:02:11.959> and<00:02:12.230> it's<00:02:12.319> still<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.770> case<00:02:12.950> now

the case and it's still the case now

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.740 
the case and it's still the case now
we'd<00:02:13.790> all<00:02:13.940> starting<00:02:14.300> out<00:02:14.390> with<00:02:14.510> three

broken<00:02:27.170> record<00:02:27.290> but<00:02:27.730> we<00:02:28.730> would<00:02:29.360> like<00:02:29.540> to<00:02:29.690> add

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
broken record but we would like to add

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.390 
broken record but we would like to add
more<00:02:29.959> factions<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.650> game<00:02:30.800> I<00:02:31.040> mean<00:02:31.190> there's

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
more factions to the game I mean there's

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.370 
more factions to the game I mean there's
certainly<00:02:31.760> been<00:02:31.850> demand<00:02:32.390> for<00:02:32.630> us<00:02:32.930> faction

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
certainly been demand for us faction

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.180 
certainly been demand for us faction
which<00:02:33.530> could<00:02:33.650> be<00:02:33.739> something<00:02:33.920> would<00:02:34.130> be

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
which could be something would be

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.860 
which could be something would be
interesting<00:02:34.610> to<00:02:34.640> do<00:02:34.820> given<00:02:35.660> that<00:02:35.690> the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
interesting to do given that the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.410 
interesting to do given that the
European<00:02:36.260> Union<00:02:36.560> in<00:02:36.650> this<00:02:36.739> game<00:02:36.920> basically

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
European Union in this game basically

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.729 
European Union in this game basically
replaces<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.810> u.s.<00:02:39.080> three<00:02:39.230> generals<00:02:39.560> one

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
replaces the u.s. three generals one

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.800 
replaces the u.s. three generals one
they<00:02:39.920> have<00:02:40.010> a<00:02:40.070> lot<00:02:40.220> of<00:02:40.250> commonalities<00:02:40.940> so<00:02:41.600> it's

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
they have a lot of commonalities so it's

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.300 
they have a lot of commonalities so it's
how<00:02:41.959> do<00:02:42.020> we<00:02:42.170> bring<00:02:42.560> us<00:02:42.890> and<00:02:43.070> make<00:02:43.160> them

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
how do we bring us and make them

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.080 
how do we bring us and make them
interesting<00:02:43.520> but<00:02:44.480> we<00:02:44.870> like<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.470> also<00:02:46.090> keep

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
interesting but we like to also keep

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.699 
interesting but we like to also keep
adding<00:02:47.360> generals<00:02:47.750> there's<00:02:48.260> one<00:02:48.320> of<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.560> joys

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
adding generals there's one of the joys

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.110 
adding generals there's one of the joys
of<00:02:48.890> generals<00:02:49.220> is<00:02:49.370> as<00:02:49.489> we<00:02:49.640> had<00:02:49.730> more<00:02:49.850> game<00:02:50.090> modes

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
of generals is as we had more game modes

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.180 
of generals is as we had more game modes
you<00:02:50.930> can<00:02:50.959> start<00:02:51.230> going<00:02:51.470> what<00:02:51.980> would<00:02:52.100> be

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
you can start going what would be

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.650 
you can start going what would be
awesome<00:02:52.220> for<00:02:52.459> this<00:02:52.670> mode<00:02:52.940> would<00:02:53.120> be<00:02:53.239> a<00:02:53.269> general

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
awesome for this mode would be a general

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.210 
awesome for this mode would be a general
that<00:02:53.840> does<00:02:54.019> these<00:02:54.230> things<00:02:54.290> so<00:02:54.950> it's<00:02:55.070> the

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
that does these things so it's the

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.580 
that does these things so it's the
breadth<00:02:55.459> of<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.790> core<00:02:55.970> gameplay<00:02:56.000> its<00:02:56.510> fans<00:02:56.780> we

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
breadth of the core gameplay its fans we

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.199 
breadth of the core gameplay its fans we
have<00:02:57.709> more<00:02:57.920> opportunities<00:02:58.400> to<00:02:58.430> add<00:02:58.700> generals

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
have more opportunities to add generals

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.240 
have more opportunities to add generals
and<00:02:59.450> generals<00:03:00.140> come<00:03:00.380> with<00:03:00.530> unit<00:03:00.830> structures

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
and generals come with unit structures

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.100 
and generals come with unit structures
powers<00:03:01.610> so<00:03:01.850> it<00:03:02.330> will<00:03:02.540> keep<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:02.870> game<00:03:03.019> universe

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
powers so it will keep the game universe

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.410 
powers so it will keep the game universe
and<00:03:03.560> by<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.130> time<00:03:04.250> we've<00:03:04.610> tapped<00:03:04.850> out<00:03:05.120> the

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
and by the time we've tapped out the

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.880 
and by the time we've tapped out the
existing<00:03:06.050> factions<00:03:06.470> we<00:03:06.560> will<00:03:06.680> have<00:03:06.769> new

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
existing factions we will have new

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.410 
existing factions we will have new
faction<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.370> play<00:03:07.550> with<00:03:07.760> hopefully<00:03:08.150> how<00:03:08.360> do

faction to play with hopefully how do

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.420 
faction to play with hopefully how do

you build a believable world out of a

really<00:04:34.080> good<00:04:34.229> for<00:04:34.380> that<00:04:34.530> because<00:04:34.680> it<00:04:34.830> allows

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
really good for that because it allows

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.650 
really good for that because it allows
us<00:04:35.340> to<00:04:35.490> be<00:04:35.580> a<00:04:35.610> little<00:04:35.789> more<00:04:35.910> experimental

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
us to be a little more experimental

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.629 
us to be a little more experimental
because<00:04:37.139> our<00:04:37.680> tss<00:04:38.099> are<00:04:38.250> a<00:04:38.280> little<00:04:38.460> bit

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
because our tss are a little bit

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:39.980 
because our tss are a little bit
intimidating<00:04:39.180> as<00:04:39.240> a<00:04:39.360> genre<00:04:39.389> if<00:04:39.720> you're<00:04:39.840> not<00:04:39.930> a

down a bunch of money though so diff I
with<00:05:12.150> RTS<00:05:12.539> I've<00:05:12.690> always<00:05:12.840> thought<00:05:13.289> we<00:05:13.560> never

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
with RTS I've always thought we never

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.140 
with RTS I've always thought we never
had<00:05:13.889> our<00:05:13.919> Unreal<00:05:14.250> Tournament<00:05:14.280> moment<00:05:14.940> we

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
had our Unreal Tournament moment we

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.249 
had our Unreal Tournament moment we
never<00:05:15.330> had<00:05:15.539> that<00:05:15.659> thing<00:05:15.840> where<00:05:15.990> something

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:16.259 
never had that thing where something

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:17.480 
never had that thing where something
like<00:05:16.320> oh<00:05:16.500> there's<00:05:16.710> more<00:05:16.830> than<00:05:16.979> death<00:05:17.099> match<00:05:17.310> we

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
like oh there's more than death match we

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:18.740 
like oh there's more than death match we
can<00:05:17.520> do<00:05:17.669> cap<00:05:17.849> to<00:05:17.940> the<00:05:18.030> flag<00:05:18.240> or<00:05:18.449> we<00:05:18.509> can<00:05:18.659> do

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
can do cap to the flag or we can do

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.779 
can do cap to the flag or we can do
whatever<00:05:18.960> so<00:05:19.620> we're<00:05:19.770> trying<00:05:20.159> to<00:05:20.340> try<00:05:20.729> to

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:20.789 
whatever so we're trying to try to

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:22.189 
whatever so we're trying to try to
provide<00:05:21.120> that<00:05:21.180> but<00:05:21.659> we<00:05:21.720> also<00:05:21.840> want<00:05:22.080> to<00:05:22.139> provide

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 
provide that but we also want to provide

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:23.930 
provide that but we also want to provide
mode<00:05:22.560> sorta<00:05:22.889> more<00:05:23.070> akin<00:05:23.430> to<00:05:23.490> sort<00:05:23.789> of<00:05:23.849> your

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
mode sorta more akin to sort of your

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.700 
mode sorta more akin to sort of your
traditional<00:05:24.060> RTS<00:05:24.630> experience<00:05:25.289> where<00:05:25.680> you

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
traditional RTS experience where you

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.350 
traditional RTS experience where you
know<00:05:25.979> something<00:05:26.669> it<00:05:26.759> might<00:05:26.880> be<00:05:27.060> a<00:05:27.090> little<00:05:27.210> more

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
know something it might be a little more

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.670 
know something it might be a little more
narrative<00:05:27.570> driven<00:05:27.930> or<00:05:28.169> something<00:05:28.500> very

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
narrative driven or something very

narrative driven or something very
objective<00:05:29.190> play<00:05:29.639> driven<00:05:30.030> rather<00:05:30.270> than<00:05:30.449> just

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
objective play driven rather than just

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.600 
objective play driven rather than just

dead we're in the middle actually of

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:36.589 
dead we're in the middle actually of

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:36.599 
sort of built it er ating on the concept

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:38.600 
sort of built it er ating on the concept
to<00:05:36.719> the<00:05:36.870> larger<00:05:37.349> metagame<00:05:37.740> surrounding<00:05:38.490> our

to the larger metagame surrounding our

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.760 
to the larger metagame surrounding our
core<00:05:38.849> gameplay<00:05:39.090> and<00:05:39.599> it's<00:05:40.440> obviously<00:05:40.710> a

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
core gameplay and it's obviously a

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:41.870 
core gameplay and it's obviously a
pretty<00:05:40.949> big<00:05:41.099> challenge<00:05:41.280> because<00:05:41.520> again<00:05:41.789> you

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
pretty big challenge because again you

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.339 
pretty big challenge because again you
don't<00:05:42.000> want<00:05:42.210> to<00:05:42.270> break<00:05:42.509> the<00:05:42.719> strategy<00:05:43.139> of<00:05:43.169> your

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
don't want to break the strategy of your

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:46.010 
don't want to break the strategy of your
game<00:05:43.560> where<00:05:44.400> if<00:05:44.520> you<00:05:44.669> can<00:05:44.849> level<00:05:45.630> your<00:05:45.780> way<00:05:45.870> up

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
game where if you can level your way up

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.659 
game where if you can level your way up
to<00:05:46.050> where<00:05:46.259> that<00:05:46.380> makes<00:05:46.560> you<00:05:46.740> just

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669 
to where that makes you just

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:50.190 
to where that makes you just
fundamentally<00:05:48.210> better<00:05:48.479> than<00:05:48.780> another<00:05:49.020> player

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
fundamentally better than another player

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.410 
fundamentally better than another player
that<00:05:50.380> can<00:05:50.530> be<00:05:50.650> problematic<00:05:50.830> so<00:05:51.460> if<00:05:51.610> we<00:05:52.030> did

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.420 
that can be problematic so if we did

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.640 
that can be problematic so if we did
what<00:05:52.540> we<00:05:52.570> don't<00:05:52.750> have<00:05:52.870> anything<00:05:53.050> specific<00:05:53.200> to

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
what we don't have anything specific to

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.320 
what we don't have anything specific to
discuss<00:05:54.130> yes<00:05:54.370> we're<00:05:54.760> actually<00:05:54.910> in<00:05:55.090> the<00:05:55.150> middle

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
discuss yes we're actually in the middle

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:56.910 
discuss yes we're actually in the middle
of<00:05:55.390> full<00:05:55.690> development<00:05:55.930> of<00:05:56.260> that<00:05:56.410> to<00:05:56.560> work<00:05:56.710> out

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:56.920 
of full development of that to work out

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.830 
of full development of that to work out
we've<00:05:57.640> tried<00:05:57.880> a<00:05:57.910> couple<00:05:58.090> things<00:05:58.420> that<00:05:58.630> we

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
we've tried a couple things that we

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.570 
we've tried a couple things that we
haven't<00:05:59.170> been<00:05:59.320> happy<00:05:59.500> with<00:05:59.740> and<00:06:00.100> we're<00:06:00.400> kind

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
haven't been happy with and we're kind

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.370 
haven't been happy with and we're kind
of<00:06:00.670> ablated<00:06:01.240> if<00:06:01.330> something<00:06:01.660> we're<00:06:02.110> not<00:06:02.230> happy

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
of ablated if something we're not happy

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.410 
of ablated if something we're not happy
with<00:06:02.590> something<00:06:02.890> most<00:06:03.550> likely<00:06:03.940> it's<00:06:04.210> going<00:06:04.330> to

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:04.420 
with something most likely it's going to

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.790 
with something most likely it's going to
suck<00:06:04.600> for<00:06:04.810> everyone<00:06:05.080> else<00:06:05.260> so<00:06:05.470> we'd<00:06:05.620> rather

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
suck for everyone else so we'd rather

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.040 
suck for everyone else so we'd rather
keep<00:06:06.640> it<00:06:06.790> close<00:06:07.000> to<00:06:07.030> the<00:06:07.210> chest<00:06:07.270> and<00:06:07.720> iterate

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
keep it close to the chest and iterate

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.300 
keep it close to the chest and iterate
until<00:06:08.080> we<00:06:08.410> get<00:06:08.530> it<00:06:08.620> to<00:06:08.710> a<00:06:08.770> point<00:06:08.890> of<00:06:08.980> goodness

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
until we get it to a point of goodness

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.970 
until we get it to a point of goodness
and<00:06:09.370> then<00:06:09.550> roll<00:06:09.700> it<00:06:09.850> out
