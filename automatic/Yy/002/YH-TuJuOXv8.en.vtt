let anybody use them for any other
purpose<00:00:33.500> you<00:00:34.500> need<00:00:34.710> measuring<00:00:35.579> something<00:00:36.000> to

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
purpose you need measuring something to

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.670 
purpose you need measuring something to
measure<00:00:36.390> with<00:00:36.690> but<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.050> know<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.170> can<00:00:37.469> use<00:00:37.500> a

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
measure with but you know I can use a

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.150 
measure with but you know I can use a
ruler<00:00:38.010> -<00:00:38.309> but<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.940> really<00:00:39.210> easy<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:40.160> some

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
ruler - but this is really easy and some

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.670 
ruler - but this is really easy and some
elastic<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.120> doesn't<00:00:42.450> really<00:00:42.600> matter<00:00:42.930> too

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
elastic and it doesn't really matter too

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.220 
elastic and it doesn't really matter too
much<00:00:43.789> how<00:00:44.789> thick<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.840> don't<00:00:45.989> think

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
much how thick it is I don't think

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.650 
much how thick it is I don't think
anyway<00:00:46.860> I've<00:00:47.010> used<00:00:47.610> only<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.120> quarter<00:00:48.480> inch

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
anyway I've used only the quarter inch

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.529 
anyway I've used only the quarter inch
but<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.050> think<00:00:49.320> you've<00:00:49.469> seen<00:00:49.980> other<00:00:50.760> tutorials

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
but I think you've seen other tutorials

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.020 
but I think you've seen other tutorials
where<00:00:51.719> they<00:00:51.809> use<00:00:51.989> thicker<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:53.219> also<00:00:53.520> need<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
where they use thicker you also need the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.639 
where they use thicker you also need the
most<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.449> star<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.930> show<00:00:55.170> tool<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:57.300> need

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
most the star the show tool and you need

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.920 
most the star the show tool and you need
about<00:00:58.649> 10<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.250> 12<00:00:59.550> yards<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.359> for<00:01:00.600> an<00:01:00.690> adult

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
about 10 to 12 yards of it for an adult

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.330 
about 10 to 12 yards of it for an adult
to<00:01:01.109> do

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
to do

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.780 
to do
I<00:01:02.399> think<00:01:02.879> there's<00:01:03.090> ten<00:01:03.390> here<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:05.250> get

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
I think there's ten here and you I get

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.580 
I think there's ten here and you I get
it<00:01:05.970> at<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.540> fabric<00:01:07.049> store<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:08.630> and<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:10.290> get<00:01:10.470> it

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
it at the fabric store and and I get it

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.310 
it at the fabric store and and I get it
in<00:01:10.680> yards<00:01:11.130> for<00:01:11.490> me<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:11.939> easier<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.479> cut<00:01:12.720> you

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
in yards for me it's easier to cut you

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.679 
in yards for me it's easier to cut you
can<00:01:13.470> get<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.920> spool<00:01:14.250> too<00:01:14.490> but<00:01:15.180> it's

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
can get it in the spool too but it's

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.320 
can get it in the spool too but it's
it's<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.290> little<00:01:16.500> harder<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.400> unroll<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:17.939> all

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
it's a little harder to unroll it all

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.120 
it's a little harder to unroll it all
and<00:01:18.689> fold<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.200> cut<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.409> but<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:19.740> is

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
and fold it and cut it but this is

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.600 
and fold it and cut it but this is
pretty<00:01:20.400> easy<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.850> just<00:01:20.880> get<00:01:21.270> ready<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:22.110> go

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
pretty easy to just get ready to to go

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.230 
pretty easy to just get ready to to go
when<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.729> cut<00:01:24.000> your<00:01:24.210> tutu<00:01:24.689> or<00:01:24.990> your<00:01:25.590> tool<00:01:26.240> you

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
when you cut your tutu or your tool you

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.810 
when you cut your tutu or your tool you
want<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.600> use<00:01:27.659> six<00:01:28.140> inch<00:01:28.409> strips<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.310> it

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
want to use six inch strips and it

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.200 
want to use six inch strips and it
doesn't<00:01:30.150> really<00:01:30.270> matter<00:01:30.509> how<00:01:30.780> long<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.439> is

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
doesn't really matter how long it is

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.940 
doesn't really matter how long it is
because<00:01:33.210> you're<00:01:33.360> gonna<00:01:33.509> fold<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.140> half<00:01:34.170> so

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
because you're gonna fold it in half so

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.990 
because you're gonna fold it in half so
however<00:01:35.610> long<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.530> you<00:01:37.530> can<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:38.790> can

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
however long that is you can you can

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.310 
however long that is you can you can
decide<00:01:39.329> how<00:01:39.360> long<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.720> want<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:40.110> have<00:01:40.200> your

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
decide how long you want to have your

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.140 
decide how long you want to have your
tutu<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.920> can<00:01:41.100> cut<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.280> at<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.490> end<00:01:41.729> or

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
tutu and you can cut it at the end or

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.050 
tutu and you can cut it at the end or
you<00:01:42.180> can<00:01:42.750> I've<00:01:43.649> cut<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.009> at<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.159> end<00:01:44.399> or<00:01:44.790> you

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
you can I've cut it at the end or you

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.490 
you can I've cut it at the end or you
know<00:01:45.270> just<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.750> case<00:01:45.780> because<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.229> don't<00:01:46.380> want

to<00:01:46.560> make<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.799> too<00:01:46.950> short<00:01:47.280> but<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.899> right<00:01:49.140> here

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
to make it too short but this right here

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
this is my Wine and Dine half marathon -

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.789 
this is my Wine and Dine half marathon -
-<00:03:12.420> it's<00:03:12.569> a<00:03:12.630> little<00:03:12.810> crinkly<00:03:13.290> right<00:03:13.620> now

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
- it's a little crinkly right now

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.530 
- it's a little crinkly right now
because<00:03:14.069> that's<00:03:14.519> what<00:03:14.760> happens<00:03:15.090> when<00:03:15.269> you<00:03:15.389> run

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
because that's what happens when you run

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.259 
because that's what happens when you run
13.1<00:03:15.989> miles<00:03:16.680> in<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.099> tutu<00:03:17.459> but<00:03:18.209> it<00:03:19.200> is<00:03:19.819> I<00:03:20.819> used

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
13.1 miles in a tutu but it is I used

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.569 
13.1 miles in a tutu but it is I used
red<00:03:21.690> sparkly<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.530> used<00:03:22.739> black<00:03:23.040> so<00:03:23.310> I<00:03:23.370> used

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
red sparkly and I used black so I used

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.370 
red sparkly and I used black so I used
alternating<00:03:24.239> colours<00:03:24.569> and<00:03:24.840> so<00:03:25.109> if<00:03:25.230> you're

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
alternating colours and so if you're

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.080 
alternating colours and so if you're
going<00:03:25.470> to<00:03:25.560> alternate<00:03:26.040> colors<00:03:26.069> you<00:03:26.669> can<00:03:26.849> do

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
going to alternate colors you can do

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.409 
going to alternate colors you can do
five<00:03:27.450> yards<00:03:27.900> of<00:03:28.049> each<00:03:28.290> and<00:03:28.639> I<00:03:29.639> think<00:03:30.150> it<00:03:30.269> came

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
five yards of each and I think it came

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.780 
five yards of each and I think it came
out<00:03:30.599> awesome<00:03:30.870> I'd<00:03:31.500> loved<00:03:32.040> running<00:03:32.430> in<00:03:32.639> this
