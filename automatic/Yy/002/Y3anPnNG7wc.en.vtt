00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.809 

I<00:03:13.540> didn't<00:03:14.379> say<00:03:14.560> if<00:03:14.739> there's<00:03:14.950> like<00:03:15.160> a<00:03:15.190> period<00:03:15.610> of

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
I didn't say if there's like a period of

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.449 
I didn't say if there's like a period of
time<00:03:16.150> or<00:03:16.390> something<00:03:16.629> so<00:03:17.260> I<00:03:17.560> don't<00:03:18.190> know<00:03:18.280> why

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
time or something so I don't know why

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.509 
time or something so I don't know why
this<00:03:18.519> isn't<00:03:18.849> working<00:03:23.010> maybe<00:03:24.010> there<00:03:24.370> is<00:03:24.489> a

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
this isn't working maybe there is a

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:30.600 
this isn't working maybe there is a
period<00:03:25.300> of<00:03:25.330> time<00:03:25.599> I<00:03:25.840> don't<00:03:25.900> really<00:03:26.080> know<00:03:29.610> maybe

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
period of time I don't really know maybe

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.610 
period of time I don't really know maybe
you<00:03:30.790> have<00:03:30.819> to<00:03:31.060> like<00:03:31.239> let<00:03:31.780> it<00:03:31.840> sit<00:03:32.230> in<00:03:32.380> there<00:03:32.560> for

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
you have to like let it sit in there for

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:33.449 
you have to like let it sit in there for
a<00:03:32.860> while

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
a while

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.589 
a while
I<00:03:35.160> guess<00:03:36.160> I'll<00:03:36.400> come<00:03:36.610> back<00:03:36.790> in<00:03:36.970> like<00:03:37.150> a<00:03:37.180> minute

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
I guess I'll come back in like a minute

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.320 
I guess I'll come back in like a minute
okay<00:03:38.380> so<00:03:38.440> now<00:03:38.860> I've<00:03:39.040> left<00:03:39.250> in<00:03:39.459> about<00:03:39.790> two

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
okay so now I've left in about two

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.140 
okay so now I've left in about two
minutes<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:40.959> it's<00:03:41.080> still<00:03:41.110> the<00:03:41.410> same<00:03:42.150> but

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
minutes and it's still the same but

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.680 
minutes and it's still the same but
either<00:03:43.569> way<00:03:43.870> I<00:03:43.900> selected<00:03:44.650> all<00:03:44.799> the<00:03:45.040> way<00:03:45.129> she<00:03:45.400> is

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
either way I selected all the way she is

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.940 
either way I selected all the way she is
because<00:03:46.690> I<00:03:46.720> think<00:03:46.870> she's<00:03:47.200> really<00:03:47.349> pretty

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
because I think she's really pretty

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.059 
because I think she's really pretty
I<00:03:49.349> guess<00:03:50.349> that's<00:03:50.709> it

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
I guess that's it

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.090 
I guess that's it
thanks<00:03:51.310> watching<00:03:51.489> fine
