00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:03.980
 hello my name is you big and I tested for you last 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.690
 school baby called from the coast 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.180
 as its name indicates all your touch 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.870
 there is no clarifying everything goes well a screen 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.610
 both extremely resistant some colleagues 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:16.619
 we tested 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.869
 the thing with the key criterion of this state 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.419
 and still a resolution to make everything nice 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:24.710
 so before 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.329
 2 you're talking about, I was listening to the latest radiohead album 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:28.289
 that I had 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.329
 to download on the internet 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:34.960
 1- obviously everything goes as for all the others for the time at the coast 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.400
 and most mp3 players 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.589
 except that papp with the touch screen 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:41.030
 I can scroll 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.200
 % my catalog 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.510
 pretty much like the veil on albums for example 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.280
 or so my songs 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.680
 or so it's a ranking participate 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.230
 % listened to it quite happy so the normal quality follow 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.390
 but he revolutionized business although this model 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.149
 for the report three months earlier 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.570
 not at the euro level of the decline anyway the heart of the post office 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.280
 but for the level of the image 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.830
 so why then I read here a series of photos are not mine 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.060
 are not my children 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.570
 but it is a catalog provided directly by the Fulahs I am 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.740
 just twice on a photo 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.990
 percent the resolution again excellent I have more than half the time 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.810
 for today on this picture or twice to return his share of this 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.140
 scroll like this 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.490
 for my catalog 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.399
 but then to whom every day is a little gadget to you tell me 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.849
 but the little revolution for me is that when you turn your 

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:38.750
 screen the picture follows you 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.310
 it's really the same thing besides the lots so that's one thing 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.219
 to make sure of things bet on photo music 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.110
 of same scene videos pretty much the same thing 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.110
 and then Germany more 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.920
 of this model 7 inches a little bit of this little right corner so ie 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.380
 sales of wii fit that will simply allow 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.500
 to connect to the internet for example aarau famous website of videos 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.399
 Youtube 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.880
 we can quite 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.270
 % rather quickly unmanageable at the very normal here I am at home 

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:16.879
 switch to the on youtube at the end and to view the last clip the most 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:17.830
 along the column 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.369
 the title is called in the other my mouth 

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:23.880
 see the quality is quite satisfactory the flow 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.829
 excellent breaking meal 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.720
 in streaming 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.919
 for the experience and really very very very very seductive 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.729
 I go back just to show that it is not more than in 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:36.479
 life 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:39.639
 percent and that for example I have a search engine 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:43.489
 because here I am on the site of the blow as for example 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.260
 reading an article for 100 th 

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:51.669
 on the field of guys as a source of energy and talent 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:53.639
 roxane sophie who wrote it 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:54.809
 at M 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:58.149
 of course continue several pages 

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:59.400
 gg access 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.360
 for that there is in August she has quite a 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.620
 for everything he does 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.619
 an interlude I'm happy 

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:09.110
 I can obviously pity 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.580
 safe the http address 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.130
 why just for example 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.469
 encode for its part the new site of northern libya I am monomaniac 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:22.199
 but is one of the best sites 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:24.079
 that exist for now 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.340
 I joke percent chips one of the places 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.760
 you will tell me ah yes but it's very small impossible to say yes yes 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.510
 except that 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.100
 with this touch screen 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.300
 abbas complicated twice on the part that interests us that you do not play 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:42.109
 then you press on hyperlinks possibly has for example here 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:45.119
 % ap 

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:46.090
 see here 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.689
 I could definitely go on this article on others 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:50.790
 choose them 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.779
 and as for the prices of 

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:53.590
 so 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.330
 who lost his rooney head visibly sir gainey is not done 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.610
 not too much damage as boss contact on his forehead 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:03.049
 for 100 euros 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.879
 so that's obviously a big plus 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.039
 % ytd 

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:11.299
 music photos videos 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:12.869
 Internet 

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:16.810
 aytus although obviously you can not imagine integrating it directly into 

00:04:16.809 --> 00:04:17.789
 his model 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:21.069
 without its paid download platform 

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:26.520
 of music so for the same price the same principles as on the site and 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.960
 so some polars add the few for props that make think that 

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:33.959
 the model is close to the personal assistant 

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:36.310
 alarm 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.220
 she will be celebrating 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.630
 what is missing if we do a little negative% even if it's difficult with this 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.340
 product 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.250
 16 hours is the time the members 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.379
 in back 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:53.009
 m a small space for a sim card that would transform whooping cough at the fair 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:56.169
 balladur and in the phone that would be really obviously 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:57.050
 the top 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.419
 memory there is therefore the existing model 32 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.460
 in two versions to he also went through the Shiite village 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.839
 the cjr 

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:11.089
 and then last element obviously the price because all that then you 

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:12.430
 think of a price 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.020
 % for the version wii giga have about 320 euros and for the version in 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.159
 16 gigas 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:20.040
 haha 400 retro 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.450
 we will see now if Santa Claus for those who come out of his house when 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.129
 superbowl door 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:27.610
 this report to this year 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:28.229
 generous
