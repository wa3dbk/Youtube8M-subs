00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
wide now that's enough maybe for one or

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.630 
wide now that's enough maybe for one or
two<00:01:00.120> people<00:01:00.629> just<00:01:01.410> on<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.800> side<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.219> your<00:01:02.399> dish

two people just on the side of your dish

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.759 
two people just on the side of your dish
so<00:01:03.629> we're<00:01:03.750> just<00:01:03.780> going<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.080> literally<00:01:04.409> pop

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
so we're just going to literally pop

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.820 
so we're just going to literally pop
these<00:01:04.979> over<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.670> frying<00:01:05.939> pan<00:01:06.470> turn<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:07.799> a

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
these over to the frying pan turn on a

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.810 
these over to the frying pan turn on a
medium<00:01:08.520> heat<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.990> like<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:11.040> add<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.460> dash<00:01:11.760> of

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
medium heat I like to add a dash of

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.190 
medium heat I like to add a dash of
olive<00:01:12.390> oil<00:01:14.330> really<00:01:15.330> doesn't<00:01:15.659> have<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.810> be<00:01:15.990> too

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
olive oil really doesn't have to be too

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.130 
olive oil really doesn't have to be too
much<00:01:16.409> olive<00:01:16.890> oil<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.060> trick<00:01:18.360> as<00:01:18.540> well<00:01:18.570> is

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
much olive oil and the trick as well is

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.310 
much olive oil and the trick as well is
to<00:01:19.830> add<00:01:19.979> some<00:01:20.009> water<00:01:20.490> now<00:01:21.000> we<00:01:21.030> use<00:01:21.479> alkalized

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
to add some water now we use alkalized

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.830 
to add some water now we use alkalized
water<00:01:22.530> which<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.549> much<00:01:23.790> healthier<00:01:24.030> for<00:01:24.600> you

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
water which is much healthier for you

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.510 
water which is much healthier for you
however<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.950> can<00:01:26.159> use<00:01:26.189> filtered<00:01:26.850> water<00:01:27.060> and

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
however you can use filtered water and

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.929 
however you can use filtered water and
when<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.640> leeks<00:01:29.850> are<00:01:30.119> cooking<00:01:31.159> the<00:01:32.159> water<00:01:32.369> and

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
when the leeks are cooking the water and

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.910 
when the leeks are cooking the water and
goodness<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.689> going<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:33.990> come<00:01:34.200> out<00:01:34.380> however<00:01:34.619> if

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
goodness is going to come out however if

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.240 
goodness is going to come out however if
we<00:01:35.070> add<00:01:35.250> water<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.939> pan<00:01:36.119> as<00:01:36.390> well<00:01:36.530> then<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
we add water to the pan as well then the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.950 
we add water to the pan as well then the
leeks<00:01:38.490> are<00:01:38.640> actually<00:01:38.970> going<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.150> retain<00:01:39.630> more

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
leeks are actually going to retain more

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.389 
leeks are actually going to retain more
water<00:01:40.670> so<00:01:41.670> we<00:01:41.790> can<00:01:41.820> leave<00:01:42.119> them<00:01:43.100> cooking<00:01:44.100> away

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
water so we can leave them cooking away

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.480 
water so we can leave them cooking away
and<00:01:44.729> another<00:01:45.509> little<00:01:45.720> tip<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.920> would<00:01:47.280> say

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
and another little tip is I would say

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.929 
and another little tip is I would say
never<00:01:47.790> use<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.420> regular<00:01:49.350> salt<00:01:49.710> however<00:01:50.399> we<00:01:50.670> use

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
never use a regular salt however we use

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.480 
never use a regular salt however we use
Himalayan<00:01:51.630> pink<00:01:51.869> rock<00:01:52.229> salt<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.860> literally<00:01:53.369> a

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
Himalayan pink rock salt and literally a

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.630 
Himalayan pink rock salt and literally a
little<00:01:53.700> sprinkling<00:01:54.270> on<00:01:54.630> top<00:01:56.540> and<00:01:58.430> you<00:01:59.430> can

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
little sprinkling on top and you can

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.080 
little sprinkling on top and you can
leave<00:01:59.820> them<00:02:00.210> for<00:02:00.869> maybe<00:02:01.049> five<00:02:01.890> minutes

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.150 

so<00:02:07.090> it's<00:02:07.450> been<00:02:07.630> about<00:02:07.750> five<00:02:08.320> minutes<00:02:08.920> that's

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
so it's been about five minutes that's

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.430 
so it's been about five minutes that's
all<00:02:09.400> it<00:02:09.580> needs<00:02:09.610> and<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:10.900> water<00:02:11.110> has

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
all it needs and the water has

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.200
