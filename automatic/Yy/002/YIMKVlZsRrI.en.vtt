latch<00:04:20.139> and<00:04:20.500> i'll<00:04:20.650> pull<00:04:20.859> that<00:04:21.010> out<00:04:21.040> but<00:04:21.400> the

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
latch and i'll pull that out but the

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.219 
latch and i'll pull that out but the
nice<00:04:21.700> thing<00:04:21.729> about<00:04:22.000> the<00:04:22.270> Avalanche<00:04:22.660> so<00:04:23.169> you

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
nice thing about the Avalanche so you

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:24.690 
nice thing about the Avalanche so you
can<00:04:23.350> lay<00:04:23.500> this<00:04:23.680> inside<00:04:23.919> down<00:04:24.400> and<00:04:24.580> now<00:04:24.639> you

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
can lay this inside down and now you

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.000 
can lay this inside down and now you
have<00:04:24.910> access<00:04:25.570> to<00:04:25.600> the<00:04:26.260> inside<00:04:26.380> of<00:04:26.620> the<00:04:26.800> back

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
have access to the inside of the back

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.740 
have access to the inside of the back
area<00:04:28.770> interior<00:04:29.770> light<00:04:30.010> from<00:04:30.729> the<00:04:30.880> back<00:04:31.419> of<00:04:31.450> the

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
area interior light from the back of the

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.379 
area interior light from the back of the
tail<00:04:32.020> gate<00:04:32.320> to<00:04:33.130> the<00:04:33.190> front<00:04:33.520> right<00:04:33.700> here<00:04:33.729> is<00:04:34.060> 8

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
tail gate to the front right here is 8

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.900 
tail gate to the front right here is 8
feet<00:04:34.780> that's<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.620> same<00:04:35.830> thing<00:04:35.860> as<00:04:36.340> a

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
feet that's the same thing as a

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.800 
feet that's the same thing as a
full-sized<00:04:37.650> long<00:04:38.650> bed<00:04:39.180> so<00:04:40.180> if<00:04:40.330> you<00:04:40.419> needed<00:04:40.660> to

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
full-sized long bed so if you needed to

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.330 
full-sized long bed so if you needed to
pull<00:04:41.470> some<00:04:41.770> material<00:04:42.460> around<00:04:42.700> you<00:04:43.600> have

show you how to remove that window pull
the<00:05:00.910> other<00:05:00.940> latch<00:05:01.770> don't<00:05:02.770> worry<00:05:02.950> that's<00:05:03.190> what

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
the other latch don't worry that's what

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.860 
the other latch don't worry that's what
this<00:05:03.610> is<00:05:03.669> for<00:05:03.820> it's<00:05:04.120> going<00:05:04.240> to<00:05:04.300> catch<00:05:04.479> that<00:05:04.539> so

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
this is for it's going to catch that so

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:19.320 
this is for it's going to catch that so
that<00:05:05.020> doesn't<00:05:05.289> fall<00:05:05.440> out<00:05:05.470> on<00:05:05.830> you<00:05:18.330> they're

that doesn't fall out on you they're

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.950 
that doesn't fall out on you they're
locked<00:05:20.200> into<00:05:20.470> place<00:05:21.150> and<00:05:22.150> then<00:05:22.210> you<00:05:22.450> have<00:05:22.600> the

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
locked into place and then you have the

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:29.909 
locked into place and then you have the
open<00:05:23.350> window<00:05:25.889> pretty<00:05:26.889> easy<00:05:27.100> stuff<00:05:27.479> okay<00:05:28.919> nice

open window pretty easy stuff okay nice

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.400 
open window pretty easy stuff okay nice
thing<00:05:30.220> about<00:05:30.250> the<00:05:30.729> Avalanche<00:05:31.389> is<00:05:31.660> no<00:05:32.229> need<00:05:32.350> for

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
thing about the Avalanche is no need for

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.830 
thing about the Avalanche is no need for
tonneau<00:05:32.830> cover<00:05:33.160> these<00:05:34.000> panels<00:05:34.510> each<00:05:34.600> will

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
tonneau cover these panels each will

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.310 
tonneau cover these panels each will
support<00:05:35.200> 250<00:05:35.919> pounds<00:05:36.280> of<00:05:36.370> peace<00:05:36.580> and<00:05:37.270> this<00:05:38.200> is

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
support 250 pounds of peace and this is

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.200 
support 250 pounds of peace and this is
lockable<00:05:38.800> trunk<00:05:39.190> so<00:05:39.430> when<00:05:39.610> the<00:05:39.729> trunk<00:05:40.000> is

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
lockable trunk so when the trunk is

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.740 
lockable trunk so when the trunk is
locked<00:05:41.310> or<00:05:42.310> the<00:05:42.430> tail<00:05:42.610> gate<00:05:42.789> is<00:05:42.940> locked<00:05:43.120> no<00:05:43.630> one

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
locked or the tail gate is locked no one

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.830 
locked or the tail gate is locked no one
can<00:05:43.900> get<00:05:44.080> in<00:05:44.880> water-resistant<00:05:47.190> do<00:05:48.190> have<00:05:48.310> some

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
can get in water-resistant do have some

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.140 
can get in water-resistant do have some
reservoirs<00:05:49.840> here<00:05:50.139> to<00:05:50.410> direct<00:05:51.250> water<00:05:51.550> out<00:05:51.820> that

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
reservoirs here to direct water out that

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.210 
reservoirs here to direct water out that
gets<00:05:52.360> through<00:05:52.660> the<00:05:52.780> cracks<00:05:53.110> let's<00:05:53.919> say<00:05:54.099> if<00:05:54.190> you

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
gets through the cracks let's say if you

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.700 
gets through the cracks let's say if you
drove<00:05:54.520> through<00:05:54.729> a<00:05:54.910> car<00:05:55.900> wash<00:05:56.139> that<00:05:56.440> could

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
drove through a car wash that could

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.040 
drove through a car wash that could
happen<00:05:56.919> so<00:05:57.370> you<00:05:57.639> know<00:05:58.330> it's<00:05:58.510> not<00:05:58.630> waterproof

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
happen so you know it's not waterproof

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.210 
happen so you know it's not waterproof
could<00:05:59.979> get<00:06:00.160> some<00:06:00.669> moisture<00:06:01.150> in<00:06:01.240> here<00:06:01.270> but<00:06:02.220> you

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 
could get some moisture in here but you

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.460 
could get some moisture in here but you
have<00:06:03.310> reservoirs<00:06:03.789> to<00:06:04.060> get<00:06:04.690> the<00:06:04.810> water<00:06:04.960> out<00:06:05.110> but

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
have reservoirs to get the water out but

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.740 
have reservoirs to get the water out but
anyways<00:06:05.800> Andy<00:06:06.490> get<00:06:07.120> a<00:06:07.150> little<00:06:07.390> bit<00:06:07.510> off<00:06:07.599> the

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
anyways Andy get a little bit off the

subject here i just want to show you
this<00:06:09.039> avalanche<00:06:09.520> it's<00:06:10.210> here<00:06:10.690> it's<00:06:11.140> a

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.260 
this avalanche it's here it's a

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.930 
this avalanche it's here it's a
beautiful<00:06:11.289> vehicle

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
beautiful vehicle

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.780
