we had our team car go under a heart
restriction<00:01:21.220> beam<00:01:22.220> with<00:01:23.090> all<00:01:23.210> the<00:01:23.330> blocks<00:01:23.540> on

restriction beam with all the blocks on
the<00:01:23.810> roof<00:01:23.990> so<00:01:24.020> it<00:01:24.740> was<00:01:24.890> a<00:01:24.920> little<00:01:25.190> bit<00:01:25.280> of<00:01:25.930> chaos

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
the roof so it was a little bit of chaos

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.320 
the roof so it was a little bit of chaos
I<00:01:27.260> guess<00:01:27.470> but<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:28.520> staff<00:01:28.730> handled<00:01:29.150> it<00:01:29.210> really

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
I guess but the staff handled it really

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.960 
I guess but the staff handled it really
well<00:01:29.450> and<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:30.170> mechanic<00:01:30.560> didn't<00:01:30.860> sweep<00:01:31.490> out<00:01:31.670> a

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
well and the mechanic didn't sweep out a

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.870 
well and the mechanic didn't sweep out a
little<00:01:32.900> under<00:01:33.140> control<00:01:33.500> they<00:01:34.010> were<00:01:34.160> prepared

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
little under control they were prepared

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.030 
little under control they were prepared
for<00:01:35.120> things<00:01:35.240> like<00:01:35.510> this<00:01:35.690> obviously<00:01:36.380> it<00:01:36.620> sounds

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
for things like this obviously it sounds

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.770 
for things like this obviously it sounds
the<00:01:37.160> way<00:01:37.250> that<00:01:37.460> you<00:01:37.520> manage<00:01:37.640> them<00:01:37.970> unforeseen

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
the way that you manage them unforeseen

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
Georgia's got so every chance of winning

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.150 
Georgia's got so every chance of winning
today<00:01:43.630> if<00:01:44.630> she<00:01:44.780> gets<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.080> right<00:01:45.110> right<00:01:45.530> run<00:01:46.009> to

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
today if she gets the right right run to

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
today if she gets the right right run to
the<00:01:46.250> line<00:01:46.720> it's<00:01:47.720> just<00:01:48.550> it's<00:01:49.550> been<00:01:49.790> there<00:01:50.090> in

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
the line it's just it's been there in

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.780 
the line it's just it's been there in
the<00:01:50.240> right<00:01:50.390> position<00:01:50.780> and<00:01:50.869> just<00:01:51.640> been<00:01:52.640> in<00:01:52.729> the

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
the right position and just been in the

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.160 
the right position and just been in the
right<00:01:52.940> position<00:01:53.270> for<00:01:53.300> those<00:01:53.509> last<00:01:53.750> corners

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
right position for those last corners

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.469 
right position for those last corners
and<00:01:54.290> the<00:01:54.380> last<00:01:54.590> couple<00:01:54.979> of<00:01:55.040> stages<00:01:55.250> I<00:01:55.759> think

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
and the last couple of stages I think

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.219 
and the last couple of stages I think
she's<00:01:56.630> had<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:56.930> speed<00:01:57.399> but<00:01:58.399> she's<00:01:58.610> just<00:01:59.229> not

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
she's had the speed but she's just not

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.120 
she's had the speed but she's just not
quite<00:02:00.290> felt<00:02:01.250> for<00:02:01.430> that<00:02:01.460> last<00:02:01.850> corner<00:02:02.979> so<00:02:03.979> much

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
quite felt for that last corner so much

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.260 
quite felt for that last corner so much
and<00:02:04.310> I<00:02:04.340> think<00:02:04.520> it<00:02:04.640> all<00:02:04.729> goes<00:02:04.759> back<00:02:04.940> to

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
and I think it all goes back to

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.070 
and I think it all goes back to
Luxembourg<00:02:05.540> where<00:02:05.930> she<00:02:06.080> crashed

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.929 

in<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.409> last<00:02:12.590> corner<00:02:12.830> there<00:02:13.400> was<00:02:13.430> a<00:02:13.670> little

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:13.939 
in the last corner there was a little

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:16.270 
in the last corner there was a little
bit<00:02:14.150> problem<00:02:14.720> with<00:02:14.870> a<00:02:14.900> with<00:02:15.560> a<00:02:15.590> motorbike<00:02:16.099> of

bit problem with a with a motorbike of

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.670 
bit problem with a with a motorbike of
organization<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.329> I<00:02:17.420> must<00:02:17.689> turn<00:02:17.930> over<00:02:17.959> that
