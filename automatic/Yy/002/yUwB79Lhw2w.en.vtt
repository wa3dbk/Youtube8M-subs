overdrive<00:01:26.340> by<00:01:26.580> catalan<00:01:27.150> bread<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.600> what<00:01:27.840> it's

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
overdrive by catalan bread and what it's

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.050 
overdrive by catalan bread and what it's
supposed<00:01:28.260> to<00:01:28.320> do<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.790> basically<00:01:29.790> be<00:01:30.030> a

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
supposed to do is basically be a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.750 
supposed to do is basically be a
flip-top<00:01:30.570> style<00:01:31.080> ampeg<00:01:31.590> overdrive<00:01:32.400> like<00:01:32.610> an

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
flip-top style ampeg overdrive like an

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.060 
flip-top style ampeg overdrive like an
old<00:01:33.150> porta<00:01:33.479> flex<00:01:33.720> they<00:01:34.170> were<00:01:34.229> originally<00:01:34.890> bass

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
old porta flex they were originally bass

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.910 
old porta flex they were originally bass
amps<00:01:35.460> where<00:01:36.330> the<00:01:36.600> amplifier<00:01:36.930> cabinet<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.830> the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
amps where the amplifier cabinet and the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.710 
amps where the amplifier cabinet and the
head<00:01:38.130> was<00:01:38.400> inside<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.970> cab<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.330> flipped

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
head was inside the cab and you flipped

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.330 
head was inside the cab and you flipped
the<00:01:39.810> top<00:01:40.020> set<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.560> on<00:01:40.680> tapping<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.130> really

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
the top set it on tapping this really

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.700 
the top set it on tapping this really
cool<00:01:41.550> like<00:01:41.700> Art<00:01:41.910> Deco<00:01:41.970> looking<00:01:42.660> amplifier<00:01:43.530> it

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
cool like Art Deco looking amplifier it

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.930 
cool like Art Deco looking amplifier it
was<00:01:43.830> all<00:01:43.920> -<00:01:44.130> but<00:01:44.280> originally<00:01:44.400> again<00:01:44.820> there

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
was all - but originally again there

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.490 
was all - but originally again there
were<00:01:45.000> bass<00:01:45.180> amps<00:01:45.510> but<00:01:45.720> guys<00:01:45.900> figured<00:01:46.229> out<00:01:46.320> that

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
were bass amps but guys figured out that

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.050 
were bass amps but guys figured out that
playing<00:01:47.130> guitar<00:01:47.430> through<00:01:47.610> them<00:01:47.729> sounded

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
playing guitar through them sounded

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.540 
playing guitar through them sounded
really<00:01:48.360> really<00:01:48.750> cool<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.350> think<00:01:50.070> probably<00:01:50.280> most

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
really really cool I think probably most

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.639 
really really cool I think probably most
famously<00:01:51.000> Queens<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.479> Stone<00:01:51.660> Age<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:52.050> lot<00:01:52.410> of

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
famously Queens the Stone Age a lot of

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.190 
famously Queens the Stone Age a lot of
the<00:01:52.860> early<00:01:53.220> Queen<00:01:53.940> stuff<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.630> kaya<00:01:54.840> stuff

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
the early Queen stuff and the kaya stuff

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.740 
the early Queen stuff and the kaya stuff
was<00:01:55.380> recorded<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:55.979> old<00:01:56.700> Aunt<00:01:56.910> Peg<00:01:57.119> bass<00:01:57.360> amps

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
was recorded on old Aunt Peg bass amps

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.540 
was recorded on old Aunt Peg bass amps
and<00:01:57.899> when<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.500> crank<00:01:58.800> it<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.160> gives<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.490> this

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
and when you crank it it gives you this

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.029 
and when you crank it it gives you this
really<00:01:59.610> cool<00:02:00.119> really<00:02:00.660> thick<00:02:01.080> warm<00:02:01.380> overdrive

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
really cool really thick warm overdrive

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:03.410 
really cool really thick warm overdrive
it<00:02:02.190> really<00:02:02.369> doesn't<00:02:02.610> sound<00:02:02.759> like<00:02:03.000> any<00:02:03.180> normal

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
it really doesn't sound like any normal

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.570 
it really doesn't sound like any normal
guitar<00:02:03.840> overdrive<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.860> that's<00:02:05.280> what<00:02:05.460> this

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
guitar overdrive and that's what this

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.070 
guitar overdrive and that's what this
thing<00:02:05.640> does<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.240> spades<00:02:06.570> but<00:02:06.720> more<00:02:06.960> than<00:02:07.020> just

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
thing does in spades but more than just

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.199 
thing does in spades but more than just
an<00:02:07.289> overdrive<00:02:07.710> pedal<00:02:07.740> if<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.610> turn<00:02:08.820> the<00:02:09.000> gain

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
an overdrive pedal if you turn the gain

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.570 
an overdrive pedal if you turn the gain
all<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.750> way<00:02:09.840> down<00:02:10.050> close<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.649> zero<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.459> can

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
all the way down close to zero you can

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.000 
all the way down close to zero you can
actually<00:02:11.880> use<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:12.330> as<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.570> clean<00:02:13.140> platform<00:02:13.770> so

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
actually use this as a clean platform so

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.560 
actually use this as a clean platform so
like<00:02:14.220> I'm<00:02:14.370> playing<00:02:14.580> through<00:02:14.880> a<00:02:14.910> super<00:02:15.390> reverb

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
like I'm playing through a super reverb

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.320 
like I'm playing through a super reverb
on<00:02:15.900> purpose<00:02:16.739> so<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:16.980> can<00:02:17.250> hear<00:02:17.550> how<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:17.940> pedal

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
on purpose so you can hear how the pedal

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.970 
on purpose so you can hear how the pedal
sounds<00:02:18.690> through<00:02:18.870> like<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.050> very<00:02:19.350> very<00:02:19.620> clean

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
sounds through like a very very clean

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.890 
sounds through like a very very clean
fender<00:02:20.430> style<00:02:20.760> amp<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.299> so<00:02:21.600> let's<00:02:21.750> say<00:02:21.840> you

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
fender style amp and so let's say you

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.210 
fender style amp and so let's say you
had<00:02:22.110> something<00:02:22.350> like<00:02:22.470> this<00:02:22.560> but<00:02:22.799> you<00:02:22.860> want<00:02:23.130> a

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
had something like this but you want a

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.400 
had something like this but you want a
beefier<00:02:23.610> clean<00:02:24.000> platform<00:02:24.959> to<00:02:25.080> put<00:02:25.230> other

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
beefier clean platform to put other

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.259 
beefier clean platform to put other
feste<00:02:25.739> plus<00:02:26.160> pedals<00:02:26.489> and<00:02:26.549> overdrive<00:02:26.910> pedals

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
feste plus pedals and overdrive pedals

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.940 
feste plus pedals and overdrive pedals
on<00:02:27.390> -<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.989> can<00:02:28.110> run<00:02:28.260> this<00:02:28.410> thing<00:02:28.470> at<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:28.830> end

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
on - you can run this thing at the end

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.620 
on - you can run this thing at the end
of<00:02:29.040> your<00:02:29.100> chain<00:02:29.160> really<00:02:29.820> really<00:02:30.120> clean<00:02:30.390> and

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
of your chain really really clean and

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.509 
of your chain really really clean and
then<00:02:31.410> leave<00:02:31.590> it<00:02:31.620> on<00:02:31.769> basically<00:02:31.980> all<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.489> time

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
then leave it on basically all the time

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.000 
then leave it on basically all the time
and<00:02:32.940> it<00:02:33.030> will<00:02:33.180> just<00:02:33.360> kind<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.350> color<00:02:34.590> your<00:02:34.799> tone

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
and it will just kind of color your tone

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.390 
and it will just kind of color your tone
in<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.430> warmer<00:02:35.940> more<00:02:36.690> bass-heavy<00:02:37.440> fashion<00:02:38.280> and

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
in a warmer more bass-heavy fashion and

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.160 
in a warmer more bass-heavy fashion and
it'll<00:02:38.549> make<00:02:38.850> it<00:02:38.970> basically<00:02:39.330> sound<00:02:39.750> like<00:02:39.959> an

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
it'll make it basically sound like an

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.490 
it'll make it basically sound like an
old<00:02:40.560> Aunt<00:02:40.860> Peg<00:02:41.180> bass<00:02:42.180> amp<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:42.780> in<00:02:43.140> this<00:02:43.260> demo

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
old Aunt Peg bass amp so in this demo

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.740 
old Aunt Peg bass amp so in this demo
I've<00:02:43.739> done<00:02:43.980> one<00:02:44.760> with<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.060> drive<00:02:45.269> around<00:02:45.480> half

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
I've done one with the drive around half

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.020 
I've done one with the drive around half
way<00:02:45.780> one<00:02:46.560> demo<00:02:46.769> with<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.100> drive<00:02:47.340> clean<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:47.970> you

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
way one demo with the drive clean so you

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.460 
way one demo with the drive clean so you
can<00:02:48.120> hear<00:02:48.420> how<00:02:48.540> it<00:02:48.570> just<00:02:48.780> beefs<00:02:49.049> up<00:02:49.230> a<00:02:49.350> normal

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
can hear how it just beefs up a normal

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.440 
can hear how it just beefs up a normal
clean<00:02:49.799> signal<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.370> then<00:02:50.700> one<00:02:50.970> with<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.239> game

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
clean signal and then one with the game

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.509 
clean signal and then one with the game
