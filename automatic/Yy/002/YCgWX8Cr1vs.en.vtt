00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:05.529
 we will now see still within the groups of the draw the group 2 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:07.640
 The figure 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.960
 this figure 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.960
 it's just childish b 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:33.830
 from the different position the swimmer takes on a front carp position 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.200
 the two legs move simultaneously from the surface 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.900
 to assume a vertical position 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.220
 the trunk remains in the vertical alignment 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.530
 while the legs rise from the surface to a vertical position 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.770
 at maximum height 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.110
 the proposition that the legs only comes the hips I'm fitting the front to 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.290
 facilitate the contraction of the gluteus without moving the trunk 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.130
 for this it is interesting that the athlete imagines leaning against a wall 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.310
 the wine abdomen 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.650
 the rare trunk against this imaginary wall 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.860
 so that the head stays in line the athlete must keep looking ahead 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.980
 and nape to the fullest extent 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.980
 after brief pause 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:30.310
 the body of this age consumption maintaining the vertical alignment until submersion 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.370
 toes 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.300
 for entry is used the coil that start of water in the moon in front of the 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.200
 body 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.860
 and as the body of the palm has lost goes to the top of the 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.050
 head 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.370
 in the carp position of not using the alternating ugly palm below 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.320
 of the thighs and knees 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.470
 if necessary the athlete performs a format and has opted for the head 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.470
 for submersion of the toes 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.760
 the delay 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.549
 is a variation of the abortion figure 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:31.449
 starting from a front position assumed a front carp position 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:35.939
 the two legs are taken simultaneously from the surface to the same 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:40.629
 during which one of them presses to take a vertical position with the 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:42.599
 flexed knee 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.030
 The figure ends with vertical city knee flexed 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:53.429
 in this figure the same ones are used by matheus 

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:56.429
 What we saw in the abortion figure 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:10.189
 swordfish 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.500
 in the front position the athlete can choose to start the figure 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.119
 with the ones without a face in the water 

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:40.799
 as in the picture with the face in the water the swimmer performs friction to eat and 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.909
 begins to turn to swordfish without breathing 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.929
 at the same time things start to create 

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:52.219
 the leg extended to be brought to the surface a 180 degree arc 

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:56.289
 until you take a position of surface art knee flexed 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:02.339
 flexed knee extends until the parents join in a 

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:03.299
 surface 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:04.730
 and without pause 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.260
 a surface arc exit to a coast position will be performed 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:16.139
 in both options the swimmer must start with which mateyu next to the 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.869
 waist and switch to the alternating straight-side to raise the leg 

00:04:21.869 --> 00:04:23.180
 of the surface 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.979
 first, the athlete should only apply force by the extended leg so that it 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:35.710
 elevate guest lift she acted on the body deep down the trunk and quickly switches to 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.020
 support to gain breakage more easily 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.729
 the act should be kept on the hip throughout the passage 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.999
 after the leg passes through the line perpendicular to the surface 

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:52.840
 the trunk should try to get married and only leg should be 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:53.770
 increasing 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.319
 more and more air 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:58.540
 until it reaches the position of surface arch 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.419
 with the leg flexed 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.590
 a little after passing the line perpendicular to the water line 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.520
 the athlete must change your bow crusade to palm and stay in it until the 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.879
 leg season to apodi surface 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:18.429
 the swimmer start the crossroads exit to then pass to 'torpedo' 

00:05:18.429 --> 00:05:18.799
 roles
