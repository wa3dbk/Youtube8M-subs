00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.490
 hello how are you guys I hope you are 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.379
 very very good 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:09.030
 good guys came out some news very 

00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:11.050
 I do not know how to say it very tempting very 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.730
 hard because good 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.620
 tommaso today today is good 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.919
 ratito started tweeting a few things 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.409
 about minecraft and 0.12 points at 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:22.989
 guys, that's how they start. 

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:24.310
 news about the new version but 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:28.019
 well here first on the screen we have 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:31.470
 this tweet that he says is a little bit 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.330
 uncomfortable or good inopportune for me 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:39.850
 announce things that you do not work on 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:43.210
 myself but the 0.12 0.12 forgiveness 0.12 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.820
 0 points as it will have many new 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.460
 things and when I say many is seriously 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.610
 many I mean many there are you 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.780
 guys that tweet the truth is that good 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.910
 Well, we've already moved a lot because 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.040
 if you mean that many things and I'm going to 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.530
 emphasize that many things then 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.720
 honestly for the 0.12 points but 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.940
 if we can wait grandiose and 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.250
 great things but good here not 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.730
 ends everything with the tuit number two is 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.980
 where 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.390
 the father starts the fun and where 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.980
 I want you to be in the 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.680
 comments participate a lot in this 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.530
 video and help me go deciphering or 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.780
 thinking what it can be that 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.040
 have added to minecraft pib because 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.970
 good as tommy here I put the video 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.190
 on the screen it says there's a clear and 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.160
 list 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.470
 who can read from the initials of the 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.780
 new list of things new things 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.180
 that are going to be added which is 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.880
 obviously it's not provocative at all so 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.680
 he puts tom and how can you see guys there 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:48.030
 are all the initials nsc or hg 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.530
 efe pss ok well you will already be thinking 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.930
 you in a good of things already will have 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.500
 imagined that it is and that's the way I am 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.180
 I started making my deductions good 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.420
 obviously to begin with let's start 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.950
 for the first letter n that I think that 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.830
 it may be the n iv what is the most 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.750
 probably obviously never ok there we have 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.790
 the n I can not think of anything else with n that 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.890
 can add to minecraft and apart from 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.740
 never then we have the s where can 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.780
 there are several things that according to my 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.700
 deductions can be sprint or 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.280
 soundtrack that is the background music or 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.100
 is nick that is nick is to bend over or do 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.200
 shift then we have the cee that en 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.410
 honestly I do not have anything there I leave it to 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.239
 you then we have side that would be 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.550
 ocelot if added if the 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.830
 corn because it could happen acercate 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.210
 of cats that are the priests when 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.940
 you give them fish because they become 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:42.300
 cats then we have the ax that there 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:46.140
 various jÃ¼nger odds either for 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.730
 of hunger horses horses or hardcore like that 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.500
 is not we do not know yet then we have 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.410
 the g that apparently is the only one that is 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.770
 100% confirmed that it is golems apparently 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.880
 that is confirmed because good 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.160
 it will put it on the screen but it was 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.920
 reading more tomaso tweets and a guy 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.240
 of tutelage meant golems and I think 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.640
 who told him that if the truth is not 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.680
 very safe but good then we have the 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.500
 that can be enchantments or 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.340
 experience that are basically added 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.330
 enchantments would have to add the 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.890
 experience not 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.840
 although good could only add the 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.820
 experience for example you can go 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.370
 accumulating the and then already when they add 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.570
 in another in another version more 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.180
 enchantments then it is to have 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.280
 experience then we have the p that I 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.170
 I think it can be power potions 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.180
 which is very likely because 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.060
 we have the effects and since I think 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.730
 that it costs them a lot to add the potions 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.459
 then we have the ay I do not know I have no idea 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.560
 I could not think of anything then we have fp 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.709
 sincerely, the only thing that 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.370
 it happens is flower pot is to say the like the 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.370
 flower pot 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.959
 the one where you put the can put 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.750
 cactus saplings and it looks pretty 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.640
 quite father and we have finally the 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.989
 that I think is the most parents and 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.989
 which I'm also almost certain that 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:00.720
 means what is controller support 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.610
 that's how it is and what is what it means in 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.130
 Spanish support for controls I think 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.690
 This is possible because the good 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.370
 truth is it had filtered many things and 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.470
 many news about support for 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.560
 controls and honestly well I think that 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.640
 it may be this that he does it well so 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.500
 good guys I hope you liked it 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.750
 the video if it was like this do not forget 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.250
 give me a like and then seriously put 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.989
 here in the comments make your own 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.310
 list leave it in the comments and then 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.220
 we started talking here in the 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.110
 comments all 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:32.090
 to think that it may be what they are going to 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:35.510
 add to inquire then to try then 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.760
 how to say it and deduce what it is 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.140
 that can mean that letter and good 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:44.530
 guys how do I tell them I love them so much 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:44.530
 and see you in a next video bye bye
