00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.570 
honestly it would be my worst but it's
so<00:02:04.229> intense<00:02:04.640> it's<00:02:05.640> actually<00:02:05.909> really<00:02:06.210> good<00:02:07.580> but

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
this because a sports make more sense

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.170 
this because a sports make more sense
because<00:02:29.680> football<00:02:29.950> one<00:02:30.549> connects<00:02:30.940> well<00:02:31.090> as

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
because football one connects well as

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.110 
because football one connects well as
one<00:02:31.360> was<00:02:31.569> just<00:02:31.780> terrible

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
one was just terrible

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.580 
one was just terrible
come<00:02:34.120> rails<00:02:34.360> on<00:02:34.599> there<00:02:34.750> flicks<00:02:35.110> was<00:02:35.230> obviously

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
come rails on there flicks was obviously

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.089 
come rails on there flicks was obviously
good<00:02:35.860> on<00:02:36.010> there<00:02:37.079> there<00:02:38.079> so<00:02:38.260> far<00:02:38.440> all<00:02:38.620> freely

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
good on there there so far all freely

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.670 
good on there there so far all freely
sports<00:02:39.459> makes<00:02:39.730> sense<00:02:40.000> for<00:02:40.239> connect<00:02:40.569> like<00:02:41.079> you

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
sports makes sense for connect like you

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.949 
sports makes sense for connect like you
would<00:02:41.829> they<00:02:42.489> just<00:02:42.730> make<00:02:42.970> sense<00:02:43.269> they<00:02:43.510> work<00:02:43.750> for

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
would they just make sense they work for

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.069 
would they just make sense they work for
it<00:02:44.110> so<00:02:44.790> yeah<00:02:45.790> it's<00:02:46.299> definitely<00:02:46.450> an

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
it so yeah it's definitely an

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.280 
it so yeah it's definitely an
improvement<00:02:47.349> and<00:02:48.209> I<00:02:49.209> can<00:02:49.390> see<00:02:49.569> Kinect<00:02:49.989> doing

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
improvement and I can see Kinect doing

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.319 
improvement and I can see Kinect doing
good<00:02:50.440> things<00:02:50.739> so<00:02:51.040> hopefully<00:02:51.370> connect<00:02:52.150> gets

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
good things so hopefully connect gets

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.460 
good things so hopefully connect gets
better<00:02:54.120> yeah<00:02:55.120> I<00:02:55.359> think<00:02:55.510> I<00:02:55.629> would<00:02:55.810> stay<00:02:56.290> for

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
better yeah I think I would stay for

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.110 
better yeah I think I would stay for
