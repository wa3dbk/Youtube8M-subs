00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.630
 among all the cemeteries I was touched 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.050
 this 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.300
 a cemetery only 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.359
 and it's around you is a lot of 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.590
 tombs but they are all full of bones 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.590
 no sound of people 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:36.340
 the truth is that I do not remember too much 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.340
 of mine but yes of my death 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.730
 died is like a shipwreck but to 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.730
 in 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.700
 in a tunnel of darkness notes that the 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.700
 life goes like the noise of a dog 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.489
 you stop feeling everything 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.680
 this is the worst of the cemeteries the 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.750
 corpses rot cold against the 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.630
 slabs in the chimes resound in 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.580
 empty boxes while the humidity of the 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.530
 winter makes the stones cry and 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.550
 grow the moss that takes over everything and 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.590
 of all 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.660
 my only company since then has been 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.480
 the death that continues to walk around here 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.720
 and when 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.430
 She really liked to scare me know if 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.320
 I had to describe what he would say 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.290
 like an outfit without a body angel without 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.390
 mouth and without throat nothing for the world 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.880
 always looking for life as the needle 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.920
 look for the thread but when all that 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.860
 ambition takes it and continues without stopping 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.020
 in the beauty of what he has found 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.110
 so powerful figure and neither 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.590
 observer 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.390
 and solid 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.700
 to always live insatiable 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.870
 sometimes I think you go through here just 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.870
 to laugh at loneliness 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.920
 all cemeteries 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.119
