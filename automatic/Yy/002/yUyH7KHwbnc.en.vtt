00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.140
 some months before e3 2013 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.960
 nintendo confirmed that it would show on 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.960
 event the awaited 3d mario donate one 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.640
 playable version coming to the fair what 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.189
 we saw of the successor of the series super mario 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:32.119
 galaxy but was approaching the popular 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.590
 super mario 3d land super mario 3d world 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.130
 presented an adventure in three 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.110
 dimensions of Mario Pitt Luidi toad with 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.269
 focus on multiplayer features 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.699
 unique to each hero plus new 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:45.980
 beautiful visual parameters in high 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:47.030
 definition and promise to be the system 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.579
 river cell 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.350
 but is it that Mario and his gang 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:56.079
 have been able to carry out this arduous 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.079
 even without being speculated mario galaxy 3 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.170
 this time the damsel in danger will be the 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.870
 Princess Explain Taking Advantage of Your 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.420
 days of freedom and will join Mario 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.300
 luigi toad to free the rennes pixi from 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.550
 basic tyranny for this will have to 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.580
 go through several worlds filled with 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.500
 phases and we can see both thematic 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.660
 as well as environmental 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.670
 brand new 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.100
 the map that organizes all these phases 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.050
 follows the model of super mario world 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.250
 but precisely because of being human 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.620
 three-dimensional 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.450
 no need to follow my straight lines 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.190
 and you can move freely 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.530
 by the ways 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.390
 still this organization of the 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.450
 game stadiums our proposal but 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.540
 get young from 30 world's we do not have 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.610
 immense shocks to explore objects 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:09.080
 involving explorations and dialogues with 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.190
 characters following just this year 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.470
 of 3 and led 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.720
 the 3d sea for the il proves to be more 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.370
 next game to gather the galley and 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.080
 play without commitment 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.110
 still the nintendo promise 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.030
 solid singleplayer experience but not 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.890
 wait for a personal journey time 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.660
 as in super mario 64 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.660
 mario sunshine or mario galaxy 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.439
 another element that mario 3 and world 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.079
 brings its predecessor to 3ds is 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:44.900
 just an approximation with osmar 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:46.760
 two-dimensional is a legitimate 3d mario 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.859
 but with aspects of an adventure in 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.109
 progression on the side where you 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:53.030
 these time-limited linear 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:56.120
 flag that marks the end of the stage 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.879
 it is clear that the panoramic perspective 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.340
 the 3d style brings up promoting itself 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:03.650
 only a deeper experience 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.079
 the phases have more things to do and 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.060
 hideout to explore and reach 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:10.180
 it's a challenge to think about how everything is going 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.500
 work with four characters 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.889
 especially the camera 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.239
 because the screen will not be divided into four 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:21.069
 but you will have to deal with all 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.069
 participants through a single vision 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.050
 What we can play on e3 has shown 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.910
 yes to make a 3d map with focus on 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.440
 multiplayer without losing the best 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.110
 feature that games 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.270
 three-dimensional mustache has all the 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.180
 creativity genius of the studio 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.709
 nintendo ead mainly by 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.140
 variety of gameplay 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.819
 starting with the four characters 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.170
 and their advantages and disadvantages 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:57.120
 disadvantages such as 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.670
 everyone who is the fastest in the class and 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.069
 which is the best and most balanced 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.860
 besides luigi he has higher heels and 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.400
 pitty that although sluggish can float with 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.400
 your dress 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.900
 nintendo still implemented 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.880
 very interesting game like a race 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.460
 in all the characters controls the same 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.090
 vehicle at the same time soccer balls 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.680
 to be thrown at enemy panels 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.620
 on the floor that increases the speed of 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.810
 character sleds in the form of shoes 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.520
 from piranha to the west can be 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.220
 loaded to swallow enemies 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.530
 masks to disguise themselves and 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.110
 several other oddities beyond 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.990
 fun but the icing on the cake is 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.600
 variety of power apps from the 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.389
 traditional fire flower and tanks useful 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.340
 until brand new cats suite the variations in 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:59.770
 way to control Mario and his gang 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.979
 promises to do very well with the challenges 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.810
 found in each curious phase of this 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:07.240
 even create clones with the 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.960
 double heads and stand gigantic with 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.960
 mega stain 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:32.309
 the technical realism of the power of 

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:34.139
 awaited playstation 

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:36.419
 4 xbox one 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:39.029
 Nintendo has not brought the best console 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.800
 technically speaking plus 3 and world 

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:42.629
 comes with the promise of establishing a 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:49.770
 graphic quality standard for 

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:50.699
 river games is like having all the beauty of a 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.610
 mario galaxy 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:55.559
 only in high definition scenarios 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.240
 are beautiful and the variety of 

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:59.490
 well- architected environments 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.330
 value the effort employed in the visual 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.580
 about the game 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.409
 light effects also show us the 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.499
 how much the artistic part of the game was 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:09.809
 worked good hope everything 

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:11.699
 hobbies in slow down to the same as with 

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:13.860
 four characters jumping and shooting 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:15.719
 balls of fire at the same time and be a 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.159
 hardly difficult 

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:18.749
 still do not see any functionality 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:22.680
 that takes advantage of the true differential 

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:24.449
 River your tablet control feature 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.939
 slide your finger over elements of the 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:29.069
 hidden scenery is interesting but 

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:31.399
 still waiting with mini games for 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:33.839
 touch screen integration as evans 

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:36.149
 while the soundtrack 

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:39.089
 We can hardly speak but his participation 

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:46.439
 by composer cody condon is already a reason for 

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:48.240
 A lot of joy that I tried 3 but it is not 

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:51.269
 exactly a series that captivates the 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.909
 mass audience - it was mÃ¡rio brasil already 

00:06:51.269 --> 00:06:56.969
 had failed before 

00:06:53.909 --> 00:07:00.599
 been too adult and gave year was the year 

00:06:56.969 --> 00:07:02.969
 so unfortunately that one went away 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:04.949
 the promise of taking the il of the week off 

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:06.990
 sales gloom falls on the hands 

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:09.419
 March gloom your class 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:11.699
 the proposal to join the gang in the same 

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:13.680
 couch to enjoy an experience that even 

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:17.249
 so it was always single-player looks 

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:19.349
 interesting but although several options 

00:07:17.249 --> 00:07:21.240
 control the possibility of entering or 

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:24.060
 leave the match at any time 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.580
 help to popularize the game will be with 

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:28.879
 3d mario in groups 

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:31.310
 able to overcome its predecessors good 

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:32.479
 this is what we will discover on the 22nd 

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.750
 from November 

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:38.090
 so dex elmont game pad no shank 

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:40.400
 or whatever peripheral you use and 

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:43.449
 let's explore realm explain if this 

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.449
 in high definition
