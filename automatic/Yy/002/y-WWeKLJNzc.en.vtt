00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.219
 ah 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.359
 here are the Basques 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.340
 mollusks are invertebrate animals 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.829
 with the soft body almost all have 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.379
 shell this shell covers and protects its 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.300
 part can be in one piece as 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.730
 the snail's 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.940
 or two pieces like that of the 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.940
 clam 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.350
 we are going to have no shell 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.100
 they have a softer shell in the 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.100
 inside of your body 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.870
 and they move swimming over some 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.430
 how snails live on earth and 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.370
 they crawl on the floor 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.740
 the annoying ones are oviparous animals and 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:28.660
 eggs leave larvae that change little to 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.660
 little into adults 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.390
 almost all moles as they live in the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.390
 Water 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.060
 like only a few molist or if 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.580
 resigned at the end in the sea have the 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.280
 most mollusks some live 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.290
 glued to rocks like limpets and 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.870
 others like squid and cuttlefish 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.900
 they live in the open sea and also 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.610
 some sailors like the knives that 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.760
 they live buried in the sand of the 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.760
 Beaches 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.670
 in rivers and lakes they live mostly 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.280
 aquatic snails on land 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.890
 they have the dirt plug and the slug 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.380
 although these molluscs live outside the 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.110
 need to live in areas with a lot of 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.780
 humidity the mollusks are some animals 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.610
 very abundant in nature without 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.710
 However, they depend so much on water for 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.040
 live that are never in zones 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.040
 dry 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.980
 the different species of mollusks 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.710
 they can differentiate themselves from each other 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.800
 way of feeding yourself breathe and of 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:02.590
 move the mollusks feed on 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.920
 herbivorous animal vegetables and molluscs 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.170
 like snail from orchard and slug 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.540
 omnivores such as clams and mussels and 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.370
 carnivores like squid and cuttlefish 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.040
 the mollusks that live in the water 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.390
 they breathe through gills and those that live 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.880
 on the firm ground they breathe through lungs 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.190
 most molluscs move 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.220
 swimming 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.200
 squid and clams only 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.830
 the snails, both aquatic and 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.710
 terrestrial are drawn rectangle all 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.600
 the annoying ones are oviparous animals 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.760
 eggs that put the females some 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.080
 larvae that change little by little until 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.080
 become adults 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.329
 ah
