00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.200 
same thing to each side you make an
angular<00:01:58.180> fold<00:01:59.220> is<00:02:00.220> to<00:02:00.430> start<00:02:00.729> right<00:02:00.970> around

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
angular fold is to start right around

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.160 
angular fold is to start right around
the<00:02:01.420> R<00:02:01.659> in<00:02:02.140> America<00:02:02.710> and<00:02:03.780> go<00:02:04.780> all<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.050> way<00:02:05.080> to

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
the R in America and go all the way to

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.580 
the R in America and go all the way to
the<00:02:05.290> top<00:02:06.630> be<00:02:07.630> sure<00:02:07.660> you<00:02:07.930> have<00:02:08.080> a<00:02:08.110> little<00:02:08.380> bit<00:02:08.500> of

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
the top be sure you have a little bit of

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.380 
the top be sure you have a little bit of
space<00:02:08.830> behind<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.610> fold<00:02:09.820> it<00:02:10.000> doesn't<00:02:10.240> need<00:02:10.330> to

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
space behind the fold it doesn't need to

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.820 
space behind the fold it doesn't need to
be<00:02:10.420> folded<00:02:10.780> flat<00:02:11.020> and<00:02:11.320> you<00:02:11.410> make<00:02:11.590> sure<00:02:11.620> you

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
be folded flat and you make sure you

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.479 
be folded flat and you make sure you
have<00:02:11.950> an<00:02:12.070> S<00:02:12.330> angle<00:02:13.330> just<00:02:13.480> like<00:02:13.600> that<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:15.250> an

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
have an S angle just like that and an

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.390 
have an S angle just like that and an
Aztec<00:02:15.940> crease<00:02:16.739> so<00:02:17.739> again<00:02:17.950> we'll<00:02:18.160> do<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.370> other

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
Aztec crease so again we'll do the other

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.100 
Aztec crease so again we'll do the other
side<00:02:18.850> just<00:02:21.060> around<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.209> middle<00:02:22.390> of<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.540> R<00:02:22.720> and

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
side just around the middle of the R and

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.310 
side just around the middle of the R and
dollar<00:02:25.590> crease<00:02:26.590> that<00:02:26.800> up<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:28.630> turn<00:02:29.110> it<00:02:29.200> this

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
dollar crease that up and turn it this

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.280 
dollar crease that up and turn it this
way<00:02:29.380> you'll<00:02:30.010> see<00:02:30.280> it<00:02:30.519> kind<00:02:30.880> of<00:02:31.000> looks<00:02:31.060> like<00:02:31.330> the

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
way you'll see it kind of looks like the

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.229 
way you'll see it kind of looks like the
shirt<00:02:32.500> color<00:02:32.739> that's<00:02:33.220> exactly<00:02:33.790> what<00:02:34.090> we're

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
shirt color that's exactly what we're

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.530 
shirt color that's exactly what we're
going<00:02:34.420> for<00:02:36.120> next<00:02:37.120> thing<00:02:37.390> we<00:02:37.480> need<00:02:37.570> to<00:02:37.630> do<00:02:37.870> is

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
going for next thing we need to do is

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.199 
going for next thing we need to do is
fold<00:02:40.540> our<00:02:40.959> dollar<00:02:41.200> bill<00:02:41.410> a<00:02:41.680> few<00:02:41.920> times<00:02:42.220> fold<00:02:43.120> it

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
fold our dollar bill a few times fold it

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.050 
fold our dollar bill a few times fold it
about<00:02:43.300> a<00:02:43.420> third<00:02:43.720> of<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:43.989> way<00:02:44.140> down<00:02:44.970> from<00:02:45.970> the

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
about a third of the way down from the

about a third of the way down from the
top<00:02:46.170> unfold<00:02:47.170> that<00:02:47.820> then<00:02:48.820> we're<00:02:48.940> going<00:02:49.060> to<00:02:49.120> do

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
top unfold that then we're going to do

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.960 
top unfold that then we're going to do
it<00:02:49.300> again<00:02:49.390> on<00:02:49.780> this<00:02:50.350> side<00:02:53.760> starting<00:02:54.760> from<00:02:54.850> the

it again on this side starting from the

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.340 
it again on this side starting from the
bottom<00:02:55.120> you'll<00:02:55.540> notice<00:02:55.570> the<00:02:55.840> line<00:02:56.049> comes

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
bottom you'll notice the line comes

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.850 
bottom you'll notice the line comes
right<00:02:56.560> up<00:02:56.709> to<00:02:56.890> about<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.340> O<00:02:57.489> and<00:02:57.880> of<00:02:58.590> America

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
fold in our previous fold and tuck it

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.130 
fold in our previous fold and tuck it
right<00:03:06.640> up<00:03:06.940> under<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.269> edge<00:03:07.450> of<00:03:07.810> those<00:03:07.959> two

right up under the edge of those two
angular<00:03:08.470> folds<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:10.720> it's<00:03:10.959> starting<00:03:11.260> to<00:03:11.350> look

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
angular folds and it's starting to look

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.840 
angular folds and it's starting to look
like<00:03:11.500> a<00:03:11.650> shirt<00:03:11.950> with<00:03:12.130> a<00:03:12.160> little<00:03:12.430> collar<00:03:12.640> at<00:03:12.790> the

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
like a shirt with a little collar at the

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.340 
like a shirt with a little collar at the
top<00:03:12.910> but<00:03:13.299> there's<00:03:13.480> one<00:03:13.570> thing<00:03:13.780> missing

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350

we don't have sleeves now that's

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:17.729 
we don't have sleeves now that's
probably<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.660> hardest<00:03:16.989> thing<00:03:17.049> to<00:03:17.290> make<00:03:17.470> in

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
probably the hardest thing to make in

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.039 
probably the hardest thing to make in
this<00:03:17.950> project<00:03:18.760> but<00:03:19.030> it's<00:03:19.209> actually<00:03:19.660> fairly
