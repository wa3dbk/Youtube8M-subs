real girl vlogging from her bedroom I

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.660 
real girl vlogging from her bedroom I

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
thought that was quite interesting

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.389 
thought that was quite interesting
because<00:00:41.820> even<00:00:42.660> still<00:00:42.899> today<00:00:43.140> people<00:00:43.170> take<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
because even still today people take the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:44.990

Internet

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
Internet

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.600 
Internet
I<00:00:45.030> guess<00:00:45.989> at<00:00:46.320> face<00:00:46.649> value<00:00:46.680> which<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.309> little

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
I guess at face value which is a little

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.520 
I guess at face value which is a little
bit<00:00:47.760> scary<00:00:48.329> but<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:48.780> very<00:00:48.989> interesting<00:00:49.410> as

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
bit scary but it's very interesting as

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.529 
bit scary but it's very interesting as
well<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.219> loved<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:50.879> in<00:00:51.000> at<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.300> time

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
well so I loved on in at this time

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.290 
well so I loved on in at this time
YouTube<00:00:51.899> was<00:00:52.050> about<00:00:52.610> it<00:00:53.610> was<00:00:53.730> really<00:00:54.059> small

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
YouTube was about it was really small

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.779 
YouTube was about it was really small
side<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.780> small<00:00:55.440> site<00:00:55.920> compared<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.489> what<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.699> is

off and then where do you get the

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.160 
off and then where do you get the
inspiration<00:02:35.790> for<00:02:36.360> most<00:02:36.570> of<00:02:36.690> your<00:02:36.750> videos<00:02:37.050> I

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
internet that sounds very awful but I

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.249 
internet that sounds very awful but I
mean<00:04:29.919> I<00:04:29.949> was<00:04:30.130> 17<00:04:30.580> when<00:04:30.729> I<00:04:30.790> started<00:04:31.210> its<00:04:31.419> 1890

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:32.259 
mean I was 17 when I started its 1890

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:33.689 
mean I was 17 when I started its 1890
look<00:04:32.590> that's<00:04:32.830> terabyte<00:04:33.190> any<00:04:33.310> matter<00:04:33.490> how<00:04:33.580> old

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
look that's terabyte any matter how old

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:37.920 
look that's terabyte any matter how old
I<00:04:33.789> was<00:04:34.710> maybe<00:04:35.710> 19<00:04:36.389> either<00:04:37.389> way<00:04:37.570> I<00:04:37.600> think<00:04:37.810> that's

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
I was maybe 19 either way I think that's

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.300 
I was maybe 19 either way I think that's
very<00:04:38.050> important<00:04:38.500> because<00:04:38.560> the<00:04:38.830> Internet<00:04:39.160> is

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
very important because the Internet is

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.120 
very important because the Internet is
still<00:04:39.490> a<00:04:40.199> place<00:04:41.199> that's<00:04:41.410> being<00:04:41.590> discovered<00:04:42.039> at

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
still a place that's being discovered at

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.249 
still a place that's being discovered at
the<00:04:42.190> moment<00:04:42.550> but<00:04:43.479> I<00:04:43.539> think<00:04:43.750> it's<00:04:43.840> important

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:44.259 
the moment but I think it's important

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:45.420 
the moment but I think it's important
that<00:04:44.289> people<00:04:44.740> just<00:04:44.979> do<00:04:45.070> what<00:04:45.190> they<00:04:45.280> like

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
that people just do what they like

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.710 
that people just do what they like

there's<00:04:49.900> so<00:04:50.020> much<00:04:50.050> pollen<00:04:50.650> in<00:04:50.770> me<00:04:50.860> a<00:04:52.560> lot<00:04:53.560> of

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
there's so much pollen in me a lot of

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.680 
there's so much pollen in me a lot of
access<00:04:54.100> to<00:04:54.130> niches<00:04:54.789> so<00:04:55.240> I<00:04:55.270> think<00:04:55.360> if<00:04:55.570> you<00:04:55.660> just

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
access to niches so I think if you just

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.020 
access to niches so I think if you just
do<00:04:55.960> whatever<00:04:56.139> you<00:04:56.320> like<00:04:56.490> people<00:04:57.490> will<00:04:57.729> find

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
do whatever you like people will find

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.150 
do whatever you like people will find
you<00:04:58.270> and<00:04:58.419> and<00:04:58.630> that's<00:04:58.960> a<00:04:59.080> fun<00:04:59.229> thing<00:04:59.440> so<00:04:59.710> yeah

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
you and and that's a fun thing so yeah

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.870 
you and and that's a fun thing so yeah
and<00:05:00.930> finally<00:05:01.930> what<00:05:02.380> have<00:05:02.680> you<00:05:03.010> seen<00:05:03.400> from<00:05:03.460> your

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
and finally what have you seen from your

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.950 
and finally what have you seen from your
videos<00:05:04.210> what<00:05:04.360> do<00:05:04.419> you<00:05:04.479> think<00:05:04.630> are<00:05:04.720> some<00:05:04.810> of<00:05:04.900> the

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
videos what do you think are some of the

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.900 
videos what do you think are some of the
pitfalls<00:05:05.169> of<00:05:05.680> posting<00:05:06.100> on<00:05:06.220> the<00:05:06.310> Internet<00:05:06.729> as

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
pitfalls of posting on the Internet as

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.700 
pitfalls of posting on the Internet as
opposed<00:05:07.270> to<00:05:07.449> using<00:05:07.780> more<00:05:08.020> traditional<00:05:08.139> routes

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
opposed to using more traditional routes

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:16.100 
opposed to using more traditional routes
such<00:05:08.949> as<00:05:08.979> television<00:05:11.940> it's<00:05:12.940> a<00:05:13.000> lot<00:05:13.150> harder<00:05:13.389> to

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.430 

control<00:05:17.110> what<00:05:18.010> happens<00:05:18.310> to<00:05:18.490> your<00:05:18.669> stuff

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
control what happens to your stuff

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.320 
control what happens to your stuff
copyrights<00:05:20.440> a<00:05:20.770> bit<00:05:21.370> of<00:05:21.490> an<00:05:21.610> issue<00:05:21.789> but<00:05:22.090> I<00:05:22.150> mean

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
copyrights a bit of an issue but I mean

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.879 
copyrights a bit of an issue but I mean
like<00:05:22.449> I<00:05:22.720> think<00:05:23.020> things<00:05:23.380> on<00:05:23.500> the<00:05:23.590> internet

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
like I think things on the internet

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:25.770 
like I think things on the internet
should<00:05:24.070> be<00:05:24.220> shared<00:05:24.460> so<00:05:24.610> but<00:05:25.090> other<00:05:25.419> people

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
should be shared so but other people

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:26.460 
should be shared so but other people
find<00:05:25.930> that<00:05:26.020> a<00:05:26.080> problem

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
find that a problem

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.200 
find that a problem
traditional<00:05:27.039> media<00:05:27.130> finds<00:05:27.550> it<00:05:27.639> a<00:05:27.669> problem

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.180 

yeah<00:05:31.210> I<00:05:31.780> think<00:05:32.349> there's<00:05:32.650> a<00:05:32.740> lot<00:05:32.889> of<00:05:32.979> freedom

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
yeah I think there's a lot of freedom

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.409 
yeah I think there's a lot of freedom
that<00:05:33.490> comes<00:05:33.610> to<00:05:33.820> doing<00:05:34.030> things<00:05:34.150> on<00:05:34.330> the

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
that comes to doing things on the

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:36.360 
that comes to doing things on the
internet<00:05:34.810> but<00:05:34.930> I<00:05:35.020> guess<00:05:35.199> the<00:05:35.440> the<00:05:35.830> downfall<00:05:36.340> is

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
internet but I guess the the downfall is

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.750 
internet but I guess the the downfall is
that<00:05:36.789> people<00:05:38.010> the<00:05:39.010> anonymity<00:05:39.340> that<00:05:39.699> the

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
that people the anonymity that the

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.070 
that people the anonymity that the
Internet<00:05:40.060> provides<00:05:40.090> means<00:05:40.840> that<00:05:40.990> you're

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
Internet provides means that you're

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.060 
Internet provides means that you're
gonna<00:05:41.169> deal<00:05:41.440> with<00:05:41.470> a<00:05:41.590> lot<00:05:41.740> more<00:05:41.889> harassment

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
gonna deal with a lot more harassment

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.649 
gonna deal with a lot more harassment
you're<00:05:42.550> gonna<00:05:42.669> deal<00:05:42.849> with<00:05:43.000> a<00:05:43.030> lot<00:05:43.210> more<00:05:43.360> abuse

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:43.659 
you're gonna deal with a lot more abuse

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:45.540 
you're gonna deal with a lot more abuse
and<00:05:43.990> things<00:05:44.440> like<00:05:44.650> that<00:05:44.830> and<00:05:45.039> I<00:05:45.099> guess<00:05:45.310> that

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
and things like that and I guess that

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.420 
and things like that and I guess that
there's<00:05:45.699> no<00:05:45.849> one<00:05:46.030> around<00:05:46.419> you<00:05:46.960> to<00:05:47.190> filter<00:05:48.190> that

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
there's no one around you to filter that

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.100 
there's no one around you to filter that
for<00:05:48.760> you<00:05:48.880> unless<00:05:49.240> you<00:05:49.449> prepare<00:05:49.870> for<00:05:49.960> that

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
for you unless you prepare for that

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.659 
for you unless you prepare for that
which<00:05:50.260> I<00:05:50.380> guess<00:05:50.530> is<00:05:50.710> another<00:05:50.860> piece<00:05:51.220> of<00:05:51.250> advice

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
which I guess is another piece of advice

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:57.600 
which I guess is another piece of advice
so<00:05:52.030> I<00:05:54.419> guess<00:05:55.440> immediate<00:05:56.440> feedback<00:05:56.680> you<00:05:57.400> make

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
so I guess immediate feedback you make

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.100 
so I guess immediate feedback you make
content<00:05:58.030> there's<00:05:58.240> immediate<00:05:58.479> feedback<00:05:58.870> I

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
content there's immediate feedback I

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.629 
content there's immediate feedback I
mean<00:05:59.349> then<00:05:59.470> just<00:05:59.650> the<00:05:59.740> sharing<00:06:00.220> that<00:06:00.340> happens

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 
mean then just the sharing that happens

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:02.760 
mean then just the sharing that happens
on<00:06:00.729> the<00:06:00.820> Internet<00:06:01.120> is<00:06:01.270> wonderful<00:06:02.110> despite<00:06:02.560> all

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
saying they feel the same way is a

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.320 
saying they feel the same way is a
