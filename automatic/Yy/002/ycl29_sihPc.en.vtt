lenses<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.780> really<00:00:37.079> do<00:00:37.230> like<00:00:37.410> them<00:00:37.559> they<00:00:38.600> man

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
lenses I really do like them they man

lenses I really do like them they man
they<00:00:39.719> just<00:00:39.840> do<00:00:40.050> wonders<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:41.520> PC<00:00:42.450> II<00:00:42.660> was<00:00:43.020> a

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
they just do wonders so PC II was a

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.709 
they just do wonders so PC II was a
stand<00:00:43.379> for<00:00:43.530> well<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.309> P<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.700> C<00:00:44.969> that

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
stand for well the P and the C that

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.720 
stand for well the P and the C that
means<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.079> perspective<00:00:46.410> correction<00:00:46.739> he<00:00:47.490> is

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
means the perspective correction he is

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.610 
means the perspective correction he is
the<00:00:48.270> electronic<00:00:49.850> Absher<00:00:50.930> so<00:00:51.930> what<00:00:52.380> we<00:00:52.470> got

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
the electronic Absher so what we got

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.710 
the electronic Absher so what we got
going<00:00:52.829> here<00:00:52.860> well<00:00:53.130> first<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.460> all<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:54.000> PC<00:00:54.480> part

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
going here well first of all the PC part

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.900 
going here well first of all the PC part
the<00:00:54.840> perspective<00:00:55.320> correction<00:00:55.650> now<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.640> whole

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
the perspective correction now the whole

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.390 
the perspective correction now the whole
goal<00:00:57.180> here<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.750> real<00:00:58.230> simple<00:00:58.470> we<00:00:59.100> want<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.340> keep

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
goal here is real simple we want to keep

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.630 
goal here is real simple we want to keep
our<00:00:59.579> film<00:00:59.850> plain<00:01:00.060> the<00:01:00.540> back<00:01:00.720> this<00:01:00.930> camera

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
our film plain the back this camera

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.999 
our film plain the back this camera
parallel<00:01:02.640> with<00:01:03.060> the<00:01:03.180> subject<00:01:03.630> now<00:01:04.619> when<00:01:04.769> we<00:01:04.829> do

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
parallel with the subject now when we do

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:06.770 
parallel with the subject now when we do
that<00:01:05.220> we<00:01:05.700> don't<00:01:05.850> have<00:01:06.060> any<00:01:06.180> convergence<00:01:06.689> of

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
that we don't have any convergence of

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.499 
that we don't have any convergence of
the<00:01:06.930> lines<00:01:07.229> okay<00:01:07.829> that's<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.670> main<00:01:08.880> goal<00:01:09.210> now

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
the lines okay that's the main goal now

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.280 
the lines okay that's the main goal now
if<00:01:10.439> we<00:01:10.979> parallel<00:01:11.820> our<00:01:12.060> film<00:01:12.570> playing<00:01:12.810> with<00:01:13.049> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
if we parallel our film playing with the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.590 
if we parallel our film playing with the
let's<00:01:13.740> say<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.920> building

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
let's say a building

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.959 
let's say a building
the<00:01:15.600> problem<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.170> when<00:01:17.130> we've<00:01:17.280> done<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.520> we

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969 
the problem is when we've done that we

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:19.249 
the problem is when we've done that we
were<00:01:18.090> going<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.420> cut<00:01:18.689> off<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.020> top<00:01:19.229> of

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
were going to cut off the top of

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.289 
were going to cut off the top of
building<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.770> won't<00:01:19.979> see<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.370> top<00:01:21.120> of

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
building you won't see that top of

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.390 
building you won't see that top of
building<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.690> the<00:01:21.780> frame<00:01:22.010> so<00:01:23.010> we're<00:01:23.250> going<00:01:23.340> to

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
building in the frame so we're going to

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.330 
building in the frame so we're going to
use<00:01:23.640> our<00:01:23.880> PC<00:01:24.870> part<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.200> lens<00:01:25.440> that's<00:01:25.920> called<00:01:26.220> the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
use our PC part a lens that's called the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.550 
use our PC part a lens that's called the
shift<00:01:26.610> for<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.940> rise<00:01:27.120> to<00:01:27.810> bring<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.170> back<00:01:28.320> in

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
shift for the rise to bring it back in

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.770 
shift for the rise to bring it back in
so<00:01:28.770> unlock<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.640> unlocking<00:01:30.060> knob<00:01:30.299> on<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.630> side

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
so unlock is unlocking knob on this side

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.550 
so unlock is unlocking knob on this side
of<00:01:30.810> lens<00:01:31.080> you<00:01:32.240> lock<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.540> we<00:01:33.659> simply<00:01:34.020> raise

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
of lens you lock it and we simply raise

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.730 
of lens you lock it and we simply raise
the<00:01:34.740> lens<00:01:34.920> up<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:36.350> have<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> set<00:01:37.619> for<00:01:37.710> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
the lens up I have a set for the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.020 
the lens up I have a set for the
vertical<00:01:38.220> I'll<00:01:38.310> go<00:01:38.460> back<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.850> horse

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
vertical I'll go back to horse

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.300 
vertical I'll go back to horse
horizontal<00:01:39.869> here<00:01:40.020> raise<00:01:40.830> it<00:01:41.010> up

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
horizontal here raise it up

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.120 
horizontal here raise it up
okay<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:41.970> we<00:01:42.060> shift<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.390> lens<00:01:42.570> up<00:01:43.010> so<00:01:44.010> the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
okay and we shift the lens up so the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.640 
okay and we shift the lens up so the
lens<00:01:44.310> shifts<00:01:44.670> up<00:01:44.820> or<00:01:45.299> down<00:01:45.510> okay

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
lens shifts up or down okay

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.020 
lens shifts up or down okay
typically<00:01:47.340> though<00:01:47.580> it's<00:01:47.790> going<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:47.970> be

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
typically though it's going to be

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.920 
typically though it's going to be
raising<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.810> up<00:01:49.250> so<00:01:50.250> we<00:01:50.460> have<00:01:50.640> taken<00:01:51.060> our<00:01:51.210> back

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
raising it up so we have taken our back

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.420 
raising it up so we have taken our back
of<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.110> camera<00:01:52.350> we've<00:01:52.619> got<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.890> parallel<00:01:53.310> to

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
of the camera we've got a parallel to

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.390 
of the camera we've got a parallel to
the<00:01:53.549> film<00:01:53.790> plane<00:01:53.850> or<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.330> the<00:01:54.799> building<00:01:55.799> and

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
the film plane or to the building and

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.310 
the film plane or to the building and
now<00:01:56.580> we've<00:01:56.729> raised<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.689> four<00:01:57.869> elements<00:01:58.080> and

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
now we've raised the four elements and

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.660 
now we've raised the four elements and
now<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.439> top<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.920> building<00:01:59.159> comes<00:01:59.400> in<00:01:59.549> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
now the top of building comes in the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.730 
now the top of building comes in the
frame<00:02:00.229> now<00:02:01.229> here's<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.409> couple<00:02:01.590> things<00:02:01.650> that

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
frame now here's a couple things that

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.730 
frame now here's a couple things that
happens<00:02:02.100> when<00:02:02.220> that<00:02:02.850> occurs<00:02:02.909> first<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.930> all<00:02:04.080> we

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
happens when that occurs first of all we

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.479 
happens when that occurs first of all we
do<00:02:04.890> get<00:02:05.450> but<00:02:06.450> what<00:02:07.290> else<00:02:07.470> we<00:02:07.650> could<00:02:07.799> well<00:02:08.399> as

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
do get but what else we could well as

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.279 
do get but what else we could well as
soon<00:02:08.670> as<00:02:08.759> we<00:02:08.909> take<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:09.239> lens<00:02:09.420> we<00:02:09.629> move<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.959> off

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
soon as we take this lens we move it off

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.190 
soon as we take this lens we move it off
of<00:02:10.890> this<00:02:11.009> plane<00:02:11.340> okay<00:02:12.030> we<00:02:12.629> have<00:02:12.750> lost<00:02:12.989> the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
of this plane okay we have lost the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.970 
of this plane okay we have lost the
ability<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.530> meter

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
ability to meter

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.710 
ability to meter
so<00:02:14.610> all<00:02:14.760> metering<00:02:15.150> has<00:02:15.269> to<00:02:15.360> be<00:02:15.450> done<00:02:15.599> before

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
so all metering has to be done before

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.050 
so all metering has to be done before
you<00:02:15.959> do<00:02:16.049> any<00:02:16.290> shifting<00:02:16.650> or<00:02:17.069> tilting<00:02:17.640> for<00:02:17.939> that

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
you do any shifting or tilting for that

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.750 
you do any shifting or tilting for that
matter<00:02:18.739> now<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.799> way<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.010> prefer<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:20.519> do<00:02:20.670> it

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
matter now the way I prefer to do it

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.960 
matter now the way I prefer to do it
right<00:02:21.060> now<00:02:21.239> is<00:02:21.420> camera<00:02:22.230> beyond<00:02:22.730> take<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.760> meter

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
right now is camera beyond take a meter

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:24.260 
right now is camera beyond take a meter

button<00:03:05.320> there<00:03:05.500> and<00:03:05.590> away<00:03:05.740> I<00:03:05.770> go<00:03:06.510> so<00:03:07.510> that's<00:03:07.630> a

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
button there and away I go so that's a

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.870 
button there and away I go so that's a
PC<00:03:08.170> part<00:03:08.770> of<00:03:08.920> the<00:03:09.040> perspective<00:03:09.490> correction

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
PC part of the perspective correction

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.240 
PC part of the perspective correction
now<00:03:10.810> it<00:03:10.900> comes<00:03:11.050> to<00:03:11.200> tilt<00:03:11.440> shift<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:12.010> tilt

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
now it comes to tilt shift the tilt

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.060 
now it comes to tilt shift the tilt
shift<00:03:12.310> part<00:03:12.700> is<00:03:12.790> a<00:03:13.060> very<00:03:13.210> very<00:03:13.960> cool<00:03:14.290> part<00:03:14.620> now

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
shift part is a very very cool part now

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.520 
shift part is a very very cool part now
the<00:03:15.130> tilt<00:03:15.610> it<00:03:15.790> well<00:03:16.660> I<00:03:16.690> don't<00:03:16.780> know<00:03:16.990> as<00:03:17.200> some

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
the tilt it well I don't know as some

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.870 
the tilt it well I don't know as some
sort<00:03:17.650> of<00:03:17.740> bows<00:03:17.950> when<00:03:18.130> I<00:03:18.220> first<00:03:18.400> got<00:03:18.490> the<00:03:18.610> lens<00:03:18.760> I

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
sort of bows when I first got the lens I

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.250 
sort of bows when I first got the lens I
thought<00:03:19.030> oh<00:03:19.060> I'll<00:03:19.480> see<00:03:19.810> you<00:03:19.960> know<00:03:20.050> I<00:03:20.080> got

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
tilted like this to make it work this is

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.170 
tilted like this to make it work this is
a<00:03:23.440> really<00:03:23.830> precision<00:03:24.280> piece<00:03:24.430> of<00:03:24.580> equipment

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
a really precision piece of equipment

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.820 
a really precision piece of equipment
here<00:03:25.300> and<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.870> engine<00:03:26.080> is<00:03:26.140> Nikon<00:03:26.470> did<00:03:26.590> a<00:03:26.650> great

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
here and the engine is Nikon did a great

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.970 
here and the engine is Nikon did a great
job<00:03:26.860> it<00:03:27.400> takes<00:03:27.490> almost<00:03:27.880> zero<00:03:28.300> tilt<00:03:28.900> okay<00:03:29.500> in

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
job it takes almost zero tilt okay in

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.250 
job it takes almost zero tilt okay in
order<00:03:30.190> to<00:03:30.370> pull<00:03:30.640> in<00:03:30.850> the<00:03:31.270> whole<00:03:31.600> big<00:03:31.870> plan<00:03:32.110> of

lens<00:03:48.010> or<00:03:48.580> the<00:03:48.760> aperture<00:03:48.970> I<00:03:49.150> should<00:03:49.300> say<00:03:49.420> all

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
lens or the aperture I should say all

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.210 
lens or the aperture I should say all
the<00:03:49.630> way<00:03:49.690> down<00:03:49.870> so<00:03:50.170> that's<00:03:50.290> I'm<00:03:50.530> opening<00:03:51.010> up<00:03:51.100> to

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
the way down so that's I'm opening up to

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.330 
the way down so that's I'm opening up to
2.8<00:03:51.850> and<00:03:52.140> then<00:03:53.140> I'm<00:03:53.890> gonna<00:03:54.070> sit<00:03:54.220> here<00:03:54.280> and

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
2.8 and then I'm gonna sit here and

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.830 
2.8 and then I'm gonna sit here and
focus<00:03:54.520> remember<00:03:54.940> these<00:03:55.030> are<00:03:55.150> manually<00:03:55.450> focus

lenses okay these are not article

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.449

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
because they're manual focus and then I

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:06.500 
because they're manual focus and then I
