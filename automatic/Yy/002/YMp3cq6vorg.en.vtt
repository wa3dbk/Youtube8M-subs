going to need to put an elbow on it but

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.170 
going to need to put an elbow on it but
this<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.229> what<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.530> start<00:01:04.830> with<00:01:05.000> your<00:01:06.000> nice

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
this is what you start with your nice

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.440 
this is what you start with your nice
hearth<00:01:06.900> pad<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:08.130> these<00:01:08.760> are<00:01:08.939> made<00:01:09.150> with

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
hearth pad and this these are made with

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.960 
hearth pad and this these are made with
the<00:01:09.990> heart<00:01:10.170> stones<00:01:10.500> or<00:01:10.830> 2<00:01:11.070> inches<00:01:11.400> thick<00:01:11.640> so

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
the heart stones or 2 inches thick so

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.630 
the heart stones or 2 inches thick so
that<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.960> also<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.490> requirement<00:01:16.369> so<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.460> next

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
that is also a requirement so the next

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.240 
that is also a requirement so the next
step<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.659> install<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.470> ceiling<00:01:19.860> support

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
step is to install this ceiling support

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.030 
step is to install this ceiling support
box<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:21.080> I've<00:01:22.080> already<00:01:23.810> found<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.020> truss<00:01:25.320> is

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
box and I've already found the truss is

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.340 
box and I've already found the truss is
right<00:01:26.340> here<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:28.909> squared<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.030> off<00:01:30.290> and<00:01:31.290> I

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
right here and squared it off and I

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.069 
right here and squared it off and I
actually<00:01:31.439> help<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.829> box<00:01:32.070> up<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.720> just<00:01:33.720> marked

with two by fours and I'll nail this
wire<00:02:00.960> down<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.740> side<00:02:01.979> just<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:03.049> keep<00:02:04.049> it

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
wire down to the side just to keep it

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.560 
wire down to the side just to keep it
from<00:02:04.290> touching<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.740> pipe<00:02:05.180> but<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.299> chimney

here<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:30.310> way<00:02:30.459> we'll<00:02:30.640> know<00:02:30.670> where<00:02:31.000> to

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
here and that way we'll know where to

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.330 
here and that way we'll know where to
cut<00:02:31.239> our<00:02:31.360> hole<00:02:31.569> for<00:02:32.019> the<00:02:32.349> roof<00:02:32.739> flashing<00:02:34.200> so

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
cut our hole for the roof flashing so

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.410 
cut our hole for the roof flashing so
that'll<00:02:36.340> be<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.549> next<00:02:36.670> step<00:02:37.030> we're<00:02:37.239> going<00:02:37.329> to

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
that'll be the next step we're going to

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:47.180 
that'll be the next step we're going to
cut<00:02:37.629> this<00:02:37.810> hole<00:02:38.079> and<00:02:38.610> trim<00:02:39.610> out<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:40.890> box<00:02:41.890> here

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.640 

all<00:02:48.190> right<00:02:48.340> we've<00:02:48.489> got<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:48.760> support<00:02:49.000> box<00:02:49.650> and

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
all right we've got the support box and

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.259 
all right we've got the support box and
you're<00:02:51.010> just<00:02:51.220> putting<00:02:51.400> in<00:02:51.609> a<00:02:51.640> few<00:02:51.879> more<00:02:52.000> screws

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
you're just putting in a few more screws

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.680 
you're just putting in a few more screws
you<00:02:53.230> can<00:02:53.379> see<00:02:54.030> there's<00:02:55.030> little<00:02:55.269> trim<00:02:55.450> piece

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
you can see there's little trim piece

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.960 
you can see there's little trim piece
and<00:02:56.349> that<00:02:56.650> just<00:02:56.890> covers<00:02:57.099> up<00:02:57.430> all<00:02:57.609> the<00:02:57.790> rough

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
and that just covers up all the rough

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.539 
and that just covers up all the rough
edges<00:02:58.209> from<00:02:58.720> cutting<00:02:59.079> the<00:02:59.170> drywall<00:02:59.560> so<00:03:00.400> it

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
edges from cutting the drywall so it

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.649 
edges from cutting the drywall so it
comes<00:03:00.819> it<00:03:01.000> out<00:03:01.120> really<00:03:01.329> nice<00:03:02.010> came<00:03:03.010> out<00:03:03.190> good

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
comes it out really nice came out good

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:08.330 
comes it out really nice came out good
I'm<00:03:04.659> going<00:03:04.840> to<00:03:04.900> show<00:03:05.019> you<00:03:05.079> it<00:03:05.230> from<00:03:05.379> up<00:03:05.530> top<00:03:05.799> now

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.729 

alright<00:03:09.340> here<00:03:09.579> we<00:03:09.609> are<00:03:09.900> on<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.079> top<00:03:11.319> we<00:03:11.560> cut

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
alright here we are on the top we cut

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.750 
alright here we are on the top we cut
the<00:03:11.859> roof<00:03:12.239> you<00:03:13.239> can<00:03:13.390> see<00:03:13.569> I<00:03:13.599> trimmed<00:03:14.049> out<00:03:14.760> with

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
the roof you can see I trimmed out with

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.030 
the roof you can see I trimmed out with
two<00:03:15.940> by<00:03:16.090> fours<00:03:17.609> everything's<00:03:18.609> screwed<00:03:18.880> in<00:03:19.209> I

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
two by fours everything's screwed in I

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.539 
two by fours everything's screwed in I
nailed<00:03:21.040> this<00:03:22.470> electrical<00:03:23.470> wire<00:03:23.680> down<00:03:24.010> so<00:03:24.489> it

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
nailed this electrical wire down so it

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.780 
nailed this electrical wire down so it
won't<00:03:24.760> be<00:03:24.880> touching<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:26.010> pipe<00:03:27.010> it's<00:03:27.370> nice<00:03:27.549> and

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
won't be touching the pipe it's nice and

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.839 
won't be touching the pipe it's nice and
secure<00:03:28.180> so<00:03:29.160> next<00:03:30.160> we're<00:03:30.400> going<00:03:30.489> to<00:03:30.549> put<00:03:30.760> the

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
secure so next we're going to put the

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.170 
secure so next we're going to put the
flashing<00:03:31.359> on<00:03:32.069> we've<00:03:33.069> got<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:33.280> roof<00:03:33.549> pulled<00:03:33.910> up

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
flashing on we've got the roof pulled up

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.800 
flashing on we've got the roof pulled up
so<00:03:34.810> it'll<00:03:34.989> slide<00:03:35.230> right<00:03:35.260> under<00:03:36.269> some<00:03:37.269> roof<00:03:37.480> tar

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
so it'll slide right under some roof tar

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:53.310 
so it'll slide right under some roof tar
and<00:03:39.780> we're<00:03:40.780> going<00:03:40.900> to<00:03:40.959> do<00:03:41.079> it<00:03:41.200> up

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:04:01.470 

let's<00:03:54.320> put<00:03:54.500> a<00:03:54.530> good<00:03:54.740> bead<00:03:54.980> all<00:03:55.370> the<00:03:55.400> way<00:03:55.520> around

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:10.730 

little<00:04:02.480> extra<00:04:02.840> on<00:04:02.990> the<00:04:03.140> top

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:16.650 

it's<00:04:11.740> ready<00:04:12.010> to<00:04:12.130> slide<00:04:12.400> in

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.120 

all<00:04:17.200> right<00:04:17.350> we're<00:04:17.500> ready<00:04:17.590> to<00:04:17.800> slide<00:04:18.010> this

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
all right we're ready to slide this

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:30.900 
all right we're ready to slide this
flashing<00:04:18.459> under<00:04:18.910> here<00:04:26.370> nice<00:04:27.370> and<00:04:27.670> easy<00:04:29.910> all

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
flashing under here nice and easy all

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.230 
flashing under here nice and easy all
right<00:04:31.150> now<00:04:31.330> before<00:04:31.690> we<00:04:31.870> screw<00:04:32.680> this<00:04:32.860> down

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
right now before we screw this down

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.700 
right now before we screw this down
looks<00:04:34.240> like<00:04:34.390> it's<00:04:34.540> got<00:04:34.690> to<00:04:34.780> go<00:04:34.870> a<00:04:34.900> little<00:04:35.110> lower

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
looks like it's got to go a little lower

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:45.830 
looks like it's got to go a little lower
we'll<00:04:36.670> put<00:04:36.850> the<00:04:36.970> pipe<00:04:37.180> on<00:04:37.450> it<00:04:37.660> and<00:04:37.810> level<00:04:38.140> it

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.280 

twist<00:04:46.840> lock

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:59.120 

all<00:04:51.770> right<00:04:52.040> that's<00:04:52.340> in<00:04:52.550> there

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.070 

alright<00:04:59.820> we've<00:04:59.970> got<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.240> chimney<00:05:00.570> cap<00:05:00.750> on

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
alright we've got the chimney cap on

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.000 
alright we've got the chimney cap on
here<00:05:01.970> we<00:05:02.970> ran<00:05:03.150> six<00:05:03.480> feet<00:05:03.720> of<00:05:03.840> pipe<00:05:04.050> that's

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
here we ran six feet of pipe that's

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.860 
here we ran six feet of pipe that's
pretty<00:05:05.280> much<00:05:05.400> the<00:05:05.610> minimum<00:05:06.060> and<00:05:06.300> depends<00:05:06.780> on

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
pretty much the minimum and depends on

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.130 
pretty much the minimum and depends on
the<00:05:07.020> code<00:05:07.260> but<00:05:07.980> this<00:05:08.130> is<00:05:08.280> an<00:05:08.400> important<00:05:08.820> code

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
the code but this is an important code

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.500 
the code but this is an important code
you<00:05:10.140> can<00:05:10.290> see<00:05:10.470> the<00:05:10.650> peak<00:05:10.950> is<00:05:11.820> a<00:05:11.910> little<00:05:12.330> more

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
you can see the peak is a little more

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:18.680 
you can see the peak is a little more
than<00:05:12.720> 11<00:05:13.080> feet<00:05:13.290> away<00:05:13.440> and<00:05:14.150> we<00:05:15.150> are<00:05:15.510> a<00:05:16.970> good<00:05:17.970> two

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
than 11 feet away and we are a good two

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.420 
than 11 feet away and we are a good two
feet<00:05:18.990> higher<00:05:19.290> than<00:05:20.120> the<00:05:21.120> peak<00:05:21.860> the<00:05:22.860> code<00:05:23.100> is

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
feet higher than the peak the code is

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.170 
feet higher than the peak the code is
actually<00:05:23.610> 10<00:05:24.150> feet<00:05:24.800> or<00:05:25.800> excuse<00:05:26.490> me<00:05:26.550> 2<00:05:26.940> feet

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
actually 10 feet or excuse me 2 feet

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.630 
actually 10 feet or excuse me 2 feet
higher<00:05:27.510> than<00:05:27.540> anything<00:05:28.140> 10<00:05:28.620> feet<00:05:28.860> away<00:05:30.290> so

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
higher than anything 10 feet away so

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.980 
higher than anything 10 feet away so
that's<00:05:32.640> the<00:05:32.850> code<00:05:33.060> but<00:05:33.390> check<00:05:33.630> your<00:05:33.810> local

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
that's the code but check your local

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.750 
that's the code but check your local
building<00:05:34.560> codes<00:05:34.800> and<00:05:35.220> make<00:05:35.340> sure<00:05:35.550> you're

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
building codes and make sure you're

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.350 
building codes and make sure you're
using<00:05:36.480> enough<00:05:36.870> chimney<00:05:37.230> pipe<00:05:38.030> you<00:05:39.030> can<00:05:39.060> see

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
using enough chimney pipe you can see

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.840 
using enough chimney pipe you can see
this<00:05:39.630> top<00:05:40.620> of<00:05:40.800> the<00:05:40.860> flashing<00:05:41.310> here<00:05:41.460> at<00:05:41.580> the<00:05:41.670> top

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
this top of the flashing here at the top

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.720 
this top of the flashing here at the top
of<00:05:41.970> the<00:05:42.030> cone<00:05:42.240> is<00:05:42.540> ventilated<00:05:43.230> we've<00:05:44.190> got<00:05:44.430> a

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
of the cone is ventilated we've got a

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.270 
of the cone is ventilated we've got a
storm<00:05:45.270> collar<00:05:45.570> and<00:05:45.900> we're<00:05:46.710> going<00:05:46.830> to<00:05:46.860> put<00:05:47.070> that

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
storm collar and we're going to put that
