00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.529 
into the groundwater which will get to
the<00:02:07.509> ocean<00:02:07.710> shortly<00:02:08.710> so<00:02:09.100> while<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.640> Japanese

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
the ocean shortly so while the Japanese

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.810 
the ocean shortly so while the Japanese
are<00:02:10.780> technically<00:02:11.470> correct<00:02:11.860> it<00:02:12.100> didn't<00:02:12.400> run

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
are technically correct it didn't run

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.820 
are technically correct it didn't run
across<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.390> road

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
across the road

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.400 
across the road
down<00:02:14.190> into<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.640> ocean<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.480> is<00:02:15.690> heading<00:02:16.170> for

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
down into the ocean it is heading for

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.880 
down into the ocean it is heading for
the<00:02:16.500> ocean<00:02:16.680> anyway<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.970> site<00:02:18.300> is<00:02:18.710> going<00:02:19.710> to

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
the ocean anyway the site is going to

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.490 
the ocean anyway the site is going to
bleed<00:02:20.250> into<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.820> ocean<00:02:21.270> for<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.840> hundred<00:02:22.170> years

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
bleed into the ocean for a hundred years

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.600 
bleed into the ocean for a hundred years
so<00:02:23.070> this<00:02:23.790> problem<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:24.830> not<00:02:25.830> going<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.400> be

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
so this problem is not going to be

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.360 
so this problem is not going to be
stopped<00:02:26.940> just<00:02:27.510> by<00:02:27.690> fixing<00:02:28.200> this<00:02:28.410> tank<00:02:28.800> they

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
stopped just by fixing this tank they

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.850 
stopped just by fixing this tank they
have<00:02:29.550> contaminated<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.840> entire<00:02:30.960> ground

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860

all<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:35.670> water<00:02:35.970> will<00:02:36.270> move<00:02:36.450> into<00:02:36.750> the

all of that water will move into the

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.230 
all of that water will move into the
