00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
there's a bit of a line just on the lash

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.120 
there's a bit of a line just on the lash
line<00:05:12.210> I<00:05:12.449> don't<00:05:12.990> wear<00:05:13.169> eyeliner<00:05:13.560> every<00:05:13.919> day<00:05:14.070> so

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
line I don't wear eyeliner every day so

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.270 
line I don't wear eyeliner every day so
I've<00:05:14.850> been<00:05:15.120> doing<00:05:15.180> this<00:05:15.720> and<00:05:16.039> I've<00:05:17.039> been

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
I've been doing this and I've been

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.070 
I've been doing this and I've been
really<00:05:17.610> loving<00:05:17.850> it<00:05:18.060> so<00:05:18.150> something<00:05:18.900> that<00:05:19.050> I

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
really loving it so something that I

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.450 
really loving it so something that I
think<00:05:19.200> I'll<00:05:19.440> continue<00:05:19.770> to<00:05:19.919> do<00:05:20.160> for<00:05:20.340> a<00:05:20.370> long

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
think I'll continue to do for a long

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.270 
think I'll continue to do for a long
time<00:05:20.700> my<00:05:21.030> last<00:05:21.240> beauty-related<00:05:22.039> favorite<00:05:23.039> is

time my last beauty-related favorite is

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.900 
time my last beauty-related favorite is
this<00:05:23.760> l'oreal<00:05:24.570> voluminous<00:05:25.020> mascara<00:05:25.770> this<00:05:26.760> is

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
this l'oreal voluminous mascara this is

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.550 
this l'oreal voluminous mascara this is
the<00:05:27.030> waterproof<00:05:27.539> one<00:05:27.570> but<00:05:28.020> i'm<00:05:28.139> not<00:05:28.320> too<00:05:28.530> sure

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
the waterproof one but i'm not too sure

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.560 
the waterproof one but i'm not too sure
how<00:05:28.860> waterproof<00:05:29.220> it<00:05:29.520> really<00:05:29.789> is<00:05:29.940> because<00:05:30.180> I

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
how waterproof it really is because I

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.480 
how waterproof it really is because I
did<00:05:31.050> put<00:05:31.080> it<00:05:31.380> back<00:05:31.560> in<00:05:31.710> my<00:05:31.800> cupboard<00:05:32.070> after

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490

using<00:05:32.639> it<00:05:32.789> a<00:05:32.880> couple<00:05:33.030> of<00:05:33.150> times<00:05:33.419> because<00:05:33.780> I

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
using it a couple of times because I

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.650 
using it a couple of times because I
went<00:05:34.590> out<00:05:34.710> in<00:05:34.860> the<00:05:34.889> rain<00:05:35.130> and<00:05:35.490> it<00:05:35.970> just<00:05:36.330> like
