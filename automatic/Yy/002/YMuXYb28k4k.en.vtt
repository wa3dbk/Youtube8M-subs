00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
game from respect no game and it came

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.800 
game from respect no game and it came
out<00:02:22.790> pretty<00:02:23.209> well

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
out pretty well

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.080 
out pretty well
they<00:02:24.170> made<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.800> adult<00:02:25.040> of<00:02:25.130> this<00:02:25.250> crapola

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
they made the the adult of this crapola

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.180 
they made the the adult of this crapola
system<00:02:26.510> here<00:02:26.660> comes<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:26.959> pain<00:02:27.170> they<00:02:27.709> modified

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
system here comes the pain they modified

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.370 
system here comes the pain they modified
that<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:28.580> tweaked<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:28.850> engine<00:02:29.239> so<00:02:29.660> they<00:02:30.049> so

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
that and tweaked the engine so they so

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.930 
that and tweaked the engine so they so
like<00:02:30.530> that<00:02:30.650> in<00:02:30.799> the<00:02:30.890> engine<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.580> ruslan

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
like that in the engine and the ruslan

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.100 
like that in the engine and the ruslan
actually<00:02:32.209> seems<00:02:32.390> like<00:02:32.510> it<00:02:32.630> was<00:02:32.720> kind<00:02:33.019> of

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
actually seems like it was kind of

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.259 
actually seems like it was kind of
intuitive<00:02:33.830> it<00:02:34.070> made<00:02:34.700> for<00:02:34.910> a<00:02:34.940> really<00:02:35.150> really

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
intuitive it made for a really really

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.360 
intuitive it made for a really really
good<00:02:35.600> gameplay<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.560> only<00:02:36.830> downside

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
good gameplay and the only downside

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.710 
good gameplay and the only downside
about<00:02:37.400> this<00:02:37.760> is<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.000> cell<00:02:38.209> line<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.510> cell

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
about this is the cell line the cell

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.150 
about this is the cell line the cell
line<00:02:38.840> on<00:02:38.959> this<00:02:39.080> game<00:02:39.230> was<00:02:39.380> not<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.830> strongest

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
line on this game was not the strongest

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.160 
line on this game was not the strongest
