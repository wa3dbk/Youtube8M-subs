00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.620 
and I think we're familiar with most
on<00:01:07.070> a<00:01:07.130> lot<00:01:07.400> of<00:01:07.520> you

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
on a lot of you

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.220 
on a lot of you

oh<00:01:16.229> yeah<00:01:17.229> we<00:01:17.500> don't<00:01:17.920> think<00:01:18.250> that's<00:01:18.399> what<00:01:18.579> the

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
oh yeah we don't think that's what the

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:20.639 
oh yeah we don't think that's what the
coolest<00:01:19.299> part<00:01:19.479> about<00:01:19.539> being<00:01:19.840> on<00:01:20.049> work<00:01:20.259> for<00:01:20.500> now

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
coolest part about being on work for now

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.499 
coolest part about being on work for now
is<00:01:20.859> the<00:01:21.039> fact<00:01:21.340> that<00:01:21.490> we<00:01:21.700> used<00:01:21.909> to<00:01:22.060> go<00:01:22.210> to<00:01:22.270> work

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
is the fact that we used to go to work

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.859 
is the fact that we used to go to work

for almost every year you to check out
the<00:01:26.020> bands<00:01:26.170> that<00:01:26.350> look<00:01:26.500> like

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.480 

so<00:01:31.759> far
