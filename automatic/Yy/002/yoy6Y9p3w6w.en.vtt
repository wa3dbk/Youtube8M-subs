that<00:03:41.090> is<00:03:42.090> yeah<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:43.470> tastes<00:03:44.040> really<00:03:44.190> good<00:03:47.870> but

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020

recommendations<00:03:52.380> on<00:03:53.220> this<00:03:53.989> but<00:03:54.989> I<00:03:55.260> think<00:03:55.709> it

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
recommendations on this but I think it

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:03.009 
recommendations on this but I think it
would<00:03:55.980> go<00:03:57.230> good<00:03:58.230> with<00:03:58.290> some<00:04:00.080> burger<00:04:01.080> or

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
would go good with some burger or

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:10.550 
would go good with some burger or
someone<00:04:04.019> hot<00:04:04.350> dog<00:04:07.580> cuz<00:04:08.580> it<00:04:08.910> tastes<00:04:09.450> like<00:04:09.750> kind

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
someone hot dog cuz it tastes like kind

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.490 
someone hot dog cuz it tastes like kind
of<00:04:10.709> sweet<00:04:11.069> so<00:04:11.580> it<00:04:11.640> would<00:04:11.760> be<00:04:11.970> a<00:04:12.209> good<00:04:12.959> catch<00:04:13.290> up

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
of sweet so it would be a good catch up

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.670 
of sweet so it would be a good catch up
replacement<00:04:16.669> or<00:04:17.669> maybe<00:04:17.970> I<00:04:18.450> think<00:04:19.440> it<00:04:19.560> would

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
replacement or maybe I think it would

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.100 
replacement or maybe I think it would
even<00:04:20.010> go<00:04:20.220> good<00:04:20.549> with<00:04:20.910> some<00:04:23.030> wow<00:04:24.030> now<00:04:24.900> it's

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
even go good with some wow now it's

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.570 
even go good with some wow now it's
going<00:04:25.350> for<00:04:25.590> the<00:04:25.680> tongue<00:04:27.590> yeah<00:04:28.590> but<00:04:29.160> anyway

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
going for the tongue yeah but anyway

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.540 
going for the tongue yeah but anyway
yeah<00:04:32.900> and<00:04:33.900> I<00:04:34.139> think<00:04:34.200> it<00:04:34.680> would<00:04:34.830> do<00:04:35.220> good<00:04:35.400> with

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550

yeah and I think it would do good with
tacos<00:04:36.090> also<00:04:38.810> yeah<00:04:39.810> and<00:04:40.400> I<00:04:41.400> like<00:04:41.610> the<00:04:42.289> graphics
