brings us to our paper path

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.880 
brings us to our paper path
this<00:01:37.220> is<00:01:37.370> where<00:01:37.520> we'll<00:01:37.640> clear<00:01:37.850> any<00:01:38.030> jams<00:01:38.890> this

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
this is where we'll clear any jams this

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.609 
this is where we'll clear any jams this
is<00:01:40.010> also<00:01:40.160> how<00:01:40.400> we<00:01:40.460> access<00:01:40.910> our<00:01:41.619> last

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
is also how we access our last

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.210 
is also how we access our last
consumable<00:01:43.160> to<00:01:43.340> show<00:01:43.520> is<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:43.820> fuser<00:01:45.100> so<00:01:46.100> it

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
consumable to show is the fuser so it

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.250 
consumable to show is the fuser so it
slides<00:01:46.400> in<00:01:46.640> and<00:01:46.700> out<00:01:46.790> like<00:01:46.850> so<00:01:49.630> close<00:01:50.630> it<00:01:50.810> back

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
slides in and out like so close it back

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.820 
slides in and out like so close it back
we<00:01:52.160> do<00:01:52.310> have<00:01:52.550> a<00:01:53.229> bypass<00:01:54.229> tray<00:01:54.590> that<00:01:54.770> is

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.850 
need to do is adjust and position our
back<00:02:13.820> guide<00:02:14.030> into<00:02:14.300> place<00:02:14.540> we<00:02:15.350> have<00:02:15.470> a<00:02:15.500> centered

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
back guide into place we have a centered

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.150 
back guide into place we have a centered
offset<00:02:16.190> ruler<00:02:16.520> so<00:02:17.360> I'm<00:02:17.450> simply<00:02:17.810> going<00:02:17.989> to<00:02:18.260> put

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
offset ruler so I'm simply going to put

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.890 
offset ruler so I'm simply going to put
this<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.670> width<00:02:19.880> of<00:02:20.030> my<00:02:20.180> media<00:02:20.480> in<00:02:20.630> this

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
this to the width of my media in this

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.090 
this to the width of my media in this
case<00:02:21.080> we're<00:02:21.320> running<00:02:21.530> a<00:02:21.590> number<00:02:21.800> 10<00:02:21.950> envelope

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
case we're running a number 10 envelope

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.650 
case we're running a number 10 envelope
so<00:02:22.550> I'm<00:02:22.700> gonna<00:02:22.940> put<00:02:23.120> it<00:02:23.209> at<00:02:23.300> nine<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.600> a<00:02:23.630> half

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
so I'm gonna put it at nine and a half

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.280 
so I'm gonna put it at nine and a half
and<00:02:24.110> I'm<00:02:25.010> simply<00:02:25.340> gonna<00:02:25.550> tighten<00:02:25.940> this<00:02:26.290> this

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
and I'm simply gonna tighten this this

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.420 
and I'm simply gonna tighten this this
guide<00:02:27.560> down<00:02:28.690> so<00:02:29.690> that<00:02:29.780> it's<00:02:29.930> in<00:02:30.080> place<00:02:30.430> next

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
guide down so that it's in place next

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:40.320

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
closest to me on the operator side I'm

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.990 
closest to me on the operator side I'm
gonna<00:02:47.380> leave<00:02:47.620> it<00:02:47.740> pretty<00:02:48.040> loose<00:02:48.370> for<00:02:48.580> now<00:02:48.610> and

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
if you'll notice my my flap is up and

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.730 
if you'll notice my my flap is up and
actually<00:02:52.450> facing<00:02:52.990> the<00:02:53.110> machine<00:02:53.410> right<00:02:53.590> now

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
actually facing the machine right now

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.860 
actually facing the machine right now
that's<00:02:53.980> how<00:02:54.160> we<00:02:54.190> want<00:02:54.490> to<00:02:54.550> load<00:02:54.730> in<00:02:55.150> order<00:02:55.360> to

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
that's how we want to load in order to

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.950 
that's how we want to load in order to
print<00:02:56.080> on<00:02:56.350> the<00:02:56.470> front<00:02:56.740> side<00:02:57.010> of<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.340> envelope

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
print on the front side of the envelope

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.500 
print on the front side of the envelope
so<00:02:58.960> once<00:02:59.410> I<00:02:59.530> get<00:02:59.590> them<00:02:59.800> in<00:02:59.860> place<00:03:00.330> beside<00:03:01.330> the

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
so once I get them in place beside the

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.120 
so once I get them in place beside the
on/off<00:03:01.840> switch<00:03:01.870> here<00:03:02.350> I'm<00:03:02.530> just<00:03:02.860> going<00:03:03.010> to

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
on/off switch here I'm just going to

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.230 
on/off switch here I'm just going to
hold<00:03:03.280> down<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.610> immediate<00:03:04.210> advance<00:03:04.450> button

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
hold down the immediate advance button

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.420 
hold down the immediate advance button
and<00:03:07.240> the<00:03:07.360> envelopes<00:03:07.810> are<00:03:07.990> going<00:03:08.170> to<00:03:08.430> cascade

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
and the envelopes are going to cascade

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.400 
and the envelopes are going to cascade
and<00:03:09.730> you're<00:03:10.390> gonna<00:03:10.480> get<00:03:10.660> this<00:03:10.840> tiling<00:03:11.140> effect

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
and you're gonna get this tiling effect

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.010 
and you're gonna get this tiling effect
that's<00:03:11.830> exactly<00:03:12.370> what<00:03:12.520> we<00:03:12.670> want<00:03:12.910> in<00:03:13.630> order<00:03:13.750> to

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
that's exactly what we want in order to

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.520 
that's exactly what we want in order to
load<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.320> media<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:14.980> then<00:03:15.820> once<00:03:16.030> I<00:03:16.180> have<00:03:16.360> it

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
load the media and then once I have it

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.740 
load the media and then once I have it
distributed<00:03:17.530> like<00:03:17.680> so<00:03:17.950> I'm<00:03:18.130> gonna<00:03:18.220> adjust<00:03:19.060> the

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
distributed like so I'm gonna adjust the

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.100 
distributed like so I'm gonna adjust the
guide<00:03:19.990> closest<00:03:20.560> to<00:03:20.620> me<00:03:21.690> bringing<00:03:22.690> it<00:03:22.780> in<00:03:22.959> and
