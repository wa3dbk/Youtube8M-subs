recognizable<00:00:53.940> subject<00:00:54.449> matter<00:00:54.690> because<00:00:55.500> it

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
recognizable subject matter because it

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.189 
recognizable subject matter because it
gives<00:00:55.890> her<00:00:56.129> an<00:00:56.309> armature<00:00:56.850> for<00:00:57.750> her<00:00:57.899> mark

making<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:59.149> paint<00:01:00.149> different<00:01:00.449> subjects<00:01:01.140> but

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
making I paint different subjects but

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.139 
making I paint different subjects but
I'm<00:01:01.530> particularly<00:01:02.190> attracted<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.760> painting

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
I'm particularly attracted to painting

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.820 
I'm particularly attracted to painting
deserts<00:01:03.570> because<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.470> think<00:01:04.650> they're<00:01:04.799> very

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
deserts because I think they're very

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.789 
deserts because I think they're very
sensual<00:01:05.489> deserts<00:01:06.240> lend<00:01:06.570> themselves<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.260> oil

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
sensual deserts lend themselves to oil

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.310 
sensual deserts lend themselves to oil
paint<00:01:08.159> because<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.729> surface<00:01:09.210> quality<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:10.260> you

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
paint because of surface quality so you

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.980 
paint because of surface quality so you
set<00:01:10.920> up<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.250> desert<00:01:11.670> paint<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.450> all<00:01:12.600> day<00:01:12.810> and

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
set up the desert paint it all day and

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.899 
set up the desert paint it all day and
then<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.290> eat<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.530> no<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.130> usually<00:01:14.400> spray

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
then you eat it no I usually spray

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.179 
then you eat it no I usually spray
varnish<00:01:15.150> on<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.570> before<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.080> start<00:01:16.770> painting<00:01:16.979> it

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
varnish on it before I start painting it

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.249 
varnish on it before I start painting it
so<00:01:17.340> I'm<00:01:17.490> not<00:01:17.700> tempted<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.270> eat<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:19.049> don't

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
so I'm not tempted to eat it you don't

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.410 
so I'm not tempted to eat it you don't

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.059 
wasn't working so well he was on a field
I<00:02:42.269> turned<00:02:42.510> it<00:02:42.630> around<00:02:42.720> into<00:02:43.140> something<00:02:43.590> else

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
I turned it around into something else

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.099 
I turned it around into something else
I'm<00:02:44.400> in<00:02:44.609> mine<00:02:44.790> once<00:02:45.060> there<00:02:45.299> was<00:02:45.450> series<00:02:45.900> so<00:02:46.079> I

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
I'm in mine once there was series so I

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:47.690 
I'm in mine once there was series so I
had<00:02:46.350> once<00:02:46.560> there<00:02:46.769> was<00:02:46.859> a<00:02:46.890> farm<00:02:47.190> horse<00:02:47.400> once

there<00:02:47.880> was<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.030> flamingo

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:53.219 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:56.309 

this<00:02:54.219> is<00:02:54.370> once<00:02:54.549> there<00:02:54.760> was<00:02:54.819> a<00:02:54.879> swimmer<00:02:55.180> but<00:02:56.140> the

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
this is once there was a swimmer but the

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.959 
this is once there was a swimmer but the
night<00:02:56.500> before<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:56.859> delivered<00:02:57.400> it<00:02:57.459> I<00:02:57.579> got<00:02:57.790> rid<00:02:57.939> of

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:57.969 
night before I delivered it I got rid of

00:02:57.969 --> 00:02:59.369 
night before I delivered it I got rid of
the<00:02:58.180> swimmer<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:58.750> it<00:02:58.930> became<00:02:59.170> a<00:02:59.230> different

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
the swimmer and it became a different

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.569 
the swimmer and it became a different
painting<00:02:59.969> so<00:03:00.969> your<00:03:01.420> paintings<00:03:01.930> evolved<00:03:02.739> until

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
painting so your paintings evolved until

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.599 
painting so your paintings evolved until
the<00:03:03.819> day<00:03:04.060> their<00:03:04.329> hanging<00:03:04.689> on<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:05.019> wall<00:03:05.230> lutely

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
the day their hanging on the wall lutely

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.039 
the day their hanging on the wall lutely
absolutely

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
absolutely

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.720 
absolutely
sometimes<00:03:08.049> when<00:03:08.500> I<00:03:08.530> start<00:03:08.950> with<00:03:09.129> an<00:03:09.220> idea<00:03:09.519> of<00:03:09.670> a

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
sometimes when I start with an idea of a

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.210 
sometimes when I start with an idea of a
subject<00:03:10.120> it<00:03:10.209> becomes<00:03:10.510> too<00:03:11.040> articulated<00:03:12.040> and

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
subject it becomes too articulated and

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.460 
subject it becomes too articulated and
then<00:03:12.340> it<00:03:12.430> becomes<00:03:12.730> boring<00:03:13.090> so<00:03:13.599> I<00:03:13.930> have<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.319> use

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
then it becomes boring so I have to use

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.740 
then it becomes boring so I have to use
that<00:03:14.500> as<00:03:14.829> a<00:03:14.859> jumping<00:03:15.370> board<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:15.970> destroy<00:03:16.569> it

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
that as a jumping board and destroy it

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.569 
that as a jumping board and destroy it
start<00:03:17.290> with<00:03:17.680> something<00:03:17.950> completely

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
start with something completely

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.309 
start with something completely

creates disorganisation so he can
recreate<00:03:32.739> organization<00:03:33.489> that's<00:03:33.700> what<00:03:33.849> I<00:03:33.909> try

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
recreate organization that's what I try

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.449 

I<00:03:50.580> asked<00:03:51.580> her<00:03:51.700> about<00:03:52.420> one<00:03:52.720> particularly

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
I asked her about one particularly

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.100 
I asked her about one particularly
gripping<00:03:54.459> image<00:03:54.970> there<00:03:55.599> were<00:03:55.690> about<00:03:55.870> eight

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
gripping image there were about eight

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.390 
gripping image there were about eight
crows<00:03:56.409> on<00:03:56.650> a<00:03:56.680> fence

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
crows on a fence

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.800 
crows on a fence
it<00:03:57.670> felt<00:03:58.530> static<00:03:59.530> and<00:04:00.120> uninteresting<00:04:01.120> so<00:04:01.450> I

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
it felt static and uninteresting so I

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.240 
it felt static and uninteresting so I
tried<00:04:02.080> to<00:04:02.110> search<00:04:02.560> for<00:04:02.769> a<00:04:02.830> different
