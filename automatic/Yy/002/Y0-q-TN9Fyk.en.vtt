00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400

it typically we wouldn't recommend that
on<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.119> 14<00:01:12.510> kW<00:01:13.080> we<00:01:13.260> would<00:01:13.439> usually<00:01:13.619> step<00:01:14.070> up<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.340> a

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
on a 14 kW we would usually step up to a

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.080 
on a 14 kW we would usually step up to a
17<00:01:14.880> kW<00:01:15.420> or<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.630> 20<00:01:15.990> kW<00:01:16.220> which<00:01:17.220> then<00:01:17.820> we<00:01:17.939> would

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
17 kW or a 20 kW which then we would

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.330 
17 kW or a 20 kW which then we would
also<00:01:18.270> probably<00:01:18.840> recommend<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.530> 200<00:01:20.250> amp

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
also probably recommend a 200 amp

also probably recommend a 200 amp
transfer<00:01:20.850> switch<00:01:21.090> which<00:01:21.330> would<00:01:21.600> power<00:01:21.900> the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
transfer switch which would power the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.109 
transfer switch which would power the
whole<00:01:22.290> panel<00:01:22.710> then<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.610> wouldn't<00:01:23.850> have<00:01:23.970> to

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
whole panel then you wouldn't have to

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.149 
whole panel then you wouldn't have to
decide<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.659> which<00:01:24.900> lights<00:01:25.229> which<00:01:25.619> rooms<00:01:25.890> and

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
decide on which lights which rooms and

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.920 
decide on which lights which rooms and
things<00:01:26.400> like<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.970> would<00:01:27.090> want<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.720> have

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
things like that you would want to have

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.130 
things like that you would want to have
on<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.140> generator<00:01:29.600> so<00:01:30.600> basically<00:01:30.930> what

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
on the generator so basically what

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.770 
on the generator so basically what
happens<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:32.070> lose<00:01:32.100> your<00:01:33.090> utility<00:01:33.570> power

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
happens is you lose your utility power

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.800 
happens is you lose your utility power
the<00:01:34.590> generator<00:01:35.070> will<00:01:35.250> then<00:01:35.430> kick<00:01:35.729> on<00:01:35.909> within

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
the generator will then kick on within

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.320 
the generator will then kick on within
30<00:01:37.170> seconds

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
30 seconds

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.560 
30 seconds
then<00:01:39.290> it<00:01:39.590> will<00:01:39.770> in<00:01:40.250> about<00:01:40.340> a<00:01:40.460> minute<00:01:40.730> there's<00:01:41.450> a

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
then it will in about a minute there's a

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.690 
then it will in about a minute there's a
