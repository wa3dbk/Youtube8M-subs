00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.710 

right<00:02:23.100> so<00:02:23.280> we<00:02:23.400> shot<00:02:23.550> some<00:02:23.820> groups<00:02:24.120> with<00:02:24.450> the

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
right so we shot some groups with the

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.040 
right so we shot some groups with the
psycho<00:02:25.290> 85<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.490> psycho<00:02:26.880> ammunition<00:02:27.720> it's

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
psycho 85 and the psycho ammunition it's

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.040 
psycho 85 and the psycho ammunition it's
a<00:02:28.350> 55<00:02:28.950> grain<00:02:29.580> game<00:02:30.000> head<00:02:30.270> ammunition<00:02:30.870> for<00:02:30.959> the

a 55 grain game head ammunition for the
two<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.380> three<00:02:31.739> now<00:02:32.459> I<00:02:32.910> think<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.570> shot<00:02:33.750> some

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930

two to three now I think it shot some
phenomenal<00:02:34.500> groups<00:02:34.770> we've<00:02:34.980> not<00:02:35.250> tested<00:02:35.700> any

other ammo and the psycho ammo and a

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.280 
other ammo and the psycho ammo and a
psycho<00:02:38.640> gun<00:02:38.880> seems<00:02:39.209> to<00:02:39.390> a<00:02:39.420> shot<00:02:39.690> really<00:02:40.110> well

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290
