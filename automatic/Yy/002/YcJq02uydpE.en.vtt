00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
unprepared for that sort of intensity I

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.840 
unprepared for that sort of intensity I
would<00:00:53.460> like<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:54.170> 100%<00:00:55.170> apologize<00:00:56.039> for<00:00:56.640> my<00:00:56.730> own

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
because I think that poetry is something

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.090 
because I think that poetry is something
that's<00:01:03.120> really<00:01:03.359> really<00:01:03.510> really<00:01:04.350> important<00:01:04.860> I

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
that's really really really important I

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.060 
that's really really really important I
love<00:01:05.369> poetry<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.450> think<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.650> something<00:01:07.920> that

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
love poetry I think it is something that

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.969 
love poetry I think it is something that
we<00:01:08.280> can't<00:01:08.520> lose<00:01:08.820> as<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> human<00:01:09.960> brace<00:01:10.200> but<00:01:10.680> then

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
we can't lose as a human brace but then

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.130 
we can't lose as a human brace but then
again<00:01:11.250> maybe<00:01:11.760> cave<00:01:12.090> painters<00:01:12.510> felt<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:12.990> way

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
again maybe cave painters felt that way

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.230 
again maybe cave painters felt that way
when<00:01:13.530> cave<00:01:13.799> paintings<00:01:14.369> or<00:01:14.640> petroglyphs

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
when cave paintings or petroglyphs

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.600 
when cave paintings or petroglyphs
started<00:01:16.140> going<00:01:16.380> out<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.619> style<00:01:16.830> maybe<00:01:17.400> they

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
started going out of style maybe they

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.640 
started going out of style maybe they
were<00:01:17.700> like<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.210> written<00:01:18.509> word<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.320> gonna
