 really there that I'm talking about products

 for the buttons that these things there and 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:38.760
 that I think with this competition the 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.799
 to make it a happy one to 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.910
 through all these people there can no 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.930
 but I wanted to talk to you anyway 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.260
 of a product that I use 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:49.379
 personally in normaderm in the 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.090
 Gingham range excellent spot gain 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.010
 like that so in fact it's a 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.660
 treatment that puts local on 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.040
 buttons because even though I do not have a 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.049
 time loop but it happens to me when 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.690
 even sometimes to have a time to have 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.370
 a big pic is really talent that makes 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.530
 wrong and that it is a wonderful product 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.629
 for relies in two days seriously 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.720
 montbeton and almost gone it's like 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:12.000
 a little jet hell all with a mouthpiece 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.560
 like that we put it on and that 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.180
 it's really a miracle product it's 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.070
 like the day we have our picture 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.840
 of school but curious the most 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.940
 big we've ever had who gets us out 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.560
 hesitated anyway if the essential to 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.290
 see then 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.490
 is that this product uses the range and 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.160
 I really expect this range the 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.750
 serious man if you are started to see 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.980
 how poor is how to know 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.630
 amsa with your post i advise 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.380
 to really go to the pharmacy 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.880
 cosmetic 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.320
 what are they doing with the range 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.580
 north-ma'am in vichy is that it is 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.740
 really not expensive 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.150
 when it comes on sale sometimes the 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.560
 it really comes next it comes 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.710
 almost the same price as the products 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.440
 a little low-end fit that in 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.340
 the bottom does not really affect me 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.840
 I see a lot of people using 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.520
 this noble product that I work in 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.130

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.720

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.320
 happy to do for them the 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.030
