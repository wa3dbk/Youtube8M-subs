00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
directions or five so in any given

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.650 
directions or five so in any given
direction<00:02:55.769> you're<00:02:56.280> firing<00:02:56.579> at<00:02:56.910> on<00:02:57.150> your<00:02:57.209> left

or<00:02:57.780> your<00:02:57.840> right<00:02:57.959> side<00:02:58.319> you're<00:02:58.920> gonna<00:02:59.099> be

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
or your right side you're gonna be

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.949 
or your right side you're gonna be
firing<00:02:59.519> about<00:02:59.819> eleven<00:03:00.180> dice<00:03:00.450> which<00:03:00.780> is

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
firing about eleven dice which is

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.229 
firing about eleven dice which is
probably<00:03:01.260> gonna<00:03:01.440> be<00:03:01.680> reduced<00:03:02.400> down<00:03:02.579> to<00:03:02.849> mount

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
probably gonna be reduced down to mount

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.210 
probably gonna be reduced down to mount
maybe<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.810> can't<00:03:04.470> really<00:03:04.560> say<00:03:04.829> because<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.069> don't

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
maybe I can't really say because I don't

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.559 
maybe I can't really say because I don't
have<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.430> weapon<00:03:05.700> chart<00:03:05.940> in<00:03:06.060> front<00:03:06.209> me<00:03:06.390> but

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
have the weapon chart in front me but

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.330 
have the weapon chart in front me but
it's<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.780> nice<00:03:07.019> decent<00:03:07.500> size<00:03:07.650> dice<00:03:07.980> roll<00:03:08.250> you

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
it's a nice decent size dice roll you

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.860 
it's a nice decent size dice roll you
have<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.489> good<00:03:08.700> chance<00:03:08.910> of<00:03:09.120> really<00:03:09.540> doing

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
have a good chance of really doing

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.400 
have a good chance of really doing
damage<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.470> a<00:03:10.500> ship<00:03:11.359> it's<00:03:12.359> also<00:03:12.599> got<00:03:12.900> fighter

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
damage to a ship it's also got fighter

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.280 
damage to a ship it's also got fighter
bays<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:14.160> four<00:03:14.849> squadrons<00:03:15.180> each<00:03:15.629> so<00:03:15.930> you<00:03:15.959> get

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
bays that four squadrons each so you get

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.440 
bays that four squadrons each so you get
about<00:03:16.590> you<00:03:17.099> can<00:03:17.280> produce<00:03:17.579> an<00:03:17.940> eight-man<00:03:18.420> squad

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
about you can produce an eight-man squad

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.720 
about you can produce an eight-man squad
if<00:03:18.989> you<00:03:19.109> want<00:03:19.349> of<00:03:19.590> either<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:20.220> fighters<00:03:20.579> or

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
if you want of either the fighters or

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.520 
if you want of either the fighters or
bombers<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.450> for<00:03:21.690> an<00:03:21.750> additional<00:03:22.230> five

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
bombers and for an additional five

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.030 
bombers and for an additional five
points<00:03:23.160> it<00:03:23.519> can<00:03:23.790> carry<00:03:24.230> assault<00:03:25.230> boats<00:03:25.500> which

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
points it can carry assault boats which

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.129 
points it can carry assault boats which
is<00:03:26.220> fairly<00:03:26.430> decent<00:03:26.730> so<00:03:27.510> you've<00:03:27.720> got<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:27.900> lot<00:03:28.079> of

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
is fairly decent so you've got a lot of

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:29.960 
is fairly decent so you've got a lot of

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
options to go around with this this is a

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.930 
options to go around with this this is a
fairly<00:03:30.329> solid<00:03:30.989> battleship<00:03:31.650> but<00:03:31.889> in<00:03:32.400> terms<00:03:32.730> of

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
fairly solid battleship but in terms of

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.000 
fairly solid battleship but in terms of
gaming<00:03:33.329> I<00:03:33.630> would<00:03:33.780> probably<00:03:34.169> only<00:03:34.260> use<00:03:34.410> this<00:03:34.769> as

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
gaming I would probably only use this as

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.309 
gaming I would probably only use this as
a<00:03:35.190> like<00:03:35.430> backwards<00:03:36.090> defense<00:03:36.810> ship<00:03:37.079> something

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
a like backwards defense ship something

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.879 
a like backwards defense ship something
I'd<00:03:37.470> keep<00:03:37.709> it<00:03:37.859> in<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.099> backline<00:03:38.609> and<00:03:39.859> fire<00:03:40.859> a

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
I'd keep it in the backline and fire a

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:42.770 
I'd keep it in the backline and fire a
bunch<00:03:41.069> of<00:03:41.280> Fighters<00:03:41.549> at<00:03:41.849> and<00:03:42.030> keep<00:03:42.269> with<00:03:42.540> a

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
bunch of Fighters at and keep with a

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.050 
bunch of Fighters at and keep with a
couple<00:03:43.079> of<00:03:43.109> escort<00:03:43.560> cruisers<00:03:44.130> around<00:03:44.639> it<00:03:44.880> and

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
couple of escort cruisers around it and

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.270 
couple of escort cruisers around it and
only<00:03:45.630> really<00:03:45.930> get<00:03:46.169> into<00:03:46.319> combat<00:03:46.530> with<00:03:46.739> it<00:03:47.130> if

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
only really get into combat with it if

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.030 
only really get into combat with it if
it<00:03:47.400> really<00:03:47.609> has<00:03:47.880> to<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:48.329> to<00:03:49.319> know<00:03:49.500> with<00:03:49.739> almost

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
it really has to and to know with almost

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.900 
it really has to and to know with almost
all<00:03:50.280> imperial<00:03:50.790> battleships<00:03:51.359> you<00:03:51.840> can<00:03:52.049> only<00:03:52.260> do

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
all imperial battleships you can only do

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.339 
all imperial battleships you can only do
you<00:03:53.910> can't<00:03:54.150> do<00:03:54.359> come<00:03:54.690> to<00:03:54.840> a<00:03:54.870> new<00:03:55.079> heading

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
you can't do come to a new heading

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.289 
you can't do come to a new heading
because<00:03:55.739> they're<00:03:55.950> so<00:03:56.220> slow<00:03:56.549> they<00:03:56.790> just<00:03:57.060> can't

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
because they're so slow they just can't

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.300 
because they're so slow they just can't
make<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.630> turns<00:03:57.870> fast<00:03:58.230> enough<00:03:58.560> to<00:03:58.829> they<00:03:59.130> just

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
make the turns fast enough to they just

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.849 
make the turns fast enough to they just
can't<00:03:59.549> move<00:03:59.700> fast<00:03:59.910> enough<00:04:00.090> to<00:04:00.329> turn<00:04:00.540> them<00:04:00.859> so

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
can't move fast enough to turn them so

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.220 
can't move fast enough to turn them so
that's<00:04:02.069> one<00:04:02.310> fairly<00:04:02.700> big<00:04:03.090> big<00:04:03.540> of<00:04:03.660> a<00:04:03.720> downside

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
that's one fairly big big of a downside

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.289 
that's one fairly big big of a downside
but<00:04:04.260> it's<00:04:04.859> not<00:04:05.040> too<00:04:05.340> much<00:04:05.549> that<00:04:05.790> you<00:04:06.000> really

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
but it's not too much that you really

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:07.970 
but it's not too much that you really
shouldn't<00:04:06.510> encounter<00:04:07.319> for<00:04:07.500> that<00:04:07.620> with<00:04:07.829> the

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
shouldn't encounter for that with the

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.500 
shouldn't encounter for that with the
Imperial<00:04:08.340> Guard<00:04:08.549> unless<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:08.910> really<00:04:09.120> want<00:04:09.450> a

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
Imperial Guard unless you really want a

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.140 
Imperial Guard unless you really want a
fast<00:04:09.750> army<00:04:10.139> to<00:04:10.260> play<00:04:10.579> now<00:04:11.579> their<00:04:11.790> next

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
fast army to play now their next

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.819 
fast army to play now their next
battleship<00:04:12.720> on<00:04:12.840> the<00:04:12.959> list<00:04:13.169> is<00:04:13.349> personally<00:04:13.799> one

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
battleship on the list is personally one

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.500 
battleship on the list is personally one
of<00:04:13.980> my<00:04:14.069> favorites<00:04:14.639> which<00:04:14.790> is<00:04:14.849> the<00:04:15.060> Imperial

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
of my favorites which is the Imperial

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.259 
of my favorites which is the Imperial
retribution<00:04:15.870> class<00:04:16.500> battleship<00:04:17.250> I<00:04:17.489> like<00:04:18.090> this

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
retribution class battleship I like this

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.360 
retribution class battleship I like this
one<00:04:18.539> because<00:04:18.780> it's<00:04:19.289> got<00:04:19.470> a<00:04:19.500> speed<00:04:19.799> of<00:04:19.919> 20<00:04:20.250> it's

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
one because it's got a speed of 20 it's

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.979 
one because it's got a speed of 20 it's
one<00:04:20.519> of<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:20.669> more<00:04:20.849> faster<00:04:21.299> battleships<00:04:21.840> in

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
one of the more faster battleships in

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.350 
one of the more faster battleships in
the<00:04:22.109> Imperial<00:04:22.440> Guard<00:04:22.650> army<00:04:22.979> it's<00:04:23.729> got<00:04:24.120> only

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
the Imperial Guard army it's got only

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.690 
the Imperial Guard army it's got only
four<00:04:24.750> turrets<00:04:25.110> which<00:04:25.440> is<00:04:25.620> four<00:04:26.160> still<00:04:26.400> pretty

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
four turrets which is four still pretty

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.940 
four turrets which is four still pretty
good<00:04:26.909> for<00:04:27.210> a<00:04:27.240> battleship<00:04:27.810> but<00:04:28.380> it<00:04:28.530> makes<00:04:28.740> it<00:04:28.860> up

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
good for a battleship but it makes it up

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.810 
good for a battleship but it makes it up
for<00:04:29.159> having<00:04:29.280> a<00:04:29.460> front<00:04:29.789> armor<00:04:30.180> six<00:04:30.479> and

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
for having a front armor six and

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.670 
for having a front armor six and
and<00:04:30.910> a<00:04:31.210> side<00:04:31.450> armer<00:04:31.720> five<00:04:31.960> so<00:04:32.290> anything

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
and a side armer five so anything

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.170 
and a side armer five so anything
attacking<00:04:33.070> it<00:04:33.190> in<00:04:33.340> its<00:04:33.490> front<00:04:33.730> arc<00:04:33.940> has<00:04:34.150> to

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
attacking it in its front arc has to

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.110 
attacking it in its front arc has to
roll<00:04:34.600> a<00:04:34.630> six<00:04:35.020> where<00:04:35.350> it<00:04:35.950> only<00:04:36.160> where<00:04:36.670> five<00:04:37.090> is

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
roll a six where it only where five is

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.360 
roll a six where it only where five is
needed<00:04:37.570> to<00:04:37.720> get<00:04:37.930> on<00:04:38.170> its<00:04:38.380> side<00:04:38.590> or<00:04:38.620> behind<00:04:39.130> it

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
needed to get on its side or behind it

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.550 
needed to get on its side or behind it
which<00:04:39.550> by<00:04:39.730> that<00:04:39.760> point<00:04:40.150> since<00:04:40.840> its<00:04:41.050> imperial

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
which by that point since its imperial

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.960 
which by that point since its imperial
guard<00:04:41.800> you're<00:04:42.070> most<00:04:42.280> likely<00:04:42.520> gonna<00:04:42.790> be

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
guard you're most likely gonna be

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.730 
guard you're most likely gonna be
destroyed<00:04:43.360> the<00:04:43.630> ships<00:04:43.840> gonna<00:04:44.020> most<00:04:44.260> likely<00:04:44.380> be

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
destroyed the ships gonna most likely be

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.050 
destroyed the ships gonna most likely be
destroyed<00:04:45.070> before<00:04:45.250> it<00:04:45.460> gets<00:04:45.640> a<00:04:45.730> chance<00:04:45.880> to

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
destroyed before it gets a chance to

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.780 
destroyed before it gets a chance to
crack<00:04:46.420> at<00:04:46.630> the<00:04:46.720> battleship<00:04:47.170> itself<00:04:47.590> I<00:04:47.890> also

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
crack at the battleship itself I also

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.820 
crack at the battleship itself I also
like<00:04:49.150> this<00:04:49.360> ship<00:04:49.570> because<00:04:49.750> it's<00:04:50.050> got<00:04:50.230> lances

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
like this ship because it's got lances

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.110 
like this ship because it's got lances
whereas<00:04:51.190> the<00:04:51.310> Emperor<00:04:51.640> class<00:04:51.850> does<00:04:52.090> not

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
whereas the Emperor class does not

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.680 
whereas the Emperor class does not
lances<00:04:52.990> are<00:04:53.110> really<00:04:53.350> nice<00:04:53.560> since<00:04:53.860> they<00:04:54.690> always

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
lances are really nice since they always

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.260 
lances are really nice since they always
hit<00:04:55.900> on<00:04:55.930> a<00:04:56.020> four<00:04:56.350> plus<00:04:56.650> no<00:04:57.250> regardless<00:04:58.030> and

hit on a four plus no regardless and

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.350 
hit on a four plus no regardless and
they<00:04:58.690> don't<00:04:58.870> have<00:04:59.020> any<00:04:59.200> and<00:04:59.500> they<00:05:00.060> ignore<00:05:01.060> um

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
they don't have any and they ignore um

blast markers and cloud effects and such

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.500 
blast markers and cloud effects and such
and<00:05:05.380> it's<00:05:05.890> got<00:05:06.100> really<00:05:06.460> nice<00:05:06.700> range<00:05:07.090> it's<00:05:07.330> got

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510

sixty centimeters on all of its weapons
and<00:05:09.790> it's<00:05:09.910> weapon<00:05:10.210> batteries<00:05:10.570> are<00:05:10.720> twelve<00:05:11.050> so

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
and it's weapon batteries are twelve so

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.550 
and it's weapon batteries are twelve so
it<00:05:12.010> can<00:05:12.160> broadside<00:05:12.760> fairly<00:05:13.390> have<00:05:13.630> fairly<00:05:14.200> hard

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
it can broadside fairly have fairly hard

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.260 
it can broadside fairly have fairly hard
and<00:05:14.800> if<00:05:14.890> you've<00:05:15.100> got<00:05:15.220> a<00:05:15.250> cruiser<00:05:15.730> coming<00:05:16.180> up

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
and if you've got a cruiser coming up

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.230 
and if you've got a cruiser coming up
alongside<00:05:16.570> it<00:05:17.080> to<00:05:17.500> get<00:05:17.650> a<00:05:17.680> pincer<00:05:18.160> move<00:05:18.340> it<00:05:18.700> can

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
alongside it to get a pincer move it can

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.760 
alongside it to get a pincer move it can
really<00:05:19.570> do<00:05:19.780> a<00:05:19.810> lot<00:05:19.900> of<00:05:20.080> damage<00:05:20.350> to<00:05:20.620> any

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
really do a lot of damage to any

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.400 
really do a lot of damage to any
battleship<00:05:21.370> it<00:05:21.550> goes<00:05:21.700> up<00:05:21.880> against<00:05:22.360> again<00:05:23.260> it's

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
battleship it goes up against again it's

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.610 
battleship it goes up against again it's
also<00:05:23.590> got<00:05:23.890> the<00:05:24.010> same<00:05:24.250> hit<00:05:24.970> points<00:05:25.390> and<00:05:25.630> it's

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
also got the same hit points and it's

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.130 
also got the same hit points and it's
got<00:05:26.890> nine<00:05:27.280> torpedoes<00:05:28.030> which<00:05:28.300> I<00:05:28.480> really<00:05:28.780> like<00:05:28.960> I

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
got nine torpedoes which I really like I

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.320 
got nine torpedoes which I really like I
like<00:05:29.170> shoot<00:05:29.590> torpedoes<00:05:30.550> because<00:05:30.910> it<00:05:31.060> really

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
like shoot torpedoes because it really

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.260 
like shoot torpedoes because it really
causes<00:05:31.710> a<00:05:32.710> hindrance<00:05:33.580> because<00:05:33.760> it<00:05:34.000> basically

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
causes a hindrance because it basically

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.270 
causes a hindrance because it basically
limits<00:05:34.960> the<00:05:35.110> field<00:05:35.350> of<00:05:35.500> turning<00:05:35.890> in<00:05:36.010> view

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
limits the field of turning in view

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.740 
limits the field of turning in view
especially<00:05:36.490> with<00:05:36.940> Eldar<00:05:37.300> you<00:05:37.420> want<00:05:37.600> to<00:05:37.660> be

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
especially with Eldar you want to be

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.720 
especially with Eldar you want to be
able<00:05:37.840> to<00:05:37.960> shoot<00:05:38.140> torpedoes<00:05:38.710> everywhere<00:05:39.520> to

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
able to shoot torpedoes everywhere to

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.430 
able to shoot torpedoes everywhere to
keep<00:05:39.910> to<00:05:40.210> keep<00:05:40.240> the<00:05:40.540> Eldar<00:05:40.840> from<00:05:41.110> going

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
keep to keep the Eldar from going

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.860 
keep to keep the Eldar from going
anywhere<00:05:41.680> that<00:05:41.950> they<00:05:42.070> want<00:05:42.340> to<00:05:42.550> and<00:05:42.970> again<00:05:43.690> it

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
anywhere that they want to and again it

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.570 
anywhere that they want to and again it
suffers<00:05:44.230> the<00:05:44.380> same<00:05:44.560> problem<00:05:45.010> as<00:05:45.070> as<00:05:45.220> it<00:05:45.370> can't

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
suffers the same problem as as it can't

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.070 
suffers the same problem as as it can't
come<00:05:45.790> to<00:05:45.970> a<00:05:46.000> new<00:05:46.120> heading<00:05:46.390> like<00:05:46.540> I<00:05:46.720> said<00:05:46.960> I'd

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
come to a new heading like I said I'd

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.360 
come to a new heading like I said I'd
probably<00:05:47.230> mention<00:05:47.650> this<00:05:47.740> before<00:05:48.160> all

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
probably mention this before all

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.280 
probably mention this before all
battleships<00:05:49.150> for<00:05:49.390> the<00:05:49.480> Imperial<00:05:49.810> Guard<00:05:50.020> are

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:50.290 
battleships for the Imperial Guard are

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.870 
battleships for the Imperial Guard are
not<00:05:50.560> allowed<00:05:50.830> to<00:05:51.010> use<00:05:51.130> the<00:05:51.280> come<00:05:51.490> to<00:05:51.670> new

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
not allowed to use the come to new

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.620 
not allowed to use the come to new
heading<00:05:52.150> special<00:05:52.690> rule<00:05:54.240> but<00:05:55.240> again<00:05:55.480> it

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
heading special rule but again it

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:56.940 
heading special rule but again it
doesn't<00:05:55.810> really<00:05:55.990> hinder<00:05:56.290> them<00:05:56.500> these<00:05:56.650> ships

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
doesn't really hinder them these ships

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.050 
doesn't really hinder them these ships
are<00:05:57.070> not<00:05:57.190> really<00:05:57.400> meant<00:05:57.610> for<00:05:57.700> fast

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
are not really meant for fast

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.910 
are not really meant for fast
maneuverable<00:05:58.570> combat<00:05:59.050> it's<00:05:59.200> meant<00:05:59.440> for<00:05:59.530> going

00:05:59.910 --> 00:05:59.920 
maneuverable combat it's meant for going

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.250 
maneuverable combat it's meant for going
straight<00:06:00.160> up<00:06:00.520> the<00:06:00.640> middle<00:06:00.760> and<00:06:01.260> blowing

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.260 
straight up the middle and blowing

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.110 
straight up the middle and blowing
everything<00:06:02.680> up<00:06:02.920> in<00:06:03.070> its<00:06:03.220> path<00:06:03.460> and<00:06:03.730> doing<00:06:03.940> and

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
everything up in its path and doing and

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.020 
everything up in its path and doing and
it<00:06:04.240> can<00:06:04.360> do<00:06:04.450> it<00:06:04.570> very<00:06:04.930> very<00:06:05.110> well<00:06:05.620> and<00:06:06.030> so

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
it can do it very very well and so

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.880 
it can do it very very well and so
between<00:06:07.330> the<00:06:07.600> two<00:06:07.750> battleships<00:06:08.350> in<00:06:08.680> the

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890 
between the two battleships in the

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.250 
between the two battleships in the
Imperial<00:06:09.280> Guard<00:06:09.550> class<00:06:10.060> I<00:06:10.330> think<00:06:11.140> the

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.260 
Imperial Guard class I think the

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.960 
Imperial Guard class I think the
retribution<00:06:11.560> class<00:06:12.010> is<00:06:12.190> a<00:06:12.220> lot<00:06:12.460> better<00:06:12.700> it's

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970 
retribution class is a lot better it's

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.430 
retribution class is a lot better it's
actually<00:06:13.330> my<00:06:13.420> favorite<00:06:13.630> out<00:06:13.870> of<00:06:13.930> all<00:06:14.110> of<00:06:14.260> them

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
actually my favorite out of all of them

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.410 
actually my favorite out of all of them
and<00:06:14.680> in<00:06:15.130> terms<00:06:15.370> of<00:06:15.490> battleship<00:06:15.940> class<00:06:16.180> wise

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:16.420 
and in terms of battleship class wise

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.570 
and in terms of battleship class wise
they're<00:06:16.990> actually<00:06:17.350> pretty<00:06:17.680> decent<00:06:18.010> they've

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:18.580 
they're actually pretty decent they've

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.300 
they're actually pretty decent they've
got<00:06:18.880> very<00:06:19.240> nice<00:06:19.450> they're<00:06:20.050> very<00:06:20.260> nice<00:06:20.710> stats

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
got very nice they're very nice stats

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.970 
got very nice they're very nice stats
they<00:06:21.610> can<00:06:21.940> fill<00:06:22.210> a<00:06:22.480> pretty<00:06:23.110> solid<00:06:23.350> core<00:06:23.770> row

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:23.980 
they can fill a pretty solid core row

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.830 
they can fill a pretty solid core row
like<00:06:24.340> I<00:06:24.520> say<00:06:24.700> the<00:06:24.820> retribution<00:06:25.090> is<00:06:25.510> more<00:06:25.690> of<00:06:25.750> an

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
like I say the retribution is more of an

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.530 
like I say the retribution is more of an
aggressive<00:06:26.140> spaceship<00:06:27.070> and<00:06:27.370> which<00:06:28.120> can<00:06:28.330> hold

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:28.540 
aggressive spaceship and which can hold

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.020 
aggressive spaceship and which can hold
on<00:06:28.750> its<00:06:28.900> own<00:06:29.200> whereas<00:06:29.710> the<00:06:29.950> Emperor<00:06:30.370> spaceship

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030 
on its own whereas the Emperor spaceship

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.720 
on its own whereas the Emperor spaceship
battleship<00:06:31.750> is<00:06:31.930> more<00:06:32.140> designed<00:06:32.530> for<00:06:32.950> having

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:33.730 
battleship is more designed for having

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.130 
battleship is more designed for having
at<00:06:33.820> least<00:06:33.970> two<00:06:34.090> cruisers<00:06:34.600> on<00:06:34.750> its<00:06:34.900> side<00:06:35.110> to

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:35.140 
at least two cruisers on its side to

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.690 
at least two cruisers on its side to
give<00:06:35.440> it<00:06:35.560> support<00:06:36.130> and<00:06:36.310> so

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:38.700 
give it support and so

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.630 
give it support and so
that<00:06:38.940> is<00:06:39.600> basically<00:06:40.110> what<00:06:40.920> I<00:06:40.980> can<00:06:41.220> say<00:06:41.490> about

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:41.640 
that is basically what I can say about

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.480 
that is basically what I can say about
those<00:06:42.030> two<00:06:42.300> ships<00:06:42.630> and<00:06:42.960> I'm<00:06:43.860> running<00:06:44.370> out<00:06:44.460> of

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.490 
those two ships and I'm running out of

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.080 
those two ships and I'm running out of
time<00:06:44.760> for<00:06:45.060> today<00:06:45.240> so<00:06:45.650> we'll<00:06:46.650> take<00:06:47.610> this<00:06:47.790> again

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.090 
time for today so we'll take this again

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.020 
time for today so we'll take this again
next<00:06:48.360> Monday<00:06:48.690> and<00:06:49.340> we'll<00:06:50.340> look<00:06:50.580> into<00:06:50.820> the

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.030 
next Monday and we'll look into the

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.140 
next Monday and we'll look into the
Imperial<00:06:51.480> Guard<00:06:51.720> um<00:06:51.960> like<00:06:52.680> um<00:06:52.860> cruisers<00:06:53.640> so

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.150 
Imperial Guard um like um cruisers so

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.810
