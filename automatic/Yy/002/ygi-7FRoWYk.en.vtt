00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.590
 I do not know if you could not 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.630
 to see this button is to make the 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.940
 synchrony 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.340
 they squeeze once here once only 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.790
 I'll give it to a cast console will have 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.860
 and synchronizing the controls is 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.740
 usually this happens you just need 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.250

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.950
