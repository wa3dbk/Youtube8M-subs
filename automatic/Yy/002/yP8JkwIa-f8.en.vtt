00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.110
 scared that one there taylor lautner 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.090
 On the one hand is the type 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.290
 well, sometimes involuntarily funny 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.270
 Things might be just fine 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.950
 comedy but fits in adam sandler 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.420
 films are generally just one 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.220
 faith either one likes silver 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.630
 maxi not my sandlers with the 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.370
 often stripes for the golden raspberry 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.870
 nominated but somehow I like one 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.940
 plates of humor when I often 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.010
 easy for nothing too bad 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.239
 children's heads 2 will tell him the story of 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.040
 first part continued 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.630
 the next between with his family 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.920
 pulled back to the small town again 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.870
 return to where he is 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.370
 grew up, and this time there are 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.600
 not necessarily just the adult ones 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.370
 behave like children but this time 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.720
 it is the children in the adult 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.150
 Bringing what life really does 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.190
 Is that all on the last day of school? 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.050
 Unfortunately, you do not know more about that yet 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.360
 history but from the casa are again the 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.220
 core of the four types played by 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.019
 adam sandler david spade kevin james and 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.300

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.489
 Buscemi will be there and Taylor 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.810
 lautner something of everything so look on 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.130
 The canvas brings me here 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.720
 regularly scared like worse 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.950
 But maybe it would be comedy 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.780
 That's why I'm exactly genre 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.160
 strained child heads 2 starts on 18 July 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.350
 2013 presented in German cinemas 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.280
 from sony pictures and i am looking forward to 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.799
 the movie because I the first part 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.209
 really liked and eyes like 23 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.500
 have seen more than you absolutely 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.450

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.160
 That's why I'm in the second part 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.840
 even if he is probably funny 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.010
 you have to be stupid in advance 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.959
 but know with the expectations 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.880
 are more like the center movies sometimes 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.959
