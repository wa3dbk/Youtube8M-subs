00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.040
 tips how her new people get to know each other 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:16.740
 if you like me at a festival 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:18.930
 completely alone since I have this 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.760
 year for the very first time a festival 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.199
 visited the Roskilde festival 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.970
 in Denmark 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.140
 So I'm having a hard time 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.670
 not just yourself 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.320
 first of all times going to a festival 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.090
 but I 'm going alone too 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.890
 a foreign country and I have none 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.420
 I do not know about camping 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.860
 Camping is a complete one 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.120
 other story in this video 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.309
 Let's just take a look 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.590
 Focus on how to get the new people 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.469
 bz also get to know new friends 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.450
 if you travel alone or this case 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.980
 traveling alone at a festival 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.230
 many of you will even fall 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.210
 already in your bag I have 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.280
 I had to get it before because 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.629
 I once so not supported 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.789
 but development, I will too 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.789
 It is a lighter 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.510
 you should not underestimate how many 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:08.180
 people because I do not smoke personally 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.600
 but there are many people who do that and 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.960
 To have a lighter is at a festival 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.540
 make really handy 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.270
 every third person will ask you if you are 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.909
 and if you're up then the hero are 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.780
 in fact his vehicle is not yet 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.690
 lost 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.509
 well then you are with the people in the 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.340
 conversation and the doors are open 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.200
 to get to know our people or 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.810
 maybe one too 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.189
 Freud to find new friends by 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.710
 you can not only if somebody 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:40.780
 something asks to be helpful and thereby 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.909
 get in touch with new people 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.799
 but you can also if you can 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.039
 somehow you are lost 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.509
 through questions and with the concert schedule 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.500
 Just show gentleman and say here 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.810
 you where this stage 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.460
 and then if you tell yourself that 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.410
 ideas just barely in the same 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.750
 just with you have no idea how 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.310
 often that happened to me and how many 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.260
 people I got to know 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.810
 So the festival plan or 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.780
 just listening to the concert schedule 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.820
 real miracles glitter and light 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.740
 stand and as many are perhaps most 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.319
 a bit too we have at the beginning 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.010
 Let's say the guy has for me 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.049
 works wonderfully 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.900
 I believe the people in her 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.670
 deepest inner as well as parents and standing 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.920
 on everything that sparkles and sparkles and 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.469
 shines 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.200
 I have a fun budget in advance 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:34.840
 set up for me with me then 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.180
 bought any possible weak 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.400
 has as one might live in normal 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.340
 Let's see this is going to be just like that 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.969
 Perfectly suited as for example 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.909
 paint under violet body color 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:52.480
 which then glitters in the dark glitter 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:56.079
 rhinestones and so on 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.659
 kink lights and let me tell you that 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:02.889
 People will definitely be you 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:05.019
 address and if you are so like that 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:07.239
 have anticipated that you 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.430
 then with it off and say hey you are 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.459
 also a bit 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.319
 glitter people will take pictures with you 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.959
 you will make us poor 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:19.109
 be cell phones and that he just like that 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:21.450
 nice that is see and I had on it 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.890
 Glistening yourself again and again 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.329
 face or continue me again and again 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.549
 addressed and I still have there 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:29.250
 just so many people know new people 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.109
 you just learned that for yourself 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.900
 raich try it yourself and let 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.950
 the boys said outside I have 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.150

 wanted to do this two very delicate golden 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:46.049
 Glitter stripes in often the next 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:50.150

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.150
 I am wanted to come to me 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.959

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:04.489

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:09.739
 me one 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:12.660
 It had to be tory at the time though it works 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:15.210
 so that something like that can be done in the 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:18.420
 in the case give 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:20.079
 lightning thing or this simply 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.990
 eat life 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.520
 If you have been water is always whole 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.009

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.720

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:37.159

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:38.260
 superheroes and whatever works 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:40.920
 you 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.920
 the pixels 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.460
 Previously from kik graduate purchase and then 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.569
 from a cent there is simply too 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.729
 many people around you 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:52.349
 that also in war and 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.779
 no, honestly, who does not want one 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:56.600
 War should watch this only 

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:57.830
 the 12 run 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.550
 kiki exchange 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.550
 in matters 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.260
 league 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.080
 just say hello the people on one 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.120
 feast 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.500
 so open to new ones 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.270
 Friendships and 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.530
 close acquaintances that is 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.810
 Actually, not really 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.690
 what you say but just that in 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.870
 open your mouth be it now that 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.700
 you glitter with biscuits with one 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.190
 festival planner volunteer is that they 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:29.340
 Just ask what concert she's getting 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.110
 do not want to see if you're watching 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.420
 Roskilde that's great because the people 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.730
 have built their own music there 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.710
 her own boxes that forgave her 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.570
 camps too if is over and 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.030
 Somehow a compliment about their camp 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.890
 mars or their taste in music, however 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.380
 Do you just come as they do with people? 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.970
 into the conversation 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.640
 let me really wonder 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:52.530
 if you consolidate yours 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.890
 especially at your roskilde festival 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.880
 otherwise not a single new one 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.860
 it should close friendship 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.870
 I'm always a bonus tip for 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.850
 all the people that is too unsafe 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.440
 because actually completely alone 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:06.720
 I would go to the festival 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.540
 just guess in advance 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.490
 couchsurfing in the carcass in groups too 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.380
 inquire if the man on the festival 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.409
 just go that way, everybody 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.029
 out there already 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:19.309
 know what screamer is or 

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:21.169
 at least heard of it demonstrably 

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:22.610
 It also drives time in the comments and 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:24.139
 then I will do my own video 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.479
 what couchsurfing is like that 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:29.569
 but works for the moment go 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:31.489
 goes now times like this that is so 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:32.400
 as I said there you can in advance 

00:06:31.489 --> 00:06:33.810
 feel 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.150
 Many people get to know them too 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:39.180
 which brings fixed will go your choice 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:41.160
 and of course they are cool on the 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.050
 facebook groups of the festival and if 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.610
 it should be more specifically can you 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:47.310
 even the fans at the festival 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:49.040
 or vicky chase on the 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:52.550
 facebook pages 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.860
 or twitter-account just one 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.330
 will cost a little bit with the hashtag 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.830
 on going strong and they then 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.650
 maybe meant as well but also that 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.420
 Concert in these people is what it was 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.820
 my five tips including a bonus 

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:06.200
 nobody for you at a festival 

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.820
 New in a foreign country 

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.470
 close friendships 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.480
 if I celebrated this video then 

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.920
 subscribe to my channel and cold 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.230

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.460
 give me a thumbs up and up 

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:20.440
 I wish you the next time 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.440
 a beautiful day cheeseburger
