00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:23.720

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.019
 level and prestige of weapon first os 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.640
 I will explain a bit of prestige of 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.050
 level and here you have my new emblem not 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.130
 I have changed in the dolphin but still 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.710
 having the end because I like the 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.720
 dolphins I do not know why and well here you see 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.640
 pretty much a little bit and the first thing that I go 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.200
 to do is to check one thing not 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.820
 challenges we're going to see challenges for 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.760
 example the mine reflection 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.500
 we go here you will see it we reflect 151 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.230
 the progress is valid for the next one and I 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.470
 the reflection then let's check that 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.910
 let's check that it's still there does not follow 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.910
 there we will see 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.020
 let's prestige now then and we 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.379
 they will give more a few things later 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:07.130
 of having demanded bla bla bla space 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:12.350
 additional now not good come this way 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.399
 well I do not know what happened it's worth it has happened and 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.630
 now here we have prestigious awards 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:16.009
 that we can do all the 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.320
 statistics and start over from the 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:23.070
 level I hope they just gave me a trophy 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.020
 and now welcome to the penthouse I think 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.670
 very well was reimbursed all fixed 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.290
 unlocking used in the ball I do not know 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.880
 what is this but I think I'm lost 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.280
 an extra class , not what I want 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.900
 because here that will give me things that I do not 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.700
 want to unblock after mothers 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.380
 let's go here yes get an extra class 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.960
 we already have the sixth one we no longer have 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:45.680
 right to him the prestige mode of the 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.170
 the prizes that happen we will see no 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.369
 we can see the classes no or yes that 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.900
 we can at level 4, but I'm telling you 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.970
 I think the classes are going to stay 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:00.200
 just as you had them, let's see 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:03.040
 the challenges to the challenges 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.450
 challenges challenges 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.390
 I hope you let us teach go look 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.140
 here you look at the reflexes you see the challenges 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.849
 they move the is toxic 151 of 200 so 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.510
 the challenges remain as it does not happen 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.510
 nothing with the challenges 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.960
 it would be all totally the same so 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.640
 let's get the challenges we keep the 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.410
 weapons although they can not teach us but 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.170
 we keep the weapons and the same weapons 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.640
 at the same level, we keep them and 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.100
 Now I'm going to leave you because I have to 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.500
 continue up to level 4 and I'll show you 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.020
 that I have the weapons to teach 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.280
 how do I have how I am going to prestige a weapon 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.290
 it does not seem like it can prestige a 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.080
 because I can not give prestige here 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.940
 Ok so well now I'll teach you up 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.340
 now it's okay guys we're back here 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.290
 I'm going to show you how to do it 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.210
 prestige a weapon not as you see the 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.870
 prestigious regret but now I'm going to 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:58.000
 prestige the pe of w 57 what happens is 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.590
 that puts us max here is worth going or we go 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.380
 to the weapon and you see that he puts the triangle 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.410
 prestige with weapon is worth introducing 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.540
 prestige is worth 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.630
 and what has happened is that we have a 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.360
 little star and if you notice, they have erased me 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.210
 I have broken two serious but not the 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.790
 camouflages is worth as you see the camouflage 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.290
 I had unlocked and now I can 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.970
 put the emblem on the weapon and it will stay 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.550
 very cool and that's what the only thing 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.020
 makes the weapon prestigious not also what 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.120
 when we move to unblock 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.590
 prestige is the permanent unlocking 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.930
 this is like a token like when 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.550
 that we call everyone do warfare 3 and 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.440
 What I'm going to get release 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:40.170
 permanent they have recommended me 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:43.650
 I put the mmc or in the the 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.540
 the in 94 I think it's better 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.780
 more unlock in 94 which is the 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.250
 book 55 that not the other one so that's what 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.900
 that I'm going to unblock so you have to 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.489
 give the r 1 we have an unlock 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.150
 permanent and unlock and equip 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:59.850
 we also have the one in 94 and we're already 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.590
 online radio to play good guys 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.569
 girls I leave here that I will continue 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.870
 playing with my classmates is marc joan 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:10.140
 I do not think I have anything more than 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.160
 say to the respect more than you have a good 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.459
