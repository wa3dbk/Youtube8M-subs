00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
which I love and this the size doesn't

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.060 
which I love and this the size doesn't
really<00:00:14.910> matter<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:15.870> actually<00:00:16.109> found<00:00:16.619> that

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
really matter and I actually found that

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.460 
really matter and I actually found that
a<00:00:17.250> little<00:00:17.550> on<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.820> smaller<00:00:18.150> side<00:00:18.570> works

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
a little on the smaller side works

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.359 
a little on the smaller side works
better<00:00:20.250> than<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.939> real<00:00:21.300> large<00:00:21.590> hook<00:00:22.590> so<00:00:23.279> I've

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
better than a real large hook so I've

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.210 
better than a real large hook so I've
got<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.580> size<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:24.480> here<00:00:25.199> which<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.830> smallest

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
got a size I here which is the smallest

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.130 
got a size I here which is the smallest
one<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.699> could<00:00:26.970> use<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.390> could<00:00:27.570> probably<00:00:27.779> use

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
one I could use I could probably use

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.209 
one I could use I could probably use
like<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.500> year<00:00:29.010> Effie<00:00:29.640> vain'<00:00:29.849> that'd<00:00:30.539> be<00:00:30.720> fine

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
like a year Effie vain' that'd be fine

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.940 
like a year Effie vain' that'd be fine
and<00:00:32.700> then<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:32.940> always<00:00:33.329> use<00:00:33.750> two<00:00:34.110> stitch<00:00:34.410> markers

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
and then I always use two stitch markers

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.850 
and then I always use two stitch markers

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
the center and it's easier that way and

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.630 
the center and it's easier that way and

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
one skip pick up this one so now I have

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.030 
one skip pick up this one so now I have
probably<00:02:37.299> about<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.900> equivalent<00:02:38.440> of<00:02:38.590> eight

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
probably about the equivalent of eight

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.060 
probably about the equivalent of eight
new<00:02:39.640> loops<00:02:40.000> of<00:02:40.239> my<00:02:40.360> hook<00:02:40.600> so<00:02:41.380> I'm<00:02:41.530> just<00:02:41.799> going

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
new loops of my hook so I'm just going

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.670 
new loops of my hook so I'm just going
to<00:02:42.160> take<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.910> last<00:02:43.209> loop<00:02:43.750> I<00:02:43.959> just<00:02:43.989> picked<00:02:44.500> up

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
to take the last loop I just picked up

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.120 
to take the last loop I just picked up
leave<00:02:45.130> that<00:02:45.459> on<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:46.060> hook<00:02:46.299> and<00:02:46.570> then<00:02:47.290> grab<00:02:47.709> all

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
leave that on the hook and then grab all

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.539 
leave that on the hook and then grab all
the<00:02:48.670> other<00:02:48.820> ones<00:02:49.060> like<00:02:49.360> this<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:50.230> then<00:02:51.010> turn

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
the other ones like this and then turn

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.090 
the other ones like this and then turn
the<00:02:51.790> head<00:02:51.940> of<00:02:52.060> my<00:02:52.209> hook<00:02:52.450> down<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:53.170> bring<00:02:53.590> all

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
the head of my hook down and bring all

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.620 
the head of my hook down and bring all
those<00:02:54.580> loops<00:02:55.150> over<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:56.500> last<00:02:56.709> loop<00:02:57.130> on<00:02:57.370> my

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
those loops over the last loop on my

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.680 
those loops over the last loop on my
that<00:02:58.630> was<00:02:58.780> on<00:02:58.900> my<00:02:59.049> hook<00:02:59.230> that<00:02:59.739> I<00:02:59.799> picked<00:03:00.130> up

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
that was on my hook that I picked up

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.350 
that was on my hook that I picked up
okay<00:03:01.690> so<00:03:01.750> then<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.709> stitch<00:03:02.980> marker<00:03:03.250> I<00:03:03.820> put

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
okay so then the stitch marker I put

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.289 
okay so then the stitch marker I put
right<00:03:04.600> here<00:03:05.200> just<00:03:06.040> in<00:03:06.430> case<00:03:06.640> you<00:03:06.850> want<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.120> set

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
right here just in case you want to set

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.410 
right here just in case you want to set
this<00:03:07.480> down<00:03:07.780> or<00:03:08.790> something<00:03:09.790> happens<00:03:10.180> where<00:03:10.390> you

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
this down or something happens where you

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.380 
this down or something happens where you
drop<00:03:10.810> it<00:03:11.140> you<00:03:11.829> don't<00:03:12.010> want<00:03:12.160> all<00:03:12.400> your<00:03:12.760> stitches

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
drop it you don't want all your stitches

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.009 
drop it you don't want all your stitches
to<00:03:13.570> unravel<00:03:14.280> so<00:03:15.280> for<00:03:15.579> the<00:03:15.640> next<00:03:15.820> group<00:03:16.269> you

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
to unravel so for the next group you

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.160 
to unravel so for the next group you
skip<00:03:17.739> that<00:03:17.950> one<00:03:18.180> put<00:03:19.180> this<00:03:19.360> one<00:03:19.630> on<00:03:19.660> your<00:03:19.930> hook

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
skip that one put this one on your hook

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.680 
skip that one put this one on your hook
so<00:03:20.980> now<00:03:21.160> I'm<00:03:21.310> going<00:03:21.430> to<00:03:21.489> pick<00:03:21.700> up<00:03:21.910> about<00:03:22.209> ten

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
so now I'm going to pick up about ten

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.190 
so now I'm going to pick up about ten
loops<00:03:23.470> this<00:03:23.830> way<00:03:24.130> and<00:03:24.520> I<00:03:25.120> could<00:03:25.360> do<00:03:25.540> twelve<00:03:25.900> or

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
loops this way and I could do twelve or

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.080 
loops this way and I could do twelve or
fourteen<00:03:26.650> or<00:03:26.680> sixteen<00:03:27.010> or<00:03:27.489> whatever

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
okay I'm done last loop stays under the

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
okay so last loop stays there I take all

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.120 
okay so last loop stays there I take all
the<00:05:15.000> rest<00:05:15.120> of<00:05:15.300> the<00:05:15.390> loops<00:05:15.630> and<00:05:16.560> I<00:05:16.680> pull<00:05:16.950> the

loops on the hook so now if I want to
continue<00:05:22.530> on<00:05:22.800> using<00:05:23.220> the<00:05:23.340> stitch<00:05:23.580> markers<00:05:24.060> I

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
continue on using the stitch markers I

that strand wrap it around my finger and
then<00:06:36.540> take<00:06:36.780> that<00:06:36.990> loop<00:06:37.200> off<00:06:37.410> my<00:06:37.650> finger<00:06:38.070> and

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 
then take that loop off my finger and

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.260 
then take that loop off my finger and
bring<00:06:38.550> that<00:06:39.270> strand<00:06:39.980> through<00:06:40.980> that<00:06:41.220> loop<00:06:41.430> just

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:42.270 
bring that strand through that loop just

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:46.130 
bring that strand through that loop just
to<00:06:42.390> make<00:06:42.540> a<00:06:42.570> knot<00:06:42.840> and<00:06:44.300> the<00:06:45.300> ruffles<00:06:45.750> on<00:06:45.990> the

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:46.140 
to make a knot and the ruffles on the

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.010 
to make a knot and the ruffles on the
bottom<00:06:46.560> will<00:06:46.800> cover<00:06:47.700> that<00:06:47.940> up<00:06:48.000> and<00:06:48.330> I<00:06:48.720> want<00:06:48.930> to

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
bottom will cover that up and I want to

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.200 
bottom will cover that up and I want to
move<00:06:49.170> that<00:06:49.230> knot<00:06:49.680> as<00:06:49.980> close<00:06:50.130> as<00:06:50.580> possible<00:06:50.790> to

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.210 
move that knot as close as possible to

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.480 
move that knot as close as possible to
the<00:06:51.600> last<00:06:51.840> ruffles<00:06:53.450> just<00:06:54.450> like<00:06:54.660> that

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.490 
the last ruffles just like that

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.900 
the last ruffles just like that
then<00:06:55.940> I'll<00:06:56.090> go<00:06:56.270> in<00:06:57.160> and<00:06:58.160> cut<00:06:58.400> about<00:06:58.550> an<00:06:58.759> inch

00:06:58.900 --> 00:06:58.910 
then I'll go in and cut about an inch

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.800 
then I'll go in and cut about an inch
away<00:06:59.180> like<00:06:59.539> that<00:06:59.569> and<00:07:01.180> then<00:07:02.180> when<00:07:02.360> this<00:07:02.479> falls

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:02.810 
away like that and then when this falls

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.620 
away like that and then when this falls
down<00:07:03.169> the<00:07:04.130> ruffles<00:07:04.699> will<00:07:04.819> drape<00:07:05.030> over<00:07:05.360> it<00:07:05.449> you

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:05.630 
down the ruffles will drape over it you

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.080 
down the ruffles will drape over it you
won't<00:07:05.810> see<00:07:06.050> that
