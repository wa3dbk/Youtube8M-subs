 hamburg in a map saw one is like that 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.000
 fits closely and what do we do on the 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.560
 kartbahn we play mario kart mario 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.810
 kart mario kart cup we want 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.160
 Invited by Nintendo for the release 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.160
 by mario kart 8 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.910
 the first race is over I feel 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.370
 really great team really everything 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.410
 given and lost with possible 27 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.720
 I can score points here very well 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.670
 show I do not know we see that there 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.520
 we see 27 points of possible over 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.170
 50 or so I just can 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.460
 better worse off but was 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.110
 but not what is playing right 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.970
 really much fun so really everything 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.340
 what one wants the kids-cup here 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.940
 and I'm curious how the 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:24.040
 to beat others 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.570
 because I'm not there until noon today anyway 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.980
 Of course it's not just about that 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.420
 Mario kart eight good or bad 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.920
 but it's also about who is the 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.300
 best driver and the best driver 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.070
 but we do not just join 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.450
 against each other on the wii u an but 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.430
 also outside on the kart track 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.540
 that means who drives the best rounds 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.660
 he gets the most points 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.390
 who will win in the end tanja will be in 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.480
 the category 100 kubik compete and me 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.650
 in the category 150 million so have a look 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.650
 who will be the only one of us 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.210
 4 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.660

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.260

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.330

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.160
 I'm completely finished it 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.020
 Very first time card was my work 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.020

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.650
 he expects I had to go drifting 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.020

 minijobber to the band of the borders 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.500
 Here I am once against the 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.060
 gang of his reign 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.060
 Although the pictures prove only very rarely 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.140
 very rare but that yamaha so me 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.360
