Good morning, good morning. Oh my gosh. I am so excited for

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.474
this morning. Today we are going out to the great barrier reef 

00:00:09.474 --> 00:00:12.771
and we are going to do some diving, snorkeling... I can't even

00:00:12.771 --> 00:00:16.068
describe..its one of those things I wanted to do forever..

00:00:16.068 --> 00:00:21.014
Man: This here is the scuba unit. Anyone here knows what  

00:00:21.014 --> 00:00:26.122
scuba stands for? Self contained underwater breathing apparatus

00:00:26.122 --> 00:00:34.528
The number one most important rule of scuba diving is: always

00:00:34.528 --> 00:00:39.869
breathe and never, ever hold your breath. In and out of our

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:43.537
mouths, nice and slowly. Its quite easy, just make sure you 

00:00:43.537 --> 00:00:49.644
don't hold breath. Second rule of scuba diving is when we go

00:00:49.644 --> 00:00:52.941
underwater, you start to feel a bit of pressure in our ears. That 

00:00:52.941 --> 00:00:56.146
is no worries, we just have to equalize that pressure. The way 

00:00:56.146 --> 00:01:00.651
we do that is we take two fingers, pinch our nose and blow 

00:01:00.651 --> 00:01:04.853
against our nose. For every meter or so that we go down you

00:01:04.853 --> 00:01:07.965
need to stop and equalize your ears.

00:01:15.511 --> 00:01:22.245
Welcome to the Great Barrier Reef. I am so excited to be here.

00:01:22.245 --> 00:01:25.031
As you can see I have already been in the water, couldn't wait

00:01:25.031 --> 00:01:26.843
I had to go in.

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:37.245
Yea. Now we are getting on our scuba gear, and go scuba dive.

00:02:38.732 --> 00:02:44.490
Hi guys. We are getting ready to go on our second scuba dive.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:51.040
Are you excited? Girl: Yes. Water in my eye.
