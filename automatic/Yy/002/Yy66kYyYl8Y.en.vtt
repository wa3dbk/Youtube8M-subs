whole<00:01:51.630> entire<00:01:51.659> life<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:53.340> when<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.850> start

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
whole entire life and so when you start

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.700 
whole entire life and so when you start
to<00:01:54.240> look<00:01:54.390> at<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.630> chemical<00:01:54.810> makeup<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.560> these

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
to look at the chemical makeup of these

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.050 
to look at the chemical makeup of these
plants<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.280> highest<00:01:56.490> concentrated<00:01:56.880> source

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
plants the highest concentrated source

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.420 
plants the highest concentrated source
of<00:01:57.180> vitamin<00:01:57.450> C<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.960> last<00:01:58.170> virgin<00:01:58.649> soil<00:01:59.189> on<00:01:59.399> the

it's<00:02:23.910> scientific<00:02:24.660> but<00:02:24.900> let's<00:02:25.500> talk<00:02:25.739> about

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
it's scientific but let's talk about

it's scientific but let's talk about

that biodiversity because it's not

die-off<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.580> extinction<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.299> so<00:02:43.019> our

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
die-off and extinction and so our

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.710 
die-off and extinction and so our
company<00:02:44.130> is<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.250> for-profit<00:02:44.670> company<00:02:45.090> that

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
company is a for-profit company that

company is a for-profit company that
sets<00:02:46.080> up<00:02:47.569> we<00:02:48.569> work<00:02:48.810> directly<00:02:49.230> with<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.620> tribes

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
sets up we work directly with the tribes

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.330 
sets up we work directly with the tribes
who<00:02:50.280> harvest<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.940> plants<00:02:51.739> sustainably<00:02:52.739> so

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
who harvest the plants sustainably so

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.920 
who harvest the plants sustainably so
what<00:02:53.549> comes<00:02:53.819> out<00:02:54.000> of<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.209> rainforest<00:02:54.420> will

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
what comes out of the rainforest will

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.229 
what comes out of the rainforest will
grow<00:02:55.170> back<00:02:55.410> in<00:02:55.650> months<00:02:56.010> or<00:02:56.160> years<00:02:56.580> so<00:02:57.180> you

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
grow back in months or years so you

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.839 
grow back in months or years so you
harvest<00:02:57.810> say<00:02:58.500> for<00:02:58.739> example<00:02:59.069> the<00:02:59.160> camel<00:02:59.519> camel

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
harvest say for example the camel camel

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.850 
harvest say for example the camel camel
berry<00:03:00.060> that's<00:03:00.390> going<00:03:00.630> to<00:03:00.690> grow<00:03:00.900> back<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.440> grow

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
berry that's going to grow back and grow

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.160 
berry that's going to grow back and grow
back<00:03:02.069> and<00:03:02.370> so<00:03:02.670> it<00:03:02.849> creates<00:03:03.239> an<00:03:03.360> economical

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
back and so it creates an economical

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.430 
back and so it creates an economical
viable<00:03:05.069> system<00:03:05.730> but<00:03:06.360> what<00:03:06.630> can<00:03:06.870> we<00:03:07.140> do<00:03:07.319> I<00:03:07.349> mean

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
viable system but what can we do I mean

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.319 
viable system but what can we do I mean
here<00:03:07.799> you<00:03:07.830> are<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.430> live<00:03:08.640> in<00:03:08.730> Santa<00:03:09.150> Monica

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
here you are you live in Santa Monica

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.599 
here you are you live in Santa Monica
it's<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:09.750> beautiful<00:03:10.170> community<00:03:10.350> where<00:03:11.130> I<00:03:11.160> guess

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
it's a beautiful community where I guess

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:12.949 
it's a beautiful community where I guess
for<00:03:11.970> lack<00:03:12.090> of<00:03:12.150> better<00:03:12.299> term<00:03:12.600> where<00:03:12.750> is<00:03:12.840> the

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
for lack of better term where is the

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.250 
for lack of better term where is the
low-lying<00:03:13.500> fruit<00:03:13.799> that<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.130> can<00:03:14.609> grab<00:03:14.880> so<00:03:15.840> I<00:03:15.870> can

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
low-lying fruit that I can grab so I can

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.220 
low-lying fruit that I can grab so I can
help<00:03:16.500> sustain<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.940> Amazon<00:03:18.480> rainforest<00:03:18.720> what

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
help sustain the Amazon rainforest what

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.280 
help sustain the Amazon rainforest what
can<00:03:19.350> I<00:03:19.530> do<00:03:19.590> well<00:03:20.579> you<00:03:20.670> can<00:03:20.700> drink<00:03:20.970> Samuel<00:03:21.359> that
