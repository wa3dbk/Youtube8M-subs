00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.660
 or the one that came is as you already know every time 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:07.580
 I am more and therefore there are more questions 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.349
 As I can not answer them all in 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.139
 the same day I ask you to be short 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.670
 concise and descriptive if possible in 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.340
 the last video so that all are 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.769
 gathered if you want me to upload your photos or 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.199
 videos you can send less by gmail to 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:24.169
 an aquarium diary at gmail.com or 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.269
 by facebook www.facebook.com bar 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.880
 aquarium diary with its corresponding 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.589
 question in a video question 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.750
 previous carlos medina gives us some 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:34.760
 photos that I forgot to put them as 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.179
 it's very good I'm going to teach the two for 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.179
 that you see them 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.250
 by the way I think that he must live here 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.250
 'sponge Bob' 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.700
 of master words hello jose long ago you 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.770
 I mentioned that I was going to build my aquarium 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.300
 planted now will be even bigger and not 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.370
 I know you can put it on and be 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.840
 compatible with the main fish that 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.910
 he wants to put is he has seen grass 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.040
 Ramirez and what do you recommend for me? 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.840
 let your colleagues be greetings if 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.420
 you plan to put Ramirez if the trip should 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.280
 be very close to 6 degrees and the gh by 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.930
 below 10 and the water changes should 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.400
 be habitual and already following these 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.410
 parameters you can meter times 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.090
 Community if they are calm and according to 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.950
 the aquarium as long as the boats 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.050
 many caves being effective will have 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.910
 guti et cetera should be aquariums in 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.009
 less than 100 liters and surpassing that 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.410
 volume you can put bigger fish or 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.210
 different like scalar grammys fish 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.590
 the apex swim and other varieties of 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.600
 dwarf cyclic 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.880
 higinio I said I can place cichlids with 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.220
 angel depends on what cichlids we speak 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.170
 if it is constituted African impossible 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.330
 if it's with American cichlids it's nothing 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.160
 advisable that kind of times need 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.869
 individual aquariums however if it is 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.850
 with dwarf cichlids if you can have 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.780
 as long as the volume of 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.820
 100 liters 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.310
 danny sanchez says one of my scalars 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.530
 supposed female is very fat that can 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.460
 to be the truth is that I have four 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.890
 days and I do not know 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.869
 deposit stool monitors the closely 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.520
 see what type of stool they release if 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.320
 is that they release some on the other hand if 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.119
 the aquarium is about 27 or 28 degrees 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.100
 look to see if he does rituals of 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.660
 mating with another scalar or if you're 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.250
 cleaning some sheet or bottom of the 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.989
 aquarium in that case it would be full of 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.760
 eggs and if not, there can be two 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.860
 dropsy things if you have the 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.630
 scales raised almost without treatment 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.400
 and with daily water changes or some 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.110
 commercial drug as they were or 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.270
 bach trimmer or if you only have the 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.040
 swollen stomach must be obstruction 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.319
 intestinal that is medicated by several 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.000
 forms one way is to give spirulina or 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.769
 some kind of house vegetable and 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.540
 moistening it in oil and giving it to 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.830
 daily until the swelling goes down and 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.350
 another way to medicate would be with 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.420
 First, apply two drops per each 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.519
 10 liters for one day and another way 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.500
 would give him a pill say velux for 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.180
 every 10 liters for a day but 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.880
 always trying to medicate other than 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.709
 expensive aquarium magnano said hello for the 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.780
 occlusion doubts leave the fish a 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.970
 day without eating and both males are very much 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.040
 skinnier but the female continues with this 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.260
 bacon round but does not have the stain 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.090
 Black will be sick 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.739
 your fish will simply eat fast and 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.450
 they fill up before the others though 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.700
 this happens many times I would give them 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.500
 less quantity and more distributed more times 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.329
 the day that is still swollen should be 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.790
 pregnant and you can put a paridera 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.680
 with grid or put in the background 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.480
 many plants that are dense so that 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.250
 the fry hide light in case of 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.780
 pregnancy is not advisable not 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.670
 feed him and if provide him 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.110
 food alive or frozen if it happens some 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.269
 time you see that it's possible that it's 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.430
 intestinal obstruction should be the 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.620
 vegetables soaked in oil just like 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.540
 we said in the previous question 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.519
 removed red says hello to you visor do 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.560
 one question I have an aquarium of 80 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.409
 liters I bought a larger one of 130 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.090
 liters you ask me can I directly 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:41.069
 put the smallest aquarium water with 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.450
 your gravel filter plants and all your 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.519
 things in the biggest aquarium and 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.060
 skip recycling since many 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.709
 Thank you 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.720
 even though we use already used material from 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.819
 another aquarium the new volume of water 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.769
 can cause more to be generated 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.510
 bacteria that increase toxins to 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.579
 this adds to what being a new one 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.889
 can affect the parameters to 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:01.230
 principle and make the fish die or 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:03.209
 inferniÃ±o jose ramirez says hello jose 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.530
 that a question I have a couple of 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.640
 sakura prawns 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.380
 look 152 centimeters that is and well 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.360
 I put the couple in an aquarium of 30 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.060
 liters in which are also found 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.970
 Sword pups these measure 2 to 2.5 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.470
 centimeters now my question are do you think 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.989
 that the space is too large to be 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.580
 can play shrimp and how much 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.860
 would be the minimum amount of liters for 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.230
 have two prawns do you think that the young 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.820
 sword they eat the baby shrimp there 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.530
 you think that the light is very strong for 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.690
 shrimp because I seem to have heard 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.580
 that they do not like much light this guy 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.919
 of prawns can create there perfectly 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.990
 and also in less liters also as 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.330
 minimum about 10 the case is that according 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.070
 grow the offspring of seafood there may be 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.810
 problems of both space and that 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.669
 the young of the prawns eat the 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.380
 lighting that you have is fine and not 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.330
 should annoy you as long as 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.490
 there are muscles and plants that 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.680
 provide shelter to these prawns and 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.330
 five fingers over here I leave a video in 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.310
 the one that I put some images of about 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.570
 scalars that I had a few years ago 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.570
 I learned a lot of things
