00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.399
 re N 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.600
 goo 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.700
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.350
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:30.640
 Organ Shiro I guess you know the organ 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.760
 Sauce One set 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.050
 There which is also of that child Tteyuu but unique 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.050
 A little about yesterday 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:48.770
 You 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:54.460
 For example, now I have only one other column setting 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.460
 I tried to play down to the lower side assuming the keyboard 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.780
 Company 3 tips 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.900
 This time there was a little request 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.060
 About foot keyboard 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.869
 A little 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:18.200
 Do you want try to talk Toka it from reverb function 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.300
 Well there is no headphone jack 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.530
 It seems man has him before 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:27.550
 So when it comes to playing that running base like now 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.530
 Look at the elements rush 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:35.479
 Nn 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.860
 It's a small thing, but this kind of little thing leads to the expression of the performance 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.790
 By say 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:43.330
 a There were three ways of using feet 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.410
 Tell me 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.470
 Line and the amplifier when the studio practice and live 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.260
 Which one is better 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:57.360
 Beneath you for your question 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:59.310
 Well in live I am always connected to the bass amp but that bass 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.220
 That comes out of the amp 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.220
 That feeling of air and so on
