00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.860
 hello to all the people of video games 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:17.020
 italy i'm spare c12 and how by now 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.700
 constituents in my channel are here for 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.290
 present you a game a little different from the 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.000
 usual 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:25.090
 today I am talking about x3 terran 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.590
 conflict but first of all if I'm here 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.090
 thanks to the administrators 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.259
 of the channel for giving me this 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.490
 opportunity 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.370
 and of course you too 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.810
 watching the video right now 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:37.360
 teheran conflict like all the trilogy 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.250
 is set in the hicks universe a 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.079
 universe of big trades very much in 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.930
 pole shares several large starbases 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.640
 small ships large if a first sight 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.530
 a quiet game a kind of 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.329
 commercial managerial with 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.090
 a rather special diet and not 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.949
 many actions hands people wrong 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.719
 definitely wrong 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.179
 in fact there is one thing that gives this game 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.320
 and to all his series the first right 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:01.510
 to enter the history of video games 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.320
 and not the shrewdness of intelligence 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.600
 artificial 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.090
 not even the almost infinite longevity e 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.870
 not even the graphics are bad but they are 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.780
 another thing 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:13.780
 huge space battles battles 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.430
 spaceships with huge space ships hunting 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.280
 corvettes in light and heavy hobs 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.140
 real battleships of space is 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.020
 needless to deny it is this the most element 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.820
 interesting and fun of x3 starting 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.799
 with a small ship almost completely 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.240
 to the green you can get to rule a 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.909
 galactic empire of size 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.869
 boundless from the technical point of view yes 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.939
 can say that the combat system 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.399
 it is excellent if governed manually 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.720
 for a wide variety of weapons 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.310
 but when the control of our ships 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.009
 pass the polita scene to the computer 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.479
 definitely more ships in particular 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.880
 big hardly perform 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.469
 automatically evasive maneuvers 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.420
 when you are manual control often 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:51.939
 save the ship itself and per month 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.380
 we have even been successful on it 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.600
 monetary policy is not easy especially 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.100
 at the beginning in fact earn the first 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.530
 credits a real business e 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.210
 also quite boring but proceeding 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.250
 in the game it automates more and more 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.200
 our task remains only that of 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.899
 protects our transport and not more than 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.789
 govern availability manually 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.590
 economic choice also increases among the 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.330
 various ships to expand our fleet 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.090
 and here the best aspect is connected 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.680
 of x3 also generally of ship everyone has 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.080
 its characteristics and isolated weak 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.170
 that you can spend hours finding the ship 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.390
 better for ours 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.550
 also thanks to good documentation 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.959
 online from your ships you can 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.790
 also capture but for large ones 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.349
 very difficult and should be reduced 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.470
 in a state that buy new you 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.190
 spends less and makes less effort 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.349
 obviously the ships must be 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.230
 equipped and 3 say so also here i 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.610
 manufacturers have indulged hundreds 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.380
 of weapons are found around and for all 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.319
 the species present in the hicks universe 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.150
 each with its specifics each species 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.739
 moreover some particular weapons that 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.290
 they can only be mounted on ships 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.000
 of the same species even if at the end 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.950
 accounts in particular for more ships 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.140
 the best weapons are few and large 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.610
 very expensive when it comes to 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.500
 equipping smaller ships is 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.200
 important to make a good choice 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.910
 never underestimate the light chain 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.459
 the shield sector was developed instead 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.319
 which is limited to one more you ever are is is 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.030
 well developed also political department 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.500
 in fact you can make friends with 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.569
 certain races increase their income 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.310
 commercial but you can also end up 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.959
 t garci together in that case 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.239
 your national ships welcome in 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.150
 their systems bringing some problems 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.080
 to your trade the navigation between 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.090
 system and the other is done through 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.160
 of the portals that connect the systems between 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.650
 them but if you want to speed things up 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.940
 which adopts the ship test of a jumpdrive 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.350
 that exact from one lead to the other without 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.680
 go through the intermediate ones 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.540
 needless to say but it is not cheap 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.579
 realistic no one can therefore say that a 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.750
 all effects a role-playing game 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.310
 albeit somewhat particular to 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.560
 the setting not really built 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.359
 as a role play to a bargain from 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.709
 follow but fun side that you can 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.709
 completely ignored they decide to opt 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:54.170
 for a personal choice of a former home 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.640
 success and domination has galactic will be 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.440
 if he wanted to follow the plot in history 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.000
 it is however also quite interesting 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.320
 but not only that bore you with the 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.579
 details 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.200
 also with you will be over are 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.790
 several different types of sheep are available 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.739
 different universes to play with 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.810
 if you wanted to find a fault I would say 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.940
 that apart from the lack of multiplayer 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.410
 There are no such special virgin 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.030
 of very obvious 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.859
 provided you have a graphical compartment at 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.389
 step with the times but being the game 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.109
 in the most recent they should not 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.239
 be problems 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.440
 in my opinion the game satisfies style 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.970
 fans of role-playing games and 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.039
 those of the bike molds that those 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.449
 of managers among a system of 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.530
 game never seen before 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:30.540
 so what else to tell you if you don't have it 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.980
 never proposals in search of a game a 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.139
 different for a videogame experience 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.479
 non-classical I recommend it 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:39.110
 fully if nothing else the video e 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.110
 ends here
