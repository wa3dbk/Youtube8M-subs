00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
pump housing and I do this process again

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.169 
pump housing and I do this process again
now<00:02:01.869> put<00:02:02.050> this<00:02:02.140> back<00:02:02.349> together<00:02:02.530> and<00:02:02.920> I<00:02:03.429> hope

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.700 

it's<00:02:08.890> basically<00:02:09.250> sets<00:02:09.580> down<00:02:09.789> into<00:02:10.119> here<00:02:10.710> and

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
it's basically sets down into here and

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.070 
it's basically sets down into here and
yeah<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.880> vein<00:02:13.090> sits<00:02:13.420> on<00:02:13.570> the<00:02:13.690> end<00:02:13.810> with<00:02:13.990> the

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
yeah the vein sits on the end with the

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.680 
yeah the vein sits on the end with the
clip<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.280> two<00:02:15.430> pins<00:02:15.670> hold<00:02:16.390> this<00:02:16.510> other

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
clip and the two pins hold this other

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.680 
clip and the two pins hold this other
stuff<00:02:16.960> on<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:18.520> it<00:02:18.760> goes<00:02:18.880> into<00:02:19.060> this<00:02:19.210> body<00:02:19.450> over

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
stuff on and it goes into this body over

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.640 
stuff on and it goes into this body over
here

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
here

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.440 
here
the<00:02:22.040> top<00:02:22.220> of<00:02:22.370> that<00:02:22.489> is<00:02:22.730> just<00:02:22.970> got<00:02:23.120> a<00:02:23.150> seal<00:02:23.420> on

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
the top of that is just got a seal on

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.940 
the top of that is just got a seal on
that's<00:02:23.930> where<00:02:24.110> it<00:02:24.170> was<00:02:24.260> leaking<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:26.860> so<00:02:27.860> what

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
that's where it was leaking and so what

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:28.890 
that's where it was leaking and so what
I<00:02:28.010> have<00:02:28.160> today

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
I have today

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.080 
I have today
take<00:02:29.900> care
