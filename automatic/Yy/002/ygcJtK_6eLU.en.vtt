00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.400
 So scheme number 10 server cluster 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.140
 mark your style north of cyprus 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.449
 Muchkapsky district and applications 

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:09.209
 how are they predominantly 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:11.889
 threatening everything here is pretty simple we 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:13.469
 leave everything almost without 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.199
 changes 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:16.299
 a place 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.689
 n remote desktop normal 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.359
 terminal servers we will use 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.720
 remote app market auto 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.720
 so get down to work 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.020
 now we are on our server 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.230
 neither we 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.680
 server 1c works in the vicinity of the server 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.480
 recount do it 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.170
 third we call server manager 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.170
 add roles and components 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.370
 Further 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.330
 installation of services 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.080
 work tables 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.820
 I remind you that uncontrolled 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.060
 domain 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.380
 by 1 to 7 10 12 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.700
 This application can not be raised 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.950
 state domain controller should 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.620
 so standard deployment 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.550
 we leave by default now 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.170
 medals 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.920
 yesterday we know 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.920
 play our server court cried congress 0 1 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.910
 yesterday stalin 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.250
 if we do it he 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.210
 using the wizard add roles 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.390
 component is pretty simple 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.590
 so put kitch kok install services 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:22.690
 laid off access 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.490
 remote desktop in the north 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.970
 intermediary connections 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.770
 remote desktop 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.270
 just choose 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.270
 to this end 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.250
 here as well as warranty with 0 1 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.760
 Stein Bird Auto 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.800
 restart difference server if 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.980
 need and color deploy 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.550
 further we wait 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.400
 it will take some time 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.930
 so ian pause just to 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.160
 don't rush your guilt are empty 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.220
 so everything is fixed 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.800
 shutting down 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.670
 we click in service of remote workers 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.150
 tables 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.810
 peak create collections create collections 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.000

 conflict example 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.679
 one of 

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:18.589
 to describe the same thing yesterday became 

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:21.159
 north dv 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.069
 groups which users 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.810
 we will provide third access 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:26.620
 position 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.379
 this domain users may be 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.739
 Received principle can not do 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:31.759
 differently 

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:34.969
 can remove 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:36.939
 Click here to add this group and 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:38.290
 choose a group that we have 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.290
 called what tajiks ues 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.489
 Siemens 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.869
 then year 

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:55.249
 turn on drives run ribbon we them not 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:57.539
 use sides kudrin further 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:59.419
 and create 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:02.839
 waiting for the completion of the creation of collections 

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:05.499
 so good click close 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:08.499
 Here we have created a collection of esata 

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:10.799
 now you can proceed to 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.799
 publishing remote application muratov 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.949
 this parameter 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:21.849
 clicking on the link 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.620
 1c enterprise putting quiet for 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.829
 thin citrus customers 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.169
 publish this 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:31.069
 so far nothing else we need here 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:32.269
 more 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.029
 Beijing Dalian 

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:35.559
 publish to her 

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:36.380
 so leader 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.270
 the wizard tells us that this application 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.339
 will be successful whites 

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:42.849
 clicks save 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:44.239
 and now you can 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:45.319
 get down 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.259
 to the work of Vladimir with our users 

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:49.409
 use am 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:50.479
 but for that 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:51.809
 but first 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:54.669
 need to go to the funeral 1 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:57.669
 to organizations 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:00.429
 these ribbons slept options did not hit 

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:02.210
 launch the front 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.380
 I recommend chrome to you 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.640
 to be able to 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.029
 download your 

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:09.209
 So data applications work 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.209
 internet explorer there are problems with this 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.209
 so we will write browser stuff 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.719
 look for dirt 

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:20.439
 cunning

 0 1 dot com in.lapy palm 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:26.509
 next slash 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:29.509
 this day 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:33.379
 then summer 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:36.800
 doubtful and ahead on the site of Kiev 01 kopecks 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.349
 it is unsafe therefore given 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:40.250
 certificate we have not verified ourselves 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.849
 assures that the certificate 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:43.659
 all this can be customized today 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:45.139
 Certification Authority 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:46.930

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:50.349
 drink to all those responsible 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:51.860
 the fact 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.219
 then this is done divorce basically 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:56.389
 can wash the center of the specification and not 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:59.289
 pull is not critical 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:00.620
 in our case 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.610
 waiting for new browser to display 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.129

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:06.939
 auto markets 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:09.589
 Dina again come authorization can 

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:12.900
 download remote applications 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.900
 here we write the correspondent 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.689
 Socor dot local lusya native 1 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:22.460
 and sometimes Kuchma 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.460
 users 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.460
 and firm interpretation 

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:31.109
 so here we see our published 

00:05:31.109 --> 00:05:33.169
 position this post this thin client

 where was the peak 

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:00.949
 sich make that no longer ask 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:02.930
 and connect 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:03.949

 so will remember the credentials 

00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:12.559
 flexible under the figures in conjunction with 

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:13.649
 remote worker connection 

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:15.309
 table past 

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:17.629
 enough run stability 

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:20.080
 first time a little more 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.229
 This process goes through and everything 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:24.080
 rest run next run 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.090
 will they quickly that is and through 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.509
 quick start 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:29.029
 so well we see 

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:32.099
 information base 

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:34.619

 it looks as if the 1 told starts and 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:43.750
 works 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:44.610
 on local computer 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.259
 user 1 population 

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:49.520
 Well, here's one user selection window 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.800
 because to him cues

 so long ago we work for him 

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:02.009
 local computer 

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:03.659
 Well, similar actions 

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:04.729
 we did so 

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:07.449
 on other computers Bashkir only 

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:08.919
