00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
we're really looking at is how do you

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.710 
we're really looking at is how do you
gain<00:01:24.210> access<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:25.200> gun<00:01:25.729> well<00:01:26.729> as<00:01:26.939> always

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
gain access to the gun well as always

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.899 
gain access to the gun well as always
you<00:01:27.840> got<00:01:27.960> really<00:01:28.350> two<00:01:28.920> options<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.460> then

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
you got really two options and then

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.149 
you got really two options and then
there's<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.900> yeah<00:01:31.170> they<00:01:31.439> cascade<00:01:31.650> from<00:01:32.009> there

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
there's the yeah they cascade from there

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.969 
there's the yeah they cascade from there
but<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.460> comes<00:01:32.610> down<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.790> two<00:01:33.200> one<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.439> using

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
but it comes down to two one is using

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.109 
but it comes down to two one is using
the<00:01:35.189> offhand<00:01:35.900> to<00:01:36.900> allow<00:01:37.170> access<00:01:37.439> are<00:01:38.310> two

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
the offhand to allow access are two

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.870 
the offhand to allow access are two
using<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.020> gun<00:01:40.320> hand<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.860> both<00:01:41.040> allow<00:01:41.430> access

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
using the gun hand to both allow access

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.090 
using the gun hand to both allow access
and<00:01:41.909> gain<00:01:42.299> access<00:01:42.710> what<00:01:43.710> does<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:43.829> look<00:01:44.040> like

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
and gain access what does that look like

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.210 
and gain access what does that look like
well<00:01:45.170> using<00:01:46.170> two<00:01:46.470> hands<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.829> always<00:01:46.979> going<00:01:47.159> to

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
well using two hands is always going to

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.280 
well using two hands is always going to
be<00:01:47.310> faster<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:48.240> know<00:01:48.299> we've<00:01:48.630> got<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:48.990> hand

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290
