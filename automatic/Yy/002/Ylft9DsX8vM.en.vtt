00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:14.099

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.100
 my bedroom 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:24.050
 and yes then the first thing you 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:28.369
 want to do is open this and yves is 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.369

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.850
 record that it turns from what 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:46.170
 does not work like these then from the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:50.309
 all saints then now you want 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.760

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:57.360
 oriented and will find something 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.320
 that you want to play and today I 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.690
 played meadows 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.110
 so now that you have your album 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:11.910
 there is like a plastic cover 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:15.450
 so who will take that away from us here 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:18.179
 justin here you think the disc this 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.860
 so you're just gonna kidnapped it's 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:24.840
 also here is our cover 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:32.399
 I hope that in paper 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:34.710
 so you'll go that too here then 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:38.490
 when you have this haunted record have never 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.290
 cheated like here like never before 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.549
 you want to touch like the sides like 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:48.030
 here is a bit like doing that and you can 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.799
 use right here too times that's 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.140
 what I do when I said I know 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:57.090
 but I'm still strong like that 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:59.340
 for now continue this then 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:04.200
 now you will put the disc on 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:09.000
 the record player and sprimont 10 like 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:12.150
 this I'm going to put on the table then 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.630
 the first thing you want to do the 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.630
 question table is like that 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:35.939
 this will put on like that then other 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:39.480
 thing I'm going to say is you can 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:45.090
 start your album as Slavic j 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:49.620
 but at all as up here 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:52.470
 until the c1 songs then until then 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.169
 until then it's our try goes until 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.879
 there then if you want to start that my 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:03:00.510
 songs in the right middle right 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:04.200
 put in there now so for 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.510
 start playing just take this is 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.639
 when he moves like these act 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:14.489
 started turning as automatically 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:17.489
 so you'll take this and just not 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:20.010
 so you can see that this concert at 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:25.470
 turn then now get back and 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:29.180
 this is something like that and it's okay 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.180
 start playing 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.760
 so what is that thinking
