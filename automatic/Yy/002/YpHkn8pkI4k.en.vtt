00:01:34.312 --> 00:01:38.062
 Pure Chile is your bluish sky, 

00:01:38.342 --> 00:01:41.078
 Pure breezes also cross you, 

00:01:42.311 --> 00:01:45.999
 And your embroidered flower field, 

00:01:46.297 --> 00:01:49.250
 It is the happy copy of Eden. 

00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:54.092
 Majestic is the white mountain, 

00:01:54.344 --> 00:01:57.812
 What the Lord gave you as a bulwark, 

00:01:58.313 --> 00:02:01.263
 What did the Lord give you as a bulwark? 

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:05.826
 And that calm sea bathes you, 

00:02:06.283 --> 00:02:09.627
 It promises you a future splendor. 

00:02:09.627 --> 00:02:13.560
 And that calm sea bathes you, 

00:02:13.811 --> 00:02:17.030
 It promises you a future splendor. 

00:02:18.616 --> 00:02:25.332
 Sweet Homeland, receive the votes 

00:02:26.627 --> 00:02:32.939
 With which Chile in your heart swore 

00:02:34.125 --> 00:02:37.562
 That or the grave you will be of the free ones, 

00:02:38.098 --> 00:02:41.081
 Or asylum against oppression. 

00:02:42.063 --> 00:02:45.813
 That or the grave you will be of the free ones, 

00:02:46.094 --> 00:02:48.641
 Or asylum against oppression. 

00:02:49.054 --> 00:02:53.583
 That or the grave you will be of the free ones, 

00:02:54.094 --> 00:02:57.000
 Or asylum against oppression. 

00:02:58.046 --> 00:03:01.063
 Or asylum against oppression. 

00:03:02.065 --> 00:03:04.984
 Or asylum against oppression.
