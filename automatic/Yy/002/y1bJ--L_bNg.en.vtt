 the same speech made before 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.090
 to fix the edges of the yellow cross the superior verbal is drugged 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.480
 of also to commute to move 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.429
 triangles 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.019
 in the top layer 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.259
 create an algorithm that mail 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:21.989
 he turned clockwise to a position he moved these here 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:26.079
 keeping this in mind 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.239
 algorithm was the following 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:32.329
 then time raitv inverter app 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.590
 read inverter app

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.700

 diet uu instinct was us tv constipation 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.420
 alan Balloon from what was said in the previous video we can 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.500
 alan 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.730
 apply the algorithm in an inverted way 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.860
 upside down 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.510
 to move always keep this move fixed in the sense 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.570
 counterclockwise 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.969
 mike clockwise also this thing cvt throw udine 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.840
 of course, it applies to me, we need to apply the bottom algorithm twice 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.190
 the with this operating system removed +2 time the algorithm 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.110
 the following algorithm though albeit 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.600
 surely you have understood there is a little truth tree tola you 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.010
 then 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.430
 appa 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.560
 Well

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.080

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.080
 happy inverter 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.079
 as I said the problem terracina oddio referente also in this case it 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.590
 We can 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.590
 some managers ref without we can instead 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.530
 learn the opposite algorithm 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.550
 not 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.540
 apply the specular algorithm always respecting this plan 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.559
 such 

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:16.719
 over time I have for the karaoke space companies remembered to apply 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.109
 the algorithm in mirror mode 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:22.799
 rather than learning to buy because he learned against new itunes movie 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.879
 learn a concluded you learn must looking like an algorithm 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.399
 to the new 

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:33.019
 other than a different day lg optimus dual in some way 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.159
 by practicing it you can easily get it so that you have a chance to do it 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.129
 and should not make a memory effort 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.129
 rather than it costs a ram 

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:47.489
 you have to 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.369
 make a little reasoning effort 

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:55.379
 thanks clearly if you want you saw ste dago rhythm in the mirror 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.549
 this piece remains fixed here 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.099
 let's say years mirror image this here must drink amp 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:07.060
 not left to right so if you want to decide, learn this algorithm 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.479
 specular rather than inverted mode 

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:11.450
 remember that this 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.739
 this one to stay here 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.950
 so the cube should be positioned so with the fixed angle you want to keep 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.459
 fixed to the right, kidnapped by the algorithm, you already know each other by mirror image 

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:26.490
 tam 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.780
 algorithms you know this here freehand 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.529
 was timbertech amp the claire water touch inverter

 earth inverter happybet 

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:44.379
 - specular bolton and this shifting of having lost green to remain closed 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:45.119
 here 

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:48.119
 because the following art in the heart alert 

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:52.119

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.159
 craig 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.959
 and these move 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.009
 an anti-clockwise sense
