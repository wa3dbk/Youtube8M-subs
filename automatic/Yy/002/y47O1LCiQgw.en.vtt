workshop of Howard piano industries and
we're<00:00:07.680> going<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:07.830> be<00:00:07.980> talking<00:00:08.340> today<00:00:08.550> about

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:09.710 
we're going to be talking today about

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.280 
we're going to be talking today about
inharmonicity<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:11.309> kale<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:11.790> it's<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.480> term

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
inharmonicity and kale and it's a term

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.150 
inharmonicity and kale and it's a term
we<00:00:13.320> use<00:00:13.469> in<00:00:13.830> tuning<00:00:14.280> what<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.360> does<00:00:15.570> is<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:16.160> kind

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
we use in tuning what it does is it kind

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.060 
we use in tuning what it does is it kind
of<00:00:17.310> describes<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.270> as<00:00:18.990> they<00:00:19.109> define<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.740> show

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
of describes and as they define and show

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.609 
of describes and as they define and show
you<00:00:20.160> what<00:00:20.310> inharmonicity<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.439> it's<00:00:22.439> going<00:00:22.560> to

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
you what inharmonicity is it's going to

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.800 
you what inharmonicity is it's going to
show<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:22.890> why<00:00:23.220> pianos<00:00:23.910> need<00:00:24.210> what<00:00:24.449> are<00:00:24.570> called

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
show you why pianos need what are called

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.140 
show you why pianos need what are called
what's<00:00:25.140> called<00:00:25.439> stretch<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.400> octaves<00:00:27.800> now

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
what's called stretch to the octaves now

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.479 
what's called stretch to the octaves now
we<00:00:30.150> talked<00:00:30.420> in<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.630> previous<00:00:31.019> video<00:00:31.199> about<00:00:31.710> what

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
we talked in a previous video about what

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.180 
we talked in a previous video about what
are<00:00:32.669> what<00:00:32.969> what<00:00:33.300> partials<00:00:33.899> are<00:00:34.190> they're

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
are what what partials are they're

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.389 
are what what partials are they're
basically<00:00:35.239> overtones<00:00:36.620> you<00:00:37.620> know<00:00:37.770> in<00:00:37.950> any

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
basically overtones you know in any

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.569 
basically overtones you know in any
single<00:00:38.910> piano<00:00:39.120> key<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.930> hear<00:00:40.430> that<00:00:41.430> are

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
single piano key that you hear that are

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.529 
single piano key that you hear that are
present<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.390> don't<00:00:42.540> necessarily<00:00:43.110> hear<00:00:43.320> them

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
present you don't necessarily hear them

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.270 
present you don't necessarily hear them
real<00:00:45.539> strongly<00:00:45.899> but<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.559> are<00:00:46.680> present

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
real strongly but to the are present

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.799 
real strongly but to the are present
present<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:47.940> any<00:00:48.260> tone<00:00:49.260> or<00:00:49.770> any<00:00:49.920> note<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.610> a

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
present in any tone or any note of a

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.350 
present in any tone or any note of a
certain<00:00:51.809> piano<00:00:52.110> key<00:00:52.440> or<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.370> piano

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
certain piano key or a piano

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.650 
certain piano key or a piano
so<00:00:55.250> what<00:00:56.250> inharmonicity<00:00:56.879> basically<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:59.660> if

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
so what inharmonicity basically is is if

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.290 
so what inharmonicity basically is is if
you<00:01:00.780> can<00:01:00.960> imagine<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.649> any<00:01:02.250> any<00:01:02.609> piano<00:01:02.910> wire

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
you can imagine that any any piano wire

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.830 
you can imagine that any any piano wire
or<00:01:03.570> piano<00:01:03.750> string<00:01:04.369> when<00:01:05.369> it's<00:01:05.519> played<00:01:05.850> those

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
or piano string when it's played those

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.830 
or piano string when it's played those
partials<00:01:07.530> are<00:01:07.950> present<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.150> string<00:01:09.720> and

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
partials are present in that string and

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.840 
partials are present in that string and
what<00:01:10.020> those<00:01:10.170> are<00:01:10.229> are<00:01:10.850> segments<00:01:11.930> which<00:01:12.930> are

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
what those are are segments which are

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.870 
what those are are segments which are
divisions<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.840> strings<00:01:16.229> for<00:01:16.470> example

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
divisions of that strings for example

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.640 
divisions of that strings for example
the<00:01:17.880> first<00:01:18.150> partial<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.900> going<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.170> be<00:01:19.320> half

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the first partial is going to be half

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.550 
the first partial is going to be half
the<00:01:20.009> length<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.549> string<00:01:21.049> the<00:01:22.049> second<00:01:22.409> the

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
the length of the string the second the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.910 
the length of the string the second the
third<00:01:22.590> partial<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.310> going<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.520> be<00:01:23.750> third<00:01:24.920> of

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
third partial is going to be third of

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.469 
third partial is going to be third of
the<00:01:26.130> length<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.610> string<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.180> forth

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
the length of the string and so forth

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.969 
the length of the string and so forth
what<00:01:28.409> happens<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:29.100> as<00:01:29.509> and<00:01:30.509> all<00:01:30.750> those<00:01:30.990> all

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
what happens is as and all those all

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.280 
what happens is as and all those all
those<00:01:32.040> partials<00:01:32.909> are<00:01:33.180> present<00:01:33.630> because<00:01:34.020> you

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
those partials are present because you

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.390 
those partials are present because you
get<00:01:35.479> vibrations<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:37.290> are<00:01:37.470> just<00:01:37.740> portions<00:01:38.250> of

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
get vibrations that are just portions of

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.340 
get vibrations that are just portions of
that<00:01:38.520> string<00:01:38.970> okay<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.869> creates

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
that string okay and that creates

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.600 
that string okay and that creates
whatever<00:01:40.619> what<00:01:40.860> what<00:01:41.159> those<00:01:41.400> are<00:01:41.579> called

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
whatever what what those are called

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.440 
whatever what what those are called
partials<00:01:42.299> or<00:01:42.509> overtones<00:01:44.240> you<00:01:45.240> know<00:01:45.299> what

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
partials or overtones you know what

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.990 
partials or overtones you know what
happens<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:46.280> because<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.460> length<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.880> that

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
happens is because the length of that

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.560 
happens is because the length of that
string<00:01:48.740> there<00:01:49.740> was<00:01:49.860> those<00:01:50.100> shorter<00:01:50.850> shorter

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
string there was those shorter shorter

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.789 
string there was those shorter shorter
segments<00:01:52.200> which<00:01:52.829> create<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.460> partials<00:01:54.799> are

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
segments which create the partials are

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.249 
segments which create the partials are
are<00:01:56.430> stiffer<00:01:57.180> because<00:01:57.659> if<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.899> can<00:01:58.049> imagine

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
are stiffer because if you can imagine

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.149 
are stiffer because if you can imagine
as<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.640> have<00:01:59.820> a<00:02:00.180> piano<00:02:00.659> wire<00:02:01.350> or<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.770> string

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
as you have a piano wire or a string

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.469 
as you have a piano wire or a string
that<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:04.140> same<00:02:04.530> thickness<00:02:05.479> throughout

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
that is the same thickness throughout

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.990 
that is the same thickness throughout
its<00:02:06.630> entire<00:02:06.960> length<00:02:07.290> as<00:02:07.649> those<00:02:08.340> segments<00:02:08.849> get

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
its entire length as those segments get

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.570 
its entire length as those segments get
shorter<00:02:09.479> they<00:02:10.289> get<00:02:10.440> stiffer<00:02:10.770> okay<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.459> what

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
shorter they get stiffer okay and what

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.300 
shorter they get stiffer okay and what
happens<00:02:11.970> is<00:02:12.180> because<00:02:12.690> they're<00:02:12.930> stiffer

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
happens is because they're stiffer

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.640 
happens is because they're stiffer
than<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:15.180> entire<00:02:15.390> length<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.290> actually

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
than the entire length it actually

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.940 
than the entire length it actually
raises<00:02:17.240> the<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.900> overtone<00:02:19.380> or<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.650> partial

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
raises the the overtone or the partial

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.020 
raises the the overtone or the partial
okay<00:02:20.490> so<00:02:20.550> for<00:02:21.090> example<00:02:21.510> we've<00:02:22.110> got<00:02:22.880> here<00:02:23.880> let

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
okay so for example we've got here let

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.030 
okay so for example we've got here let
me<00:02:24.090> just<00:02:24.150> show<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.510> an<00:02:24.660> example<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.740> you

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
me just show you an example and you you

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.630 
me just show you an example and you you
you<00:02:26.250> know<00:02:26.370> as<00:02:26.490> you<00:02:26.580> could<00:02:26.730> imagine<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:27.390> shorter

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
you know as you could imagine a shorter

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.000 
you know as you could imagine a shorter
segment<00:02:29.640> of<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.850> same<00:02:30.350> thickness<00:02:31.350> of<00:02:31.680> string

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
segment of the same thickness of string

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.770 
segment of the same thickness of string
is<00:02:32.160> going<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.370> be<00:02:32.490> stiffer<00:02:32.910> if<00:02:32.970> we<00:02:33.090> do<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.540> full

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
is going to be stiffer if we do the full

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.780 
is going to be stiffer if we do the full
length<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.860> can<00:02:35.040> see<00:02:35.370> that<00:02:36.380> kids<00:02:37.610> will<00:02:38.610> move

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
length you can see that kids will move

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.520 
length you can see that kids will move
fairly<00:02:39.060> quickly<00:02:39.330> but<00:02:39.540> if<00:02:39.660> we're<00:02:40.020> fairly

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
fairly quickly but if we're fairly

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.730 
fairly quickly but if we're fairly
easily<00:02:40.800> but<00:02:41.070> if<00:02:41.190> we<00:02:41.280> do<00:02:41.610> a<00:02:41.640> shorter<00:02:42.090> section

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
easily but if we do a shorter section

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.800 
easily but if we do a shorter section
okay<00:02:43.740> it<00:02:44.220> doesn't<00:02:44.430> want<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.790> doesn't<00:02:45.450> want<00:02:45.720> to

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
okay it doesn't want to doesn't want to

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.610 
okay it doesn't want to doesn't want to
move<00:02:46.050> so<00:02:46.320> it<00:02:46.470> so<00:02:46.620> yeah<00:02:46.890> you<00:02:46.950> know<00:02:47.210> general

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
move so it so yeah you know general

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.750 
move so it so yeah you know general
logic<00:02:49.620> would<00:02:49.950> tell<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.280> that<00:02:50.400> it's<00:02:50.550> going<00:02:50.700> to

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
logic would tell you that it's going to

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.870 
logic would tell you that it's going to
be<00:02:50.880> stiffer<00:02:51.390> if<00:02:51.600> it's<00:02:52.170> shorter<00:02:52.620> if<00:02:53.160> the

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
be stiffer if it's shorter if the

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.270 
be stiffer if it's shorter if the
diameter<00:02:54.180> is<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.600> same<00:02:54.630> so<00:02:55.140> for<00:02:55.350> example<00:02:55.770> we

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
diameter is the same so for example we

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.040 
diameter is the same so for example we
talked<00:02:56.490> about<00:02:56.640> here<00:02:57.300> we're<00:02:57.450> good<00:02:57.600> we<00:02:57.750> got<00:02:57.780> a

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
talked about here we're good we got a

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.640 
talked about here we're good we got a
three<00:02:59.180> okay<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.450> first<00:03:00.630> partial<00:03:01.260> is<00:03:01.380> or<00:03:01.530> the

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
three okay the first partial is or the

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.080 
three okay the first partial is or the
second<00:03:01.980> partial<00:03:02.190> is<00:03:02.400> going<00:03:02.520> to<00:03:02.580> be<00:03:02.700> an<00:03:02.790> octave

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
second partial is going to be an octave

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.900 
second partial is going to be an octave
higher<00:03:03.800> the<00:03:04.800> third<00:03:05.010> partial<00:03:05.310> is<00:03:05.550> going<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.790> be

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
higher the third partial is going to be

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.960 
higher the third partial is going to be
an<00:03:06.060> octave<00:03:06.360> and<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.570> fifth<00:03:07.490> okay<00:03:08.490> and<00:03:08.610> as<00:03:08.700> we<00:03:08.850> go

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
an octave and a fifth okay and as we go

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.140 
an octave and a fifth okay and as we go
higher<00:03:09.210> with<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.380> partials<00:03:10.860> those<00:03:11.730> are<00:03:11.970> going

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
higher with the partials those are going

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.550 
higher with the partials those are going
to<00:03:13.490> increasingly<00:03:14.490> be<00:03:14.610> a<00:03:15.180> little<00:03:15.780> bit<00:03:15.900> sharp<00:03:16.230> of

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
to increasingly be a little bit sharp of

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.680 
to increasingly be a little bit sharp of
what<00:03:17.750> theoretically<00:03:18.750> that<00:03:20.180> that<00:03:21.180> partial

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
what theoretically that that partial

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.780 
what theoretically that that partial
should<00:03:21.930> be<00:03:22.140> if<00:03:22.709> everything<00:03:23.070> were<00:03:23.430> in<00:03:23.730> a

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
should be if everything were in a

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.550 
should be if everything were in a
perfect<00:03:24.150> world<00:03:24.300> okay<00:03:24.840> but<00:03:25.020> because<00:03:25.350> of<00:03:25.470> that

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
perfect world okay but because of that

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.100 
perfect world okay but because of that
inharmonicity<00:03:26.190> which<00:03:27.120> is<00:03:27.300> created<00:03:27.870> by<00:03:28.050> the

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
inharmonicity which is created by the

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.560 
inharmonicity which is created by the
stiffness<00:03:28.910> and<00:03:29.910> what<00:03:30.090> happens<00:03:30.420> is<00:03:30.540> that

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
stiffness and what happens is that

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.020 
stiffness and what happens is that
stiffness<00:03:31.050> the<00:03:31.410> ends<00:03:31.800> don't<00:03:32.040> want<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:32.370> bend<00:03:32.580> as

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
stiffness the ends don't want to bend as

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.740 
stiffness the ends don't want to bend as
easily<00:03:33.980> which<00:03:34.980> causes<00:03:35.550> which<00:03:36.209> causes<00:03:36.630> the

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
easily which causes which causes the

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.040 
easily which causes which causes the
pitch<00:03:36.959> to<00:03:37.230> raise<00:03:37.430> raise<00:03:38.430> a<00:03:38.459> little<00:03:38.790> bit<00:03:39.060> the

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
pitch to raise raise a little bit the

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.650 
pitch to raise raise a little bit the
higher<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.530> partials<00:03:40.950> go<00:03:41.160> okay<00:03:42.150> so<00:03:42.209> that's

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
higher the partials go okay so that's

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.630 
higher the partials go okay so that's
that's<00:03:42.870> basically<00:03:43.110> what<00:03:43.680> what<00:03:43.980> inharmonicity

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
that's basically what what inharmonicity

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.449 
that's basically what what inharmonicity
is<00:03:45.150> okay<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:45.990> what<00:03:46.350> that<00:03:46.530> what<00:03:46.860> that<00:03:46.890> does<00:03:47.040> is

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
is okay and what that what that does is

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.870 
is okay and what that what that does is
weak<00:03:47.670> as<00:03:47.880> we<00:03:48.030> get<00:03:48.180> higher<00:03:49.520> partials<00:03:50.520> are<00:03:50.670> going

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
weak as we get higher partials are going

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.270 
weak as we get higher partials are going
to<00:03:51.090> be<00:03:51.240> higher<00:03:51.420> so<00:03:51.720> for<00:03:52.020> example<00:03:52.410> if<00:03:52.500> we<00:03:52.680> we

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
to be higher so for example if we we

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.670 
to be higher so for example if we we
know<00:03:53.430> that<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:54.030> we've<00:03:54.600> got<00:03:54.810> partials<00:03:55.290> all<00:03:55.500> the

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
know that the we've got partials all the

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.600 
know that the we've got partials all the
way<00:03:55.800> up<00:03:55.950> here<00:03:56.720> okay<00:03:57.720> maybe<00:03:57.900> on<00:03:58.140> a<00:03:58.170> six<00:03:58.740> and<00:03:59.459> a

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
way up here okay maybe on a six and a

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.980 
way up here okay maybe on a six and a
seven

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.670 

we<00:04:03.990> got<00:04:04.110> parcels<00:04:04.880> in<00:04:05.880> this<00:04:06.150> note<00:04:06.510> of<00:04:06.840> those

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
we got parcels in this note of those

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.470 
we got parcels in this note of those
notes<00:04:08.040> okay<00:04:08.459> and<00:04:08.580> if<00:04:08.640> by<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:08.850> time<00:04:09.060> we<00:04:09.209> get<00:04:09.330> up

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
notes okay and if by the time we get up

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.280 
notes okay and if by the time we get up
here<00:04:09.510> these<00:04:10.410> are<00:04:10.709> you<00:04:11.160> know<00:04:11.280> 15<00:04:11.910> 20<00:04:12.330> 30<00:04:12.360> cents

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
here these are you know 15 20 30 cents

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.240 
here these are you know 15 20 30 cents
sharp<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:15.510> partials<00:04:16.020> for<00:04:16.290> this<00:04:16.440> note<00:04:16.709> we<00:04:17.070> have

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
sharp the partials for this note we have

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.070 
sharp the partials for this note we have
to<00:04:17.400> tune<00:04:17.609> those<00:04:17.910> notes<00:04:18.239> that<00:04:18.570> many<00:04:18.720> cents

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
to tune those notes that many cents

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.330 
to tune those notes that many cents
sharp<00:04:19.440> so<00:04:20.130> that<00:04:20.160> it<00:04:20.459> matches<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:22.340> partials

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
sharp so that it matches the partials

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.640 
sharp so that it matches the partials
for<00:04:23.729> for<00:04:24.240> this<00:04:24.419> note<00:04:24.660> all<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:24.990> way<00:04:25.110> down<00:04:25.290> here

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
for for this note all the way down here

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.590 
for for this note all the way down here
in<00:04:25.800> case

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
in case

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.470 
in case
so<00:04:27.600> basically<00:04:28.380> we<00:04:28.590> have<00:04:28.710> to<00:04:28.740> tune<00:04:29.480> gradually

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
so basically we have to tune gradually

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.140 
so basically we have to tune gradually
sharper<00:04:31.110> you<00:04:31.560> know<00:04:32.220> for<00:04:32.520> we<00:04:32.669> will<00:04:33.030> usually

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
sharper you know for we will usually

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.980 
sharper you know for we will usually
start<00:04:33.540> at<00:04:33.690> a<00:04:33.840> four<00:04:34.230> as<00:04:34.730> as<00:04:35.730> zero<00:04:36.510> cents

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
start at a four as as zero cents

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.310 
start at a four as as zero cents
sharper<00:04:37.560> flat<00:04:37.800> from<00:04:38.220> from<00:04:39.060> where<00:04:39.960> it<00:04:40.080> should

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
sharper flat from from where it should

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.610 
sharper flat from from where it should
be<00:04:40.350> but<00:04:40.680> as<00:04:41.220> we<00:04:41.400> get<00:04:41.580> higher<00:04:41.760> from<00:04:42.180> there

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
be but as we get higher from there

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.180 
be but as we get higher from there
though<00:04:43.620> we<00:04:44.220> have<00:04:44.370> to<00:04:44.520> stretch<00:04:44.910> the<00:04:46.130> stretch<00:04:47.130> to

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
though we have to stretch the stretch to

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.030 
though we have to stretch the stretch to
the<00:04:47.669> pitch<00:04:47.910> a<00:04:48.210> little<00:04:48.690> bit<00:04:49.050> higher<00:04:49.380> to<00:04:49.830> match

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
the pitch a little bit higher to match

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.240 
the pitch a little bit higher to match
those<00:04:50.370> overtones<00:04:51.120> or<00:04:51.419> those<00:04:51.630> partials<00:04:52.250> that

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
those overtones or those partials that

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.950 
those overtones or those partials that
are<00:04:53.370> know<00:04:53.490> in<00:04:53.700> the<00:04:53.790> notes<00:04:54.030> below<00:04:54.360> them<00:04:54.570> okay

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
are know in the notes below them okay

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.560 
are know in the notes below them okay
and<00:04:55.050> as<00:04:55.139> we<00:04:55.290> go<00:04:55.410> down<00:04:55.820> below<00:04:56.820> this<00:04:57.180> okay

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
and as we go down below this okay

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.920 
and as we go down below this okay
obviously<00:04:57.720> the<00:04:58.350> the<00:04:59.130> the<00:04:59.820> stretch<00:05:00.150> has<00:05:00.540> to<00:05:00.750> go

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
obviously the the the stretch has to go

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.640 
obviously the the the stretch has to go
lower<00:05:01.500> okay<00:05:01.979> because<00:05:02.600> you<00:05:03.600> know<00:05:03.720> basically

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
lower okay because you know basically

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.670 
lower okay because you know basically
unless<00:05:04.979> we<00:05:05.190> started<00:05:05.550> at<00:05:05.669> eight<00:05:05.790> zero<00:05:06.600> okay<00:05:07.169> but

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
unless we started at eight zero okay but

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.110 
unless we started at eight zero okay but
we<00:05:07.830> don't<00:05:08.010> we<00:05:08.190> start<00:05:08.400> at<00:05:08.520> eight<00:05:08.639> four<00:05:08.880> but<00:05:09.030> if

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
we don't we start at eight four but if

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.110 
we don't we start at eight four but if
we<00:05:09.210> started<00:05:09.510> at<00:05:09.600> a<00:05:09.720> zero<00:05:10.139> at<00:05:10.770> being<00:05:11.070> at<00:05:11.490> pitch

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
we started at a zero at being at pitch

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.940 
we started at a zero at being at pitch
okay<00:05:12.419> then<00:05:12.630> we'd<00:05:12.810> have<00:05:12.960> to<00:05:13.110> gradually<00:05:13.680> get

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
okay then we'd have to gradually get

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.940 
okay then we'd have to gradually get
higher<00:05:14.190> but<00:05:14.750> that's<00:05:15.750> not<00:05:16.020> real<00:05:16.200> practical<00:05:16.410> so

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
higher but that's not real practical so

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.240 
higher but that's not real practical so
we<00:05:17.070> start<00:05:17.580> with<00:05:17.700> a<00:05:17.820> four<00:05:18.150> okay<00:05:18.750> and<00:05:19.080> so<00:05:19.830> so

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
we start with a four okay and so so

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.640 
we start with a four okay and so so
gradually<00:05:20.790> as<00:05:20.880> we<00:05:20.910> go<00:05:21.120> down<00:05:21.389> to<00:05:22.229> a<00:05:22.260> lesser

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
gradually as we go down to a lesser

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.230 
gradually as we go down to a lesser
degree<00:05:22.680> it's<00:05:23.160> not<00:05:23.310> we<00:05:23.430> don't<00:05:23.550> stretch<00:05:23.940> the

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
degree it's not we don't stretch the

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.629 
degree it's not we don't stretch the
base<00:05:24.450> and<00:05:24.960> the<00:05:25.050> lower<00:05:25.680> end<00:05:25.919> of<00:05:26.070> the<00:05:26.130> section<00:05:26.370> is

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
base and the lower end of the section is

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:29.390 
base and the lower end of the section is
of<00:05:26.970> the<00:05:27.120> piano<00:05:27.419> as<00:05:27.690> much<00:05:27.930> as<00:05:28.110> we<00:05:28.260> do<00:05:28.440> the<00:05:29.100> upper

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
of the piano as much as we do the upper

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.380 
of the piano as much as we do the upper
end<00:05:29.580> okay<00:05:30.090> so<00:05:30.710> the<00:05:31.710> other<00:05:31.830> thing<00:05:32.130> is<00:05:32.310> it<00:05:33.090> also

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
end okay so the other thing is it also

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.060 
end okay so the other thing is it also
depends<00:05:33.990> the<00:05:34.110> snow<00:05:34.289> the<00:05:34.560> amount<00:05:34.710> of<00:05:34.830> stretch

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
depends the snow the amount of stretch

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.159 
depends the snow the amount of stretch
is<00:05:35.250> going<00:05:35.400> to<00:05:35.460> depend<00:05:35.729> on<00:05:35.910> the<00:05:36.539> size<00:05:36.750> and<00:05:36.810> the

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
is going to depend on the size and the

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.159 
is going to depend on the size and the
model<00:05:37.530> and<00:05:37.710> scaling<00:05:38.610> of<00:05:38.789> of<00:05:39.240> each<00:05:39.479> individual

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
model and scaling of of each individual

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:44.240

piano<00:05:40.440> and<00:05:40.650> in<00:05:40.890> general<00:05:41.930> the<00:05:42.930> taller<00:05:43.860> or

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
piano and in general the taller or

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
longer the piano is longer in a grand

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.409 
longer the piano is longer in a grand
piano<00:05:48.720> tall<00:05:49.169> or<00:05:49.350> in<00:05:49.440> an<00:05:49.530> upright<00:05:49.890> piano<00:05:50.419> the

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
piano tall or in an upright piano the

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.960 
piano tall or in an upright piano the
less<00:05:51.630> inharmonicity<00:05:52.500> you<00:05:52.860> have<00:05:53.070> okay<00:05:53.729> and<00:05:53.910> the

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
less inharmonicity you have okay and the

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.240 
less inharmonicity you have okay and the
reason<00:05:54.150> for<00:05:54.510> that<00:05:54.570> is<00:05:54.900> okay<00:05:55.770> if<00:05:55.830> we<00:05:55.950> look<00:05:56.100> over

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
reason for that is okay if we look over

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.340 
reason for that is okay if we look over
here<00:05:56.400> at<00:05:56.580> the<00:05:56.729> bass<00:05:56.910> strings<00:05:57.240> okay<00:05:57.870> as<00:05:58.139> you

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
here at the bass strings okay as you

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.779 
here at the bass strings okay as you
know<00:05:58.560> as<00:05:58.710> you're<00:05:58.860> probably<00:05:59.010> familiar<00:05:59.490> with

00:05:59.779 --> 00:05:59.789 
know as you're probably familiar with

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:02.210 
know as you're probably familiar with
bass<00:06:00.630> strings<00:06:01.020> they're<00:06:01.289> round<00:06:01.590> with<00:06:01.830> wound

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
bass strings they're round with wound

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.230 
bass strings they're round with wound
with<00:06:02.490> copper<00:06:03.150> windings<00:06:03.660> okay<00:06:04.320> and<00:06:04.910> the<00:06:05.910> reason

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
with copper windings okay and the reason

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.330 
with copper windings okay and the reason
for<00:06:06.570> that<00:06:06.630> is<00:06:07.080> because<00:06:07.590> you<00:06:07.830> have<00:06:07.979> to<00:06:08.160> be<00:06:08.280> able

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
for that is because you have to be able

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.540 
for that is because you have to be able
to<00:06:08.490> get<00:06:08.610> the<00:06:08.760> lower<00:06:08.940> pitches<00:06:09.330> and

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
to get the lower pitches and

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.180 
to get the lower pitches and
theoretically<00:06:11.550> to<00:06:12.360> keep<00:06:12.600> thinner<00:06:13.560> wire<00:06:13.889> on

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
theoretically to keep thinner wire on

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.440 
theoretically to keep thinner wire on
the<00:06:14.310> bass<00:06:14.460> strings<00:06:14.820> you'd<00:06:15.000> have<00:06:15.180> to<00:06:15.330> have

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:15.450 
the bass strings you'd have to have

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.450 
the bass strings you'd have to have
really<00:06:16.080> really<00:06:16.110> really<00:06:16.530> long<00:06:16.830> bass<00:06:17.130> strings

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
really really really long bass strings

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.790 
really really really long bass strings
so<00:06:17.700> they<00:06:18.330> they<00:06:18.720> wrap<00:06:18.960> those<00:06:19.200> with<00:06:19.440> copper

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
so they they wrap those with copper

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.770 
so they they wrap those with copper
windings<00:06:20.280> to<00:06:20.490> make<00:06:20.669> them<00:06:20.789> thicker<00:06:21.120> so<00:06:21.750> that

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
windings to make them thicker so that

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.240 
windings to make them thicker so that
they<00:06:22.110> can<00:06:22.350> get<00:06:23.070> the<00:06:24.000> lower<00:06:24.210> pitch<00:06:25.250> without

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
they can get the lower pitch without

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.430 
they can get the lower pitch without
having<00:06:26.700> to<00:06:26.789> make<00:06:26.940> the<00:06:27.090> strings<00:06:27.440> enormously

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
having to make the strings enormously

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.029 
having to make the strings enormously
long<00:06:28.860> so<00:06:30.169> so<00:06:31.169> as<00:06:31.260> you<00:06:31.380> can<00:06:31.530> imagine<00:06:31.590> a

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 
long so so as you can imagine a

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:35.240 
long so so as you can imagine a
nine-foot<00:06:32.550> concert<00:06:33.030> grand<00:06:33.300> piano<00:06:33.919> it's<00:06:34.919> not

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.250 
nine-foot concert grand piano it's not

the way down here at a zero and and in

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:39.559 
the way down here at a zero and and in
this

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:39.569 
this

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:42.109 
this
bass<00:06:39.719> section<00:06:40.020> as<00:06:40.409> it<00:06:41.039> does<00:06:41.219> on<00:06:41.429> like<00:06:41.909> for

bass section as it does on like for

00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:44.629 
bass section as it does on like for
example<00:06:42.210> this<00:06:42.629> console<00:06:43.020> pianore<00:06:43.499> nor<00:06:44.039> a<00:06:44.099> baby

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 
example this console pianore nor a baby

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:46.809 
example this console pianore nor a baby
grand<00:06:44.969> piano<00:06:45.270> that's<00:06:45.509> only<00:06:45.629> five<00:06:45.929> feet<00:06:46.110> long

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:46.819 
grand piano that's only five feet long

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:51.290 
grand piano that's only five feet long
so<00:06:47.819> so<00:06:48.629> that's<00:06:48.839> why<00:06:49.909> you've<00:06:50.909> got<00:06:51.059> less

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300 
so so that's why you've got less

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.419 
so so that's why you've got less
inharmonicity<00:06:51.929> and<00:06:52.319> a<00:06:52.379> taller<00:06:52.679> or<00:06:53.369> longer

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:53.429 
inharmonicity and a taller or longer

00:06:53.429 --> 00:06:56.419 
inharmonicity and a taller or longer
piano<00:06:54.059> and<00:06:54.149> that's<00:06:54.240> why<00:06:54.449> the<00:06:54.509> bass<00:06:54.860> sounds<00:06:55.860> so

00:06:56.419 --> 00:06:56.429 
piano and that's why the bass sounds so

00:06:56.429 --> 00:07:00.769 
piano and that's why the bass sounds so
much<00:06:56.550> better<00:06:58.580> no<00:06:59.580> longer<00:06:59.969> or<00:07:00.089> taller<00:07:00.389> piano

00:07:00.769 --> 00:07:00.779 
much better no longer or taller piano

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:04.839 
much better no longer or taller piano
than<00:07:01.050> it<00:07:01.169> does<00:07:01.409> on<00:07:01.679> a<00:07:02.249> shorter<00:07:02.990> or<00:07:03.990> not<00:07:04.409> as<00:07:04.559> long

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:04.849 
than it does on a shorter or not as long

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:08.329 
than it does on a shorter or not as long
piano<00:07:05.849> so<00:07:06.240> so<00:07:07.169> that's<00:07:07.289> you<00:07:07.649> know<00:07:07.740> some<00:07:07.979> general
