on saturday to win or lose the game can

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.920 
on saturday to win or lose the game can
you<00:01:23.460> count<00:01:23.670> on<00:01:23.759> your<00:01:23.880> body<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.360> that's<00:01:24.780> where

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
you count on your body and that's where

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.420 
you count on your body and that's where
that<00:01:24.990> team<00:01:25.200> chemistry<00:01:25.409> really<00:01:25.890> comes<00:01:26.100> forth

that team chemistry really comes forth

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.649 
that team chemistry really comes forth
and<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.850> think<00:01:27.060> that's<00:01:27.210> something<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.509> we

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
and I think that's something that we

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.569 
and I think that's something that we
really<00:01:27.689> excel<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.710> game<00:01:28.920> days<00:01:29.189> when<00:01:29.490> they

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
really excel it on game days when they

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.490 
really excel it on game days when they
come<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.909> support<00:01:30.210> at<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.450> games<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.200> think

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
come to support at the games and I think

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
come to support at the games and I think
they<00:01:31.619> just<00:01:31.650> really<00:01:32.009> create<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.460> atmosphere

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
they just really create that atmosphere

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.310 
they just really create that atmosphere
