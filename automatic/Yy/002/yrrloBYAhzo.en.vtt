00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:23.680
 Violet is a story full of thousand 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:26.800
 stuff full of comedy drama music 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.300
 a story that tells the life of a 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.250
 girl who returns to live in Argentina 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.070
 with his dad after being many years 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.140
 living abroad she does not 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.880
 he knows but when he returns to buenos aires 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.720
 it's going to change your life totally 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.840
 because he's going to meet new friends on 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.239
 I think love is the most important 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.699
 passion for music almost without wanting 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.220
 end immersed in a world full of 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:54.580
 music surrounded by the friend is found 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.020
 a place where she feels comfortable and 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:00.730
 he feels free with respect to music 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:03.610
 leonés a character with strong character 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:07.900
 very honest but being very honest 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:11.369
 can be arrogant and pedantic to me 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.369
 but he has more musical ear than you 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.140
 It is comprehensive and fair but it would come 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.880
 being the bad guy in the story look 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.450
 is in the studio with violet 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.560
 that would come to be the bad one and there are some 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.810
 evils that if you do them on purpose 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.939
 but how is it directed towards humor 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:32.229
 it's like a mischief 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:34.450
 he is a bad character but comic with 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.649
 crumb without brain or talent or glamor 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:41.229
 outside my character is called andrés is a 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:44.740
 boy that although as belonging to the 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:48.640
 side of the bad guys of a sensitivity and 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:52.810
 have a child thing 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.300
 where out there he responds in that way very 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.050
 childish 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:01.460
 It is usually hanging by the 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:05.010
 health clouds 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.500
 Concentrate matters my character in to you 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:11.430
 I am the friend of the thousand to look at the 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.890
 bad i am the one who does all the 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.380
 plans that you are already thinking in your head 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.960
 is the one that takes them to action in my 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.880
 character is already a bracco is I can I 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.460
 say that it is quite positive because 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.640
 is always as good wave is put 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:30.000
 happy is good because it has enough 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.760
 friends always try to help not to do 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.290
 maldades he likes to dance music 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.150
 also because when he listens to music 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.320
 he can not stop he starts dancing 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.630
 Napoleon is a good boy is a good 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.390
 boy but maybe it's a bit pretty 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.920
 insecure and this leads to showing 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.500
 superb 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.989
 I do not know how as medium and safe to 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.910
 the others then try to demonstrate 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.770
 that can and all the time like that if 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.840
 has to go to shock goes to shock and 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.420
 this is sometimes confused with evil or 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.230
 with arrogance I will write you my 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:07.020
 Broadway character as very similar 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.880
 with me is a Brazilian who comes to the 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.209
 history 21 invites those of Gregory and 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.700
 at the beginning to help the guys like 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:18.440
 dance themes but with passing many 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.440
 things because brody has many secrets 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.950
 ah 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.560
 to 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.340
 ah 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.630
 and music is fundamental is the way 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.840
 in which we express ourselves 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.060
 constantly be a revelation against 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.860
 teachers to tell a story of 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.870
 love tell a story of friendship all 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.160
 what can not be counted on images 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.160
 they finish it with all the musicians 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.860
 I think violet 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.330
 will like it in general because it is 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:01.670
 entertaining has everything has dance has 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:06.910
 singing has very funny characters 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:11.690
 It has to be interesting, loves, desamors 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:15.250
 conflict is very complete not what 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.250
 loses violet from on disney channel
