for<00:02:32.019> until<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:33.310> LED<00:02:34.269> stops<00:02:34.900> working<00:02:35.230> it<00:02:35.829> means

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
for until the LED stops working it means

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.280 
for until the LED stops working it means
that<00:02:36.519> there's<00:02:36.670> 3<00:02:36.939> volts<00:02:37.329> or<00:02:37.510> less<00:02:37.540> on<00:02:38.230> the

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
that there's 3 volts or less on the

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.229 
that there's 3 volts or less on the
capacitors<00:02:39.189> at<00:02:39.340> which<00:02:39.430> point<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:39.760> charge<00:02:40.090> it

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
capacitors at which point you charge it

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.789 
capacitors at which point you charge it
again<00:02:40.299> all<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:40.659> takes<00:02:40.810> about<00:02:40.930> 15<00:02:41.200> 20<00:02:41.620> minutes

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
again all it takes about 15 20 minutes

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.330 
again all it takes about 15 20 minutes
so<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.760> initial<00:02:43.090> charge<00:02:43.299> takes<00:02:43.569> a<00:02:43.689> while

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
so the initial charge takes a while

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.619 
so the initial charge takes a while
anyway<00:02:45.340> so<00:02:45.400> what<00:02:45.760> I'll<00:02:45.849> do<00:02:45.970> is<00:02:46.090> I<00:02:46.239> will<00:02:46.390> stop

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
anyway so what I'll do is I will stop

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.000 
anyway so what I'll do is I will stop
the<00:02:46.720> video<00:02:46.959> and<00:02:47.200> I<00:02:47.620> will<00:02:47.739> give<00:02:47.859> you<00:02:47.950> a

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
for a few dollars more or as a kit I'll

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.069 
for a few dollars more or as a kit I'll
be<00:04:11.769> making<00:04:12.069> an<00:04:12.159> assembly<00:04:12.579> video<00:04:12.699> anyway<00:04:13.659> so

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
be making an assembly video anyway so

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.620 
be making an assembly video anyway so
what<00:04:14.229> I'll<00:04:14.319> do<00:04:14.500> is<00:04:14.739> I<00:04:15.099> will<00:04:15.299> fast<00:04:16.299> forward

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
what I'll do is I will fast forward

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.949 
what I'll do is I will fast forward
ahead<00:04:16.810> and<00:04:17.699> when<00:04:18.699> this<00:04:18.880> gets<00:04:19.090> to<00:04:19.269> the<00:04:19.299> area<00:04:19.750> the

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
ahead and when this gets to the area the

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.879 
ahead and when this gets to the area the
the<00:04:19.989> knife<00:04:20.620> the<00:04:21.549> end<00:04:21.909> charge<00:04:22.330> time<00:04:22.630> I'll<00:04:22.889> start

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
the knife the end charge time I'll start

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.640 
the knife the end charge time I'll start
the<00:04:23.979> video<00:04:24.070> again<00:04:24.280> and<00:04:24.610> we<00:04:24.940> can<00:04:25.060> watch<00:04:25.270> it<00:04:25.650> turn

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
the video again and we can watch it turn

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.899 
the video again and we can watch it turn
off<00:04:27.389> we're<00:04:28.389> almost<00:04:28.510> there<00:04:28.990> and<00:04:29.849> what<00:04:30.849> will

00:04:30.899 --> 00:04:30.909 
off we're almost there and what will

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:32.340 
off we're almost there and what will
happen<00:04:31.270> is<00:04:31.389> when<00:04:31.599> it<00:04:31.750> reaches<00:04:32.080> the

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
happen is when it reaches the

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.930 
happen is when it reaches the
voltage<00:04:32.590> you'll<00:04:33.040> hear<00:04:33.190> the<00:04:33.310> relay<00:04:33.550> click<00:04:33.760> off

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
voltage you'll hear the relay click off

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.020 
voltage you'll hear the relay click off
and<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:35.020> red<00:04:35.230> LED<00:04:35.350> will<00:04:36.310> continue<00:04:36.700> to<00:04:36.820> blink

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
and the red LED will continue to blink

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.720 
and the red LED will continue to blink
as<00:04:37.240> an<00:04:37.930> indicator<00:04:38.320> it<00:04:39.160> will<00:04:39.310> not<00:04:39.460> stop

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
as an indicator it will not stop

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.770 
as an indicator it will not stop
blinking<00:04:39.910> until<00:04:40.330> you<00:04:40.420> remove<00:04:40.720> power<00:04:42.780> again

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
blinking until you remove power again

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.870 
blinking until you remove power again
there<00:04:43.990> will<00:04:44.080> be<00:04:44.140> no<00:04:44.230> back<00:04:44.590> powering<00:04:45.070> from<00:04:45.790> the

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
there will be no back powering from the

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.700 
there will be no back powering from the
capacitors<00:04:46.390> to<00:04:46.600> the<00:04:46.690> circuit<00:04:47.080> it<00:04:47.410> will<00:04:47.590> be

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
capacitors to the circuit it will be

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.410 
capacitors to the circuit it will be
completely<00:04:48.190> isolated<00:04:48.340> once<00:04:48.850> the<00:04:48.940> relay<00:04:49.180> turns

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.420 
completely isolated once the relay turns

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.020 
completely isolated once the relay turns
off<00:04:49.740> so<00:04:50.740> you<00:04:50.800> can<00:04:50.950> count<00:04:51.190> on<00:04:51.370> the<00:04:51.550> capacitor

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
off so you can count on the capacitor

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.650 
off so you can count on the capacitor
staying<00:04:52.330> charged<00:04:52.950> there<00:04:53.950> we<00:04:54.070> go<00:04:54.360> five<00:04:55.360> point

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
staying charged there we go five point

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.780 
staying charged there we go five point
three<00:04:55.720> three<00:04:56.080> volts<00:04:56.410> the<00:04:56.860> bank<00:04:57.130> can<00:04:57.430> handle

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
three three volts the bank can handle

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.980 
three three volts the bank can handle
being<00:04:58.660> charged<00:04:59.020> to<00:04:59.140> five<00:04:59.500> point<00:04:59.800> four<00:05:00.010> volts

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
being charged to five point four volts

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:07.020 
being charged to five point four volts
so<00:05:01.990> now<00:05:02.140> we<00:05:03.070> can<00:05:03.220> remove<00:05:03.400> power<00:05:05.610> we<00:05:06.610> didn't

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
so now we can remove power we didn't

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.730 
so now we can remove power we didn't
even<00:05:07.180> have<00:05:07.300> to<00:05:07.540> remove<00:05:07.780> power<00:05:07.990> to<00:05:08.230> turn<00:05:08.410> on<00:05:08.560> our

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
even have to remove power to turn on our

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.040 
even have to remove power to turn on our
flashlight

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
flashlight

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.640 
flashlight
let's<00:05:11.050> saturate<00:05:11.560> our<00:05:11.680> camera<00:05:12.070> sensor<00:05:13.650> that's

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
let's saturate our camera sensor that's

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.420 
let's saturate our camera sensor that's
bright<00:05:16.380> let's<00:05:17.380> just<00:05:17.590> quickly<00:05:17.770> turn<00:05:18.100> off<00:05:18.280> the

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
bright let's just quickly turn off the

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.320 
bright let's just quickly turn off the
lights

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:27.030 

anyhow<00:05:23.910> that<00:05:24.910> should<00:05:25.240> stay<00:05:25.480> on<00:05:25.510> for<00:05:26.080> about

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
anyhow that should stay on for about

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.740 
anyhow that should stay on for about
thirty<00:05:27.400> thirty<00:05:27.730> minutes<00:05:28.000> to<00:05:28.030> 45<00:05:28.270> minutes

thirty thirty minutes to 45 minutes
non-stop<00:05:30.000> again<00:05:31.000> what<00:05:31.180> makes<00:05:31.300> this<00:05:31.570> appealing

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
non-stop again what makes this appealing

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.690 
non-stop again what makes this appealing
is<00:05:32.140> the<00:05:32.260> fact<00:05:32.470> that<00:05:32.590> capacitors<00:05:33.220> have<00:05:33.370> treated

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
is the fact that capacitors have treated

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.380 
is the fact that capacitors have treated
well<00:05:34.020> well<00:05:35.020> outlive<00:05:35.950> us<00:05:35.980> all<00:05:36.210> that's<00:05:37.210> what

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
well well outlive us all that's what

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.260 
well well outlive us all that's what
makes<00:05:37.540> it<00:05:37.690> special<00:05:37.890> so<00:05:38.890> you<00:05:39.880> build<00:05:40.090> this

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
makes it special so you build this
