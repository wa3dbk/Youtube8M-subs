00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439

the<00:01:37.560> World<00:01:37.740> Cup<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.220> mean<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.909> long<00:01:39.270> shot

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
the World Cup I mean that is a long shot

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.899 
the World Cup I mean that is a long shot
still<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.770> still<00:01:41.159> quite<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> bit<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.790> a

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
still and it is still quite a bit of a

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.130 
still and it is still quite a bit of a
waste<00:01:42.090> from<00:01:42.509> from<00:01:42.960> now<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:44.340> can't<00:01:44.820> really

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
waste from from now so I can't really

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.380 
waste from from now so I can't really
say<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.320> back<00:01:46.829> them<00:01:47.040> right<00:01:47.189> now<00:01:47.310> to

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
say that I back them right now to

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.609 
say that I back them right now to

that's being a bit generous no

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.980 
that's being a bit generous no
disrespect<00:02:20.910> them<00:02:21.150> obviously<00:02:21.300> but<00:02:21.690> they<00:02:21.780> just

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
lightweight teams in Europe so I don't

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.930 
lightweight teams in Europe so I don't
see<00:02:55.560> them<00:02:55.709> coming<00:02:55.950> up<00:02:56.160> against<00:02:56.520> a<00:02:56.610> strong

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
see them coming up against a strong

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.290 
see them coming up against a strong
favourite<00:02:57.540> like<00:02:57.690> Croatia<00:02:58.020> and<00:02:59.180> walking<00:03:00.180> away

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
favourite like Croatia and walking away

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.530 
favourite like Croatia and walking away
with<00:03:00.630> a<00:03:00.780> win<00:03:00.900> so<00:03:01.380> for<00:03:02.100> me<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.730> way<00:03:02.910> I<00:03:02.940> would<00:03:03.390> go

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
with a win so for me the way I would go

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.840 
with a win so for me the way I would go
with<00:03:03.570> this<00:03:03.810> match<00:03:04.080> is<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:05.100> back<00:03:05.280> Croatia<00:03:05.670> to

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
with this match is to back Croatia to

with this match is to back Croatia to
the<00:03:06.060> win<00:03:06.500> obviously<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.709> favorite<00:03:08.100> so<00:03:08.250> if

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
the win obviously the favorite so if

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.470 
the win obviously the favorite so if
you'd<00:03:08.430> like<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.730> make<00:03:08.850> a<00:03:08.910> little<00:03:09.209> bit<00:03:09.330> more
