for a number of reasons the concept of
inflatable<00:01:00.160> board<00:01:00.340> is<00:01:00.520> great<00:01:00.760> this<00:01:00.940> is<00:01:01.000> the

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
inflatable board is great this is the

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.430 
inflatable board is great this is the
board<00:01:01.330> that<00:01:01.360> you<00:01:01.480> can<00:01:01.660> roll<00:01:01.870> up<00:01:02.020> and<00:01:02.140> put<00:01:02.290> in<00:01:02.380> a

River panel on some exotic lake
somewhere<00:01:11.740> in<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:11.950> world<00:01:12.070> so<00:01:12.580> they're<00:01:12.700> really

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
somewhere in the world so they're really

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.550 
somewhere in the world so they're really
really<00:01:13.060> great<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.720> problem<00:01:14.020> was<00:01:14.110> inflatable

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
really great the problem was inflatable

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.440 
really great the problem was inflatable
boards<00:01:14.860> is<00:01:15.100> that<00:01:15.220> they<00:01:15.340> bend<00:01:15.580> when<00:01:16.180> you<00:01:16.240> pump

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
boards is that they bend when you pump

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.420 
boards is that they bend when you pump
them<00:01:16.630> up<00:01:16.750> to<00:01:17.470> things<00:01:17.710> that<00:01:17.740> happen<00:01:18.130> as<00:01:18.220> one<00:01:18.340> is

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
them up to things that happen as one is

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.890 
them up to things that happen as one is
the<00:01:18.580> board<00:01:18.790> bends<00:01:19.060> which<00:01:19.360> means<00:01:19.600> that<00:01:19.660> you<00:01:19.810> get

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
the board bends which means that you get

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.359 
the board bends which means that you get
wet<00:01:20.110> feet<00:01:20.350> so<00:01:20.500> you<00:01:20.560> have<00:01:20.710> water<00:01:20.890> sloshing

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
wet feet so you have water sloshing

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.040 
wet feet so you have water sloshing
around<00:01:21.460> your<00:01:21.729> feet<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:22.540> other<00:01:22.660> problem<00:01:22.810> is

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
around your feet the other problem is

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.300 
around your feet the other problem is
that<00:01:23.110> you<00:01:23.290> shorten<00:01:23.619> up<00:01:23.649> the<00:01:23.740> water<00:01:23.979> line<00:01:24.160> of

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
that you shorten up the water line of

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.609 
that you shorten up the water line of
the<00:01:24.369> board<00:01:24.610> which<00:01:24.850> makes<00:01:25.030> a<00:01:25.149> flower<00:01:25.390> water<00:01:25.720> so

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
the board which makes a flower water so

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.170 
the board which makes a flower water so
while<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:26.830> concept<00:01:27.340> of<00:01:27.430> inflatable<00:01:27.910> boards

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
while the concept of inflatable boards

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.060 
while the concept of inflatable boards
is<00:01:28.300> great<00:01:28.570> they<00:01:28.990> don't<00:01:29.170> actually<00:01:29.380> work<00:01:29.800> that

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
is great they don't actually work that

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.490 
is great they don't actually work that
well<00:01:30.340> what<00:01:31.149> we've<00:01:31.300> done<00:01:31.450> here<00:01:31.509> with<00:01:32.350> our

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
well what we've done here with our

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.930 
well what we've done here with our
boards<00:01:32.770> and<00:01:32.860> what's<00:01:32.979> completely<00:01:33.369> unique<00:01:33.670> is

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
boards and what's completely unique is

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.790 
boards and what's completely unique is
that<00:01:34.300> we've<00:01:34.600> done<00:01:34.869> everything<00:01:35.170> that<00:01:35.320> we<00:01:35.440> can

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
that we've done everything that we can

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.490 
that we've done everything that we can
stop<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:36.789> boards<00:01:37.030> from<00:01:37.090> flexing<00:01:37.570> we're

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
stop the boards from flexing we're

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.340 
stop the boards from flexing we're
making<00:01:38.800> these<00:01:38.890> boards<00:01:39.310> as<00:01:39.430> stiff<00:01:40.270> as<00:01:40.300> an<00:01:40.899> epoxy

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
making these boards as stiff as an epoxy

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.109 
making these boards as stiff as an epoxy
board<00:01:41.560> and<00:01:42.250> we're<00:01:42.369> doing<00:01:42.460> that<00:01:42.580> in<00:01:42.759> two<00:01:42.940> ways

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
board and we're doing that in two ways

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.880 
board and we're doing that in two ways
the<00:01:43.750> first<00:01:43.990> one<00:01:44.200> which<00:01:44.320> is<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.500> most<00:01:44.619> obvious

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
the first one which is the most obvious

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.219 
the first one which is the most obvious
is<00:01:45.280> this<00:01:45.759> exoskeleton<00:01:46.180> that<00:01:46.630> you<00:01:46.810> can<00:01:46.960> see<00:01:47.140> on

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
is this exoskeleton that you can see on

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:48.960 
is this exoskeleton that you can see on
the<00:01:47.320> outside<00:01:47.350> of<00:01:47.710> the<00:01:47.890> board<00:01:48.070> here<00:01:48.250> these

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
the outside of the board here these

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.359 
the outside of the board here these
sharks<00:01:49.570> sit<00:01:50.560> on<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.770> deck<00:01:50.890> of<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.100> board

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
sharks sit on the deck of the board

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.700 
sharks sit on the deck of the board
basically<00:01:52.240> work<00:01:52.570> as<00:01:52.750> a<00:01:52.780> skeleton<00:01:53.350> and<00:01:53.500> stop

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
basically work as a skeleton and stop

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.870 
basically work as a skeleton and stop
that<00:01:53.860> board<00:01:54.100> from<00:01:54.250> bending<00:01:54.610> because<00:01:54.760> they're

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
that board from bending because they're

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.490 
that board from bending because they're
very<00:01:55.150> very<00:01:55.299> stiff<00:01:55.689> and<00:01:55.900> it<00:01:56.020> stops<00:01:56.229> the<00:01:56.380> whole

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
very very stiff and it stops the whole

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.170 
very very stiff and it stops the whole
board<00:01:56.740> from<00:01:56.860> bending<00:01:57.189> up<00:01:57.340> stops<00:01:57.939> the<00:01:58.030> ends

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
board from bending up stops the ends

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.640 
board from bending up stops the ends
coming<00:01:58.390> up<00:01:58.570> out<00:01:58.689> of<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:58.810> water<00:01:59.020> stops<00:01:59.560> the

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
coming up out of the water stops the

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.870 
coming up out of the water stops the
board<00:01:59.830> plowing<00:02:00.280> water<00:02:00.460> when<00:02:00.610> you're<00:02:00.729> paddling

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
board plowing water when you're paddling

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.730 
board plowing water when you're paddling
forward<00:02:01.299> that<00:02:01.810> is<00:02:01.960> a<00:02:01.990> great<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:02.560> very

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
forward that is a great and very

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.380 
forward that is a great and very
important<00:02:03.159> thing<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:04.000> next<00:02:04.119> thing<00:02:04.330> that

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
important thing the next thing that

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.300 
important thing the next thing that
we've<00:02:04.600> done<00:02:04.630> is<00:02:05.170> we've<00:02:05.409> lowered<00:02:05.650> the<00:02:05.860> standing

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
we've done is we've lowered the standing

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.280 
we've done is we've lowered the standing
area<00:02:06.490> of<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.820> board<00:02:07.030> lowering<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:07.930> standing

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
area of the board lowering the standing

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.800 
area of the board lowering the standing
of<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.440> area<00:02:08.890> of<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.070> Board<00:02:09.450> makes<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.570> board

of the area of the Board makes the board

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.370 
of the area of the Board makes the board
a<00:02:10.899> lot<00:02:11.110> more<00:02:11.260> stable<00:02:11.590> for<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.430> same<00:02:12.730> amount<00:02:12.880> of

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
a lot more stable for the same amount of

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.690 
a lot more stable for the same amount of
width<00:02:14.380> and<00:02:14.620> length<00:02:14.680> from<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.190> board<00:02:15.400> so<00:02:15.580> we

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
width and length from the board so we

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.420 
width and length from the board so we
can<00:02:15.850> make<00:02:15.940> a<00:02:16.180> narrower<00:02:16.600> smaller<00:02:17.140> board<00:02:17.470> easier

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
can make a narrower smaller board easier

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.759 
can make a narrower smaller board easier
to<00:02:18.519> stand<00:02:18.730> on<00:02:18.970> much<00:02:19.600> more<00:02:19.840> stable<00:02:20.049> much<00:02:20.590> more

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
to stand on much more stable much more

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.789 
to stand on much more stable much more
fun<00:02:20.950> to<00:02:20.980> paddle<00:02:21.750> what<00:02:22.750> we've<00:02:22.900> done<00:02:22.930> in<00:02:23.350> doing

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
fun to paddle what we've done in doing

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.979 
fun to paddle what we've done in doing
so<00:02:24.040> is<00:02:24.310> we've<00:02:24.820> created<00:02:24.850> a<00:02:25.329> multi-chamber

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
so is we've created a multi-chamber

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.380 
so is we've created a multi-chamber
system<00:02:26.380> we<00:02:26.920> have<00:02:26.950> one<00:02:27.370> chamber<00:02:27.880> which<00:02:28.120> is<00:02:28.269> this

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
system we have one chamber which is this

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.270 
system we have one chamber which is this
outside<00:02:28.810> area<00:02:29.110> that<00:02:29.230> you<00:02:29.320> can<00:02:29.470> see<00:02:29.680> and<00:02:29.829> the

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
outside area that you can see and the

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.069 
outside area that you can see and the
second<00:02:30.700> chamber<00:02:31.060> which<00:02:31.299> is<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.570> floor<00:02:31.810> here

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079 
second chamber which is the floor here

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:34.949 
second chamber which is the floor here
and<00:02:32.310> by<00:02:33.310> doing<00:02:33.519> this<00:02:33.730> we<00:02:33.940> created<00:02:34.420> an<00:02:34.510> i-beam

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
and by doing this we created an i-beam

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.560 
and by doing this we created an i-beam
here<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.470> an<00:02:35.769> i-beam<00:02:36.160> then<00:02:36.459> which<00:02:37.030> then<00:02:37.239> works

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
here and an i-beam then which then works

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.050 
here and an i-beam then which then works
to<00:02:38.019> make<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.260> board<00:02:38.470> very<00:02:38.920> very<00:02:39.130> stiff<00:02:39.549> even

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
to make the board very very stiff even

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.460 
to make the board very very stiff even
without<00:02:40.329> these<00:02:40.540> shops<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:41.170> board<00:02:41.380> is

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
without these shops the board is

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.920 
without these shops the board is
extremely<00:02:42.010> stiff<00:02:42.250> then<00:02:42.970> we<00:02:43.150> come<00:02:43.360> in<00:02:43.540> with<00:02:43.810> the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
extremely stiff then we come in with the

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.350 
extremely stiff then we come in with the
school<00:02:44.260> which<00:02:44.769> is<00:02:44.829> in<00:02:44.980> its<00:02:45.190> own<00:02:45.370> way<00:02:45.610> an<00:02:45.880> i-beam

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
school which is in its own way an i-beam

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.720 
school which is in its own way an i-beam
we<00:02:46.870> can<00:02:47.019> pump<00:02:47.200> this<00:02:47.350> up<00:02:47.500> very<00:02:47.860> very<00:02:47.950> stiff<00:02:48.459> the

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
we can pump this up very very stiff the

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.680 
we can pump this up very very stiff the
folia<00:02:49.180> up<00:02:49.600> to<00:02:49.989> about<00:02:50.200> 20<00:02:50.620> psi<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.540> then<00:02:52.540> we

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
folia up to about 20 psi and then we

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.509 
folia up to about 20 psi and then we
have<00:02:52.870> this<00:02:53.170> which<00:02:53.620> working<00:02:54.010> with<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.280> sides

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
have this which working with the sides

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:55.809 
have this which working with the sides
make<00:02:55.000> this<00:02:55.180> for

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
make this for

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.339 
make this for
it<00:02:56.030> almost<00:02:56.209> doesn't<00:02:56.629> Bend<00:02:56.900> at<00:02:57.019> all<00:02:57.140> I<00:02:57.170> mean

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
it almost doesn't Bend at all I mean

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:58.569 
it almost doesn't Bend at all I mean
you've<00:02:57.469> got<00:02:57.590> to<00:02:57.680> jump<00:02:57.859> up<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.129> down<00:02:58.189> on<00:02:58.310> it<00:02:58.459> and

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
you've got to jump up and down on it and

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.879 
you've got to jump up and down on it and
you<00:02:58.790> get<00:02:58.909> a<00:02:58.939> little<00:02:59.120> bit<00:02:59.299> of<00:02:59.359> flexing<00:02:59.780> which<00:03:00.319> is

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:00.889 
you get a little bit of flexing which is

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:03.099 
you get a little bit of flexing which is
going<00:03:01.129> to<00:03:01.189> happen<00:03:01.489> but<00:03:02.030> basically<00:03:02.569> what<00:03:02.959> we've

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
going to happen but basically what we've

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:04.629 
going to happen but basically what we've
done<00:03:03.290> is<00:03:03.439> we've<00:03:03.590> taken<00:03:03.620> any<00:03:04.189> two<00:03:04.430> ninety

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:04.639 
done is we've taken any two ninety

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:06.309 
done is we've taken any two ninety
percent<00:03:04.760> of<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.359> vexing<00:03:05.780> out<00:03:05.959> of<00:03:06.079> the<00:03:06.139> more

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
percent of the vexing out of the more

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.849 
percent of the vexing out of the more
but<00:03:07.189> I've<00:03:07.999> done<00:03:08.209> here<00:03:08.389> even<00:03:09.170> call<00:03:09.409> them<00:03:09.650> out

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
but I've done here even call them out

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.089 
but I've done here even call them out
the<00:03:10.430> flow<00:03:10.760> of<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:10.969> board<00:03:11.299> comes<00:03:11.900> out<00:03:12.170> and<00:03:12.950> what

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
the flow of the board comes out and what

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:14.949 
the flow of the board comes out and what
that<00:03:13.250> does<00:03:13.459> is<00:03:13.819> it<00:03:14.209> means<00:03:14.569> that<00:03:14.780> for<00:03:14.900> example

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
that does is it means that for example

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.199 
that does is it means that for example
on<00:03:15.469> this<00:03:15.769> board<00:03:16.040> which<00:03:16.250> is<00:03:16.459> our<00:03:16.639> white<00:03:16.939> water

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
on this board which is our white water

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.259 
on this board which is our white water
board<00:03:17.480> you<00:03:18.079> then<00:03:18.290> have<00:03:18.319> a<00:03:18.530> surfboard<00:03:18.939> the<00:03:19.939> thin

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
board you then have a surfboard the thin

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.750 
board you then have a surfboard the thin
is<00:03:20.510> attached<00:03:21.200> to<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.439> floor<00:03:21.739> not<00:03:22.340> to<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:22.579> main

on<00:03:34.639> the<00:03:35.359> touring<00:03:35.750> boards<00:03:36.079> will<00:03:36.199> charge<00:03:36.409> us<00:03:36.469> a

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
on the touring boards will charge us a

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.990 
on the touring boards will charge us a
little<00:03:36.680> bit<00:03:36.799> longer<00:03:37.040> this<00:03:37.579> serves<00:03:37.819> as<00:03:37.909> a

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
little bit longer this serves as a

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.459 
little bit longer this serves as a
mattress<00:03:38.359> it's<00:03:38.599> one<00:03:38.840> less<00:03:39.019> thing<00:03:39.079> that<00:03:39.290> you

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:39.469 
mattress it's one less thing that you

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.530 
mattress it's one less thing that you
have<00:03:39.500> to<00:03:39.620> carry<00:03:39.919> on<00:03:40.099> the<00:03:40.189> board<00:03:40.459> so<00:03:41.180> you<00:03:41.209> pop

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
have to carry on the board so you pop

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.240 
have to carry on the board so you pop
the<00:03:41.659> fallout<00:03:42.019> if<00:03:42.469> you<00:03:42.590> flayed<00:03:42.829> it<00:03:42.980> down<00:03:43.129> to

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
the fallout if you flayed it down to

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.729 
the fallout if you flayed it down to
about<00:03:43.280> 3<00:03:43.669> psi<00:03:44.150> 0<00:03:44.209> 2<00:03:44.480> psi<00:03:44.900> and<00:03:45.379> you<00:03:45.530> have<00:03:45.709> a
