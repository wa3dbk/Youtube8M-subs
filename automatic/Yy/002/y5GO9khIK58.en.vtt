it to get a chance to know it I've been

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.660 
it to get a chance to know it I've been
a<00:00:36.360> big<00:00:36.660> fan<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.140> surface<00:00:37.500> non<00:00:37.920> RT<00:00:38.460> line

a big fan of the surface non RT line

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.970 
a big fan of the surface non RT line
since<00:00:38.879> inception<00:00:39.090> about<00:00:39.840> two<00:00:40.140> years<00:00:40.440> ago<00:00:40.590> I

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
since inception about two years ago I

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.010 
since inception about two years ago I
really<00:00:41.520> like<00:00:41.730> what<00:00:41.879> Microsoft<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.450> trying<00:00:42.480> to

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
really like what Microsoft is trying to

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.500 
really like what Microsoft is trying to
do<00:00:43.260> here<00:00:43.590> but<00:00:44.430> those<00:00:44.579> first<00:00:44.850> devices<00:00:45.149> had

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
do here but those first devices had

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.420 
do here but those first devices had
issues<00:00:45.930> they<00:00:46.110> had<00:00:46.230> sort<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.590> weird<00:00:46.920> screen

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
issues they had sort of a weird screen

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.209 
issues they had sort of a weird screen
size<00:00:47.670> they<00:00:48.270> had<00:00:48.390> poor<00:00:48.719> resolution<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.860> kind

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
size they had poor resolution that kind

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:50.840 
size they had poor resolution that kind
of<00:00:50.340> meant

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
of meant

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.670 
of meant
battery<00:00:51.120> life<00:00:51.239> over<00:00:51.510> time<00:00:51.690> they<00:00:52.320> had<00:00:52.440> kind<00:00:52.649> of

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
battery life over time they had kind of

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.229 
battery life over time they had kind of
questionable<00:00:53.160> utility<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.730> value<00:00:54.000> for<00:00:54.180> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
questionable utility in value for the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.299 
questionable utility in value for the
price<00:00:54.449> now<00:00:55.110> though<00:00:55.320> Microsoft<00:00:55.559> has<00:00:56.070> brought

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
price now though Microsoft has brought

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.639 
price now though Microsoft has brought
what<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.520> think<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.030> absolute<00:00:57.239> best

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
what I think is the absolute best

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.689 
what I think is the absolute best
representation<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.710> Windows<00:00:59.010> 8.1<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.640> the

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
representation of Windows 8.1 on the

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.790 
representation of Windows 8.1 on the
market<00:01:00.059> but<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.960> good<00:01:01.170> enough<00:01:01.379> for<00:01:01.620> you

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
market but is that good enough for you

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.070 
market but is that good enough for you
and<00:01:02.039> what<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.250> keep<00:01:02.489> using<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:02.879> thing<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.960> it's

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:51.060 
was looking at a MacBook Air I'd
seriously<00:04:49.780> consider<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:50.560> surface<00:04:50.860> pro<00:04:51.040> 3

instead<00:04:51.580> it's<00:04:52.300> still<00:04:52.540> more<00:04:52.780> expensive<00:04:52.840> than<00:04:53.229> I

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
instead it's still more expensive than I

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.560 
instead it's still more expensive than I
liked<00:04:53.560> the<00:04:53.800> range<00:04:54.010> of<00:04:54.190> 800<00:04:54.729> to<00:04:54.880> 1950<00:04:55.479> and

liked the range of 800 to 1950 and

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.140 
liked the range of 800 to 1950 and
that's<00:04:55.630> before<00:04:55.990> that<00:04:56.740> type<00:04:56.979> cover<00:04:57.220> so<00:04:57.880> this<00:04:58.030> is

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
that's before that type cover so this is
