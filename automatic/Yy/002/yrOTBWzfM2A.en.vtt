 the job 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.300
 Of how 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.780
 the figures are made what 5 on my page 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.810
 with 20 thousand to 4 cut bandages that are used to make 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.550
 the principle in which they have been squared 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.550
 this is heard in around here they bend 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.860
 i intertwine 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.410
 they are crossing 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.410
 to carry out what is the square 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.560
 square on the main base of all the others 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.230
 foot modules 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.230
 they are done with what I know how to do the criticisms 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.780
 event muster 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.800
 many benches among the many the four interviews 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.660
 by way of 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.160
 stay square, I turn it around just fine 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.380
 for what 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.380
 I was standing well done 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.580
 doubled again 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.470
 by ap he folded the tip so that it is easily inserted below 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.500
 the other appointment 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.750
 if this is what has been seized 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.910
 from here all the modules with which I carried out all my figures depart 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.140
 then I will continue with this same thing to make a flower I will speak to 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.799
 conquer 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:20.010
 of the strips that I have been for a dollar so that without tricks easily 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.399
 so now I'm going to make a flower 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:25.819
 by way of 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.469
 adam regret over here 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:30.699
 to be the first part 

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:33.389
 this is said to be a flower 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:36.189
 they say it because that's how it will be done 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.269
 so let's see how it looks like we hope it looks good 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.429
 I have already thrown on both sides 

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:46.379
 I go for the third 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.159
 third degree of the flower i strong the last 

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:53.969
 net over here 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:58.700
 it was stretched crushed with the tpi already have you here made the flower from 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:59.959
 here 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.339
 sheehan be and all the other modules with what if they carry out all the 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:07.259
 figure that can see my page much grace that tells us
