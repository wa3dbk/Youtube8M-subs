00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello hello good night to all the 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.950
 today I bring you a small video 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.280
 tutorial and it's pretty simple is a 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.660
 program called and interactive anatomy 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.029
 is an anatomy program works like 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.189
 a kind of economics anatomy is what 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.010
 I strongly advise students of 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.439
 medicine is quite useful is a little bit 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.109
 old man but the truth is very very 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.779
 functional at the time of studying so 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.480
 basically what we will need is the 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.210
 download link and I'll leave it in 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.219
 the description of the video if it is here and 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.030
 we simply enter and we will 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:45.030
 look like an advertisement we hope that 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.200
 finish loading here and click on 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.750
 Skip ad 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.030
 once again we have skipped the advertising 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.180
 is going to take us the mega page here 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.180
 it is simply to give it in download and now 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.820
 I have downloaded so I do not need 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.440
 download it and just when 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.740
 finish downloading they will have a 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.650
 file like this here have two 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:12.070
 options in case you have 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.550
 the windows 8 is this this here 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.330
 that has the subway interface 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.600
 they just have to click 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.520
 right and if you get the option to ride 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.950
 click there and it will open the 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.140
 program they simply have to click 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.930
 acanceh tap and continue with the 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.840
 installation but most likely not 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.910
 have windows 7 so they're going to have to 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.090
 install a program called daemon 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.550
 tools is this from here and I will leave you the 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.310
 link of in the inscription of the video and 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.080
 to download it simply 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.390
 they have to click here on download and 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.530
 the lead to another page and again in 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.060
 download and basically they will have is 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.229
 this program here 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.229
 they open it 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.689
 Y 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.689
 voice 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:10.590
 in Spanish next I accept license 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:15.530
 free this is important and they wait for 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.530
 to connect you get next install 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.000
 and something important 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.330
 in case you do not want to install this 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.790
 program may wish to have the 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.459
 program that we're going to install adam but 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.819
 if you simply have to record it 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.799
 within itself and automatically every time 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.470
 that insert it understand within the 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:46.819
 computer will execute them the 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.819
 program without any problem 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.569
 once the program is installed and we will 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.180
 appear this small window here 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.120
 in if really what you have to do is 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.329
 click here where it appears to add 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.659
 image they look for the place where they have 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:09.150
 the file that we download from the program 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:12.000
 that is going to be this and they give in to open in 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.639
 a case I have it here and it's going to 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.170
 appear this exactly the same and you give 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:21.810
 Click on the green mount button 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.689
 assemble the image and you are going to 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.419
 team and they will appear here as if 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:33.349
 had an uncertain yes or just you 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:33.349
 double click here and click on set 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.849
 is going to look like this little box does not 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:41.060
 it's supposed to look like a 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:44.290
 animation but for some reason not 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.769
 appear we wait for him to load 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.769
 Y 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:02.770
 now we give in install and do not go or 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.770
 do not go to install internet explorer 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.030
 they give him the following 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.030
 yes 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:19.129
 here in next and enter 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.879
 and I 'm going to ask you if you want 

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:23.750
 install quick time is a player 

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:25.400
 usually already installed in the 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.120
 computers in case you do not 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:33.289
 they have it and they give him that if I already have it 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:35.569
 then they give the next following and 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:38.229
 wait for it to finish extracting all 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:38.229
 the files 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:47.300
 once you have finished installing 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:49.610
 probably do not create a shortcut 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.610
 here on the desk so it's going to 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.750
 be necessary 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.670
 look for it from here 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.370
 well now I'm wondering this 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:02.520
 is asking here is simply the 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:05.790
 language and we will put it in my case 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.460
 spanish spanish is important that is with 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.810
 the secondary language not all not all 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.780
 the body parts were 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:16.290
 correctly translated into Spanish by 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:18.710
 what is pretty good they have as 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.660
 second option English 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:24.260
 here they simply give it to finish 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:26.840
 unmark this utility starts as they 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.690
 he said does not appear like all 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.490
 programs do not appear an icon in the 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.290
 desk then just you 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.620
 they have to write the name of the 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.620
 Program 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:44.279
 they click and it will really do this 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:48.119
 is everything and here appeared them a link to 

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:50.189
 the page to make slides for 

00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:53.729
 see a corpse in 3-d usually not 

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:55.319
 It works very well and the function more 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:58.499
 important that is the corpse says lime 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:06:02.159
 we click here and simply 

00:05:58.499 --> 00:06:05.759
 we choose the characteristics of the doll 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:08.969
 in our case man side vision or 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:12.719
 medial anterior posteriority is that is 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:15.179
 at ease we expand here and how we can 

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:17.360
 see here a bar at the top 

00:06:15.179 --> 00:06:19.919
 and on the bottom as you 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:24.149
 let's click and go 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:26.719
 disappearing different layers or parts 

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:26.719
 tissues 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:32.430
 another pretty interesting thing about this 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:35.330
 program is that we can go dedicating 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:38.330
 nothing more a part then for example 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.330
 here 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:43.210
 and we continue the distraction only 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.210
 on this side 

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.710
 obviously we have to do it 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:50.230
 transparent to the maximum and will continue as 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:53.800
 can see will be removing only the part 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:57.220
 in which we chose the dissection and then 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:59.590
 really that has been all for today 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:02.380
 in case they need some other 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:06.100
 program some other atlas and that you do not 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:07.480
 find and let me know and it really was 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:10.710
 a little bit complicated to find the 

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:14.380
 program I hope you liked it and I 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:16.680
 be very useful until next time 

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.680
 beautiful
