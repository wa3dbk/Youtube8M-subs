and make a decision and if we go through
the<00:02:18.060> acronym<00:02:18.480> basically<00:02:18.960> we're<00:02:19.080> going<00:02:19.170> to

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
the acronym basically we're going to

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.400 
the acronym basically we're going to
answer<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:20.790> question<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.810> start<00:02:22.110> with<00:02:22.260> the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
depends I guess really on the industry

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.660 
depends I guess really on the industry
isn't<00:02:33.570> it<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:33.960> I<00:02:34.110> guess<00:02:34.320> I<00:02:34.350> want<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.250> decision

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
isn't it and I guess I want the decision

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.370 
isn't it and I guess I want the decision
right<00:02:36.060> well<00:02:36.300> I<00:02:36.330> guess<00:02:36.900> you've<00:02:37.020> got<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.170> look<00:02:37.230> at

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
right well I guess you've got to look at

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.480 
right well I guess you've got to look at
the<00:02:37.440> different<00:02:37.740> variables<00:02:38.190> though<00:02:38.280> don't

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
the different variables though don't

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.980 
the different variables though don't
you've<00:02:38.640> got<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.910> look<00:02:39.000> at<00:02:39.209> for<00:02:39.570> example<00:02:39.600> what

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
you've got to look at for example what

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.470 
you've got to look at for example what
industry<00:02:40.350> they<00:02:40.470> were<00:02:40.640> operate<00:02:41.640> in<00:02:41.850> you<00:02:42.180> also<00:02:42.330> I

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
industry they were operate in you also I

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.570 
industry they were operate in you also I
think<00:02:42.660> what<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.840> spies<00:02:43.110> listen<00:02:43.620> up<00:02:44.040> all<00:02:44.280> right

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
don't think all highly profitable firms

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.790 
don't think all highly profitable firms

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.320 
answered a question you've said so why
why<00:03:11.040> is<00:03:11.100> it<00:03:11.250> you<00:03:11.550> know<00:03:11.640> you've<00:03:11.820> answered<00:03:12.120> a

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
why is it you know you've answered a

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.229 
why is it you know you've answered a
question<00:03:13.250> business<00:03:14.250> cultures<00:03:14.670> are<00:03:14.790> not<00:03:15.000> all

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
question business cultures are not all

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.880 
question business cultures are not all
similar<00:03:15.690> I<00:03:15.720> find<00:03:16.049> it<00:03:16.140> profitable<00:03:16.290> phones

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
similar I find it profitable phones

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.400 
similar I find it profitable phones
so<00:03:17.220> maybe<00:03:17.430> just<00:03:17.549> justify<00:03:18.090> that<00:03:18.480> just<00:03:19.110> to<00:03:19.200> say

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
so maybe just justify that just to say

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.789 
so maybe just justify that just to say
something<00:03:19.470> like<00:03:21.380> you<00:03:22.380> know<00:03:22.410> they're<00:03:22.620> not<00:03:22.739> all

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
something like you know they're not all

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.930 
something like you know they're not all
highly<00:03:23.370> similar<00:03:23.610> because<00:03:24.030> we've<00:03:24.780> seen<00:03:25.049> with

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
highly similar because we've seen with

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.270 
highly similar because we've seen with
IKEA<00:03:26.940> they<00:03:27.570> have<00:03:27.660> a<00:03:27.720> team<00:03:27.989> work<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.470> a<00:03:29.070> cost

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
IKEA they have a team work and a cost

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.120 
IKEA they have a team work and a cost
conscious<00:03:29.989> cost<00:03:30.989> consciousness<00:03:31.380> in<00:03:31.980> their

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
conscious cost consciousness in their

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.070 
conscious cost consciousness in their
culture<00:03:32.549> so<00:03:33.269> you<00:03:33.299> could<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:33.690> could<00:03:33.840> bring<00:03:33.959> in

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
culture so you could you could bring in

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.110 
culture so you could you could bring in
some<00:03:34.110> examples<00:03:34.440> to<00:03:34.739> show<00:03:34.950> why<00:03:35.220> that<00:03:35.760> is<00:03:35.910> not

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
some examples to show why that is not

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.660 
some examples to show why that is not
the<00:03:36.239> case<00:03:36.450> so<00:03:36.720> we<00:03:37.230> saw<00:03:37.590> that<00:03:37.620> yesterday<00:03:38.280> that

going to move you from say e 1 on this

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.880 
going to move you from say e 1 on this
are<00:05:29.240> the<00:05:29.420> level<00:05:29.720> descriptors<00:05:30.260> and<00:05:30.470> you're

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:30.890 
are the level descriptors and you're

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.130 
are the level descriptors and you're
moving<00:05:30.980> up<00:05:31.250> towards<00:05:31.640> e<00:05:31.850> 2<00:05:32.150> so<00:05:32.630> the<00:05:32.750> band<00:05:32.960> of

together like this so if you can do all

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.600 
together like this so if you can do all
of<00:06:16.550> them<00:06:16.730> really<00:06:17.300> you<00:06:17.630> know<00:06:18.340> that's<00:06:19.340> a<00:06:19.400> really

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.610 
of them really you know that's a really

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:20.890 
of them really you know that's a really
strong<00:06:19.820> end<00:06:20.000> to<00:06:20.120> an<00:06:20.210> S<00:06:20.330> I<00:06:20.450> think<00:06:20.660> the<00:06:20.720> biggest

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
strong end to an S I think the biggest

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:21.910 
strong end to an S I think the biggest
thing<00:06:21.080> you've<00:06:21.290> got<00:06:21.380> to<00:06:21.410> think<00:06:21.590> about<00:06:21.680> in<00:06:21.890> that

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:21.920 
thing you've got to think about in that

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.560 
thing you've got to think about in that
final<00:06:22.250> paragraph<00:06:22.550> is<00:06:22.820> the<00:06:22.850> fact<00:06:23.150> that<00:06:23.270> we're

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
final paragraph is the fact that we're

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.060 
final paragraph is the fact that we're
looking<00:06:23.660> at<00:06:23.900> all<00:06:24.050> highly<00:06:24.380> profitable<00:06:24.590> firms

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:25.070 
looking at all highly profitable firms

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.010 
looking at all highly profitable firms
so<00:06:25.400> the<00:06:25.520> examples<00:06:25.910> that<00:06:25.970> you<00:06:26.060> consider<00:06:26.510> in

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
so the examples that you consider in

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.780 
so the examples that you consider in
your<00:06:27.080> evaluation<00:06:27.590> and<00:06:28.280> throughout<00:06:28.550> your

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:28.790 
your evaluation and throughout your

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.130 
your evaluation and throughout your
entire<00:06:28.940> answer<00:06:29.300> have<00:06:29.510> got<00:06:29.660> to<00:06:29.780> be<00:06:29.870> highly

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:30.140 
entire answer have got to be highly

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.110 
entire answer have got to be highly
profitable<00:06:30.290> firms<00:06:30.860> so<00:06:31.430> you<00:06:31.520> can<00:06:31.700> and<00:06:31.880> if<00:06:32.000> you

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
profitable firms so you can and if you

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.870 
profitable firms so you can and if you
can<00:06:32.330> sort<00:06:32.600> of<00:06:32.660> pick<00:06:32.870> firms<00:06:33.170> from<00:06:33.320> different

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 
can sort of pick firms from different

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.820 
can sort of pick firms from different
trees<00:06:34.090> that<00:06:34.270> are<00:06:34.600> all<00:06:34.720> highly<00:06:35.050> profitable<00:06:35.230> but

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:35.830 
trees that are all highly profitable but

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.530 
trees that are all highly profitable but
they've<00:06:35.950> got<00:06:36.190> different<00:06:36.430> cultures<00:06:37.090> then

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:37.540 
they've got different cultures then

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:38.940 
they've got different cultures then
you're<00:06:37.690> actually<00:06:38.050> fully<00:06:38.350> understanding<00:06:38.920> the

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:38.950 
you're actually fully understanding the

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:40.390 
question and you're demonstrating to the

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.270 
question and you're demonstrating to the
post<00:06:40.570> for<00:06:40.630> example<00:06:41.110> you've<00:06:41.320> done<00:06:41.800> sufficient

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:42.280 
post for example you've done sufficient

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.850 
post for example you've done sufficient
research<00:06:42.550> on<00:06:42.790> numerous<00:06:43.450> industries<00:06:43.990> this

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860 
research on numerous industries this

research on numerous industries this
last<00:06:45.130> part<00:06:45.400> here<00:06:45.550> but<00:06:45.700> most<00:06:45.940> important<00:06:46.510> factor

is this idea that of all your it depends

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.300 
is this idea that of all your it depends
on<00:06:49.840> that<00:06:49.990> you've<00:06:50.140> referred<00:06:50.410> to<00:06:50.620> which<00:06:51.100> is<00:06:51.220> the
