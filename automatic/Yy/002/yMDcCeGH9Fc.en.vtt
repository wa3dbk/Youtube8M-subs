00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
waste of time because they are not

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.819 
waste of time because they are not
blurring<00:00:59.340> his<00:00:59.550> vision<00:00:59.940> enough<00:01:00.300> for<00:01:01.170> his<00:01:01.559> brain

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
blurring his vision enough for his brain

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.920 
blurring his vision enough for his brain
to<00:01:02.070> use<00:01:02.340> his<00:01:02.579> other<00:01:02.760> eye<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.480> it's<00:01:03.539> kind<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.840> a

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
to use his other eye so it's kind of a

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.070 
to use his other eye so it's kind of a
waste<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.260> time<00:01:04.500> um<00:01:05.720> because<00:01:06.720> uh<00:01:07.380> no<00:01:07.979> matter

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
waste of time um because uh no matter

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.410 
waste of time um because uh no matter
how<00:01:10.080> hard<00:01:10.380> we<00:01:10.409> tried<00:01:10.860> even<00:01:11.790> if<00:01:11.939> he<00:01:12.060> kept<00:01:12.299> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
how hard we tried even if he kept the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.380 
how hard we tried even if he kept the
patch<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:12.840> every<00:01:13.290> single<00:01:13.439> day<00:01:13.850> it<00:01:14.850> probably

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
patch on every single day it probably

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.730 
patch on every single day it probably
wouldn't<00:01:15.810> help<00:01:16.020> his<00:01:16.140> vision<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.560> much

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
wouldn't help his vision that much

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.520 
wouldn't help his vision that much
anyway<00:01:17.159> simply<00:01:17.670> because<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.990> optic<00:01:19.500> nerve

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
anyway simply because the optic nerve

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.950 
anyway simply because the optic nerve
and<00:01:19.950> his<00:01:20.100> right<00:01:20.310> eye<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:20.850> small<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.570> no

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
and his right eye is so small that no

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.330 
and his right eye is so small that no
you<00:01:22.860> can't<00:01:23.549> fix<00:01:23.970> an<00:01:24.270> optic<00:01:24.810> nerve<00:01:25.080> so<00:01:25.590> he's

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
you can't fix an optic nerve so he's

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.890 
you can't fix an optic nerve so he's
just<00:01:26.400> never<00:01:26.729> going<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.090> have<00:01:27.270> good<00:01:27.479> vision<00:01:27.659> in

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
just never going to have good vision in

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.539 
just never going to have good vision in
that<00:01:27.930> eye<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.590> um<00:01:29.299> our<00:01:30.299> efforts<00:01:30.780> are<00:01:31.549> useless

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
that eye so um our efforts are useless

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.429 
that eye so um our efforts are useless
pretty<00:01:32.939> much<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.810> we're<00:01:34.049> going<00:01:34.259> to

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
pretty much so we're going to

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.710 
pretty much so we're going to
discontinue<00:01:35.130> trying<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.700> strengthen<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
it's fine I mean he sees perfectly fine

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.440

fine<00:03:26.090> I<00:03:26.389> think<00:03:27.319> he<00:03:27.410> could<00:03:27.560> totally<00:03:27.680> do<00:03:28.010> that<00:03:28.040> I

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
fine I think he could totally do that I

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.800 
fine I think he could totally do that I
think<00:03:28.340> that<00:03:28.699> if<00:03:28.819> you<00:03:28.849> wanted<00:03:29.359> to<00:03:29.419> give<00:03:29.599> him<00:03:29.720> the

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
think that if you wanted to give him the

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.599 
think that if you wanted to give him the
test<00:03:30.019> today<00:03:30.169> you<00:03:30.319> could<00:03:30.650> do<00:03:30.769> that<00:03:30.799> simply

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
test today you could do that simply

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.729 
test today you could do that simply
because<00:03:31.790> Jaden<00:03:32.449> knows<00:03:32.690> all<00:03:33.079> of<00:03:33.139> his<00:03:33.560> letters

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
because Jaden knows all of his letters

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.830 
because Jaden knows all of his letters
heinous<00:03:34.609> had<00:03:34.790> to<00:03:34.909> identify<00:03:35.090> all<00:03:35.629> of<00:03:35.659> his

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
heinous had to identify all of his

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.809 
heinous had to identify all of his
letters<00:03:36.049> and<00:03:36.409> he<00:03:36.500> knows<00:03:36.739> most<00:03:37.220> of<00:03:37.459> the<00:03:37.639> letter

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
letters and he knows most of the letter

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.530 
letters and he knows most of the letter
sounds<00:03:38.480> so<00:03:39.609> we're<00:03:40.609> not<00:03:40.760> even<00:03:40.909> gonna<00:03:41.090> have<00:03:41.329> to

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
sounds so we're not even gonna have to

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.300 
sounds so we're not even gonna have to
like<00:03:41.750> help<00:03:42.169> him<00:03:42.349> memorize<00:03:42.560> those<00:03:43.040> letters

to make one trip so the blood draw was
for<00:04:42.650> the<00:04:42.740> endocrinologist<00:04:43.460> and<00:04:43.670> that<00:04:44.210> was<00:04:44.360> a

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
for the endocrinologist and that was a

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.630 
for the endocrinologist and that was a
tickle<00:04:44.840> of<00:04:44.900> his<00:04:45.080> levels<00:04:45.500> its<00:04:46.010> growth<00:04:46.220> hormone

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640
