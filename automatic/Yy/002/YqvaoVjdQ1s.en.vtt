there<00:06:32.529> but<00:06:33.009> I<00:06:33.399> think<00:06:33.729> now<00:06:33.969> is<00:06:34.389> is<00:06:35.079> difficult

00:06:35.609 --> 00:06:35.619 
there but I think now is is difficult

00:06:35.619 --> 00:06:38.009 
there but I think now is is difficult

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:41.889 
future is possible I think for this
