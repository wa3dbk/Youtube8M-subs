00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.180
 the arabidopsis is a model plant that 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.740
 is used in research thanks to its 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.650
 ease to be manipulated 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.750
 genetically this has allowed us 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.730
 introducing fluorescent proteins 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.340
 different colors that are expressed in 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.990
 concrete organelles and visualize what 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.970
 occurs within the cell in each 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.289
 time by observing a 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.269
 confocal microscope 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.939
 the surface of the arabidopsis leaf 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.369
 presents interesting structures 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.919
 the more star-shaped wheat that 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.769
 Maintains moisture and serves as a defense 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:36.780
 facing aggression if we continue 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:38.940
 deepening we find the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.610
 epidermis where the stomata stand out 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.100
 those openings through which the plants 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.899
 they perform gas exchange in 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.390
 our plant we can see some spheres 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.670
 of blue color corresponding to the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.800
 but if they are more very organelles 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.019
 interesting and little known that 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.619
 we can see why they express a protein 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:01.080
 that blooms in blue and if we advance yet 

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:03.059
 more we find the cells of the 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.129
 month or phil or where the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.829
 chloroplasts where the 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.950
 photosynthesis and that are easily seen 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:13.020
 because auto bloom in red color the 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.030
 small spots in yellow are the 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.340
 mitochondria that express a protein 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.560
 yellow fluorescent 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.970
 unlike the static image that 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.460
 we studied in textbooks 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.950
 inside the cell everything is in 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.990
 movement and nothing is randomly the 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.830
 different organs move to different 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.440
 speed 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.290
 and they maintain close relationships in 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.000
 Sometimes they are traveling together or separately and 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.640
 an exchange occurs continuously 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.820
 of compounds between them that allow 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.220
 the functioning of the cell is 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.320
 dynamic can be modified in response 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.720
 to certain stimuli to optimize 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.530
 the resources of the cell and adapt to 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.530
 adverse situations 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.590
 and all this in turn is governed by 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.359
 the cytoskeleton that constitutes the network 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.359
 of highways within the cell 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.290
 next time you look at a 'leaf 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.740
 think of the universe that is in your 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.740
 inside
