work<00:00:32.349> ever<00:00:32.650> so<00:00:33.579> I<00:00:33.610> wouldn't<00:00:33.940> even<00:00:34.030> bother<00:00:34.329> with

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
work ever so I wouldn't even bother with

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.200 
work ever so I wouldn't even bother with
that<00:00:35.290> situation<00:00:35.590> it's<00:00:36.460> possible<00:00:37.060> they<00:00:37.150> could

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
that situation it's possible they could

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.000 
that situation it's possible they could
have<00:00:37.450> some<00:00:37.600> extra<00:00:37.840> money<00:00:37.960> the<00:00:38.590> likelihood

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
have some extra money the likelihood

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.620 
have some extra money the likelihood
that<00:00:39.040> they<00:00:39.190> want<00:00:39.370> to<00:00:39.400> buy<00:00:39.490> that<00:00:39.640> house<00:00:39.820> I<00:00:40.090> mean

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:40.630 
that they want to buy that house I mean

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.930 
that they want to buy that house I mean
I<00:00:40.750> think<00:00:41.290> it's<00:00:41.380> unlikely<00:00:41.530> so<00:00:42.400> don't<00:00:42.670> mess<00:00:42.910> with

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
I think it's unlikely so don't mess with

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.970 
I think it's unlikely so don't mess with
that<00:00:43.270> instead<00:00:43.720> ask<00:00:44.050> the<00:00:44.200> seller<00:00:44.380> when<00:00:44.860> are

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
that instead ask the seller when are

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.170 
that instead ask the seller when are
these<00:00:45.040> people<00:00:45.100> going<00:00:45.490> to<00:00:45.580> be<00:00:45.670> out<00:00:45.820> of<00:00:46.030> the
