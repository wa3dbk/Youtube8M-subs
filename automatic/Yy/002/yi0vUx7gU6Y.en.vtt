00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:07.139 
different colored fences like we told

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:10.820 
different colored fences like we told
the<00:02:07.859> developers<00:02:08.520> what<00:02:09.000> we<00:02:09.149> wanted<00:02:09.569> but<00:02:09.830> they

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
test the brightness out so right here in

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.590 
test the brightness out so right here in
a<00:02:37.470> cave<00:02:37.820> and<00:02:38.820> as<00:02:39.000> y'all<00:02:39.180> can<00:02:39.210> see<00:02:39.480> the

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
a cave and as y'all can see the

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.330 
a cave and as y'all can see the
brightness<00:02:39.840> is<00:02:40.140> all<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.380> way<00:02:40.530> up<00:02:40.770> right<00:02:41.100> now

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
brightness is all the way up right now

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.100 
brightness is all the way up right now
but<00:02:41.550> if<00:02:41.640> I<00:02:41.730> turn<00:02:41.880> it<00:02:42.060> down<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.240> could<00:02:42.510> be<00:02:42.780> super

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
but if I turn it down I could be super

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.480 
but if I turn it down I could be super
