00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:13.339
 so it increases even more 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:14.359
 important series 

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:15.190
 what's that 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.679
 to andrade 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:18.619
 in the interview 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.619
 I think it's missing 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:24.839
 fidelis canguçu 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:28.349
 despite the modeling hit 33 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.829
 because this is certainly the cornerstone of the program. 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.770
 there are no limits to what can be 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.550
 in terms of geometric shapes 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.690
 either because nanica or inorganic 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.250
 since that name 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.770
 all creation and modification tools 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.510
 and that is our goal is that once again only the years 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.070
 go through technical fairs here 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.460
 as we create the different forms 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.060
 duke object in question 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.039
 qr code 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:06.230
 World War II Fighter Plane 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.190
 famous mitsubishi 0 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.900
 available the reference images to lower 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.700
 you make it say with partizan pictures 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.340
 - let's start wanted neither so in the reference box 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.000
 the object 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.830
 we've already done a complete tutorial on this 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.940
 but we are going to relive this process here so that the tutorial is really 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.100
 complete 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.689
 let's then create in the box the boccia why narrated paid creation 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.450
 dilma and tristan das and even death piaba here 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.940
 What do you have to say 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.940
 which allow manual entry of dimensions 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.130
 I remember that the dimensions here are not random 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.390
 must match the dimensions of the reference images in pixels 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.010
 I already noticed the photoshop year study 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.070
 so let's put it here on lnet 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.880
 766 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.789
 we did not register 500 94 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:11.829
 images 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:14.269
 222 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.080
 just click on a tweet 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.409
 the created box reports larger than the views 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.129
 so sometimes we can click here on metz 800 stage 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:26.489
 So, we'll have the box now in four months. 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.950
 and we will then enable multi-channel lights to see the material 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:35.139
 we can also turn off the leader he only gets in the way and that in the 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:36.909
 league over 10 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.359
 so many animals 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.379
 the three in the four vices alliances 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.379
 very well now we have to the visible materials 

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:50.869
 and the next step is to turn those mouths temponi month the suitor has 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:56.009
 access to the objects is selected kwai go in the modification palette 

00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:59.879
 aveirenses modifiers and got modifier 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.149
 look up applied indicator went up 10 days 

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:07.820
 he injured in the surubi geto 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.749
 polisher 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:13.179
 with the selected curriculum I'm picking up 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.899
 I'll stop reading you 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:19.759
 portugal from the front pressed him 

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:20.999
 take another 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:22.829
 of personality 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.900
 we are left with that black form that is not really a form 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:27.699
 black 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:30.499
 pelé was in the team and the inner part 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:34.829
 if we take people come here material appears outside 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.760
 we must then who comes will have normal 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.929
 so that the material can appear in the game 

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:42.769
 so I'll select 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.639
 the multi-purpose front here 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:47.249
 I think I will 

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:49.189
 click on freight that goes 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:50.389
 toggle 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:51.939
 reverse to normal 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:56.659
 then I'll also click on tight will highlight the polygon 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:01.790
 transforming separate objects so I can apply different materials 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:02.829
 month 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:04.590
 I'll get another one now. 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.889
 knows 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:07.179
 have faith art 

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:10.319
 finally the bottom 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.019
 petacchi 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.169
 so we now have the three objects with the norm where 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.479
 three highlighted objects 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.109
 let's create the materials 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.109
 I'm going to open the materials auditor here. 

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:26.979
 the first selected lots 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.300
 let's apply the images you downloaded and 

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:33.800
 for her 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.969
 to apply 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:41.129
 the phases then select the same art we will open the team the session of woods 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:43.819
 torsten hinrichs as colleagues 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:45.300
 click on the name 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.659
 then we will harvest a net pitra motif object 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:53.449
 we then navigate to the folder 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:58.229
 where was unzipped file you'll think I'll get here now it's 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:00.870
 more up by jotapeg 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.650
 stupid on my street 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:03.800
 up 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.819
 for organization purposes 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:09.469
 you unfortunately press that the sun by citing the date on which the port 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:12.469
 the material is visible when applying 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.789
 they do the same thing as the second roth game 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:17.689
 How do you know about shipments? 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:20.809
 and I queued at the time of dread 

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:22.189
 front 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:24.949
 reno half way forward 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:26.599
 ecclestone here 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:28.789
 found on wood 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:32.520
 finally the third objects and beings were lots in the woods 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:34.400
 sorry tail 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.190
 just in time 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.550
 pedro grandson 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:39.979
 renowned clean 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:41.659
 the term 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:43.409
 click here 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:46.020
 justina 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.610
 we have all three materials 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.180
 ready to be applied in the 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.300
 let's go 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.509
 they simply lost because other side here 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:57.719
 I'll pay the top view. 

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:00.210
 clicking and dragging to 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.439
 the polygon 

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:03.650
 that the smoker is expected 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:04.869
 you come here 

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:07.800
 obvious rotates projections 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.139
 correct 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:12.240
 we have to come here showing the collation 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.380
 here in parameter w here I will put 90 degrees 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:19.389
 and then placing it in the correct position 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.200
 then I'll get the lots now 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.619
 with the picture in front I will bring to you chose and pediatricians 

00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:28.740
 it's loose 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.270
 you see that already is positioned correct form is not because it was precisely 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:37.159
 The next step we will now take the image to the terral 

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:38.409
 I'm going to bring 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:41.240
 for another object 2 kilo 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.559
 The party will be high. 

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:44.219
 say team 

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:47.499
 tuning cd that had radu patra gets up 

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:50.499
 hitting the image of me on the movie scene 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.480
 so here in the case of serve that change the said parameter 

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:58.779
 to 180 degrees 

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:01.279
 now we have then 

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:04.339
 the maps all positioned 

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:06.639
 run 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:07.500
 we can then 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.279
 close 

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:12.089
 now just get injured 

00:07:12.089 --> 00:07:15.449
 are you here to be-the relief from being injured 

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:18.779
 all objects 

00:07:18.779 --> 00:07:22.909
 explains that in the last three phases injured furquin in the panel of ten 

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:24.689
 litigation 

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:29.649
 The first thing I'll uncheck and found was said to have already cleared 

00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:31.089
 this here 

00:07:31.089 --> 00:07:32.560
 whoever I go will follow 

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.309
 Click Here! 

00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:36.520
 Quite, I did it. 

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.879
 with ice the three polygonal forse 

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:44.719
 We can now 

00:07:44.719 --> 00:07:47.839
 watching the pictures have been sitting is one of the views 

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:50.979
 we are ready 

00:07:50.979 --> 00:07:52.090
 but it's not 

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:55.090
 our tradition 

00:07:57.649 --> 00:07:58.960
 the vaccine 

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.759
 beta 1a form 

00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:03.219
 the real 

00:08:03.219 --> 00:08:04.189
 in other places
