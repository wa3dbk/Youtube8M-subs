the loop over the back and I'm going to

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.500 
the loop over the back and I'm going to
pick<00:01:07.550> up<00:01:08.980> the<00:01:09.980> loop<00:01:10.340> or<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:10.700> mesh<00:01:11.120> that<00:01:11.360> was

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
pick up the loop or the mesh that was

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.830 
pick up the loop or the mesh that was
initially<00:01:11.930> formed<00:01:12.970> so<00:01:13.970> I'm<00:01:14.090> bringing<00:01:14.630> the

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
initially formed so I'm bringing the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.780 
initially formed so I'm bringing the
needle<00:01:16.090> through<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:17.390> first<00:01:18.230> mesh<00:01:18.680> around<00:01:19.310> the

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
needle through the first mesh around the

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.690 
needle through the first mesh around the

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
back of the first mesh and then through

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.940 
back of the first mesh and then through
the<00:01:22.970> first<00:01:23.210> mesh<00:01:23.660> and<00:01:26.350> tighten<00:01:27.350> the<00:01:27.440> knot<00:01:27.650> up

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
the first mesh and tighten the knot up

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.050 
the first mesh and tighten the knot up
to<00:01:28.160> the<00:01:28.280> net<00:01:28.460> board<00:01:30.220> okay<00:01:31.220> I<00:01:31.630> now<00:01:32.630> need<00:01:32.990> to

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
to the net board okay I now need to

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.020 
to the net board okay I now need to
increase<00:01:35.060> a<00:01:35.450> mesh<00:01:36.320> as<00:01:36.680> I'm<00:01:37.250> going<00:01:37.430> to<00:01:37.520> increase

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
increase a mesh as I'm going to increase

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.590 
increase a mesh as I'm going to increase
my<00:01:38.180> meshes<00:01:38.870> of<00:01:39.050> nine<00:01:39.380> on<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:40.190> first<00:01:40.460> row<00:01:40.790> to<00:01:41.030> 11

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
my meshes of nine on the first row to 11

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.710 
my meshes of nine on the first row to 11
on<00:01:42.080> the<00:01:42.500> second<00:01:42.950> row<00:01:43.130> and<00:01:43.430> I'm<00:01:44.210> going<00:01:44.450> to<00:01:44.510> do

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
on the second row and I'm going to do

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.990 
on the second row and I'm going to do
this<00:01:44.960> by<00:01:45.260> increasing<00:01:45.680> your<00:01:46.070> mesh<00:01:46.400> on<00:01:46.940> the

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
this by increasing your mesh on the

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.920 
this by increasing your mesh on the
first<00:01:47.930> or<00:01:48.820> at<00:01:49.820> the<00:01:49.970> left-hand<00:01:50.450> edge<00:01:50.630> and<00:01:50.840> the

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
first or at the left-hand edge and the

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.310 
first or at the left-hand edge and the
right-hand<00:01:51.350> edge<00:01:51.530> of<00:01:51.680> them<00:01:51.800> at<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.310> net<00:01:53.320> okay

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
right-hand edge of them at the net okay

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.850 
right-hand edge of them at the net okay
so<00:01:54.620> the<00:01:55.070> knot<00:01:55.520> I've<00:01:56.360> initially<00:01:56.930> tied<00:01:57.170> I'm

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
so the knot I've initially tied I'm

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.570 
so the knot I've initially tied I'm
going<00:01:58.250> to<00:01:58.370> bring<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:59.180> needle<00:01:59.690> back<00:02:00.470> through

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
going to bring the needle back through

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.350 
going to bring the needle back through
that<00:02:01.580> mesh<00:02:01.940> and<00:02:02.440> pull<00:02:03.440> it<00:02:03.560> tight<00:02:03.940> so<00:02:04.940> I<00:02:04.970> now

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
that mesh and pull it tight so I now

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.120 
that mesh and pull it tight so I now
have<00:02:05.720> two<00:02:06.620> meshes<00:02:07.240> coming<00:02:08.240> off<00:02:08.390> one<00:02:09.130> initial

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
have two meshes coming off one initial

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.210 
have two meshes coming off one initial
mesh<00:02:10.399> and<00:02:10.840> to<00:02:11.840> tie<00:02:12.020> that<00:02:12.230> off<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.680> same

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
mesh and to tie that off the same

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.380 
mesh and to tie that off the same
a<00:02:13.450> twine<00:02:14.450> goes<00:02:14.720> over<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.200> back<00:02:15.410> and<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:17.180> evil

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
a twine goes over the back and the evil

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.080 
a twine goes over the back and the evil
comes<00:02:17.600> around<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:18.020> back<00:02:18.050> of<00:02:18.230> two<00:02:18.710> and<00:02:19.040> then<00:02:19.880> in

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
comes around the back of two and then in

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.200 
comes around the back of two and then in
between<00:02:20.270> the<00:02:20.960> two<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.430> then<00:02:22.430> tighten<00:02:23.030> that

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
between the two and then tighten that

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.030 
between the two and then tighten that
off<00:02:25.240> okay<00:02:26.240> and<00:02:26.300> then<00:02:26.450> I<00:02:26.510> just<00:02:26.540> pick<00:02:26.900> up<00:02:27.080> all<00:02:27.980> of

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
off okay and then I just pick up all of

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.830 
off okay and then I just pick up all of
the<00:02:28.460> next<00:02:28.790> meshes<00:02:29.500> until<00:02:30.500> I<00:02:30.530> get<00:02:31.690> to<00:02:32.690> the

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
the next meshes until I get to the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.200 
the next meshes until I get to the
second<00:02:33.290> from<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.530> end<00:02:33.650> and<00:02:34.190> then<00:02:35.000> I<00:02:35.090> will

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
second from the end and then I will

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.250 
second from the end and then I will
increase<00:02:35.600> another<00:02:36.530> mesh<00:02:37.600> so<00:02:38.600> round<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:39.020> back

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
increase another mesh so round the back

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.250 
increase another mesh so round the back
of<00:02:39.470> two<00:02:41.110> in<00:02:42.110> between<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.980> two
