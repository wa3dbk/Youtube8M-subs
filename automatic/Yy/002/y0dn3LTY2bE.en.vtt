got is just a painter's pole and going
through<00:00:43.800> my<00:00:44.190> seat<00:00:44.730> but<00:00:45.090> what's<00:00:45.300> really

through my seat but what's really
holding<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.230> place<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:47.070> have<00:00:47.219> my<00:00:47.430> hand

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
holding it in place is I have my hand

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.350 
holding it in place is I have my hand
pump<00:00:48.329> for<00:00:48.750> if<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.410> take<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:49.800> water<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.460> my<00:00:51.180> bag

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
pump for if I take on water in my bag

behind<00:00:51.809> my<00:00:51.960> seat<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.530> have<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.710> little<00:00:53.010> back

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
behind my seat so I have a little back

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.029 
behind my seat so I have a little back
pressure<00:00:53.489> bent<00:00:53.879> across<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.680> gently

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
pressure bent across that and it gently

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.490 
pressure bent across that and it gently
rests<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.730> scupper<00:00:57.180> hole<00:00:57.390> not<00:00:58.020> too<00:00:58.289> much

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
rests in the scupper hole not too much

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.290 
rests in the scupper hole not too much
pressure<00:00:58.800> at<00:00:59.039> all<00:00:59.219> definitely<00:00:59.520> not<00:00:59.940> as<00:01:00.120> much

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
pressure at all definitely not as much

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.939 
pressure at all definitely not as much
as<00:01:00.510> would<00:01:00.899> be<00:01:01.109> on<00:01:01.730> say<00:01:02.730> with<00:01:02.879> my<00:01:03.030> scupper<00:01:03.449> cart

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
as would be on say with my scupper cart

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.520 
as would be on say with my scupper cart
and<00:01:04.949> then<00:01:05.280> at<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.549> top<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:06.180> pole<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.840> took

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
and then at the top of this pole I took

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.530 
and then at the top of this pole I took
this<00:01:07.740> clamp<00:01:08.220> off<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:11.490> cheap<00:01:11.850> fillet<00:01:12.270> board

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
this clamp off of the cheap fillet board

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.710 
this clamp off of the cheap fillet board
of<00:01:12.990> some<00:01:13.229> kind<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.729> kind<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.270> neat<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.420> can

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
of some kind and so kind of neat I can

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.240 
of some kind and so kind of neat I can
use<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:15.930> on<00:01:16.409> maybe<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:18.200> tabletop<00:01:19.200> clamp<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.100> to

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
use that on maybe a tabletop clamp it to

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.700 
use that on maybe a tabletop clamp it to
something<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:21.330> know<00:01:21.479> probably<00:01:22.140> have<00:01:22.350> quite<00:01:22.680> a

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
something you know probably have quite a

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.550 
something you know probably have quite a
few<00:01:22.799> uses<00:01:23.159> for<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.610> in<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.909> future<00:01:24.470> as<00:01:25.470> I

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
few uses for that in the future as I

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.130 
few uses for that in the future as I
come<00:01:25.799> down<00:01:26.360> got<00:01:27.590> just<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.770> another<00:01:29.720> rod<00:01:30.720> holder

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
come down got just a another rod holder

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.730 
come down got just a another rod holder
on<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.320> RAM<00:01:31.590> mount<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.189> then<00:01:32.850> Elite<00:01:33.390> for<00:01:33.750> DSi

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
on a RAM mount and then Elite for DSi

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.030 
on a RAM mount and then Elite for DSi
from<00:01:35.070> Lawrence<00:01:35.460> for<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> fish<00:01:36.090> finder<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:37.040> this

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
from Lawrence for a fish finder and this

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.160 
from Lawrence for a fish finder and this
I<00:01:38.280> put<00:01:38.310> my<00:01:39.350> my<00:01:40.350> transducer<00:01:41.310> on<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:42.150> arm<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:42.960> in

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
I put my my transducer on this arm so in

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.539 
I put my my transducer on this arm so in
case<00:01:43.409> I'm<00:01:43.619> do<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:44.750> it's<00:01:45.750> nice<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.290> can<00:01:46.520> push<00:01:47.520> it

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
case I'm do is it's nice I can push it

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.280 
case I'm do is it's nice I can push it
down<00:01:47.880> stays<00:01:48.329> out<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.720> way<00:01:48.780> while<00:01:49.140> I'm

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
down stays out of the way while I'm

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.710 
down stays out of the way while I'm
fishing<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.979> then<00:01:50.579> if<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.820> need<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.119> pop<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.360> off

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
fishing and then if I need to pop it off

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.039 
fishing and then if I need to pop it off
I<00:01:52.170> can<00:01:52.649> pop<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.070> off<00:01:53.189> already<00:01:53.579> easily<00:01:54.149> throw<00:01:54.899> it

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
I can pop it off already easily throw it

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.219 
I can pop it off already easily throw it
in<00:01:55.140> my<00:01:55.259> rod<00:01:55.470> pod<00:01:55.799> not<00:01:56.759> bad<00:01:57.030> at<00:01:57.240> all

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
in my rod pod not bad at all

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.200 
in my rod pod not bad at all
throw<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.040> my<00:01:59.219> fish<00:01:59.430> finder<00:01:59.850> and<00:01:59.969> if<00:02:00.060> I'm

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
throw that and my fish finder and if I'm

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.389 
throw that and my fish finder and if I'm
coming<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.630> in<00:02:00.750> rough<00:02:00.930> conditions<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:01.740> that's

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
coming in in rough conditions so that's

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.190 
coming in in rough conditions so that's
kind<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:03.180> don't<00:02:03.570> know<00:02:03.719> I'm<00:02:03.780> probably<00:02:04.020> not

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
kind of I don't know I'm probably not

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.700 
kind of I don't know I'm probably not
the<00:02:04.259> ideal<00:02:04.649> setup<00:02:05.340> but<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.930> does<00:02:07.140> work<00:02:07.380> pretty

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
the ideal setup but it does work pretty

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.330 
the ideal setup but it does work pretty
darn<00:02:07.979> well

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
darn well

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.930 
darn well
and<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:09.060> really<00:02:09.390> like<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:10.580> scanning<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.819> the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940
