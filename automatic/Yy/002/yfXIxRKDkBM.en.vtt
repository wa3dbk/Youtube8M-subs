firmer<00:03:27.810> it's<00:03:28.470> all<00:03:28.650> I<00:03:29.010> didn't<00:03:29.609> notice<00:03:29.730> it

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
firmer it's all I didn't notice it

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.740 
firmer it's all I didn't notice it
I<00:03:31.280> thought<00:03:31.550> to<00:03:31.910> point<00:03:32.180> o<00:03:32.300> is<00:03:32.450> certainly<00:03:32.690> a

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
I thought to point o is certainly a

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.500 
I thought to point o is certainly a
little<00:03:32.930> softer<00:03:33.260> than<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:33.440> one<00:03:33.680> or<00:03:33.860> 1.5<00:03:34.510> this

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
little softer than the one or 1.5 this

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.100 
little softer than the one or 1.5 this
one<00:03:35.750> feels<00:03:36.050> really<00:03:36.410> really<00:03:36.620> similar<00:03:36.920> to<00:03:37.070> me

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
one feels really really similar to me

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.810 
one feels really really similar to me

which<00:03:42.560> weekend<00:03:42.740> in<00:03:42.830> a<00:03:42.920> second<00:03:43.220> this<00:03:43.610> one<00:03:43.790> does

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
which weekend in a second this one does

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.700 
which weekend in a second this one does
feel<00:03:44.300> faster<00:03:44.780> than<00:03:44.930> two<00:03:45.110> point<00:03:45.290> oh<00:03:45.440> I

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:45.710 
feel faster than two point oh I

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.790 
feel faster than two point oh I
definitely<00:03:46.040> focus<00:03:46.520> on<00:03:46.610> quicker<00:03:46.910> in<00:03:47.090> it<00:03:47.800> so

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
definitely focus on quicker in it so

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.980 
definitely focus on quicker in it so
maybe<00:03:49.010> that<00:03:49.220> had<00:03:49.340> to<00:03:49.430> do<00:03:49.550> with<00:03:49.580> it<00:03:49.820> they<00:03:50.720> say

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990 
maybe that had to do with it they say

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.780 
maybe that had to do with it they say
that<00:03:51.020> this<00:03:51.350> shoe<00:03:51.650> is<00:03:51.680> three<00:03:52.370> tons<00:03:52.550> of<00:03:52.640> an<00:03:52.700> ounce

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
that this shoe is three tons of an ounce

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.130 
that this shoe is three tons of an ounce
lighter<00:03:53.060> than<00:03:53.240> the<00:03:53.330> freezer<00:03:53.630> so<00:03:53.930> they<00:03:54.050> have

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
lighter than the freezer so they have

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.460 
lighter than the freezer so they have
yet<00:03:54.290> made<00:03:54.590> it<00:03:54.710> lighter<00:03:54.890> again<00:03:55.400> I<00:03:56.330> wait<00:03:56.930> my<00:03:56.960> size

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
yet made it lighter again I wait my size

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.140 
yet made it lighter again I wait my size
14<00:03:58.010> shoe<00:03:58.280> because<00:03:58.460> we<00:03:58.580> get<00:03:58.700> most<00:03:58.880> websites

with most companies on it when they do

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.150 
with most companies on it when they do
that<00:04:00.770> they<00:04:01.340> weigh<00:04:01.460> like<00:04:01.580> a<00:04:01.670> size<00:04:01.820> nine<00:04:02.920> my<00:04:03.920> size

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
that they weigh like a size nine my size

difference whether that's the

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.850 
difference whether that's the
magnification<00:04:08.570> of<00:04:08.630> the<00:04:08.690> bigger<00:04:08.900> size<00:04:09.170> who

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760
