00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.470
 Jalloh Julian Frigger he does not lure the post office and today I'll show you 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.519
 times the transport was 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.659
 Often close-up of those including this process walk away from us-tor 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:19.580
 Ceku is there is a good password for managing schulze-wethmar one can 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:23.689
 enlisting the rail distributed at the center circle simultaneously pulls the session 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:24.759
 later again 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.539
 Mor for a first to what Accola Sistem from that one here 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.250
 the log-in data you saved was extremely new in this room 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.340
 Browser can open 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.190
 Logically, the password SC I have my mine 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.720
 Heldt's demeaning now allows more bits to call the browser via the 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.940
 Globe icon 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.630
 and 12 should be the result 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.650
 the rounds around 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.500
 at the same time the input field User took 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.139
 and then dumb 

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:53.139
 Sweet rescue on password 

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:54.820
 that still happens 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.820
 and burned around the third eye Martius Pass 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.540
 and around 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.870
 then you can log in without typing anything it means once in 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.360
 this program ICOS goal given to a 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.640
 that works actually and very well 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.470
 yes and what the percentage of what this browser still can is that thanks 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.110
 can search 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.170
 that is, backtesting daimler-boss breaks not up here 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.310
 Stein but what break communicates next to the PC via controller 11 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.460
 to look for things 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.210
 Kids would also come to Macs of a test u2 and that was gone 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.820
 the books alone 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.430
 come 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.359
 Why 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:44.460
 this is clearly Brecht's smash hit 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.670
 and ensures that even the children kick 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.670
 the more further about Tim twice 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.530
 something like it is still can take a day off 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.990
 that should not own this version unlocked so again 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.910
 around 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.520
 rather a framework percent WAG resin however it could have been 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.730
 only let it activate 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.700
 can not guarantee that it worked out in euros around even autumn 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.549
 go on Plus uncomfortable a new day 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.429
 then you can enter 

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:18.109
 for example proof blocked e 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:22.089
 and for others here because there where it blog in another fact 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.469
 Of course the other function is also complete with indium 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:30.469
 new Central Committee new construction Accord Salzmann 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:32.989
 Bodo around 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:33.719
 Hero 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:39.049
 the whole even as today put the left m to send or to 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.620
 Performer support that's also very rare that I have her here around 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.479
 later 

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:46.079
 want to read 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.409
 Andritz Schloss Guttenburg with accurate water Lutz Bremer sent 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:55.919
 what could be more beautiful in the future maybe the bag integration 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:58.349
 then you can send it to representatives or send the 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.049
 facebook integration so that can be a very cool feature otherwise 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.249
 for a break already relatively good if you buy this seven athletes 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:09.479
 For free there is just an e-mail to the developer 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.629
 Trader email address 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:16.499
 I'll give you Chen in the blog post in the youtube video 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:23.249
 In the year the app should be available to Jacksons of a Cologne to find below 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:25.889
