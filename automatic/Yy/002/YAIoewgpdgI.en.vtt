00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.880
 very well let's start 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.949
 only a few simple steps will follow 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.150

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.150
 video description 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.180
 I do not know why I get this from putting 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.040
 code for the download is weird but if 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.680
 you get the same thing that I do 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.340
 write that fucking code until it comes out 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.340
 the discharge 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.520
 and ready just give him in download and he 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.340
 will start to download the rar file 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.490
 only weighs 106 megabytes take your 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.490
 weather 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.320
 once they have downloaded the 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.140
 file will be a file rar 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.409
 they give you anti click and extract here is to bring 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.409
 here 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.040
 and they will have this folder where 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.030
 you will find samplers intros effects 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.030
 poses and much more 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.300
 and well this part is optional just for 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.790
 those who do not know how to load their sampler 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.460
 or effects and the rest those who already know what 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.940
 you can omit thanks and do not forget 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.450
 the little brother up if you liked the video 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:13.280
 let's continue click on sant claire's 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.800
 you click on this circuit and load 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.319
 and they look for the file that we download and 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.860
 we extract for example I extracted it in the 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.860
 desk 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.940
 they open it and they only choose the sampler or 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.940
 what effect they want 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.170
 for example I chose a sampler from 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.060
 Reggaeton and that's it, that's all, I'll do something 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.060
 of mixing to see that it works 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.590

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.569

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:45.329
