00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.630
 hello friends of treats in reviews I am mar 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.160
 and we are with fernanda more faithful finished 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.860
 transgrancanaria we were doing 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:20.210
 the support we could only assist her in two 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:22.130
 controls was forced to stop and we 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.390
 will explain a bit what happened 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:29.620
 the support as well was the support 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.620
 have to train a little more 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:37.190
 well more or less we could say that at 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.960
 principle did not work out but then you 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.360
 we leave comfortably in house of we take care of 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.760
 ok let's call what happened in the race 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.120
 well first thank you had all the 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:51.079
 Support fantastic seat support and 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:55.010
 the joke is that he has done the most and 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:58.520
 very well since from the beginning then 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.500
 He is already out of strength, that is, he was already 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.739
 they brought channel was to try them and 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.030
 here I did not come trained, it came a little 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.460
 plus 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.190
 of the rest of aconcagua without support and 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:15.470
 train for that race and the truth that 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:18.290
 to 625 km with more than 8000 positives is 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.940
 very strong although I already have a memory 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.220
 of the body not all the training that 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.020
 I did in December and January but now in 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.170
 February for me one month has passed 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.960
 very difficult with physical problems and 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.460
 also emotional or it has been clear 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.990
 without reflection a career as hard as 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.330
 here not here you have to be very much 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.490
 balanced in every way and with 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:41.430
 a lot of effort, not if you want to fight 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:47.010
 to win or to be in the head 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:49.980
 good if not and eight hours trying for 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.950
 the philosophy of running because instance 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.409
 children 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.960
 I left deployed to get out of two 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.570
 races has abandoned two races and 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.479
 I do not like I like to run and although 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.130
 I had bad feelings I was looking for 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.780
 hope to change the feeling and 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.850
 sight for better and to enjoy a 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.009
 little but in the end it was enjoy being 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.080
 percent and percent is offered or 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.300
 that's why I saw myself in the conditions of 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.290
 get out of the race and recover well 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.450
 for the next goal 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.459
 well I remember that we were 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.400
 waiting and you appeared there 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.260
 I remember trying to cheer you up and saying 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.290
 we are not going 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.480
 Well, the next objectives are not 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.670
 final when one leaves and says good 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.500
 I'm leaving but I need something new and 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.150
 I remember that already in the car itself 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.829
 you were explaining I have to do more 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.120
 things I want to do more things 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.250
 I have desire this has not gone well 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.810
 but I'm going to do others which is what 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.319
 next thing you're going to do without clear is 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.079
 how am I trying to do it you 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.670
 facebook tour as I have spent and good 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:53.349
 I'm clear as I did not 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.569
 transgrancanaria because I had had 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.939
 while I was running I thought well if I did not 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.530
 finished that career I'll have to do it 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:02.530
 not then and of course I have some 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:06.790
 options like australia or yesterday that is 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.620
 July and this Europe then Mount Fuji or if 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.019
 Right now I'm studying how I know 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.959
 how will my recovery be from here and how 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.430
 will be my next goal not maybe in 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.680
 australia because it's a race that already 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.300
 I know what climate is also favorable 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.000
 for me that I am more than warm 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.370

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.330
