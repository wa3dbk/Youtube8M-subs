00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
from the gelatos mist maker set I filled

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.880 
from the gelatos mist maker set I filled
it<00:00:35.850> about<00:00:36.059> half<00:00:36.360> way<00:00:36.630> full<00:00:36.899> with<00:00:36.960> water<00:00:37.500> and

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
it about half way full with water and

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.650 
it about half way full with water and
I'm<00:00:38.430> just<00:00:38.489> going<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.790> use<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.090> back<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.300> an<00:00:39.570> old

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
I'm just going to use the back of an old

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.110 
I'm just going to use the back of an old
paintbrush<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.440> scoop<00:00:40.710> up<00:00:40.920> quite<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.640> bit<00:00:41.879> of

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
paintbrush to scoop up quite a bit of

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.110 
paintbrush to scoop up quite a bit of
the<00:00:42.390> texture<00:00:43.110> luxe<00:00:43.460> into<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.579> bottle<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.030> you

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
the texture luxe into the bottle and you

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.670 
the texture luxe into the bottle and you
just<00:00:45.300> kind<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.539> got<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.750> tap<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.500> it's

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
just kind of got to tap it in it's

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.920 
just kind of got to tap it in it's
pretty<00:00:46.890> thick<00:00:47.250> texture<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:48.030> mean<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:48.629> can<00:00:48.840> be

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
pretty thick texture I mean this can be

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.959 
pretty thick texture I mean this can be
used<00:00:49.079> with<00:00:49.230> stencils<00:00:49.770> on<00:00:50.100> canvases<00:00:50.700> there's<00:00:50.910> a

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
used with stencils on canvases there's a

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.610 
used with stencils on canvases there's a
ton<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.239> different<00:00:51.420> uses<00:00:51.750> but<00:00:51.960> today<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.320> wanted

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
ton of different uses but today I wanted

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.459 
ton of different uses but today I wanted
to<00:00:52.680> make<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.949> mist<00:00:53.280> with<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.989> I<00:00:54.989> am<00:00:55.020> just

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
to make a mist with it and I am just

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.080 
to make a mist with it and I am just
scooping<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.579> then<00:00:56.670> using<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
scooping it in and then using the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.880 
scooping it in and then using the
paintbrush<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.629> really<00:00:57.870> push<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.109> down<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.680> I

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
paintbrush to really push it down in I

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.180 
paintbrush to really push it down in I
would<00:00:59.399> say<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.609> did<00:01:00.090> six<00:01:00.780> or<00:01:00.960> seven<00:01:01.379> large

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
would say I did six or seven large

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.160 
would say I did six or seven large
scoops<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.480> then<00:01:03.570> just<00:01:03.719> kind<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.930> pressed

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
scoops in and then just kind of pressed

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.570 
scoops in and then just kind of pressed
it<00:01:04.320> down<00:01:04.350> into<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.830> water<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.280> then<00:01:05.369> kept

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
it down into the water and then kept

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.179 
it down into the water and then kept
scooping<00:01:06.060> until<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.390> filled<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.530> more<00:01:07.860> of

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
scooping until it filled in the more of

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.630 
scooping until it filled in the more of
the<00:01:09.060> texture<00:01:09.390> looks<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.840> apply<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.200> more

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
the texture looks you apply the more

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.399 
the texture looks you apply the more
opaque<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.000> gold<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.659> spray<00:01:12.869> will<00:01:13.049> be<00:01:13.200> if

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
opaque and gold the spray will be if

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.550 
opaque and gold the spray will be if
it's<00:01:13.590> more<00:01:13.830> water<00:01:14.100> it'll<00:01:14.460> be<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.880> looser<00:01:15.869> more

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
it's more water it'll be a looser more

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
it's more water it'll be a looser more
shimmery<00:01:17.490> with<00:01:18.560> less<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.740> an<00:01:19.830> opaque<00:01:20.130> look<00:01:20.369> to

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
shimmery with less of an opaque look to

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.039 
shimmery with less of an opaque look to
it<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:20.880> once<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.240> have<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:21.600> there<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.869> want

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
it so once you have it in there you want

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.170 
it so once you have it in there you want
to<00:01:22.110> shake<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.470> really<00:01:22.799> really<00:01:23.040> well<00:01:23.189> now<00:01:24.150> I

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
to shake it really really well now I

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.910 
to shake it really really well now I
have<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.600> penny<00:01:24.840> black<00:01:25.020> brush<00:01:25.320> stroke<00:01:25.590> stamp

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
have a penny black brush stroke stamp

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.380 
have a penny black brush stroke stamp
here<00:01:26.189> which<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.460> great<00:01:26.610> for<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:26.970> technique

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
here which is great for this technique

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.210 
here which is great for this technique
and<00:01:27.659> I'm<00:01:27.780> coloring<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.259> using<00:01:28.560> stampers<00:01:29.009> big

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
and I'm coloring it using stampers big

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.490 
and I'm coloring it using stampers big
brush<00:01:29.460> pens<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.509> have<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.750> exact<00:01:31.079> colors

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
brush pens and I have the exact colors

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.770 
brush pens and I have the exact colors
listed<00:01:31.920> at<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.159> end<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.549> video<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:33.600> want

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
listed at the end of the video you want

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.420 
listed at the end of the video you want
to<00:01:33.869> work<00:01:34.020> fairly<00:01:34.500> quickly<00:01:34.770> when<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.159> apply

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
to work fairly quickly when you apply

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.520 
to work fairly quickly when you apply
these<00:01:35.490> markers<00:01:36.060> directly<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.960> your<00:01:37.079> stamps

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
these markers directly to your stamps

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.260 
these markers directly to your stamps
because<00:01:37.710> they<00:01:38.070> are<00:01:38.130> India<00:01:38.490> ink<00:01:38.700> they<00:01:38.880> will<00:01:39.090> be

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
because they are India ink they will be

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.510 
because they are India ink they will be
permanent<00:01:39.810> once<00:01:39.960> dry<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.070> have<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.340> little

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
permanent once dry so you have a little

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.039 
permanent once dry so you have a little
bit<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.850> time<00:01:42.180> here<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.540> work<00:01:42.689> with<00:01:42.869> them<00:01:43.020> to

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
bit of time here to work with them to

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.630

shimmer to your stamped image so I'm

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.540 
shimmer to your stamped image so I'm
just<00:02:10.590> pressing<00:02:10.950> real<00:02:11.099> good<00:02:11.250> because<00:02:11.400> there's

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
just pressing real good because there's

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.490 
just pressing real good because there's
a<00:02:11.610> lot<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:11.910> solid<00:02:12.330> area

a lot of solid area

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.170 
a lot of solid area

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.780 
and then it's sort of hard to see on
camera<00:02:15.720> but<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.590> will<00:02:16.890> hold<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.220> up<00:02:17.370> here<00:02:17.550> to<00:02:17.670> see
