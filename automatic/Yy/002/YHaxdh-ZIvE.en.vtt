 talks galera black berry magazine 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.920
 I came here to show you to 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.599
 You are the new app called inep 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.920

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.930
 I'm explaining on this topic, he 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.119
 simply install the files from the 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.830
 android direct on your handset from you 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.410
 do that process that we did a 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.289
 a manual previously 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.390
 it is much simpler to install the 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.940
 android apps now because it prevents 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.100
 clothing too long for you to take vaccine 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.270
 process as it works will show 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.430
 For you, how it works, I'm not going. 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.719
 show where a 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.719
 application called inep 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:56.980
 he is very football he is practically 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:00.430
 one google play prapec br 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.630
 sure it's going here in main season 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.880
 applications 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.340
 He's going to be with us one by one. 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.620
 available applications to give the 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.050
 installation is super simple besides the 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.670
 apps have some games 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.030
 there are several things you can be 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.710
 using it is in your blackberry 10 that 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.320
 You do not find it in the blackberry store. 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.180
 world, then I'll install a 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.760
 application that only to make a test that 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.490
 you take a look that avoids everything 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:31.270
 that constraint is installing and 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.780
 loading is converting apk files 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.950
 in bar point so it saves much the 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.869
 our time 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.520
 anyone who wants to install this version one 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.520
 complete historical past 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:52.920
 when installing here if tomcat goes all 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.920
 world like 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.650
 some photos in a sprint of the screen if 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:04.780
 realize the download button here 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:06.040
 where the download actually here in this 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.510
 process it downloads the file 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:14.140
 apk and writes to your memory card 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:16.360
 After that, they give the 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.200
 people are going to have you and him installed 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:23.410
 practically it loads the application into the 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.709
 yours on your handset so it 's not a hand 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.000
 on the wheel so for those who enjoy 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.350
 for those who like enough application 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.239
 I did not stop 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:36.459
 unfortunately this version of the system 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:42.330
 10.2.1 is 1925 and only late 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.330

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.410
 a little a year too is not so 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.430
 quick as well 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.430
 but it is there normally 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.840
 after this process puts install 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.620

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:18.160
 memory and you will have the option to

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.090
 easy also accepted 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.710
