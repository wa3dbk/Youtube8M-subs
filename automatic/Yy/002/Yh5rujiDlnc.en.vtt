whether or not they just had to run the
race<00:01:52.470> at<00:01:52.619> all<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.920> mean<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.340> would<00:01:53.460> imagine<00:01:53.610> that

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
race at all I mean I would imagine that

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.910 
race at all I mean I would imagine that
NASCAR<00:01:54.450> because<00:01:54.750> it's<00:01:54.930> his<00:01:55.110> most<00:01:55.290> prestigious

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
NASCAR because it's his most prestigious

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.530 
NASCAR because it's his most prestigious
race<00:01:56.100> it's<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.610> richest<00:01:56.939> race<00:01:57.060> it's<00:01:57.420> the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
race it's the richest race it's the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.450 
race it's the richest race it's the
biggest<00:01:57.689> race<00:01:58.049> also<00:01:58.799> referred<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.100> as<00:01:59.250> the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
biggest race also referred to as the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.270 
biggest race also referred to as the
Super<00:01:59.820> Bowl<00:01:59.850> of<00:02:00.180> racing<00:02:00.930> for<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.140> sport<00:02:01.500> you

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
Super Bowl of racing for the sport you

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.440 
Super Bowl of racing for the sport you
know<00:02:02.369> they're<00:02:02.520> expecting<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.119> couple<00:02:03.360> hundred

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
know they're expecting a couple hundred

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.719 
know they're expecting a couple hundred
thousand<00:02:03.930> people<00:02:04.009> both<00:02:05.009> inside<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.399> track

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
thousand people both inside the track

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.340 
thousand people both inside the track
and<00:02:05.909> around<00:02:06.149> no<00:02:06.630> millions<00:02:06.990> are<00:02:07.110> going<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.290> be

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
and around no millions are going to be

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.900 
and around no millions are going to be
tuning<00:02:07.649> in<00:02:07.740> because<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.280> danica<00:02:08.670> fact

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
tuning in because of the danica fact

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.969 
tuning in because of the danica fact
that<00:02:09.209> Danica<00:02:09.539> Patrick<00:02:09.569> factor<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.770> fact

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
that Danica Patrick factor of the fact

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.990 
that Danica Patrick factor of the fact
that<00:02:11.039> she's<00:02:11.280> going<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.489> be<00:02:11.550> making<00:02:11.700> history

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
that she's going to be making history

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.520 
that she's going to be making history
starting<00:02:12.510> from<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.720> front<00:02:12.959> row

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
starting from the front row

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.449 
starting from the front row
so<00:02:13.740> I<00:02:13.770> think<00:02:13.890> it's<00:02:14.160> going<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.310> be<00:02:14.370> very

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
so I think it's going to be very

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.970 
so I think it's going to be very
difficult<00:02:14.850> for<00:02:15.120> NASCAR<00:02:15.660> to<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.500> cancel<00:02:16.890> the

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
difficult for NASCAR to to cancel the

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.100 
difficult for NASCAR to to cancel the
race<00:02:17.100> I<00:02:17.400> wouldn't<00:02:17.940> be<00:02:18.000> surprised<00:02:18.480> if<00:02:18.690> NASCAR

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
race I wouldn't be surprised if NASCAR

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.230 
race I wouldn't be surprised if NASCAR
pushes<00:02:19.470> back<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.830> start<00:02:20.010> time<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.550> few<00:02:21.209> hours

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
pushes back the start time a few hours

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.030 
pushes back the start time a few hours
to<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:22.050> make<00:02:22.200> sure<00:02:22.380> that<00:02:22.590> they<00:02:22.709> have<00:02:22.800> enough

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
to to make sure that they have enough

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.580 
to to make sure that they have enough
time<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.310> repair<00:02:24.270> that<00:02:24.420> retaining<00:02:24.780> wall<00:02:25.080> but

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
time to repair that retaining wall but

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.960 
time to repair that retaining wall but
they<00:02:25.650> have<00:02:25.740> enough<00:02:25.920> time<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.160> fix<00:02:26.550> that<00:02:26.730> catch

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
they have enough time to fix that catch

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.460 
they have enough time to fix that catch
fence<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:27.540> then<00:02:27.600> you<00:02:27.720> guys<00:02:27.870> think<00:02:28.140> about<00:02:28.230> the

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
fence and then you guys think about the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.559 
fence and then you guys think about the
seats<00:02:28.770> that<00:02:29.580> were<00:02:29.670> in<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.880> grandstand<00:02:30.420> that

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
seats that were in the grandstand that

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.720 
seats that were in the grandstand that
were<00:02:30.660> also<00:02:30.989> destroyed<00:02:31.319> I<00:02:31.650> mean<00:02:32.040> if<00:02:32.430> fans

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
were also destroyed I mean if fans

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.000 
were also destroyed I mean if fans
expect<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.750> be<00:02:33.870> able<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:34.200> have<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.739> safe

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
expect to be able to have a safe

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.070 
expect to be able to have a safe
experience<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.880> they<00:02:36.690> want<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:36.959> make<00:02:37.050> sure

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
experience and they want to make sure

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.330
