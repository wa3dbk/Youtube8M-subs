00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
pressure-treated lumber I guess it

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.970 
pressure-treated lumber I guess it
sounded<00:00:26.010> good<00:00:26.099> on<00:00:26.250> paper<00:00:27.439> guy<00:00:28.439> said<00:00:28.619> he<00:00:28.710> did<00:00:28.859> it

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
to make a snowmobile so you could attach

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.340 
to make a snowmobile so you could attach
a<00:00:32.040> snowmobile<00:00:32.640> put<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.420> snowmobile<00:00:33.899> in<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.200> make

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
a snowmobile put a snowmobile in it make

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.930 
a snowmobile put a snowmobile in it make
it<00:00:34.520> four<00:00:35.520> by<00:00:35.760> four<00:00:36.719> feet<00:00:36.870> wide<00:00:37.079> by<00:00:37.760> trophy<00:00:38.760> long
