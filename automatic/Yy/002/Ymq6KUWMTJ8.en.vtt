00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.350
 good to all the friends of gt I am the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.940
 his brother again here with a new 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.740
 episode of this interesting series where 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.980
 we see how weapons evolved to what 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.980
 long of the cot today we touched a small 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.630
 very small weapon that has changed 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.250
 relatively little and that few people use 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.720
 That's right 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.720
 we go with scorpion 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.270
 We are in call of duty 4 first 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.100
 delivery where we see the scorpion and 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.650
 first delivery where disappoints until 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.970
 unsuspected levels we have it 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.770
 available from the beginning of 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.840
 prestige being in the category of 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.300
 main weapons in the section of their 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.580
 fossils is the weapon with which we started 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.470
 in the old school game mode has 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:54.489
 a fairly low damage and a setback 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:58.150
 almost zero and a medium reach your charger 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:00.760
 being 20 bullets is really small 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.559
 to be able to do almost nothing with him his 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.780
 average cadence does not help control 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.270
 the ammunition what becomes very heavy 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.860
 kill enemies with it to say 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.410
 that it is very difficult to kill more than one 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.930
 enemy with a single charger all this 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.550
 combined with that the long animation of 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.530
 the recharge has to be completed 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.229
 everything so that the weapon is recharged makes 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.720
 of the scorpion a whole potato in what 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.729
 effectively refers and leaves us with a bad 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.860
 taste of mouth the accessory more 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.720
 recommended in the red dot sight that 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.520
 greatly improves our accuracy to 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.020
 aim at long distances the 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.039
 silencer that will help us 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.039
 keep us hidden 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.790
 we arrived at black ops and we met 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.920
 with a rather more acceptable scorpion 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.720
 that the view in call of duty 4 indeed 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.030
 there is not much difference in what 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.380
 feature of the weapon refers we see 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.630
 that still has a 20 charger 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.090
 bullets a slightly higher cadence and a 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.670
 slightly higher damage keeping the 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.649
 little recoil that characterizes it we see 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.500
 which is unlocked at level 7 costing 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.770
 2000 with points and that again we see in 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.360
 the section of their rifles then where 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.630
 lies the difference between this version 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.880
 and the code 4 in the accessories where 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.850
 carlos duty 4 we only had 3 accessories 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.069
 here we have a lot more highlighting 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.220
 clearly the extended chargers that 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.260
 they will give us 30 more bullets per loader but 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.819
 especially the dual accessory that we 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.430
 will allow to kill two hands with the 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.350
 cuts is certainly in this before gra 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.510
 where we can say it's good for something 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.640
 although in spite of everything it remains of 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.840
 the worst submachine guns in the saga call of 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.440
 duty 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.709
 and finally friends play modern warfare 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.209
 3 in modern warfare 3 things change 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.780
 Copies are not the weapons section 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.069
 primary but where secondary 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.860
 cataloged as a gun 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.330
 machine gun this is great for you already 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.769
 that this weapon really serves to 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.500
 situations in which we have no other 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.330
 solution because your poor charger 20 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.610
 bullets does not serve to kill very 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.260
 continued is however one of the 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.660
 best weapons to use with the accessory 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.540
 dual due to its effectiveness firing 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.160
 from the hip improving something the 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.750
 cadence with respect to previous 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.660
 deliveries and visually change the 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.280
 wooden handle for a synthetic 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.349
 the big chargers are also a 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.940
 great option and because of its setback to 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.040
 compared to black ops and 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.870
 carlos duty 4 can also be combined 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.110
 with the red dot sight to hit 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.480
 long distances in modern warfare 3 by 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.099
 so although he finally puts her in the 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.220
 category of secondary weapons that 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:34.019
 It should not stand out too much so 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.599
 is another of those weapons that remain in the 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.630
 I forget, although we have already said using the 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:42.420
 in a dual way they are really bestial 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.370
 and this has been the before and after the 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.590
 scorpion in our wings call of duty 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.780
 and seeing them in call of duty 4 black ops 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.370
 in modern warfare 3 and to make you 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.130
 share with you things that we 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.690
 they like it a lot in gt or we would say that 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.340
 comments leave us the following 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.110
 weapons that you want to see in the series before 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.120
 and then any weapon which has 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.610
 out at least 3 call of duty is 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.080
 earlier in this way says goodbye to 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.730
 your brother as you know I have to win 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.530
 personal you can pass us leave us 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.470
 danny the link in the description in a 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:16.160
 annotation and nothing this has been the ante 10 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:16.160
 then of the scorpion only in gt
