00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:14.849
 how to control the deformable 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:21.960
 I made the surface during the exhaust 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:29.580
 simple device it was a lamp attached 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:31.170
 magnets from ordinary speakers since 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.950
 I don't need the ceiling light anymore 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:41.270
 need to eat another so i did here 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.270
 I took such a device from the roulette 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:54.800
 ribbon measuring this 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:59.670
 and now attached and and because body 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.559
 now you can just control by 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.210
 millimeter 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:10.880
 as far as I go 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:13.409
 Iâ€™m not sure about the detail 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:18.540
 for example on i need to pull on 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:23.729
 5 millimeters if I just pull y 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:29.540
 I have no guide no control points 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:36.180
 measurements for in it gives parts of the rack 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:39.750
 so attaching a jack I did here 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:45.930
 tag and on this tag put this one 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:51.189
 here is the device roulette 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:54.430
 when i will naturally pull it 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:56.340
 the distance will increase and not 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.460
 in this way I will control 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.460
 how much 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.140
 leaned only out 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.700
 there are different options here 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.310
 here for example directly directly to 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:15.190
 rack attach something like this 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.380
 he can change the second piece 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:23.650
 how much here is here shot 5 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:25.810
 millimeters of course would be 5 millimeters 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.590
 went to return and therefore do not need somewhere 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.640
 per centimeter 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:35.799
 like that just arbitrarily set and 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:41.380
 here at this point 74 and measure measured 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:46.150
 here the members of cop drank meters and now i 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:49.510
 I can freely pull the rack 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:53.260
 and mistrust when you can see how she left and 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:58.319
 how can she come back can another 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:04.049
 a way to make such a piece 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:08.430
 fasten on a magnet here here attached 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:11.139
 left the joint now when i will pull 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.720
 this distance will also be 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:19.720
 increase between this ribbon this 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:25.660
 just pomer him too find out how 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:27.750
 gone rack there is another option even 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:32.519
 better than this 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:36.420
 you can attach the usual 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:39.040
 telescopic meter antennas and 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.540
 put this lamp somewhere in the back 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:48.150
 fender or front strut when already 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.150
 adjust the length of the telescope 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:55.010
 it will be much more convenient because 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.499
 pulled pull the rack 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.989
 a little bit of rocks goes away so the measurements 

00:03:57.499 --> 00:04:08.060
 will not be completely accurate and he is so 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:12.939
 somewhere shortly and here I will do more 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:17.509
 on the other hand just do the antennas 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:18.579
 here then it will be possible on the meter 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:25.070
 the distance 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:32.410
 measure any items like this 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:32.410
 all good luck to all
