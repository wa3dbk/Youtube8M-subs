00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:27.570
 always argentina went to the world 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.570
 with that aura or with that passion and that 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.000
 desire and prognosis of the fan that 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.000
 could be world champion seems to me 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.620
 that has always been like this maybe this time 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.050
 and now I'll join you with the other one a little more 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.660
 because Messi in the selection was in 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.329
 its splendor and because we play in the 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.339
 backyard that almost as you know 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.280
 local scams what happens that the yard 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:56.930
 Butt is the ultimate winner of football 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.470
 world will have champions 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.330
 and we will be more visitors than ever 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.879
 then it is to think that we are close to 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:08.560
 makes us feel a little local is to 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.560
 backwards we will be very visitor 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:17.369
 like the imagination of being champion of 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:20.069
 world but they watch all this time now 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.560
 have been two or three times 

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:24.659
 and now in this last time because 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.429
 I always had very self-absorbed 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.340
 worried about the fact of the 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:30.959
 classification for the world what 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.090
 we have to consider is to be between 

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:35.250
 get to the end or be 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.060
 among the four teams that would come to 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.000
 be what 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.170
 Argentina that time that comes to us that 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.590
 is the goal that we do not have to 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.590
 pose 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.479
 and if I see it well 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.920
 you have to listen to the coaches 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.329
 listen to the classmates we all know 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.460
 the value they have all 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.020
 coaches want to have all 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.479
 fellow customers of colleagues 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.259
 rivals do not want to face them like that 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.869
 which is the best in the world and I see it well 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:11.599
 I think that of messi fundamentally 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:15.050
 It has been a personal growth from the 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:17.450
 psychic from the maturity of him as 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.200
 person obviously one birthday is going 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:24.230
 maturing maturity brings you peace 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.230
 interior and I suddenly create a 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:32.319
 favorable climate so that for him to 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.319
 feel happy maybe it can be an action 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.120
 an important point that I believe that 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.120
 it needs well 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.930
 it seems that 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.440
 knows what it represents 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.090
 know what it means 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.080
 but I think we have to leave it 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.080
 quiet apart 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.680
 it's a team, this is not necessary 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.079
 load it from a responsibility 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.670
 what does not correspond to him for more 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:06.650
 that is the best player in the world this 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.650
 it's a team it 's a set game 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.810
 attack starts with the archer if 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.790
 we see indigo we see that it attacks with 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.769
 guzmÃ¡n that comes out when from behind and the 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.349
 defense starts with the first forward 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.870
 what do we have to do a little more 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.450
 of equipment and try to play more when the 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.500
 we have from behind tried to mark more 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.500
 when rivals have it
