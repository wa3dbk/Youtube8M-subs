00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:15.235
 Borovets like any other means Bulgarien is famous because it is free, but free does not mean bad 

00:00:15.471 --> 00:00:23.112
 because here you can find many 5 stars hotels and the elevator infrastructure is well developed. 

00:00:31.658 --> 00:00:39.716
 It is located just 75 km from Sofia, which means that you have to drive just an hour to get there. 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.200
 Our first stop is near a very beautiful lake called Iskar. 

00:01:29.013 --> 00:01:36.720
 Samokov is the colsest city from Borovets in just 10 km so we stopped there to buy some stuff. 

00:01:55.484 --> 00:02:01.683
 Borovets known as Chamkoria until the middle of the 20th century was an annoying place for the bulgarien type, 

00:02:01.683 --> 00:02:13.588
 now it is a popular Bulgarian mountain resort located in Sofia Province, on the northern slopes of Rila, at an altitude of 1350 m. 

00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:47.701
 The accommodation is large, almost all hotels are new with a range between 3 and 5 stars. 

00:03:09.785 --> 00:03:12.690
 You can get one like that and get to the top. 

00:03:34.938 --> 00:03:42.735
 If you want mountain trips this is a very good place for you, I will choose the easy way, if you want, you can choose a hard one. 

00:03:51.111 --> 00:03:56.078
 During the summer, people come here for hiking, adventure, listening to the leaves, 

00:03:56.078 --> 00:04:06.275
 to get some fresh air or just to make new friends, because ... here everything is full of life 

00:05:24.796 --> 00:05:32.308
 The elevator infrastructure is new and very good, using the gondola can get up to 2500 m altitude. 

00:05:33.376 --> 00:05:43.198
 The gondola lift has a capacity of 1200 people per hour and the ride takes about 20 minutes. 

00:06:42.801 --> 00:06:50.763
 60 km of marked pistes covered slopes generally face north up to an altitude of 2600 m, 

00:06:29.028 --> 00:06:37.128
 During summer this is a very quiet, but during the winter it is filled with many people 

00:06:51.208 --> 00:06:57.619
 with many interruption runs near the village center allowing skiers almost to their hotel door. 

00:06:58.342 --> 00:07:04.449
 The long run is a 12 km return door to the resort along the maintenance route. 

00:07:11.013 --> 00:07:22.633
 For night skiing there is a special pass elevator that must be purchased separately at kiosks on the pistes. This is valid from 17:00 to 22:00.
