hello guys so as you can see I've got
the<00:02:00.220> hurricane<00:02:00.970> you<00:02:01.330> saw<00:02:01.930> me<00:02:02.140> tune<00:02:02.410> up<00:02:02.620> for

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
the hurricane you saw me tune up for

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.760 
the hurricane you saw me tune up for
drag<00:02:03.160> racing<00:02:03.700> and<00:02:03.970> as<00:02:04.810> usual<00:02:05.380> we're<00:02:05.620> gonna

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
drag racing and as usual we're gonna

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.719 
drag racing and as usual we're gonna
test<00:02:06.220> it<00:02:06.550> on<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.600> runway<00:02:08.110> now<00:02:08.380> and<00:02:08.770> if<00:02:09.640> you

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
test it on the runway now and if you

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.740 
test it on the runway now and if you
could<00:02:09.910> see<00:02:10.179> it's<00:02:10.390> got<00:02:10.630> that<00:02:10.680> fish<00:02:12.210> bubble<00:02:13.210> see

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
could see it's got that fish bubble see

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.830 
could see it's got that fish bubble see
whatever<00:02:14.200> things<00:02:14.830> but<00:02:15.430> I<00:02:15.640> think<00:02:15.760> everyone<00:02:16.450> got

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
whatever things but I think everyone got

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.380 
whatever things but I think everyone got
sent<00:02:17.140> on<00:02:17.320> a<00:02:17.380> hurricane<00:02:17.920> I<00:02:18.250> just<00:02:18.850> left<00:02:19.120> them

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
sent on a hurricane I just left them

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.980 
sent on a hurricane I just left them
because<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:20.080> looked<00:02:20.260> kind<00:02:20.920> of<00:02:21.210> good<00:02:22.210> I<00:02:22.390> guess<00:02:22.660> I

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
because it looked kind of good I guess I

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.880 
because it looked kind of good I guess I
don't<00:02:23.560> know

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
don't know

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.430 
don't know
yeah<00:02:24.580> but<00:02:24.880> basically<00:02:25.300> I<00:02:25.720> haven't<00:02:26.230> actually

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
yeah but basically I haven't actually

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.660 
yeah but basically I haven't actually
tested<00:02:26.920> this<00:02:27.400> online<00:02:28.230> against<00:02:29.230> of<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.430> drag

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
tested this online against of the drag

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.200 
tested this online against of the drag
cars<00:02:31.000> so<00:02:31.360> I've<00:02:31.480> no<00:02:31.720> idea<00:02:31.750> how<00:02:32.230> before<00:02:33.180> but

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
cars so I've no idea how before but

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.580 
cars so I've no idea how before but
it<00:02:35.300> looks<00:02:35.630> trying<00:02:36.350> to<00:02:36.500> promising<00:02:37.130> from<00:02:37.880> this

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
it looks trying to promising from this

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.260 
it looks trying to promising from this
but<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:39.830> doesn't<00:02:40.250> look<00:02:40.430> like<00:02:40.640> it's<00:02:40.850> gonna<00:02:40.970> be

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
but it doesn't look like it's gonna be

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.580 
but it doesn't look like it's gonna be
out<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.530> Alpha<00:02:43.010> because<00:02:43.690> nothing<00:02:44.690> can<00:02:44.960> be<00:02:45.110> the

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
out the Alpha because nothing can be the

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.450 
out the Alpha because nothing can be the

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
the best run because I hit a bus hit

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.850 
the best run because I hit a bus hit
transit<00:03:24.560> van<00:03:24.740> later<00:03:25.210> and<00:03:26.210> yeah<00:03:26.540> it<00:03:26.810> doesn't<00:03:27.020> go

transit van later and yeah it doesn't go
very<00:03:27.890> well

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.390 

I<00:03:36.060> believe<00:03:36.840> I<00:03:36.990> could<00:03:37.050> have<00:03:37.560> got<00:03:37.830> it<00:03:37.980> bye<00:03:38.190> come

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
I believe I could have got it bye come

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.380 
I believe I could have got it bye come
on<00:03:38.610> now<00:03:38.880> faster<00:03:39.510> or<00:03:39.630> something<00:03:39.810> because<00:03:40.410> I

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
on now faster or something because I

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.450 
on now faster or something because I
lose<00:03:42.390> quite<00:03:42.780> a<00:03:42.840> lot<00:03:43.140> of<00:03:43.260> speed<00:03:43.590> just<00:03:44.040> hitting

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
lose quite a lot of speed just hitting

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.480 
lose quite a lot of speed just hitting
stuff<00:03:44.730> constantly<00:03:45.860> until<00:03:46.860> I<00:03:46.920> get<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.370> the

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
stuff constantly until I get to the

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:54.410 
stuff constantly until I get to the
downhill

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:07.800 

oh<00:03:55.700> really<00:03:56.700> need<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.120> drink

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.280 

so<00:04:08.050> they<00:04:08.319> can<00:04:08.500> hit<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:08.770> vine<00:04:08.980> now

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
so they can hit the vine now

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:21.090 
so they can hit the vine now
well

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100
