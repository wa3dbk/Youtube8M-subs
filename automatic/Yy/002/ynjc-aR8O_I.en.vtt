00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.250

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
aren't vocal cords just fantastic

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.870 
aren't vocal cords just fantastic
now<00:00:19.260> this<00:00:19.470> may<00:00:19.770> seem<00:00:20.039> like<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.400> could<00:00:20.550> be<00:00:20.670> very

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
now this may seem like it could be very

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.599 
now this may seem like it could be very
difficult<00:00:21.119> but<00:00:21.630> it's<00:00:21.779> not<00:00:22.109> how<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:22.890> learned<00:00:23.340> was

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
difficult but it's not how I learned was

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.300 
difficult but it's not how I learned was
I<00:00:23.699> looked<00:00:24.060> at<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.810> ways<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.740> dog<00:00:25.980> actually

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
I looked at the ways that a dog actually

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.870 
I looked at the ways that a dog actually
barks<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.869> bark<00:00:28.470> from<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.070> dog<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.699> made<00:00:30.300> by

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
barks so a bark from a dog is made by

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.170 
barks so a bark from a dog is made by
air<00:00:32.880> being<00:00:33.600> pushed<00:00:34.200> with<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.829> diaphragm<00:00:35.190> out

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
air being pushed with the diaphragm out

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.790 
air being pushed with the diaphragm out
through<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.660> mouth<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.170> through<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.590> teeth

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
through the mouth and through the teeth

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.950 
through the mouth and through the teeth
which<00:00:38.460> on<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> dog<00:00:38.940> are<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.239> lot<00:00:39.420> longer<00:00:39.600> and

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
which on a dog are a lot longer and

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.630 
which on a dog are a lot longer and
closer<00:00:40.170> together<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:40.590> they<00:00:40.860> make<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.129> R<00:00:41.250> sound

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
closer together so they make the R sound

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.220 
closer together so they make the R sound
at<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.820> beginning<00:00:42.210> which<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.629> what<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.050> want

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
at the beginning which is what you want

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.910 
at the beginning which is what you want
to<00:00:43.290> do<00:00:43.410> like<00:00:47.180> so<00:00:48.180> just<00:00:48.360> like<00:00:48.539> open<00:00:49.530> round<00:00:49.680> like

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
to do like so just like open round like

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.150 
to do like so just like open round like
this<00:00:50.100> can<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.730> teeth<00:00:50.910> like<00:00:51.949> again<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.100> that

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
this can you teeth like again of that

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.490 
this can you teeth like again of that
and<00:00:53.840> then<00:00:54.840> practice<00:00:55.770> going<00:00:55.949> ha<00:00:56.640> ha<00:00:57.629> with<00:00:58.320> your

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
and then practice going ha ha with your

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.590 
and then practice going ha ha with your
diaphragm<00:00:58.800> like<00:00:59.460> moving<00:00:59.969> with<00:01:00.090> their<00:01:00.239> stomach

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
diaphragm like moving with their stomach

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.750 
diaphragm like moving with their stomach
you<00:01:00.899> want<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.260> move<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.430> can<00:01:02.550> get<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
you want it to move so you can get the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.420 
you want it to move so you can get the
air<00:01:02.879> pushed<00:01:03.210> out<00:01:03.890> another<00:01:04.890> thing<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.250> dogs

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
air pushed out another thing that dogs

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.490 
air pushed out another thing that dogs
do<00:01:05.880> when<00:01:06.390> they<00:01:06.510> bark<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.900> they<00:01:06.990> sort<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.260> let

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
do when they bark is they sort of let

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.570 
do when they bark is they sort of let
some<00:01:07.710> air<00:01:07.890> go<00:01:08.130> into<00:01:08.340> their<00:01:08.490> cheeks<00:01:08.790> let's<00:01:09.720> just

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
some air go into their cheeks let's just

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.560 
some air go into their cheeks let's just
because<00:01:11.580> then<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.909> kind<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.180> makes<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.420> sound

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
because then that kind of makes it sound

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.080 
because then that kind of makes it sound
more<00:01:12.689> realistic<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.409> more<00:01:13.740> like<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.760> generic

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
more realistic and more like the generic

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.340 
more realistic and more like the generic
wolf<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:16.250> suppose<00:01:17.630> and<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.930> other<00:01:19.080> thing<00:01:19.229> is

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
wolf I suppose and the other thing is

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.600 
wolf I suppose and the other thing is
let<00:01:19.530> some<00:01:19.680> air<00:01:19.860> go<00:01:20.130> through<00:01:20.159> your<00:01:20.430> nasal

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
let some air go through your nasal

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.760 
let some air go through your nasal
cavities<00:01:21.330> because<00:01:21.810> that'll<00:01:22.229> make<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.409> sound<00:01:22.710> a

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
cavities because that'll make it sound a

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.490 
cavities because that'll make it sound a
little<00:01:22.799> more<00:01:23.009> lifelike<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.960> I<00:01:24.960> strongly

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
little more lifelike and I strongly

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.910 
little more lifelike and I strongly
advise<00:01:26.009> keeping<00:01:26.700> some<00:01:27.090> water<00:01:27.630> near<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.409> well

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
advise keeping some water near you well

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.740 
advise keeping some water near you well

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
you do this or else you may your vocal

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.819

cords<00:01:33.930> are<00:01:33.960> gonna<00:01:34.079> dry<00:01:34.350> out<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.710> they'll

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
cords are gonna dry out and they'll

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.190 
cords are gonna dry out and they'll
start<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.100> hurt<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.549> don't<00:01:35.579> want<00:01:35.880> that

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
worry so much about making the whoop

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.569 
worry so much about making the whoop
sound<00:01:56.939> because<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:58.079> will<00:01:58.350> happen<00:01:58.799> as<00:01:59.280> soon

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
sound because that will happen as soon

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.730 
sound because that will happen as soon
as<00:01:59.729> air<00:02:00.000> moves<00:02:00.600> through<00:02:00.899> your<00:02:01.020> vocal<00:02:01.380> cords
