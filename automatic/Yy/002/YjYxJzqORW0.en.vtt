00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.420
 and suddenly it's the loser who 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.970
 choose the map and vasili station 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.500
 living and already knows it's a 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.180
 super interesting map where there is 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.759
 always beautiful games so two 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.960
 spots with the gold but above all it's 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:32.349
 a map where herbs are often 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:33.820
 victimize for a joke of our little ones 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.330
 she was really bad but hey I'm going 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.760
 say it like that 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.860
 I'm waiting for them to go there 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.120
 is the triple we saw it says it must 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:45.899
 that drop and david kim wan besides I 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.899
 not found it turns 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.500
 so here are our little hearts to do these 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.079
 three poles and I do not know what is it 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.250
 life 2 minimath minimath we do not have 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.350
 heard he's already at the bar 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.050
 I do not even know if his opinion is 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.770
 intelligible so if if he wrote a 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.380
 article on it 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.640
 she wrote outright fucking but already 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:15.250
 I did not know they knew how to write and 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:17.630
 then hockey valence and ariege 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.369
 players who are ready to pollock and 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.800
 in the lobby already some surprised 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.290
 when I was told he was older but 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.610
 he did I do not know if you remember 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.070
 but he did an internship with us 1 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:34.130
 minimath with a little he is major 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:35.450
 let's examine you go to prison one day their 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.030
 go out one or two but so suddenly 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.360
 wrote an article about moss nights 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.710
 low but minimal cost he plays serge 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.050
 so he 's not supposed to give the 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.720
 solution 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.770
 yet his article is quite complete 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.000
 he explains three weaknesses of the 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.780
 moss nights and why these units 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.270
 controversial as the cost of timings 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.930
 aerial or blink stalker in middle 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.930
 war there 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:09.300
 thank you moment the waitresses for the bad they 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:13.200
 have changed well it's free for you 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:26.970
 manual they lost to football and 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:30.600
 blow health in the room jeantet and one 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.820
 left on a residential station or 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.320
 left of the map one for the team at do 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.680
 you know the young player 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:41.400
 the president at the he is what he is 19 years old 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:49.010
 of course president at age 19 this is 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:54.240
 of a trade and on the right the young player 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:58.500
 the honor of the prog french minister the 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.000
 proof with its representative color of 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.980
 I do not know that we will ask him after 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.550
 the rose of course picnic 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.900
 he has pink ray of Korean and 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.910
 best tournaments in the world 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.910
 this is the fuss 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:20.870
 stefano that arouses excitement at 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:26.660
 men as in women a 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:29.480
 complete man is here and there we see a 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.450
 forge a muck before a nexus while 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.850
 stephano and we see a second clean 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.080
 who sent and we will not talk too much 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.880
 strong because there are stories of 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.500
 helmets and everything and you see what I 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:45.340
 mean wait this has been seen of course 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.080
 it's a photon rush from m6 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.950
 you go to the connoisseurs who think 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.500
 that I have to turn I see go to that 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.850
 is part of the game it's part of the game 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.740
 like moss nights and it can be 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.030
 a lot of the game even though when 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.850
 even if you withdrew him 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.380
 the photon is it is as if you have 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.720
 removes at night mosta stefano whatever 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.330
 what is its a bit of unity not your 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.370
 wrinkles like big up chips besides to 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.190
 chips sure a train to make simple 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.620
 edibles whose favorite unit 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.510
 and the photon too and the photo canon the 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.780
 the only unit he builds is the 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.850
 only unit he knows how to build 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.650
 so stefano attention who takes 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.960
 blow a base on the mouth and 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.669
 frankly it's not stupid if he gets to 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:37.560
 to prevent this golf from being faulted 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:41.130
 just come on and we bring to the ats 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.370
 stefan top left of right to se 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.389
 close 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:50.060
 and the reason and that was when room here 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:51.949
 so watch out though is honest 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.690
 so I remember that this is the map of m6 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:58.430
 and m6 who chose seven colors drones 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:01.810
 to Stephanois who dreams of high value 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.480
 pop and a hatch somewhere 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:08.820
 no it seems complicated to me anyway or 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.820
 so he'll just do a rech drone 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:26.540
 gg though you had not told us about 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.190
 what against it does it work 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.510
 walk but I thought there was 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.010
 balls I'm retired this is 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:35.180
 a few months that I have not played and the 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:37.250
 calm without then there we are obliged to 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:49.570
 ask for the response from m6 and after that we 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:52.940
 will do a little break on m6 he gives in 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:55.190
 here you miss college and is very said 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:06:16.040
 bar porter class game with what do 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:20.060
 you have to say building that ask 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:22.690
 if stefano tasted the barrel rush and this 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:25.340
 that he thought of it rather well 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.720
 winner I said it's good taste 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.940
 they are proud and all he launched the 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.590
 thing is it's as if I had to 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.550
 bronze making six hens after I 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.550
 what do you fart 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.410
 the rising tension in any case and on 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.210
 these words of wisdom montpetit pump 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:44.910
 well we will launch the ad we will 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:47.460
 leave for a little twenty 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.800
 minutes to prepare the third game 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.590
 of this bo5 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.610
 everywhere a bo5 that starts from the 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.620
 best of the ways 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.720
 yeah we'll tell you later 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.100
 can check the cocktails at the bar and 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.470
 you can check also we will put 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.250
 the link you can vote for your 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.840
 favorite player 

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:05.990
 and we end up in 15 minutes at all 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.990
 right now
