 like good 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.779
 hello everyone welcome to another video and 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.769
 here is going to be read a boxing to this 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:10.929
 device that I thought was pretty 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:14.289
 interesting I just got there we see that 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:16.510
 it's called windows tv box x 8 and it's brand 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:19.210
 pip we see that he has here two 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:22.120
 features that can be started 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.880
 with windows and with android and if there are 4.4 or 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.640
 be kit kat and here in the back 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.050
 promote technical specifications 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.880
 I'm going to focus a little more closely to 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.960
 let's look at the characteristics good 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.270
 here in the back we can see 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.559
 that this box is multi-language and here 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.999
 is the language that interests us not that 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.949
 is Spanish here we can see some 

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:41.469
 features that are highlighted as 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.780
 example says that the 280 lcd screen 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:46.929
 x 800 we see that there is an intel processor 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.300
 20 quad core we have a ram memory 

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:52.629
 2 GB also more that has dual boot 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.979
 that is windows 8.1 and android so 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.170
 let's uncover this box so that 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:57.850
 let's look at its contents and now without hands to 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.819
 the play 'we are going to uncover this box 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.999
 let's see where he uncovered it by 

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:06.030
 part of here we see that I open it now 

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:09.479
 lift this stage 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.820
 it's a bit difficult, here I opened it and 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.940
 ready and we opened the box we found 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.350
 this a plastic and here we find others 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.200
 here is the input device 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.750
 it's not in a bag let's see what else 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.159
 bring this box here back from like a 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.780
 instruction manual our 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.520
 currently in Chinese I do not know if they can see 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.740
 the Chinese electric but then 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.290
 can be the guarantee I believe if it is the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.920
 guarantee let's leave aside and here it brings 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.110
 as a charger we will not take it out if 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.090
 these as a kind of charger and 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.420
 well do not have anything else here we go to 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.920
 remove this and here there is nothing that is 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.340
 this is all that brings this device 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.440
 now we are going to uncover the device that 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.470
 is in the bag here we find it 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.479
 we see that this device is quite already 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.369
 see very well I'm not loading it is a 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.649
 little heavy seems pretty good seems 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.119
 a software router here we are 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.179
 focusing well here is your screen 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.500
 we see the screen that is lcd and here 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.539
 we can find this antenna that I 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.179
 I think it's the one that admits issuing 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.869
 some information information or to receive 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.340
 anything 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.390
 here in the back we can see 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.790
 that has two usb ports here we see 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.860
 which it has a hdmi port 2 as 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.989
 you can connect a television here is 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.239
 the long port the network port here 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.659
 to connect the charger and here we can 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.819
 see two holes or two ports that is 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:33.430
 one for the usb I think that you can 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.470
 connect a cell phone we have that is the the 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.290
 hole or the appropriate port and here 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.540
 we see a hole for sd card not 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.400
 let's see what else he has here 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.099
 we found a speaker if they are 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.680
 visualizing I do not know and here ahead 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:50.109
 there's nothing else in the back 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.450
 it is totally sealed and in this 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:54.459
 part we find more usb ports is more 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.720
 that there are other portals here and here 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.599
 we found a hole through headphones 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.890
 or headphones and rise and fall of 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.109
 volume since up to the button 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.220
 on see if it lights up like this or if it does not 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.769
 you can connect the charger to 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.450
 connect it to the good source it does not 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.159
 learned so let's go I'm going to connect the 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.180
 charger to the source 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:11.590
 well here I have the device 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.800
 connected to the source now let's 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:18.040
 turn it on press the button here 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.450
 and let's see what happens 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.420
 ready the brand of the device appears 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.950
 and now good in every happen that I have 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.410
 to choose either the two starts 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.920
 not by windows or by android that 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.769
 select android and we see that no 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.230
 start press here and we'll see 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.880
 that already started charging good is to do 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.190
 a boxing of this device I'm going 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.470
 to be evaluating I will be looking 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.319
 its characteristics how it works 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.360
 connected to a television what are your 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.760
 options and then I'm going to make a river to 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.709
 background on this apparatus that the truth 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.410
 So far it gives me a good impression 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.540
 we see that it has a good style besides 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.030
 it works like a mini pc works 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.220
 also like a tv box so if you 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.099
 you get forgiveness if your TV does not 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.440
 it's the kingfisher and it has hdmi port and it 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.420
 connect c's this device and it's going to 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.950
 convert then into smart team so it's 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.620
 pretty useful this little box so 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.940
 soon I will be doing the analysis 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.919
 thoroughly we must here is already telling me 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.540
 to select the language because it 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.040
 started the Android operating system 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.200
 configure configures the same account 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.550
 so then if I do it at the time 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.050
 that link on quite long day so 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.449
 will configure everything 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.310
 in the two profiles windows and android and 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.800
 soon the audio in depth about that 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.319
 apparatus that the truth is quite 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.669
 nice until next time everything is 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:38.810
 very good and do not miss the video to 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.810
 background of this device
