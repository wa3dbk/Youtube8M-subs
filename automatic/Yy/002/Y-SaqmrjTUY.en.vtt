00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.189
 time at least one when last 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.899
 there was generally some sort of discredit 

00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:07.790
 severe punishment for you 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.059
 first time 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.059
 at all 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.300
 but how much 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.960
 Of course they decided them, but I thought my husband started 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:21.470
 just water took the time around 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.350
 understand they found that they both told 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.340
 Well, if the situation is certainly not very 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.950
 understandably 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.690
 what did you promise on the yenikeev bench 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.700
 described this particular episode as we 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:35.210
 We consider the episode that I see 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.580
 In principle, Jane's son did not beat understood that with 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.010
 you will burn out 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.109
 rolled 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.530
 hit it turned out that he chatted 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:48.000
 shoulder and since bounced heads then 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.829
 by skimming know and 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.449
 your reputation has not played you 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.100
 there was no removal there ever it is 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.210
 cromia 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.210
 interesting 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.650
 how did you protect all this about sapron 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.590
 Tretyak were 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.360
 I am spring time 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.360
 analysis will prove our position that 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.800
 principle not 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.540
 really year 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.580
 just a work to Russian on 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.610
 screamer desired crooked setting 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.950
 I talked with him in general, no, I'm not with him 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.840
 talked in Belgor 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:26.270
 you wanted to eat here what he will be 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.920
 play in the end said something but here it is 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.610
 I don't know why to play 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.900
 will leave him than i will play for 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.830
 on it is somehow easier from being able to 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.830
 help and not the most 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.940
 you find matches 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.649
 but not still want to play on 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.159
 such a holiday and do not know 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.829
 Nikita 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.750
 what in general from the tribune wanted 1 master 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.280
 looked 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.869
 parties 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.200
 great that you played an arrow on 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.200
 look 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.120
 vadim here yesterday would have watched that moment 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.210
 when you figure it out 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.490
 damn it again 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.490
 possession so there are no players who 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.470
 wish and principle I again like the Russians 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.329
 He fled to the snowy owl player Michael Grose 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.400
 priests 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:18.069
 I am holy that the top was with him 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.140
 I know of course it will not take should be 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.870
 useful after that 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.430
 strong favorite dimmer so that with match 8 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.000
 weeks without playing practice and again 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:33.010

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.250
 broke eagles help only for some reason 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.290
 can accommodate or just bad luck and 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.110
 tethering on a tournament principle a lot 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.270
 injuries of all teams will be on a pack 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.160
 convinced the sting of the season petals a lot 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.690
