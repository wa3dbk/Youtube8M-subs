00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.940

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.260

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.860
 myself but these sounds occur in my 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.619

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.270
 PC settings that we five the one 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.280
 for the rest, men left there 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.439

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.170
 sound settings at settings of 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.390
 blackops 2 puts it on supercrush 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.479

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.720
 of a right it mentions and I hear 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.180
 someone arrive in bottom blue 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.829
 6 just in my shoes well we are 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.110

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.049

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.869
 well from the mix to the big sound button 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.520

 to voice because on super they can do it 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.790
 sound of that gamer strongly suits 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.989
 so something to voice is for me 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.000
