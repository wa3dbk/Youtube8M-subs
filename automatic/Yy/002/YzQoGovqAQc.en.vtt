00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.090 

then<00:02:49.840> this<00:02:50.050> is<00:02:50.200> going<00:02:50.320> to<00:02:50.410> be<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.620> floor<00:02:50.830> and

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
then this is going to be the floor and

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.850 
then this is going to be the floor and
then<00:02:51.250> your<00:02:51.460> right<00:02:51.490> leg<00:02:51.880> it's<00:02:52.240> going<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:52.450> be<00:02:52.540> out

then your right leg it's going to be out
okay<00:02:53.860> and<00:02:54.790> from<00:02:54.940> here<00:02:55.920> it's<00:02:56.920> going<00:02:57.130> to<00:02:57.190> be<00:02:57.340> a

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
okay and from here it's going to be a

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.160 
okay and from here it's going to be a
continuous<00:02:58.990> motion<00:02:59.790> this<00:03:00.790> one<00:03:01.030> so<00:03:01.900> we're<00:03:02.080> not

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
continuous motion this one so we're not

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.410 
continuous motion this one so we're not
doing<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.620> base<00:03:02.830> to<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.310> step<00:03:03.910> one<00:03:04.120> step<00:03:04.270> two

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
doing the base to the step one step two

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.480 
doing the base to the step one step two
okay<00:03:04.960> this<00:03:05.200> is<00:03:05.320> going<00:03:05.410> to<00:03:05.500> be<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:06.100> start<00:03:06.400> of

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
okay this is going to be the start of

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.040 
okay this is going to be the start of
your<00:03:06.900> of<00:03:07.900> your<00:03:08.230> three<00:03:09.130> step<00:03:09.400> production<00:03:10.180> all

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
your of your three step production all

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.650 
your of your three step production all
right<00:03:11.280> so<00:03:12.280> this<00:03:12.430> is<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.730> second<00:03:13.090> cycle<00:03:13.270> of

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
right so this is the second cycle of

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.020 
right so this is the second cycle of
your<00:03:14.260> three<00:03:14.470> step<00:03:15.480> ok<00:03:16.480> so<00:03:16.540> this<00:03:16.810> step
