fingerprints that it generates that is

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.679 
fingerprints that it generates that is
actually<00:01:10.110> just<00:01:10.380> glossy<00:01:10.830> plastic<00:01:11.689> whereas

there is no such issue here with the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.740 
there is no such issue here with the
same<00:01:16.049> 8<00:01:16.549> 7<00:01:17.549> in<00:01:17.850> overall<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.780> really<00:01:20.750> surprises

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750

us<00:01:21.960> how<00:01:22.619> great<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.759> phablet<00:01:24.659> looks<00:01:26.330> not<00:01:27.330> that

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
us how great this phablet looks not that

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.399 
us how great this phablet looks not that
the<00:01:28.259> g3<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.829> bad<00:01:29.130> but<00:01:29.549> well<00:01:30.140> we<00:01:31.140> think<00:01:31.290> that

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
the g3 is bad but well we think that

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.710 
the g3 is bad but well we think that
Huawei<00:01:31.979> has<00:01:32.130> done<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.579> better<00:01:32.880> job<00:01:33.060> here

traditional 1080p resolution but as far
as<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.070> can<00:01:56.130> tell<00:01:56.579> its<00:01:56.969> pixel<00:01:57.840> density<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.409> more

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
as I can tell its pixel density is more

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.600 
as I can tell its pixel density is more

mate 7 is coming by the end of October
but<00:04:29.490> as<00:04:29.819> I<00:04:30.060> said<00:04:30.120> these<00:04:31.020> are<00:04:31.080> the<00:04:31.409> major

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
but as I said these are the major

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.809 
but as I said these are the major
differences<00:04:32.430> the<00:04:32.639> g3<00:04:33.090> is<00:04:33.389> a<00:04:33.419> bit<00:04:33.960> more<00:04:34.169> compact

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:34.819 
differences the g3 is a bit more compact

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:39.050 
differences the g3 is a bit more compact
than<00:04:35.819> the<00:04:36.120> sin<00:04:36.539> made<00:04:36.750> 7<00:04:37.199> but<00:04:37.680> this<00:04:37.949> one<00:04:38.189> has<00:04:38.460> a<00:04:38.490> 6

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
than the sin made 7 but this one has a 6

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.600 
than the sin made 7 but this one has a 6
inch<00:04:39.360> display<00:04:40.110> so<00:04:40.409> if<00:04:40.620> you<00:04:40.860> just<00:04:41.129> can't<00:04:41.400> have

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
inch display so if you just can't have

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.879 
inch display so if you just can't have
an<00:04:41.729> app<00:04:41.879> screen<00:04:42.300> I<00:04:42.539> guess<00:04:43.169> that<00:04:43.500> you<00:04:43.770> would

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
an app screen I guess that you would

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.650 
an app screen I guess that you would
like<00:04:44.069> to<00:04:44.250> wait<00:04:44.460> for<00:04:45.150> the<00:04:45.270> ascend<00:04:45.659> made<00:04:45.900> 7
