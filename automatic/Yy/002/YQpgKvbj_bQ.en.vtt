the great wheel it's certainly not what
everyone<00:00:20.310> does<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.910> I'm<00:00:21.060> still<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.660> beginner

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
everyone does and I'm still a beginner

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.439 
everyone does and I'm still a beginner
at<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.380> but<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.800> really<00:00:23.250> enjoy<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.519> what<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.060> do<00:00:24.180> is

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.000 
at it but I really enjoy it what I do is
I<00:00:24.600> take<00:00:24.810> this<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:25.980> half<00:00:26.730> ounce<00:00:27.680> piece<00:00:28.680> of

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
I take this is a half ounce piece of

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.060 
I take this is a half ounce piece of
roving<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:30.000> I've<00:00:30.150> died<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.810> I'm<00:00:31.650> going<00:00:31.949> to

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
roving that I've died and I'm going to

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.319 
roving that I've died and I'm going to
tear<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.430> or<00:00:33.090> break<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.630> into<00:00:34.700> smaller<00:00:35.700> strips

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
tear it or break it into smaller strips

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.270 
tear it or break it into smaller strips
it's<00:00:37.170> really<00:00:37.469> important<00:00:37.890> with<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.100> Great

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
it's really important with the Great

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.440 
it's really important with the Great
Wheel<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.730> have<00:00:38.910> well-prepared<00:00:39.800> fiber

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
Wheel that you have well-prepared fiber

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.630 
Wheel that you have well-prepared fiber
and<00:00:42.450> when<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.950> pull<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.070> into<00:00:44.219> small<00:00:44.610> chunks

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
and when you pull it into small chunks

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.510 
and when you pull it into small chunks
like<00:00:45.210> this<00:00:45.270> it's<00:00:45.629> really<00:00:45.809> easy<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.500> spin<00:00:47.219> from

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
like this it's really easy to spin from

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.760 
like this it's really easy to spin from
the<00:00:47.700> fold<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.510> I'm<00:00:48.660> gonna<00:00:48.899> pull<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.260> into<00:00:49.410> small

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
the fold so I'm gonna pull it into small

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.270 
the fold so I'm gonna pull it into small
chunks

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
chunks

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.470 
chunks
I<00:00:53.690> have<00:00:54.690> wax<00:00:55.140> paper<00:00:55.760> rolled<00:00:56.760> around<00:00:57.210> the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
I have wax paper rolled around the

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.880 
I have wax paper rolled around the
spindle<00:00:58.140> with<00:01:00.050> just<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.170> leader<00:01:01.379> hanging<00:01:01.770> off

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
spindle with just a leader hanging off

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.490 
spindle with just a leader hanging off
of<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.219> that's<00:01:02.489> just<00:01:02.809> hanging<00:01:03.809> on<00:01:03.899> there<00:01:04.110> by

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
of it that's just hanging on there by

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.080 
of it that's just hanging on there by
the<00:01:04.559> fact<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:04.920> it's<00:01:05.129> got<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.430> little<00:01:05.640> twist<00:01:05.909> in

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
the fact that it's got a little twist in

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.969 
the fact that it's got a little twist in
there<00:01:06.299> it's<00:01:06.450> been<00:01:06.630> its<00:01:06.750> final<00:01:07.500> time<00:01:07.680> it's<00:01:07.860> not

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
there it's been its final time it's not

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.190 
there it's been its final time it's not
tired<00:01:08.310> or<00:01:08.490> teemed<00:01:08.810> and<00:01:09.810> then<00:01:09.960> you're<00:01:10.080> just

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
tired or teemed and then you're just

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.810 
tired or teemed and then you're just
gonna<00:01:10.380> make<00:01:10.710> sure<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:10.979> was<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.250> end<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.700> it

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
gonna make sure this was the end so it

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.910 
gonna make sure this was the end so it
might<00:01:11.970> have<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.150> little<00:01:12.330> pieces<00:01:12.630> would<00:01:13.619> give<00:01:13.770> me

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
might have a little pieces would give me

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.429 
might have a little pieces would give me
a<00:01:13.979> problem<00:01:14.720> then<00:01:15.720> I'm<00:01:15.780> gonna<00:01:15.900> take<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.229> fold

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
a problem then I'm gonna take and fold

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.039 
a problem then I'm gonna take and fold
it<00:01:16.680> right<00:01:16.890> over<00:01:17.220> my<00:01:17.400> index<00:01:17.729> finger<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.810> seems

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
it right over my index finger it seems

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.830 
it right over my index finger it seems
to<00:01:19.229> work<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.560> best<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.979> way<00:01:20.509> now<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.540> haven't

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
to work the best this way now I haven't

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.899 
to work the best this way now I haven't
spun<00:01:22.409> on<00:01:22.619> this<00:01:22.770> little<00:01:22.979> girl<00:01:23.220> for<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.460> while<00:01:23.520> she

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
spun on this little girl for a while she

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.149 
spun on this little girl for a while she
might<00:01:24.000> be<00:01:24.210> mad<00:01:24.390> at<00:01:24.570> me<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:24.930> we'll<00:01:25.110> just<00:01:25.290> see<00:01:25.500> and

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
might be mad at me so we'll just see and

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.850 
might be mad at me so we'll just see and
then<00:01:26.310> I'm<00:01:26.460> just<00:01:26.490> going<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:26.970> attach<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.439> end<00:01:28.590> to

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
then I'm just going to attach the end to

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.010 
then I'm just going to attach the end to
this<00:01:28.950> leader<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:30.240> I'm<00:01:30.420> just<00:01:30.630> gonna<00:01:30.780> go<00:01:30.960> ahead

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
this leader and I'm just gonna go ahead

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.289 
this leader and I'm just gonna go ahead
and<00:01:31.200> wind<00:01:31.979> on<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> little<00:01:32.670> bit<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.060> leader

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
and wind on a little bit of the leader

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.020 
and wind on a little bit of the leader
cuz<00:01:33.570> it's<00:01:33.720> kind<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.020> too<00:01:34.439> long<00:01:34.640> and<00:01:35.640> then<00:01:35.820> you

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
cuz it's kind of too long and then you

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.670 
cuz it's kind of too long and then you
spin<00:01:36.360> right<00:01:36.540> off<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.900> tip<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.320> just<00:01:37.350> let<00:01:37.650> it

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
spin right off the tip you just let it

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.249 
spin right off the tip you just let it
fall<00:01:37.950> off<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.369> tip<00:01:38.579> fall<00:01:38.820> off<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.210> tip<00:01:39.420> and

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
fall off the tip fall off the tip and

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.719 
fall off the tip fall off the tip and
you<00:01:40.500> turn<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.920> wheel<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.310> don't<00:01:41.430> have<00:01:41.640> to

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
you turn the wheel you don't have to

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.230 
you turn the wheel you don't have to
turn<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.000> very<00:01:42.180> fast

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
turn it very fast

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.690 
turn it very fast
it's<00:01:44.110> really<00:01:44.680> fast<00:01:44.979> because<00:01:45.250> when<00:01:45.640> I

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
it's really fast because when I

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.700 
it's really fast because when I
accelerate<00:01:46.240> ahead<00:01:46.510> we<00:01:46.690> must<00:01:46.720> keep<00:01:47.290> walking

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
accelerate ahead we must keep walking

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.170 
accelerate ahead we must keep walking
back<00:01:47.920> and<00:01:47.950> at<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:48.400> front<00:01:48.640> where<00:01:48.820> you're<00:01:48.970> ready

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
back and at the front where you're ready

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.790 
back and at the front where you're ready
to<00:01:49.360> stop<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:50.740> need<00:01:50.920> to<00:01:51.690> bring<00:01:52.690> the<00:01:53.020> yarn<00:01:53.380> in

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
to stop you need to bring the yarn in

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.630 
to stop you need to bring the yarn in
towards<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.340> wheel<00:01:54.550> back<00:01:55.240> off<00:01:55.479> a<00:01:55.510> little<00:01:55.840> bit

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
towards the wheel back off a little bit
