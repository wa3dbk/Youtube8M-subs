00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.459 
walls and then I realized I had these
turret<00:01:59.729> type<00:02:00.000> things<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.570> just<00:02:01.229> kind<00:02:01.439> of

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
turret type things so I just kind of

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.810 
turret type things so I just kind of
played<00:02:01.680> around<00:02:01.710> with<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.430> think<00:02:02.700> it

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
played around with it and I think it

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.240 
played around with it and I think it
worked<00:02:03.000> out<00:02:03.180> quite<00:02:03.600> well<00:02:03.719> I'm<00:02:04.259> happy<00:02:04.829> with<00:02:05.100> the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
worked out quite well I'm happy with the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.529 
worked out quite well I'm happy with the
results<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.479> guys<00:02:06.659> can<00:02:07.789> judge<00:02:08.789> me<00:02:09.090> on<00:02:09.119> how

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
results and you guys can judge me on how

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.330 
results and you guys can judge me on how
I've<00:02:09.720> done<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.430> so<00:02:11.430> yeah

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
I've done and so yeah

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.040

I<00:02:12.430> think<00:02:12.940> this<00:02:13.060> house<00:02:13.239> would<00:02:13.390> be<00:02:13.450> suited<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:14.019> a

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
I think this house would be suited to a

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.350 
I think this house would be suited to a
family<00:02:14.349> because<00:02:14.830> up<00:02:15.430> when<00:02:16.000> we<00:02:16.120> go<00:02:16.239> upstairs
