00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.380
 good is it if it is active and I bring you a 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.150
 trick infinite money case that already 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.550
 was up about two weeks ago or so and 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.630
 it continues to work perfectly and well 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.369
 as it is a trick then you have to 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.200
 take it for that reason there were again 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.090
 so you can see it so you can enjoy it 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.560
 and for you to do it, they are still 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.090
 kids to see if we reached more than 100 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.189
 likes in less than an hour that I 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.780
 love it and nothing else with this trick 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.560
 we have to take a car from the street 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.470
 tune it to the maximum and go to a site 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.780
 a wall in which then we can 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.610
 crush a friend I do not know if it takes 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.710
 that crushes us I think the only thing that 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.320
 you have to do is put a wall to 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.480
 that the driver give him a triangle 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.820
 and directly get into the car worth 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.980
 instead of opening the door then of 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.380
 all ways do it like me and it will come out 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.990
 perfectly one we are like this and with 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.280
 adjustments as it makes that vehicle all 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.110
 for our friend our only if 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.790
 I got on co-pilot and we'll go to a 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.910
 mission that has the car is worth 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.250
 tracker example is time to escape or 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.810
 to the eyebrows some of those better 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.490
 we appear with the car and I have to 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.229
 have last location is clearly worth 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.850
 then we appear with the car 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.920
 we take and put it in our garage 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.630
 once this was done we met our 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.729
 friend who invites us is our friend 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.410
 will continue in the previous session because with 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.780
 our car is worth but as we have 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.369
 All vehicle access will be in the 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.430
 so we do not say anything to them 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.470
 invite let's accept your invitation and 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.240
 we are going to go to the previous room 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.369
 It's good so I'm going to spend a little 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.490
 in quick camera and I say that this group 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:43.210
 it works perfectly 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:47.380
 and then the best method for 1.20 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.970
 of 1.22 will work prove it I do not know the 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.549
 truth and good kids nothing more 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.259
 let's come, we can commit it and now 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.789
 we have two or do it again it's worth in 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.799
 this case I will do it again as 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.810
 You know what we put in the car in a 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.640
 wall that we can not leave our 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.130
 character can not escape 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.330
 then the motion by omission we go to a 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.950
 mission with car as it can be 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.840
 pursuers up to eyebrows some of 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.759
 those vouchers that appear with the car 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.760
 and as last location is worth so 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.340
 good we will go there we put the car and 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.840
 it's ok we have two more the original 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.730
 what our friend has in the other 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.739
 session then we say to invite us and 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.420
 if we want we can double it 300 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.010
 times it's ok and in this case I 'm not going to 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.080
 explain again what I'm going to do is 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.360
 put the three vouchers I'm going to put these 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.580
 two are already stuck and the one that has my 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.200
 friend I'm going to also put the garage and 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.660
 I'm going to sell them, so we do not have anything 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.300
 let's your session invites us 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.820
 if you load this 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.910
 and good kids and I say to see if we go 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.550
 to 500 law for this trick and I think that 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.340
 is the best the best that works now 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.980
 and nothing now we catch ourselves we put the 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.630
 we put car and already kids and 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.070
 we have three I tell you we can have 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.990
 continued doubling as many times as 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.600
 we want it's worth in this case I just do 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.700
 two we put the original so nothing the 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.340
 we collect and we will sell the kids 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.900
 there is a way to do it without waiting 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.970
 ok but it's very smooth then I 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.250
 I recommend selling it we take 150,000 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.740
 more or less depends on the car ends 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.630
 45 minutes playing racing and 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.220
 we take it and sell it so 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.810
 there are no kids here I'm going to fire 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.540
 I like the trick they let law not 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.260
 It costs nothing a greeting and until next time 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.260
 goodbye 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.570
 also
