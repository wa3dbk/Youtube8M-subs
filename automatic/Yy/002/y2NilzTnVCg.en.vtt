between<00:00:29.279> shades<00:00:29.550> because<00:00:29.910> i<00:00:30.380> didn't<00:00:31.380> really

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
between shades because i didn't really

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.290 
between shades because i didn't really
like<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.710> yellow<00:00:31.980> first<00:00:32.340> but<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.610> seems<00:00:33.210> like

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
like the yellow first but it seems like

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.610 
like the yellow first but it seems like
it<00:00:33.480> turned<00:00:33.660> out<00:00:33.719> okay<00:00:34.070> um<00:00:35.930> the<00:00:36.930> wings<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.410> think

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
it turned out okay um the wings I think

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.619 
it turned out okay um the wings I think
looked<00:00:37.800> pretty<00:00:38.040> good<00:00:38.960> and<00:00:40.160> I<00:00:41.180> could<00:00:42.180> have

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
looked pretty good and I could have

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.549 
looked pretty good and I could have
tried<00:00:42.870> doing<00:00:43.079> them<00:00:43.350> with<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.559> gray<00:00:43.860> outline<00:00:45.559> but

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
tried doing them with a gray outline but

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.040 
tried doing them with a gray outline but
I<00:00:46.590> don't<00:00:46.920> know<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.640> still<00:00:48.600> think<00:00:48.809> they<00:00:48.870> look

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
I don't know I still think they look

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.250 
I don't know I still think they look
good<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.230> wish<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:49.649> why<00:00:49.800> would<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.100> turned<00:00:50.309> up

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
good I wish so why would it turned up

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.950 
good I wish so why would it turned up
turned<00:00:52.260> out<00:00:52.410> looking<00:00:52.610> brighter<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:53.760> guess<00:00:54.059> so

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
turned out looking brighter I guess so

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.959 
turned out looking brighter I guess so
it<00:00:55.020> looks<00:00:55.140> pretty<00:00:55.350> dark<00:00:55.620> but<00:00:55.920> overall<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.760> think

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
it looks pretty dark but overall I think

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.740 
it looks pretty dark but overall I think
this<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.270> pretty<00:00:57.870> good<00:00:58.699> um<00:00:59.699> it's<00:01:00.690> pretty

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750
