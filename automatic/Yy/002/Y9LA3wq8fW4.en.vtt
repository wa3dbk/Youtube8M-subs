a<00:04:08.329> little<00:04:08.659> bit<00:04:08.810> of<00:04:08.900> relief<00:04:09.260> because<00:04:09.530> we

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
a little bit of relief because we

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.440 
a little bit of relief because we
weren't<00:04:09.950> doing<00:04:10.099> very<00:04:10.250> well<00:04:10.579> in<00:04:10.609> the<00:04:10.819> race<00:04:11.030> so

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
weren't doing very well in the race so

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.210 
weren't doing very well in the race so
it<00:04:12.760> you<00:04:13.760> know<00:04:13.879> was<00:04:14.200> definitely<00:04:15.200> a<00:04:15.260> relief<00:04:15.500> a

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
it you know was definitely a relief a

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.729 
it you know was definitely a relief a
little<00:04:16.910> bit<00:04:17.000> of<00:04:17.090> luck<00:04:17.299> I<00:04:17.479> guess<00:04:17.510> on<00:04:17.900> our<00:04:18.079> part

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
little bit of luck I guess on our part

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.490 
little bit of luck I guess on our part
that<00:04:19.070> they<00:04:19.489> called<00:04:19.760> the<00:04:19.880> race<00:04:20.090> off<00:04:20.329> but<00:04:20.690> it<00:04:21.380> was

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
that they called the race off but it was

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.529 
that they called the race off but it was
marginal<00:04:21.829> conditions<00:04:22.820> to<00:04:22.970> even<00:04:23.180> start<00:04:23.449> the

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
marginal conditions to even start the

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:26.620 
marginal conditions to even start the
race<00:04:23.810> so<00:04:24.199> it<00:04:25.010> probably<00:04:25.789> wasn't<00:04:26.180> really<00:04:26.510> meant

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
race so it probably wasn't really meant

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.960 
race so it probably wasn't really meant
to<00:04:26.810> be<00:04:26.960> there<00:04:27.169> at<00:04:27.289> the<00:04:27.440> end<00:04:27.590> we've<00:04:28.370> had<00:04:28.550> just<00:04:28.610> an
