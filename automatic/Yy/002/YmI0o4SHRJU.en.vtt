to bought the actual facial today from
it<00:01:39.039> works<00:01:39.520> okay<00:01:40.389> and<00:01:40.659> the<00:01:40.869> only<00:01:41.079> thing<00:01:41.439> that<00:01:41.590> I

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
it works okay and the only thing that I

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.590 
it works okay and the only thing that I
see<00:01:42.009> that<00:01:42.219> it's<00:01:42.429> a<00:01:42.549> little<00:01:42.700> drawback<00:01:43.329> is<00:01:43.539> that

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
see that it's a little drawback is that

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.109 
see that it's a little drawback is that
you<00:01:44.170> have<00:01:44.350> to<00:01:44.499> leave<00:01:44.649> it<00:01:44.770> on<00:01:44.859> for<00:01:44.920> 45<00:01:45.579> to<00:01:45.609> 60

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
you have to leave it on for 45 to 60

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.539 
you have to leave it on for 45 to 60
minutes<00:01:46.149> so<00:01:46.539> basically<00:01:46.929> an<00:01:47.170> hour<00:01:47.409> and<00:01:47.829> but<00:01:48.310> hey

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
minutes so basically an hour and but hey

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.910 
minutes so basically an hour and but hey
it<00:01:48.789> fits<00:01:48.999> worth<00:01:49.329> it<00:01:49.600> it's<00:01:49.869> worth<00:01:50.139> the<00:01:50.319> time<00:01:50.530> so

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
it fits worth it it's worth the time so
