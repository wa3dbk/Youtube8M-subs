00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:04.200
 hi everyone welcome guys and well 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.670
 found as usual on my channel 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.470
 I am secular and today I am here for 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.540
 moussavi how to best face calyx 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.250
 the reborn an end-of-level boss who 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.469
 you can meet in the prison of the 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.610
 elderly compared to use or even worse 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.560
 a kotor 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.580
 I think it's a simpler boss but 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.289
 there are mechanics as usual 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.789
 that must be learned 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.980
 first of all we must identify the 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.250
 presence of a particular enemy that is 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.570
 these served and the advances on 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.660
 down payment service are pretty much 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.270
 of the most outcasts who will have one 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.180
 particularity during this during 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.760
 this boss during this deal 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.010
 boss and we'll subtract life from time to 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.860
 so this will evoke these 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.289
 servants but above all will go to 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.120
 killing them will absorb them 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.809
 energy going to restore then the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.969
 its vitality 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.129
 so it will be important at the moment 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.530
 which we will enter this arena go to 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.870
 eliminate and kill these servants 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.370
 down payments as you see kalixa 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.010
 virtually absorbs this energy e 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.090
 see how it will restore the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.280
 let's call it one's vitality 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.229
 simply so then the summit 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.939
 east and down payments are targets 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.070
 that they will have to kill to kill them there 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.030
 the best thing in my opinion will be that 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.830
 to be in constant motion 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.140
 inside the arena trying to 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.909
 go and eliminate as soon as possible 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.710
 this threat to prevent the 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.150
 regeneration of the life of the boss 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.280
 but very important thing we must 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.590
 to know that when we have to get off 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.850
 below the half the bar of the 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.860
 life our opponent opposes 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.860
 let's say a critical goal we are 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.810
 speaking of a major who will come out of the 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.430
 door that we should remove the slack 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.100
 critical goal that we must eliminate 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.840
 before it reaches its point 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.479
 designated simply called that 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.850
 so the advice is to marry some 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.590
 blow to calyx immediately kill the threats 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.810
 when there is no one anymore 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.509
 but we spend our lives at this moment 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.100
 as you can see it educates the critical target 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.770
 well you know that always spurs from this 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.420
 then leads the Titan's barrier in front 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.950
 with the pumps to kill him 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.390
 in this way you see we eliminate immediately 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.340
 threats and we can concentrate 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.469
 again on kalex 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.090
 the thing I recommend on the high visa 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.280
 that the waves that did this 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.690
 posts often are fallen as you have 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.710
 saw throughout the game saw 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.680
 continued I kept turning in the 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.630
 because why did I ensure that in 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.640
 previous emissions in the arenas 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.740
 previous I had never gone to seize 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.120
 those purple urinations so that when me 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.980
 I would have come back inside 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.810
 this arena I would have had the chance 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.400
 to be able to welcome these again 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.200
 ammunition to see how many you see 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.690
 how many missiles launched with my galan 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.130
 for heaven's sake it is not the only weapon you have 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.020
 use however let's say that 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.840
 fortunately I have this but it turns out 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.290
 very strong I go to take advantage and 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.180
 use it 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.340
 so at the end of mechanics are 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.840
 very simple you enter two three strokes of 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:49.150
 galan or at least shoot the boss afterwards 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.250
 soon they will begin to spit out enemies already 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.510
 so it's not the telligent e strategy 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.220
 stand there at the door and shoot 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.570
 all galan recharge everyone 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.350
 float a pack the enemies really are 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.720
 very quickly 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.250
 they will jump on you spend look 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.520
 how long it takes three minutes to be a boss 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.680
 guys you saw shoot a little then 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.090
 eliminate the enemies turn a little in the 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.070
 vein recovered the ammunition 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.870
 all together you start shooting at 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.160
 boss will summon the critical target 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.810
 put the bubble in front of the door 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.200
 kill the critical target and exit 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.970
 look at bump gigi noia boss surely 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.350
 challenging and in my opinion this is mine 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.730
 point of view is compared to the others but 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.560
 if compared with others it will result more 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.120
 simple though that therefore this video there 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.530
 useful tones maybe concerned 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.330
 simply the gameplay to see a 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.680
 little movements and fair every now and then we are 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.120
 all a bit dead, however, there is 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.680
 always been someone alive in other words 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.080
 strategy to apply in my opinion is 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.030
 this I will be built for yours 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.290
 attention explains you enjoyed this 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.880
 video in this case leave a nice live 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.580
 share it with your others 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.980
 guardians friends guardian calls 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.930
 in short, the other people you play with 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.910
 and we like on this channel with i 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.060
 next videos to not lose sign up 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.770
 and comment on the case comment on the case 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.840
 good for health and prevents tumors 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.140
 alle alle balls
