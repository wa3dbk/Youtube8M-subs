00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.279
 so all tweets up my name i am a 20 year old model town and lionsgate 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.279
 has been 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:14.209
 s12 at first very good to drive around 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:20.050
 Finally, the action percent is clearly questioned 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.999
 the inferno 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:23.849
 that he is not always sovereign 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:25.289
 the money 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.130
 then retracted 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.759
 it does not come to the money 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:34.700
 Honigmann films the first major losses did not win was in 2006 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.700
 being easier with 18 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.380
 to imagine what happened 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.590
 for the physical, they probably do it to their parents 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.300
 The 2007 German championship had won it 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.530
 Surely the Romands take place first and then the best Germans as sure 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.050
 Jackdaw Red 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.650
 "Timo is fit he does not speak perfect Euro either 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.110
 it is only logical 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.910
 because maybe a few new triggers the fine would have six already 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.630
 been no 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.719
 the existing legal rules 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:17.100
 I said that I probably STA that me 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.710
 would win with the 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.460
 in Duisburg I mean in the end percent necessary process order 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.480
 sprung 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.000
 that is also due to the shape of the day so I do not think so in bad weather 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.730
 I probably would not have wanted that either 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.750
 I already had it 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.530
 We buy 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.140
 At Altdorf we will need both 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.260
 So really preparing duty from that makes me angry Zurich 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.670

 Canada Montreal you can tell the day anything new Hermann Maier 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.920
 in simple and and who wants and wants that just nobody tries 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.710
 as an accident cause out of the maybe 2010 would be 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.130
 So Soldo so Sony has to equal all the big love 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.230
 Dortmund and in Ronnenberg 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.810
 Hitchcock 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.810
 that is fact 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.489
 Before you use that fast, you progress every hour on the couple 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:13.949
 Beginning 

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:16.099
 my favorite song is one 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.489
 a to 70 million 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:18.929
 when the night falls 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:21.660
 I think that makes it the most easy to do that 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.669
 becomes free 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:24.039
 PÃ¶lten 

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:25.369

 Venlo 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:30.169
 Damage such as cracks have fun so far that Erwin to 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.209
 The injured are the case that Red Bull always there 

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:37.640
 this is a great role model 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.380
 We want to have fun with the team soon 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.829
 SAS

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.540
 for St if the five to ten years are important to see 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:50.950
 Otmar Vieth 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.999
 only the money is worth it 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:58.749
 probably around the California life and professionally with it 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:02:59.340
 still money 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.999
 for the youth 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:02.820
 Not 15 years on television 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.820
