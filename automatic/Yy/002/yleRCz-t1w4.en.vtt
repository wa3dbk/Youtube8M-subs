00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
and as you can see they've found a

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.420 
and as you can see they've found a
quicker<00:02:12.810> way<00:02:12.930> out<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:13.470> hive<00:02:13.830> rather<00:02:14.190> than

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
quicker way out of the hive rather than

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.650 
quicker way out of the hive rather than
going<00:02:14.610> up<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:14.970> stack<00:02:15.380> so<00:02:16.380> that's<00:02:17.130> what<00:02:17.660> I've

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
going up the stack so that's what I've

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.390 
going up the stack so that's what I've
got<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:18.960> plug<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.200> hole<00:02:19.410> again<00:02:19.650> as<00:02:20.100> you<00:02:20.250> can

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
got to plug that hole again as you can

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.300 
got to plug that hole again as you can
see<00:02:20.610> I've<00:02:20.970> plugged<00:02:21.600> it<00:02:21.810> in<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.020> past<00:02:22.310> it's

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
see I've plugged it in the past it's

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.510 
see I've plugged it in the past it's
interesting<00:02:24.170> when<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.230> first<00:02:25.500> put<00:02:25.740> it<00:02:25.860> on<00:02:26.010> the

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
interesting when I first put it on the

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.520 
interesting when I first put it on the
bees<00:02:26.820> is<00:02:27.270> that<00:02:27.660> when<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:27.840> first<00:02:28.020> put<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.320> cover

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
bees is that when I first put the cover

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.180 
bees is that when I first put the cover
on<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:29.460> bees<00:02:29.700> couldn't<00:02:30.150> figure<00:02:30.330> out<00:02:31.070> or<00:02:32.070> they

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
on the bees couldn't figure out or they

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.630 
on the bees couldn't figure out or they
can't<00:02:32.490> fly<00:02:32.910> vertically<00:02:33.630> I<00:02:33.900> guess<00:02:34.460> levitate<00:02:35.460> up

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
can't fly vertically I guess levitate up

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.910 
can't fly vertically I guess levitate up
the<00:02:36.000> snack<00:02:36.470> so<00:02:37.470> I<00:02:37.860> ended<00:02:38.700> up<00:02:39.470> putting<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.680> rope

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
the snack so I ended up putting a rope

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.130 
the snack so I ended up putting a rope
down<00:02:41.250> inside<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.240> stack<00:02:42.570> that<00:02:42.810> they<00:02:42.960> could

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
down inside the stack that they could

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.110 
down inside the stack that they could
walk<00:02:43.320> up<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.680> down<00:02:43.770> and<00:02:44.130> that's<00:02:44.430> that's<00:02:44.880> how

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
walk up and down and that's that's how

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.970 
walk up and down and that's that's how
they<00:02:45.270> get<00:02:45.450> in<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:45.750> out<00:02:46.850> you<00:02:47.850> can<00:02:48.000> see<00:02:48.830> you<00:02:49.830> can

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
they get in and out you can see you can

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.920 
they get in and out you can see you can
see<00:02:50.220> up<00:02:50.370> top<00:02:50.580> here<00:02:52.160> might<00:02:53.160> be<00:02:53.190> able<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.550> see<00:02:53.760> it
