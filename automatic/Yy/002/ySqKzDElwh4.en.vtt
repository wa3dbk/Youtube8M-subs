00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:05.000
 asked for a video about how it goes 

00:00:02.269 --> 00:00:08.269
 schooling in which feeling us 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.769
 there are already other videos about this school 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.400
 Now, as if we are specifics now 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.690
 coming to an end my first semester 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.890
 police school after two weeks 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.690
 there will be exams test exams 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.060
 mean how all this is like learning and 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.250
 so on, that is, if we have this 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.280
 the schedule we were given at first 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.890
 semester and it says on what day a 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:35.420
 as we have a couple of mostly couples with 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.790
 8 am to 4 pm that is a couple 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.270
 hour and a half there is a break and again 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.140
 it's time 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.450
 So how would a first semester in 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.940
 Mostly this as here is as in institution 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.320
 then first year general some subjects 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.870
 let's say we have now 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.780
 one thread together there are three different groups and 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.400
 3 different directions and we read 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.590
 teachers come the same 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.940
 items tass we sit all together yes there 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.430
 for example the basis of economic 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.190
 activities or are there safe 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.170
 life activities same items if 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.119
 you studied at the institute that is it 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.550
 educational institution in the same subjects 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.990
 which we have been such here 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.060
 schedule but he issued 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:21.700
 and here as if the day and which 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:26.820
 what object is cool where there are windows but in 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:28.990
 mostly full day full 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.110
 each item has its own quantity 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.970
 hours and at the end here for example first 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.320
 semester 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.160
 go exam and almost all of them 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.539
 oral at least we first say that 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.030
 wo n't be writing i think okay 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.979
 written stations ok they will 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.780
 oral before you need to pass 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.369
 checklist for each subject because 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.240
 that uncontrolled will not allow you to 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.320
 Exam then we will have two months 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.930
 here 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.330
 July-August there will be holidays and then 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.400
 September second semester begins there 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.000
 there will already be more practice more like 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.830
 directed to my specialty and in 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.830
 late second semester since mine 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.050
 learning year will be already 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.460
 exams komi there will be a commission that is 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.050
 it's big 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:19.660
 exams and well, in general, serious 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:24.340
 weight such as we have for our circle 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:26.860
 so postal market where e-mail is 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.440
 throw let's say some teachers 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.800
 material or you also schedule some 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:36.190
 changes that is basically all this 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:39.370
 very comfortable cutting off still telling 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:43.930
 ask questions under the video and we will 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:46.380
 they are answered and there is still here here 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.850
 so we have a sign here I am written 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.700
 wrote wildly when checklists which 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.880
 exams subjects what this semester 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.100
 how many number in each item 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.220
 there are teachers such 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.760
 exams oral letters you say such 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.620
 learning but you give in life or but 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.470
 it's just training for the crust or 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.110
 still something interesting you are useful 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.210
 you know I know interesting because 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.750
 teachers somehow teach not like 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:19.450
 for the exam for life then there are some 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.130
 retreats tell how it is well they 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.710
 tell how it is but 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:29.080
 I'm interested in the second 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:32.310
 assimilation then I met this 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:35.620
 girls talk practice language 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.840
 constantly listening good polish 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.760
 in different versions because different 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.040
 teachers people speak differently 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.550
 if you adapt and so and so you 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:49.840
 write well write differently because 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:51.730
 first Polish words that you them 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.540
 hear then you try there if 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:58.360
 write slowly using polish 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:03.280
 control work you turn in Polish 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.960
 options have not yet passed or are looking for who he is 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.640
 will translate or try it yourself but 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.490
 probably still have to look for where 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.900
 lead or looking for material in Polish 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:15.900
 if we have a good translator 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.900
 inexpensively 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.010
 ask attacks
