Bungie<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.600> let's<00:01:52.500> take<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.649> look<00:01:52.799> what<00:01:52.890> he<00:01:52.950> has

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
Bungie and let's take a look what he has

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.370 
Bungie and let's take a look what he has
to<00:01:53.159> say<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:54.060> they<00:01:54.420> first<00:01:54.600> talked<00:01:54.840> about<00:01:55.110> raids

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
to say so they first talked about raids

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.130 
to say so they first talked about raids
and<00:01:56.119> you<00:01:57.119> know<00:01:57.210> they<00:01:57.450> just<00:01:57.479> had<00:01:57.750> some<00:01:57.899> people

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
and you know they just had some people

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.289 
and you know they just had some people
come<00:01:58.290> in<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.649> play<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.850> one<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.210> first

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
come in and play and one of the first

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.240 
come in and play and one of the first
questions<00:02:00.689> was<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:01.020> -<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.409> they<00:02:02.070> read

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
questions was it - that they read

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.770 
questions was it - that they read
somewhere<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.579> took<00:02:02.729> 45<00:02:03.030> minutes<00:02:03.509> just<00:02:03.570> to

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
somewhere it took 45 minutes just to

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.649 
somewhere it took 45 minutes just to
open<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.140> door<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.829> first<00:02:05.100> raid<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.659> one

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
open the door to the first raid and one

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.880 
open the door to the first raid and one
of<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.810> interesting<00:02:07.140> things<00:02:07.409> he<00:02:07.530> said<00:02:07.740> is

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
of the interesting things he said is

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.109 
of the interesting things he said is
that<00:02:08.039> with<00:02:08.340> with<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.819> way<00:02:08.910> they're<00:02:09.030> gonna

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
that with with the way they're gonna

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.729 
that with with the way they're gonna
handle<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.629> they're<00:02:09.810> really<00:02:10.319> not<00:02:10.500> going<00:02:10.679> to

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
handle is they're really not going to

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
on our own and he says that I guess it

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
encounter but had to be skipped through

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.990 
encounter but had to be skipped through
an<00:03:45.870> earlier<00:03:46.230> encounter<00:03:46.590> and<00:03:46.980> one<00:03:47.579> group<00:03:47.730> got

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
an earlier encounter and one group got

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.699 
an earlier encounter and one group got
washed<00:03:48.180> out<00:03:48.419> and<00:03:48.690> elected<00:03:49.109> to<00:03:49.139> go<00:03:49.319> back<00:03:49.500> to

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
washed out and elected to go back to

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.740 
washed out and elected to go back to
playing<00:03:49.949> strikes<00:03:50.310> strikes<00:03:51.150> missions<00:03:51.569> and

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
playing strikes strikes missions and

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.509 
playing strikes strikes missions and
patrols<00:03:52.049> so<00:03:52.650> I<00:03:52.889> should<00:03:53.129> have<00:03:53.190> mentioned<00:03:53.310> this

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
patrols so I should have mentioned this

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.180 
patrols so I should have mentioned this
earlier<00:03:53.609> this<00:03:54.060> took<00:03:54.299> place<00:03:54.510> in<00:03:54.780> March<00:03:55.169> of<00:03:55.500> 2014

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
earlier this took place in March of 2014

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.670 
earlier this took place in March of 2014
so<00:03:56.609> obviously<00:03:57.150> after<00:03:57.329> this<00:03:57.629> experience<00:03:58.230> they

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
so obviously after this experience they

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.020 
so obviously after this experience they
looked<00:03:58.919> at<00:03:59.010> everything<00:03:59.250> in<00:03:59.519> terms<00:03:59.669> of<00:03:59.910> their

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
looked at everything in terms of their

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.089 
looked at everything in terms of their
organization<00:04:00.780> how<00:04:01.230> they<00:04:01.379> were<00:04:01.500> cooperating

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
organization how they were cooperating

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:03.080 
organization how they were cooperating
how<00:04:02.160> they<00:04:02.280> were<00:04:02.370> talking<00:04:02.579> with<00:04:02.760> each<00:04:02.879> other

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
how they were talking with each other

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.920 
how they were talking with each other
and<00:04:03.359> then<00:04:03.870> they've<00:04:04.139> been<00:04:04.290> making<00:04:04.440> fine<00:04:04.859> tuning

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
and then they've been making fine tuning

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.420 
and then they've been making fine tuning
fine<00:04:06.930> adjustments<00:04:07.530> throughout<00:04:07.799> the<00:04:07.949> sprint

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
fine adjustments throughout the sprint

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.339 
fine adjustments throughout the sprint
so<00:04:08.790> now<00:04:08.910> when<00:04:09.030> it<00:04:09.120> comes<00:04:09.269> to<00:04:09.419> raiding<00:04:09.750> we're

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
so now when it comes to raiding we're

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.080 
so now when it comes to raiding we're
gonna<00:04:10.440> have<00:04:10.650> normal<00:04:11.010> and<00:04:11.099> hard<00:04:11.370> which<00:04:11.669> we<00:04:11.849> saw

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
gonna have normal and hard which we saw

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.800 
gonna have normal and hard which we saw
when<00:04:12.480> we<00:04:12.690> played<00:04:12.989> beta<00:04:13.260> and<00:04:14.329> basically<00:04:15.329> normal

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
when we played beta and basically normal

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.930 
when we played beta and basically normal
what<00:04:16.590> he<00:04:16.709> mentions<00:04:17.099> is<00:04:17.220> normal<00:04:17.549> modes<00:04:17.699> about

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
what he mentions is normal modes about

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.279 
what he mentions is normal modes about
learning<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.419> mechanics<00:04:18.539> working<00:04:19.079> together

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
learning the mechanics working together

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.349 
learning the mechanics working together
his<00:04:19.530> team<00:04:19.799> and<00:04:20.220> building<00:04:20.519> strategies<00:04:21.030> so

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
his team and building strategies so

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.510 
his team and building strategies so
obviously<00:04:21.870> harder<00:04:22.770> it's<00:04:23.010> gonna<00:04:23.070> be<00:04:23.250> harder

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
obviously harder it's gonna be harder

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.670 
obviously harder it's gonna be harder
but<00:04:24.060> whatever<00:04:24.659> we're<00:04:24.780> concern<00:04:25.110> with<00:04:25.260> is<00:04:25.440> well

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
but whatever we're concern with is well

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.570 
but whatever we're concern with is well
what<00:04:25.860> are<00:04:25.950> the<00:04:26.010> rewards

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580

I mean are you rewarded better with with

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:32.149 
I mean are you rewarded better with with
the<00:04:30.180> cooler<00:04:30.539> gear<00:04:30.840> better<00:04:31.139> gear<00:04:31.470> from

00:04:32.149 --> 00:04:32.159 
the cooler gear better gear from

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:33.770 
the cooler gear better gear from
finishing<00:04:32.879> in<00:04:33.060> our<00:04:33.150> hard<00:04:33.330> mode<00:04:33.509> because<00:04:33.720> I

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
finishing in our hard mode because I

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:34.939 
finishing in our hard mode because I
know<00:04:33.840> when<00:04:33.990> I<00:04:34.020> was<00:04:34.139> trying<00:04:34.349> to<00:04:34.470> get<00:04:34.530> that<00:04:34.710> damn

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
trying it on hard to see if maybe it

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.290 
trying it on hard to see if maybe it
would<00:04:40.590> make<00:04:40.620> a<00:04:40.740> difference<00:04:40.830> but<00:04:41.280> I<00:04:41.400> I<00:04:41.669> still

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
would make a difference but I I still

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.939 
would make a difference but I I still

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
activity in one go the group could

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.409 
activity in one go the group could
simply<00:05:10.500> make<00:05:11.009> your<00:05:11.190> way<00:05:11.310> into<00:05:11.610> the<00:05:11.789> vault<00:05:11.969> and

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
where you left off however your progress

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.070 
where you left off however your progress
for<00:05:17.009> the<00:05:17.069> week<00:05:17.250> is<00:05:17.460> reset<00:05:17.969> every<00:05:18.330> Tuesday<00:05:18.870> so

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
for the week is reset every Tuesday so

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.959 
for the week is reset every Tuesday so
basically<00:05:20.009> every<00:05:20.279> Tuesday<00:05:20.580> they<00:05:20.699> can<00:05:20.789> have<00:05:20.909> a

basically every Tuesday they can have a
weekly<00:05:21.150> reset<00:05:21.599> so<00:05:21.750> that's<00:05:22.199> that's<00:05:22.440> really

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
weekly reset so that's that's really

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.769 
weekly reset so that's that's really

warlock within a given calendar week and

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:38.059 
warlock within a given calendar week and
get<00:06:36.569> that<00:06:36.719> loot<00:06:36.959> again<00:06:37.229> you<00:06:37.680> either<00:06:37.830> have<00:06:37.979> to

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:38.069 
get that loot again you either have to

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:39.800 
get that loot again you either have to
do<00:06:38.250> it<00:06:38.370> with<00:06:38.490> another<00:06:38.759> character<00:06:39.270> or

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810 
do it with another character or

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.320 
do it with another character or
a<00:06:40.050> full<00:06:40.320> calendar<00:06:40.770> week<00:06:40.920> to<00:06:41.340> go<00:06:41.490> back<00:06:41.700> in<00:06:41.910> that

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
a full calendar week to go back in that

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.640 
a full calendar week to go back in that
makes<00:06:42.510> sense<00:06:42.720> because<00:06:42.900> they<00:06:43.290> kind<00:06:43.440> of<00:06:43.500> want<00:06:43.620> to

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.650 
makes sense because they kind of want to

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.080 
makes sense because they kind of want to
spread<00:06:43.800> everything<00:06:44.010> out<00:06:44.250> prevent<00:06:44.970> you<00:06:45.060> from

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.090 
spread everything out prevent you from

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.100 
spread everything out prevent you from
just<00:06:45.389> taking<00:06:45.630> that<00:06:45.750> one<00:06:45.900> particular

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.110 
just taking that one particular

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.990 
just taking that one particular
character<00:06:46.770> and<00:06:46.950> just<00:06:47.100> completing<00:06:47.820> a<00:06:47.880> mission

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 
character and just completing a mission

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.580 
character and just completing a mission
or<00:06:48.300> raid<00:06:48.510> or<00:06:48.660> whatever<00:06:48.870> over<00:06:49.230> and<00:06:49.350> over<00:06:49.530> and

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:49.590 
or raid or whatever over and over and

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.830 
or raid or whatever over and over and
over<00:06:49.680> again<00:06:49.889> to<00:06:50.520> keep<00:06:51.300> getting<00:06:51.419> that<00:06:51.660> loot

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 
over again to keep getting that loot

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.500 
over again to keep getting that loot
which<00:06:52.500> makes<00:06:52.680> sense<00:06:52.830> so<00:06:53.639> that<00:06:53.820> is<00:06:54.030> it<00:06:54.270> for<00:06:54.300> me

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:54.510 
which makes sense so that is it for me

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.720 
which makes sense so that is it for me
