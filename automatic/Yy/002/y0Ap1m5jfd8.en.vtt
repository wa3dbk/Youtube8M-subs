00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
with no doubles in almost all its games

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.130 
with no doubles in almost all its games
for<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.759> much<00:01:48.090> at<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> flea<00:01:48.659> market

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
for that much at a flea market

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.780 
for that much at a flea market
yeah<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:49.590> at<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.860> point<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.280> start<00:01:50.340> getting

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
yeah so at that point you start getting

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.580 
yeah so at that point you start getting
doubles<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.420> yes<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.689> do<00:01:51.810> have<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.049> put<00:01:52.470> them

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
doubles and yes you do have to put them

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.580 
doubles and yes you do have to put them
on<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.770> market<00:01:53.009> or<00:01:53.250> trade<00:01:53.520> them<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.810> Nets

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
on the market or trade them so that Nets

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.590 
on the market or trade them so that Nets
a<00:01:55.770> large<00:01:56.310> though<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.850> because<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.360> can't

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
a large though is because you can't

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.420 
a large though is because you can't
really<00:01:57.869> factor<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:58.380> how<00:01:58.530> much<00:01:58.710> when<00:01:59.250> do<00:01:59.340> you

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
really factor in how much when do you

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.830 
really factor in how much when do you
really<00:01:59.640> remember<00:01:59.850> how<00:02:00.060> much<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.360> made<00:02:00.570> back

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
really remember how much you made back

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.749 
really remember how much you made back
off<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.290> selling<00:02:01.500> doubles<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.250> then<00:02:02.340> put<00:02:02.640> back

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
off of selling doubles and then put back

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.300 
off of selling doubles and then put back
in<00:02:03.000> its<00:02:03.140> what<00:02:04.140> do<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.290> really<00:02:04.590> think<00:02:04.829> you've

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
in its what do you really think you've

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.850 
in its what do you really think you've
spent<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:06.119> think<00:02:06.360> on<00:02:06.479> average<00:02:06.869> five<00:02:07.439> dollars<00:02:07.829> a

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
spent I think on average five dollars a

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.690 
spent I think on average five dollars a
game<00:02:08.129> there<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.459> go

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
game there you go

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.999 
game there you go
that's<00:02:08.849> some<00:02:09.090> under<00:02:09.360> I'd<00:02:09.539> say<00:02:09.720> under<00:02:09.959> $4,000<00:02:10.830> I

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
that's some under I'd say under $4,000 I

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.790 
that's some under I'd say under $4,000 I
would<00:02:11.250> say<00:02:11.459> that's<00:02:11.670> right<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:12.569> think<00:02:12.750> that

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
would say that's right and I think that

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.830 
would say that's right and I think that
that's<00:02:14.250> when<00:02:14.400> people<00:02:14.640> say<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:15.120> think<00:02:15.450> that

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
that's when people say I think that

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.940 
that's when people say I think that
because<00:02:16.080> some<00:02:16.230> games<00:02:16.440> would<00:02:16.530> average<00:02:16.770> out<00:02:16.920> to

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
because some games would average out to

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.470 
because some games would average out to
two<00:02:17.160> dollars<00:02:17.490> or<00:02:17.610> one<00:02:17.730> dollar<00:02:17.760> then<00:02:18.270> talk

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
two dollars or one dollar then talk

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.540 
two dollars or one dollar then talk
about<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.690> games<00:02:18.870> that<00:02:19.050> you<00:02:19.560> then<00:02:19.740> sold<00:02:20.190> and

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
about the games that you then sold and

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.650 
about the games that you then sold and
get<00:02:20.610> your<00:02:20.760> money<00:02:20.880> back<00:02:21.060> from<00:02:21.210> Lots

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
get your money back from Lots

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.380 
get your money back from Lots
I<00:02:21.690> think<00:02:22.380> it's<00:02:22.740> under<00:02:23.040> $4,000<00:02:23.910> so<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.060> go<00:02:24.240> back

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
I think it's under $4,000 so to go back

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.180 
I think it's under $4,000 so to go back
to<00:02:24.540> what<00:02:24.660> we<00:02:24.750> talked<00:02:24.930> about<00:02:25.050> earlier<00:02:25.200> that's

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
to what we talked about earlier that's

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.710 
to what we talked about earlier that's
because<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:26.850> was<00:02:26.970> kind<00:02:27.180> of<00:02:27.240> thinking<00:02:27.390> that's

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
because I was kind of thinking that's

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.220 
because I was kind of thinking that's
why<00:02:27.870> one<00:02:28.080> another<00:02:28.850> by<00:02:29.850> 2010<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.810> finished<00:02:31.170> my

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
why one another by 2010 I finished my

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.170 
why one another by 2010 I finished my
collection<00:02:31.620> in<00:02:31.920> early<00:02:32.070> 2000s<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:32.850> I<00:02:32.910> think<00:02:33.120> it

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
collection in early 2000s and I think it

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.550 
collection in early 2000s and I think it
ended<00:02:33.330> before<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:34.020> I<00:02:34.050> think<00:02:34.320> you<00:02:34.380> got<00:02:34.530> a

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
ended before that I think you got a

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.320 
ended before that I think you got a
little<00:02:34.710> lucky<00:02:35.100> not<00:02:35.310> chance<00:02:35.520> day<00:02:35.700> event<00:02:36.060> play

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
little lucky not chance day event play

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.930 
little lucky not chance day event play
it's<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.570> caveat<00:02:36.930> um<00:02:37.220> yeah<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.250> think<00:02:38.370> like<00:02:38.760> okay

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
it's a caveat um yeah I think like okay

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.720 
it's a caveat um yeah I think like okay
so<00:02:39.090> we<00:02:39.300> were<00:02:39.390> talking<00:02:39.570> about<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:40.200> know<00:02:40.320> the

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730

so we were talking about you know the
$15,000<00:02:41.730> sale<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.330> I<00:02:42.390> asked<00:02:42.720> how<00:02:42.810> much<00:02:42.930> do<00:02:43.110> you

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
$15,000 sale and I asked how much do you

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.990 
$15,000 sale and I asked how much do you
think<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.470> costs<00:02:43.770> an<00:02:43.860> ebay<00:02:44.160> person<00:02:44.580> do<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:44.880> now

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
think it costs an ebay person do it now

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.120 
think it costs an ebay person do it now
and<00:02:45.150> we<00:02:45.240> said<00:02:45.420> 8,000<00:02:46.020> I<00:02:46.140> think<00:02:46.680> if<00:02:46.770> you<00:02:46.890> look

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
and we said 8,000 I think if you look

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.110 
and we said 8,000 I think if you look
back<00:02:47.370> at<00:02:47.990> 98<00:02:48.990> 99<00:02:49.290> 2000<00:02:50.220> when<00:02:50.400> Nintendo

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
back at 98 99 2000 when Nintendo

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.970 
back at 98 99 2000 when Nintendo
collecting<00:02:51.570> started<00:02:51.960> to<00:02:52.170> become<00:02:52.410> a<00:02:52.470> thing<00:02:52.560> I

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
collecting started to become a thing I

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.290 
collecting started to become a thing I
think<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.850> lot<00:02:54.090> of<00:02:54.330> people<00:02:54.720> were<00:02:54.990> averaging

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
think a lot of people were averaging

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.180 
think a lot of people were averaging
three<00:02:57.300> to<00:02:57.420> five<00:02:57.630> dollars<00:02:58.050> a<00:02:58.080> game<00:02:58.380> for<00:02:59.100> the
