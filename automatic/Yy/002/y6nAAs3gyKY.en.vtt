 you will learn how to make up your day 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.410
 today we are going to see different tricks 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.779
 to create a perfect skin that for me 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.840
 is the most important thing before putting 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.059
 any shadow color or trick what 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.390
 first thing I'm going to do is hydrate the 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.880
 skin should perfectly be a potion 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.020
 perfect to add water I'll 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.000
 I recommend that you apply it with a 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.000
 flat brush or that you also 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:50.720
 you can see with the tips of your fingers 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.910
 feel where water is missing 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:57.320
 They are perfect to apply in any 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.810
 product on the face since it is used 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.530
 a little lip moisturizer the base 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.890
 of makeup 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.080
 today I recommend that it be with a 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.520
 so natural coverage that nobody can 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.080
 perceive 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.050
 basically what it comes 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.420
 makeup now in these times is of 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.900
 create a visual effect of perfection without 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.930
 need to see product on the face 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.810
 I love 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.790
 apply the makeup base before 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:30.140
 any other product that has 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:32.990
 coverage always focused attention 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.470
 of the makeup base in the center the 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:40.760
 nose at the sides a little on the 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:44.840
 chin and between the eyebrows this to give 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.800
 an even and light effect if you think that 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.240
 your makeup base is a bit 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.570
 thick what you can do is with a 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:57.020
 little moisturizer mix a little 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:00.619
 the base and then polish always 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.270
 in a circle and the edu trick is used 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.610
 only in brush joints 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.700
 maybe the whole body the base is left 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:11.660
 scratched in some way the next step 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:15.800
 to create a beautiful skin is to detail 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.380
 circles of dark circles always for 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.510
 cover this point of the dark circles is the 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.940
 creamy concealer good first thing 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.230
 let's identify is the tone that has 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.170
 our hair 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.910
 in the case of sofÃ­a it 's a bit 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.220
 pink violence I will find a tone 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.350
 that is exactly the opposite to the 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.710
 tonality that I have with it I will use 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.700
 something 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:42.130
 touches of yellow to kill this is what 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.370
 what I'm going to do is apply with a 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.710
 flat brush a little product 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.320
 exactly where is the birth 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:53.020
 of the ojera later you can use 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.700
 your finger to soften a bit and give 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.730
 touches on s 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.760
 tone on the sidewalk and in this way 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.790
 is pricing matching 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.370
 coloring another tone that is very 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.049
 similar to sofia skin tone that we 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.439
 it's going to give a little light and I'm going to 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:15.079
 apply on that tone we had 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:18.860
 applied initially with some 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:22.159
 I'm going to use a brush in the form of 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.019
 Natural hair drop can blur from 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:27.200
 such a way the products you never see 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:29.750
 where it begins and where the 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.260
 color when there is a redness what 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.650
 we can do is give touches with the tone 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.840
 of concealer more like your skin succeeded 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:43.329
 here a speck that I can see and with 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:46.480
 a brush can blur fade 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:49.120
 perfectly those 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.599
 and those brands we have to pull 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:56.500
 towards any direction of the skin with 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:04:00.310
 a delineated brush that is very very 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.530
 finite we can perfect any 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.980
 part of the skin applying a little on the 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.930
 tip of the brush or definitely if 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.209
 there are more cases as it is in the whole face 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.400
 instead of applying a thick layer of 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:16.180
 makeup what we're going to do is go 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.670
 perfecting each red dot of 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.230
 face to achieve 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.230
 a perfect skin 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.100
 the next step is one of my parts 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.670
 favorites also that are the lips 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.670
 red lips wrist 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.670
 plasticized
