these<00:00:20.130> braids<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.730> combined<00:00:21.240> two<00:00:21.420> from<00:00:21.779> the

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
these braids I combined two from the

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.679 
these braids I combined two from the
front<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.830> make<00:00:22.980> one<00:00:23.310> in<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.550> back<00:00:23.730> I'm<00:00:24.029> going

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
front to make one in the back I'm going

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.779 
front to make one in the back I'm going
to<00:00:24.750> use<00:00:24.900> this<00:00:25.080> curl<00:00:25.380> on<00:00:25.650> hair<00:00:25.980> but<00:00:26.550> I'm<00:00:26.640> going

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
to use this curl on hair but I'm going

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.250 
to use this curl on hair but I'm going
to<00:00:26.849> separate<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.480> curls<00:00:29.689> so<00:00:30.689> out<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.990> each

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
to separate the curls so out of each

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.810 
to separate the curls so out of each
curl<00:00:31.590> I'm<00:00:31.769> going<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.009> make<00:00:32.130> two<00:00:32.399> separate

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
curl I'm going to make two separate

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.299 
curl I'm going to make two separate
curls<00:00:33.120> by<00:00:33.270> pulling<00:00:33.630> them<00:00:33.750> apart<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.350> want<00:00:35.130> to

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
curls by pulling them apart you want to

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.400 
curls by pulling them apart you want to
just<00:00:35.460> feel<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.969> you're<00:00:36.510> going<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.719> find<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.140> line

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
just feel it you're going to find a line

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.260 
just feel it you're going to find a line
where<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.890> can<00:00:38.100> kind<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.460> separate<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.059> hair

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
where you can kind of separate the hair

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.060 
where you can kind of separate the hair
into<00:00:39.300> two<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.110> it's<00:00:40.559> going<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.829> break<00:00:41.040> apart

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
into two and it's going to break apart

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.660 
into two and it's going to break apart
very<00:00:41.610> easily

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:59.660 

you

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.979 

so<00:01:00.670> this<00:01:00.910> is<00:01:01.090> how<00:01:01.210> much<00:01:01.390> I<00:01:01.540> was<00:01:01.660> able<00:01:01.809> to

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
so this is how much I was able to

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:08.030 
so this is how much I was able to
achieve<00:01:02.200> which<00:01:02.650> is<00:01:02.800> one<00:01:03.100> box<00:01:03.400> of<00:01:03.610> hair

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.650 

anything<00:01:09.040> I've<00:01:09.490> ever<00:01:09.670> seen<00:01:11.940> how<00:01:12.940> can<00:01:13.270> I<00:01:13.420> get

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
anything I've ever seen how can I get

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.179 
anything I've ever seen how can I get
more<00:01:13.840> to<00:01:14.259> see<00:01:14.850> if<00:01:15.850> I<00:01:16.119> don't<00:01:16.360> believe<00:01:16.960> in<00:01:17.410> me

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
more to see if I don't believe in me

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:25.380 
more to see if I don't believe in me

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
so much more to be so much more to see I

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.020 
so much more to be so much more to see I
want<00:01:26.390> so<00:01:26.630> much<00:01:26.840> more<00:01:27.170> from<00:01:27.590> me<00:01:27.770> how<00:01:28.579> do<00:01:28.640> you

want so much more from me how do you
live<00:01:29.299> so<00:01:29.509> freely<00:01:30.320> I<00:01:32.020> thought<00:01:33.020> I<00:01:33.049> could

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
live so freely I thought I could

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.940 
live so freely I thought I could
but<00:01:35.450> just<00:01:35.780> want<00:01:35.960> to<00:01:36.140> learn<00:01:36.380> about<00:01:36.590> me<00:01:38.950> waiting

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
but just want to learn about me waiting

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.480 
but just want to learn about me waiting
in<00:01:40.070> the<00:01:40.310> pool<00:01:40.550> of<00:01:40.780> insecurity<00:01:42.040> more<00:01:43.040> turned

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
in the pool of insecurity more turned

00:01:43.490 --> 00:02:01.180 
in the pool of insecurity more turned
about<00:01:43.880> you<00:01:44.090> than<00:01:44.270> me

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.000 

so<00:02:02.190> this<00:02:02.400> is<00:02:02.580> two<00:02:02.850> boxes<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.300> hair<00:02:03.690> and<00:02:03.870> you<00:02:04.010> can

tell how much I was able to complete
that<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:08.100> hair<00:02:08.340> spreads<00:02:08.789> very<00:02:09.119> quickly<00:02:12.770> when

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
that this hair spreads very quickly when

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.650

you<00:02:13.890> have<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.040> curler<00:02:14.490> type<00:02:14.819> of<00:02:15.000> texture<00:02:15.450> hair

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
you have a curler type of texture hair

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.690 
you have a curler type of texture hair
that<00:02:15.870> you're<00:02:16.020> crocheting<00:02:16.500> in<00:02:16.770> you<00:02:17.400> want<00:02:17.610> to
