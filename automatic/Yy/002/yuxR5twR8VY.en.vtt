00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.149 

the<00:00:00.210> grinder<00:00:00.630> lives<00:00:00.810> a<00:00:00.930> fairly<00:00:01.290> rough<00:00:01.860> light

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
the grinder lives a fairly rough light

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.490 
the grinder lives a fairly rough light
life<00:00:02.820> it's<00:00:03.090> prone<00:00:03.330> to<00:00:03.510> overload<00:00:03.990> it's<00:00:04.230> prone

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
life it's prone to overload it's prone

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.010 
life it's prone to overload it's prone
to<00:00:04.710> abuse<00:00:05.549> and<00:00:05.879> of<00:00:06.270> course<00:00:06.480> it<00:00:06.660> depends<00:00:06.870> what

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
to abuse and of course it depends what

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.120 
to abuse and of course it depends what
you're<00:00:07.140> doing<00:00:07.350> with<00:00:07.500> it<00:00:07.620> but<00:00:07.799> if<00:00:07.980> you're

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
you're doing with it but if you're

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.589 
you're doing with it but if you're
working<00:00:08.280> in<00:00:08.519> metal<00:00:08.849> which<00:00:09.000> is<00:00:09.030> not<00:00:09.269> uncommon

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
working in metal which is not uncommon

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.959 
working in metal which is not uncommon
the<00:00:10.469> thing<00:00:10.620> is<00:00:10.740> actually<00:00:10.920> breathing<00:00:11.370> metal

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
the thing is actually breathing metal

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.570 
the thing is actually breathing metal
dust<00:00:12.240> you<00:00:12.480> know<00:00:12.599> iron<00:00:13.349> filings<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:14.130> storing

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
dust you know iron filings it storing

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.950 
dust you know iron filings it storing
that<00:00:15.210> sort<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:16.400> material<00:00:17.400> in<00:00:17.810> through<00:00:18.810> the

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
that sort of material in through the

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.900 
that sort of material in through the
back<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.410> motor<00:00:19.650> using<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.550> cool<00:00:20.760> the

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
back of the motor using it to cool the

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.490 
back of the motor using it to cool the
motor<00:00:21.029> components<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.869> then<00:00:21.960> expelling<00:00:22.380> it

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
motor components and then expelling it

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.330 
motor components and then expelling it
out<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.890> front

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
out the front

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.279 
out the front
now<00:00:23.699> iron<00:00:23.910> filings<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.720> electricity<00:00:25.080> don't

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
now iron filings and electricity don't

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.470 
now iron filings and electricity don't
mix<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:26.220> if<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.580> motor<00:00:26.789> isn't<00:00:27.090> protected

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
mix so if the motor isn't protected

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.810 
mix so if the motor isn't protected
against<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:28.019> then<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.099> course<00:00:29.340> there<00:00:29.609> there

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
against that then of course there there

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.220 
against that then of course there there
can<00:00:29.970> be<00:00:30.000> short<00:00:30.359> circuits<00:00:30.779> there<00:00:30.929> can<00:00:31.080> be<00:00:31.109> a

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
can be short circuits there can be a

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.740 
can be short circuits there can be a
problem<00:00:31.349> so<00:00:31.800> if<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.820> show<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.030> this<00:00:33.239> motor<00:00:33.480> here

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
problem so if I show you this motor here

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.540 
problem so if I show you this motor here
this<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.020> typical<00:00:34.200> Bosch<00:00:34.890> angle<00:00:35.250> grinder

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
this is a typical Bosch angle grinder

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.430 
this is a typical Bosch angle grinder
motor<00:00:35.730> you'll<00:00:35.940> see<00:00:36.090> there<00:00:36.239> are<00:00:36.440> certain

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
motor you'll see there are certain

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.200 
motor you'll see there are certain
features<00:00:37.620> there<00:00:38.070> which<00:00:38.280> help<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.940> prevent

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
features there which help to prevent

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.610 
features there which help to prevent
this<00:00:39.420> damage<00:00:39.809> first<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.230> all<00:00:40.350> there<00:00:40.500> are<00:00:40.590> no

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
this damage first of all there are no

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.520 
this damage first of all there are no
contacts<00:00:41.489> at<00:00:41.640> all<00:00:41.850> on<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:43.079> field<00:00:43.260> winding

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
contacts at all on the field winding

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.750 
contacts at all on the field winding
this<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:43.950> these<00:00:44.160> are<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.340> windings<00:00:44.700> that

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
this is these are the windings that

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.479 
this is these are the windings that
don't<00:00:45.120> rotate<00:00:46.020> these<00:00:46.500> stay<00:00:46.770> stationary<00:00:47.070> there

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
don't rotate these stay stationary there

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.420 
don't rotate these stay stationary there
are<00:00:47.610> no<00:00:47.760> contacts<00:00:48.329> at<00:00:48.539> all<00:00:48.719> on<00:00:48.960> here<00:00:49.379> okay<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
are no contacts at all on here okay the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.610 
are no contacts at all on here okay the
wire<00:00:50.640> goes<00:00:51.000> directly<00:00:51.480> into<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.930> windings<00:00:52.469> on

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
wire goes directly into the windings on

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
wire goes directly into the windings on
both<00:00:52.890> sides<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:54.360> any<00:00:54.710> buildup<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.739> iron

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
both sides and so any buildup of iron

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.119 
both sides and so any buildup of iron
filings<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.539> waste<00:00:57.899> metal<00:00:58.170> there<00:00:58.469> have<00:00:58.890> no

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
filings of waste metal there have no

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.950 
filings of waste metal there have no
effect<00:00:59.489> there's<00:00:59.640> no<00:00:59.789> possibility<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.510> a

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
effect there's no possibility of a

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.930 
effect there's no possibility of a
short-circuit<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.890> armature<00:01:02.340> itself<00:01:02.789> if

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
short-circuit in the armature itself if

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.670 
short-circuit in the armature itself if
I<00:01:03.030> take<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.420> out<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.140> an<00:01:04.260> armature

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
I take that out this is an armature

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.219 
I take that out this is an armature
typical<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:05.640> type<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:05.909> tool<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.510> we've

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
typical of this type of tool and we've

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.140 
typical of this type of tool and we've
got<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.619> protection<00:01:08.100> grid<00:01:08.490> front<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.030> back

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
got this protection grid front and back

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.149 
got this protection grid front and back
again<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.810> can<00:01:09.990> see<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.320> windings<00:01:10.740> inside

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
again so you can see the windings inside

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.719 
again so you can see the windings inside
which<00:01:11.760> need<00:01:12.000> air<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.780> keep<00:01:12.990> them<00:01:13.380> cool<00:01:14.040> but

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
which need air to keep them cool but

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.390 
which need air to keep them cool but
just<00:01:15.210> above<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.630> here<00:01:15.810> you've<00:01:16.049> got<00:01:16.320> these<00:01:16.590> this

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
just above it here you've got these this

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.550 
just above it here you've got these this
webbing<00:01:17.850> at<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.119> front<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.600> back<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.990> so

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
webbing at the front and the back and so

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.440 
webbing at the front and the back and so
as<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.070> armature<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.640> turning<00:01:21.119> these<00:01:21.270> are

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
as the armature is turning these are

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.020 
as the armature is turning these are
turning<00:01:21.750> at<00:01:21.840> 30<00:01:22.080> 40,000<00:01:23.009> revs<00:01:23.189> per<00:01:23.369> minute<00:01:23.640> if

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
turning at 30 40,000 revs per minute if

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.969 
turning at 30 40,000 revs per minute if
you<00:01:24.180> get<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.360> piece<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.930> abrasive<00:01:25.439> dust<00:01:25.619> coming

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
you get a piece of abrasive dust coming

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.330 
you get a piece of abrasive dust coming
in<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.369> could<00:01:26.869> impact<00:01:27.869> on<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.860> windings

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
in that could impact on the the windings

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.030 
in that could impact on the the windings
it<00:01:29.520> simply<00:01:30.270> knocked<00:01:31.110> away<00:01:31.320> it's<00:01:31.740> almost

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
it simply knocked away it's almost

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.039 
it simply knocked away it's almost
batted<00:01:32.790> out<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.270> way<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.659> allowed<00:01:33.900> to

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
batted out of the way and allowed to

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.749 
batted out of the way and allowed to
continue<00:01:34.350> through<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.770> machine<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.310> out

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
continue through the machine and out

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.630 
continue through the machine and out
through<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.630> front<00:01:36.960> vent<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.590> gearbox<00:01:38.070> so

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
through the front vent on the gearbox so

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.580 
through the front vent on the gearbox so
again<00:01:38.970> these<00:01:39.240> things<00:01:39.600> here<00:01:39.810> will<00:01:39.930> cost<00:01:40.140> money

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
again these things here will cost money

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.710 
again these things here will cost money
you<00:01:41.100> can't<00:01:41.400> incorporate<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:42.180> sort<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.540> motor

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
you can't incorporate that sort of motor

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.139 
you can't incorporate that sort of motor
protection<00:01:43.229> into<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.979> machine<00:01:44.310> that's<00:01:44.610> you

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
protection into a machine that's you

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.080 
protection into a machine that's you
know<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> market<00:01:45.869> for<00:01:46.110> 38<00:01:46.799> quid<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.549> you

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
know on the market for 38 quid so you

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.370 
know on the market for 38 quid so you
pays<00:01:48.299> your<00:01:48.329> money<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.899> takes<00:01:49.049> your

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
pays your money and you takes your

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.200 
pays your money and you takes your
choice<00:01:49.560> really<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.490> wanted<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.850> really<00:01:51.030> sort

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
choice really so I wanted to really sort

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.280 
choice really so I wanted to really sort
of<00:01:51.270> get<00:01:51.390> under<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.659> skin<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.079> tool

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
of get under the skin of the tool

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.020 
of get under the skin of the tool
because<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.680> machine<00:01:52.950> itself<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.430> fairly

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
because the machine itself is fairly

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.359 
because the machine itself is fairly
unremarkable<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.840> terms<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.290> features<00:01:55.860> but<00:01:56.219> it

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
unremarkable in terms of features but it

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.249 
unremarkable in terms of features but it
is<00:01:56.399> built<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.119> give<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.509> good<00:01:57.719> return<00:01:58.049> on

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
is built to give you a good return on

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.350 
is built to give you a good return on
your<00:01:58.350> investment<00:01:59.310> as<00:01:59.430> obviously<00:01:59.969> it's<00:02:00.149> backed

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
your investment as obviously it's backed

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.380 
your investment as obviously it's backed

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
up with the Bosch three-year warranty so

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.510 
up with the Bosch three-year warranty so
it's<00:02:04.020> still<00:02:04.439> worth<00:02:04.649> thinking<00:02:04.890> about<00:02:05.130> the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
it's still worth thinking about the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.119 
it's still worth thinking about the
Bosch<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.630> Bosch<00:02:06.780> brand<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.439> paying<00:02:07.950> that

Bosch the Bosch brand and paying that

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.589 
Bosch the Bosch brand and paying that
little<00:02:08.340> extra<00:02:08.729> when<00:02:09.149> you're<00:02:09.270> talking<00:02:09.569> about
