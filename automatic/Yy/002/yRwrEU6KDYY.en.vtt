in the car movie strip and add that also
it<00:02:25.150> seems<00:02:25.330> to<00:02:25.450> you<00:02:25.510> a<00:02:25.540> bug<00:02:25.810> it<00:02:25.990> puts<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.350> one<00:02:26.530> on

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
it seems to you a bug it puts the one on

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.910 
it seems to you a bug it puts the one on
top<00:02:26.800> of<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.070> other<00:02:27.250> which<00:02:28.000> is<00:02:28.180> kind<00:02:28.420> of<00:02:28.480> silly

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
top of the other which is kind of silly

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.950 
top of the other which is kind of silly
but<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:30.940> we<00:02:31.000> have<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.180> click<00:02:31.330> on<00:02:31.480> this<00:02:31.660> we're

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
but so we have to click on this we're

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.890 
but so we have to click on this we're
going<00:02:32.050> to<00:02:32.170> move<00:02:32.320> it<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:34.630> we're<00:02:34.750> going<00:02:34.840> to

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
going to move it and we're going to

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.420 
going to move it and we're going to
click<00:02:35.080> on<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.380> sound<00:02:35.680> and<00:02:36.010> move<00:02:36.190> it<00:02:36.310> up<00:02:36.340> here

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
click on the sound and move it up here

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.190 
click on the sound and move it up here
also<00:02:36.970> then<00:02:37.630> we<00:02:37.720> want<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:38.020> put<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:39.930> oops<00:02:40.930> I<00:02:41.080> go

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
also then we want to put the oops I go

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.200 
also then we want to put the oops I go
to<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.410> wrong<00:02:41.500> sound<00:02:41.860> anyway<00:02:42.460> we<00:02:42.580> want<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:43.090> put

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
to the wrong sound anyway we want to put

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.820 
to the wrong sound anyway we want to put
this<00:02:43.360> right<00:02:44.110> on<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.500> one<00:02:46.290> which<00:02:47.290> is<00:02:47.530> right

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
this right on the one which is right

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.270 
this right on the one which is right
there<00:02:48.640> and<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:49.290> sound<00:02:50.290> needs<00:02:50.710> to<00:02:50.830> be<00:02:50.920> lined<00:02:51.100> up

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
there and the sound needs to be lined up

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.920 
there and the sound needs to be lined up
so<00:02:51.550> it's<00:02:51.700> also<00:02:51.880> on<00:02:52.180> one<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:54.690> we're<00:02:55.690> going<00:02:55.840> to

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
so it's also on one and we're going to

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.110 
so it's also on one and we're going to
overlap<00:02:56.320> these<00:02:56.620> so<00:02:57.370> we<00:02:57.430> can<00:02:57.550> do<00:02:57.640> a<00:02:57.670> transition

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
overlap these so we can do a transition

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.160 
overlap these so we can do a transition
between<00:02:58.450> them

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.180 

375<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:03.390> quest<00:03:04.290> shift<00:03:04.620> if<00:03:04.800> it's<00:03:04.950> going

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
375 and the quest shift if it's going

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.890 
375 and the quest shift if it's going
too<00:03:05.340> fast<00:03:05.550> it's<00:03:06.180> gives<00:03:06.420> you<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.540> smoother

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
too fast it's gives you a smoother

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.210 
too fast it's gives you a smoother
control<00:03:09.020> so<00:03:10.020> now<00:03:10.140> they're<00:03:10.319> lined<00:03:10.530> up<00:03:10.739> so<00:03:11.069> now

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
control so now they're lined up so now

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.100 
control so now they're lined up so now
we<00:03:11.280> click<00:03:11.520> on<00:03:11.670> this<00:03:11.849> video<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.300> turns<00:03:12.450> white<00:03:12.630> we

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
we click on this video it turns white we

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.930 
we click on this video it turns white we
hold<00:03:13.319> shift<00:03:13.680> click<00:03:14.069> on<00:03:14.190> this<00:03:14.400> video<00:03:14.730> now<00:03:14.910> I

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
hold shift click on this video now I

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.040 
hold shift click on this video now I
have<00:03:15.060> both<00:03:15.270> of<00:03:15.300> them<00:03:15.540> white<00:03:16.010> now<00:03:17.010> we<00:03:17.069> add<00:03:18.050> an

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
have both of them white now we add an

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.600 
have both of them white now we add an
effect<00:03:19.170> strip<00:03:19.709> and<00:03:20.190> I'm<00:03:20.280> going<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.459> use<00:03:20.580> a

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
effect strip and I'm going to use a

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.520 
effect strip and I'm going to use a
gamma<00:03:20.910> cross<00:03:21.180> so<00:03:21.540> you<00:03:21.569> could<00:03:21.750> use<00:03:21.900> cross<00:03:22.230> they

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
gamma cross so you could use cross they

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.170 
gamma cross so you could use cross they
seem<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:22.830> be<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:22.950> same<00:03:23.250> but<00:03:23.459> supposedly<00:03:24.060> this

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
seem to be the same but supposedly this

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.990 
seem to be the same but supposedly this
is<00:03:24.360> better<00:03:25.310> you<00:03:26.310> can<00:03:26.459> see<00:03:26.550> up<00:03:26.640> here<00:03:26.670> we<00:03:26.880> have<00:03:26.970> a

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
is better you can see up here we have a

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.670 
is better you can see up here we have a
very<00:03:27.300> little<00:03:27.600> picture<00:03:27.930> we<00:03:28.200> don't<00:03:28.380> want<00:03:28.530> that

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
very little picture we don't want that

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.740 
very little picture we don't want that
we<00:03:28.800> want<00:03:28.830> a<00:03:29.010> bigger<00:03:29.220> picture<00:03:29.580> so<00:03:29.910> we<00:03:30.030> fit

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
we want a bigger picture so we fit

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.259 
we want a bigger picture so we fit
preview<00:03:31.410> in<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.680> window<00:03:32.010> there<00:03:32.489> we<00:03:32.610> go<00:03:32.760> let's

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
preview in a window there we go let's

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.940 
preview in a window there we go let's
make<00:03:33.450> it<00:03:33.480> even<00:03:33.780> bigger<00:03:34.140> so<00:03:34.590> we've<00:03:34.709> got<00:03:34.800> a<00:03:34.830> lot

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
make it even bigger so we've got a lot

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.259 
make it even bigger so we've got a lot
of<00:03:34.980> room<00:03:35.190> here<00:03:36.500> preview<00:03:37.500> in<00:03:37.709> window<00:03:38.069> again<00:03:38.580> we

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
of room here preview in window again we

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.090 
of room here preview in window again we
can<00:03:39.420> also<00:03:39.569> fit<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.110> strips<00:03:40.530> view<00:03:40.980> all

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
can also fit the strips view all

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.740 
can also fit the strips view all
sequences<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:41.970> there<00:03:42.299> now<00:03:42.480> they're<00:03:42.660> all

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
sequences and there now they're all

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.289 
sequences and there now they're all
nicely<00:03:42.959> fit<00:03:43.319> in<00:03:43.500> here<00:03:43.739> now<00:03:44.670> we<00:03:44.730> can<00:03:44.819> scrub

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
nicely fit in here now we can scrub

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:46.940 
nicely fit in here now we can scrub
along<00:03:45.600> and<00:03:45.930> you<00:03:45.989> can<00:03:46.080> see<00:03:46.260> there's<00:03:46.500> a<00:03:46.560> stuff<00:03:46.830> in

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
along and you can see there's a stuff in

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.850 
along and you can see there's a stuff in
the<00:03:47.040> hallway<00:03:47.310> and<00:03:48.120> now<00:03:48.330> it<00:03:48.480> starts<00:03:48.870> to<00:03:49.019> fade<00:03:49.350> to

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
the hallway and now it starts to fade to

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.729 
the hallway and now it starts to fade to
the<00:03:49.890> car<00:03:50.370> and<00:03:50.730> there's<00:03:51.450> my<00:03:51.780> wife<00:03:51.959> and<00:03:52.170> kids<00:03:52.380> all

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
the car and there's my wife and kids all

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.990 
the car and there's my wife and kids all
blurry<00:03:53.810> pixelated<00:03:54.810> in<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.200> car<00:03:55.730> so<00:03:56.730> that's

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
blurry pixelated in the car so that's

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.630 
blurry pixelated in the car so that's
basically<00:03:57.720> all<00:03:57.930> there<00:03:58.110> is<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:58.650> it<00:03:58.830> to<00:03:59.040> finish

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
basically all there is to it to finish

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.280

the crossover it tells you it's a gamma

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.659 
the crossover it tells you it's a gamma
cross<00:04:27.360> and<00:04:28.110> Replace<00:04:28.560> you<00:04:28.890> can<00:04:29.010> do<00:04:29.130> all<00:04:29.310> sorts

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
cross and Replace you can do all sorts

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.950 
cross and Replace you can do all sorts
of<00:04:29.729> other<00:04:30.000> type<00:04:30.270> of<00:04:31.280> effects<00:04:32.960> mathematical

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
of other type of effects mathematical

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.780 
of other type of effects mathematical
ideas<00:04:34.320> with<00:04:34.620> it

and there's other settings there's not
so<00:04:38.740> much<00:04:38.920> on<00:04:39.100> gamma<00:04:39.460> cross<00:04:39.730> but<00:04:39.970> on<00:04:40.060> other

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
so much on gamma cross but on other

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.840 
so much on gamma cross but on other
effects<00:04:42.040> you<00:04:42.160> can<00:04:42.280> add<00:04:42.460> there<00:04:42.730> will<00:04:42.820> be
