00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
nice red finish up top here really nice

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.160 
nice red finish up top here really nice
definitely<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.730> better<00:00:36.059> quality<00:00:36.420> bag<00:00:36.870> than

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
definitely a better quality bag than

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.139 
definitely a better quality bag than
we've<00:00:37.350> seen<00:00:37.380> in<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.770> past<00:00:37.860> like<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.850> said<00:00:39.030> this

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
we've seen in the past like I said this

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.600 
we've seen in the past like I said this
feels<00:00:39.540> like<00:00:39.809> it's<00:00:40.020> insulated<00:00:40.920> almost<00:00:41.190> but<00:00:41.579> I

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
feels like it's insulated almost but I

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.100 
feels like it's insulated almost but I
guess<00:00:41.790> it's<00:00:41.969> just<00:00:42.030> line<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:42.899> if

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
guess it's just line so that if

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.630 
guess it's just line so that if
something<00:00:43.320> spills<00:00:43.739> in<00:00:44.010> there<00:00:44.190> it's<00:00:44.340> not<00:00:44.489> going

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
something spills in there it's not going

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.729 
something spills in there it's not going
to<00:00:44.730> go<00:00:44.820> through<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.210> bag<00:00:45.390> or<00:00:45.899> completely<00:00:46.410> ruin

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
to go through the bag or completely ruin

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.500 
to go through the bag or completely ruin
the<00:00:46.860> bag<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.219> does<00:00:47.370> have<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> lining<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.300> there

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
the bag it does have a lining in there

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.080 
the bag it does have a lining in there
so<00:00:49.050> inside<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.770> glam<00:00:50.039> bag<00:00:50.309> looks<00:00:50.610> like<00:00:50.730> that

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
so inside the glam bag looks like that

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.150 
so inside the glam bag looks like that
so<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.750> first<00:00:51.870> product<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.440> see<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.890> something

really like this packaging it's

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.750 
really like this packaging it's
different<00:02:11.260> than<00:02:11.470> your<00:02:11.800> average<00:02:11.980> lip<00:02:12.490> gloss

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
different than your average lip gloss

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.660 
different than your average lip gloss
it's<00:02:13.060> really<00:02:13.420> nice<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.770> color<00:02:14.980> itself<00:02:15.190> is

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670

it's really nice and the color itself is
a<00:02:15.700> nice<00:02:16.060> pink<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:18.040> guess<00:02:18.220> this<00:02:18.430> is<00:02:18.580> in<00:02:18.790> bomb

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
a nice pink and I guess this is in bomb

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.390

number<00:02:19.360> 4<00:02:19.810> this<00:02:20.770> doesn't<00:02:20.980> have<00:02:21.070> a<00:02:21.190> color

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
number 4 this doesn't have a color

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.220 
number 4 this doesn't have a color
listed<00:02:21.850> but<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.090> does<00:02:22.240> say<00:02:22.450> this<00:02:22.750> is<00:02:22.989> their
