so<00:03:34.600> we'll<00:03:35.500> talk<00:03:35.709> about<00:03:35.830> the<00:03:36.010> design<00:03:36.340> later<00:03:36.610> but

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
so we'll talk about the design later but

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.790 
so we'll talk about the design later but
can<00:03:37.150> they<00:03:37.360> print<00:03:37.690> your<00:03:37.989> hair<00:03:38.290> extension

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
extensions too and then you'd want to

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.970 
extensions too and then you'd want to
get<00:03:43.480> a<00:03:43.510> minimum<00:03:43.840> order<00:03:44.050> quantity<00:03:44.440> for<00:03:44.470> those

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
get a minimum order quantity for those

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.949 
get a minimum order quantity for those
packages<00:03:45.730> as<00:03:45.910> well<00:03:46.120> because<00:03:46.480> that<00:03:46.510> will<00:03:46.810> be<00:03:46.930> a

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
packages as well because that will be a

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.780 
packages as well because that will be a
separate<00:03:47.410> price<00:03:47.650> than<00:03:47.950> just<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:48.280> extensions

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
separate price than just the extensions

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.790 
separate price than just the extensions
the<00:03:49.239> next<00:03:49.480> step<00:03:49.660> is<00:03:49.810> to<00:03:49.959> order<00:03:50.290> and<00:03:50.500> test

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
the next step is to order and test

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.710 
the next step is to order and test
samples<00:03:51.190> and<00:03:51.610> you<00:03:51.670> really<00:03:52.209> really<00:03:52.239> want<00:03:52.630> to

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
samples and you really really want to

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.600 
samples and you really really want to
take<00:03:52.870> some<00:03:53.080> time<00:03:53.320> testing<00:03:53.950> the<00:03:54.070> samples<00:03:54.220> and

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
take some time testing the samples and

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.250 
take some time testing the samples and
making<00:03:54.910> sure<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.239> quality<00:03:55.420> is<00:03:55.750> up<00:03:55.930> to<00:03:56.080> your

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
making sure the quality is up to your

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.770 
making sure the quality is up to your
standards<00:03:56.709> for<00:03:56.980> what<00:03:57.250> you<00:03:57.880> want<00:03:58.180> your<00:03:58.600> brand

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
standards for what you want your brand

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.979 
standards for what you want your brand
to<00:03:59.140> be<00:03:59.320> all<00:03:59.769> about<00:04:00.150> okay<00:04:01.150> and<00:04:01.390> then<00:04:01.510> on<00:04:01.630> my<00:04:01.780> list

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
to be all about okay and then on my list

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:03.960 
to be all about okay and then on my list
this<00:04:02.140> is<00:04:02.200> step<00:04:02.560> eight<00:04:02.860> it<00:04:03.190> would<00:04:03.280> be<00:04:03.459> to<00:04:03.610> create

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
this is step eight it would be to create

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.000 
this is step eight it would be to create
a<00:04:04.000> logo<00:04:04.480> and<00:04:04.660> a<00:04:04.750> package<00:04:05.110> design<00:04:05.500> from<00:04:05.920> a

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
a logo and a package design from a

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.590 
a logo and a package design from a
graphic<00:04:06.340> designer<00:04:06.700> so<00:04:06.940> a<00:04:06.970> graphic<00:04:07.330> designer

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
graphic designer so a graphic designer

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.240 
graphic designer so a graphic designer
can<00:04:07.870> make<00:04:08.019> this<00:04:08.170> for<00:04:08.410> you<00:04:08.500> and<00:04:08.739> again<00:04:08.830> I'll<00:04:09.070> go

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
can make this for you and again I'll go

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.040 
can make this for you and again I'll go
way<00:04:09.459> into<00:04:09.820> more<00:04:10.000> detail<00:04:10.330> later<00:04:10.480> about<00:04:10.630> that

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
way into more detail later about that

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.170 
way into more detail later about that
but<00:04:11.709> I'd<00:04:11.830> only<00:04:11.860> do<00:04:12.130> want<00:04:12.310> your<00:04:12.400> logo<00:04:12.580> you<00:04:13.000> want

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.020 
finally received my products in the mail
in<00:04:34.470> the<00:04:34.590> package<00:04:34.950> with<00:04:35.130> my<00:04:35.280> design<00:04:35.550> and<00:04:35.760> logo

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
in the package with my design and logo

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.540 
in the package with my design and logo
and<00:04:36.240> tagline<00:04:36.450> and<00:04:36.960> all<00:04:37.080> that<00:04:37.290> so<00:04:37.770> much<00:04:37.950> fun<00:04:38.190> and

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
and tagline and all that so much fun and

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.000 
and tagline and all that so much fun and
the<00:04:39.510> next<00:04:39.780> step<00:04:39.960> would<00:04:40.080> be<00:04:40.139> to<00:04:40.230> trademark<00:04:40.620> your

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
the next step would be to trademark your

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.190 
the next step would be to trademark your
brand<00:04:41.310> so<00:04:41.760> when<00:04:42.150> you<00:04:42.240> trademark<00:04:42.840> something

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
brand so when you trademark something

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.629 
brand so when you trademark something
you<00:04:43.290> have<00:04:43.470> to<00:04:43.590> trademark<00:04:43.860> every<00:04:44.370> three<00:04:44.550> to

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
you have to trademark every three to

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.220 
you have to trademark every three to
five<00:04:44.820> years<00:04:45.090> I<00:04:45.210> think<00:04:45.270> it<00:04:45.480> is<00:04:45.600> roughly<00:04:45.990> I<00:04:46.020> don't

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
five years I think it is roughly I don't

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.290 
five years I think it is roughly I don't
remember<00:04:46.410> the<00:04:46.590> exact<00:04:46.970> timeframe<00:04:47.970> but<00:04:48.240> you

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
remember the exact timeframe but you

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.020 
remember the exact timeframe but you
have<00:04:48.419> to<00:04:48.510> reapply<00:04:49.020> for<00:04:49.290> a<00:04:49.320> trademark<00:04:49.590> so<00:04:50.280> when
