racketeering<00:00:11.820> file<00:00:12.030> so<00:00:12.929> right<00:00:13.860> in<00:00:14.130> front<00:00:14.370> of

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
racketeering file so right in front of

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.050 
racketeering file so right in front of
you<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:14.940> have<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.509> partly<00:00:16.020> created<00:00:17.060> revolved

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
you you have a partly created revolved

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.650 
you you have a partly created revolved
surface<00:00:18.570> which<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.470> going<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.980> be<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.000> component

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
surface which is going to be a component

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.570 
surface which is going to be a component
of<00:00:21.869> your<00:00:23.600> soccer<00:00:24.600> ball<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:25.619> let's<00:00:26.010> say<00:00:26.220> you

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
of your soccer ball so let's say you

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.570 
of your soccer ball so let's say you
have<00:00:26.670> done<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.150> much<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:28.289> are<00:00:28.949> going<00:00:29.340> to

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
have done this much and you are going to

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.049 
have done this much and you are going to
do<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.420> next<00:00:30.599> step<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.529> offset<00:00:32.059> so

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
do the next step that is the offset so

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.389 
do the next step that is the offset so
select<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.750> offset<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.440> select<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.920> surface

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
select the offset and select the surface

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.320 
select the offset and select the surface
here<00:00:35.750> and

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.330 
here and

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.620 
here and
give<00:00:38.780> an<00:00:38.900> offset<00:00:39.260> of<00:00:39.440> say<00:00:39.650> 10<00:00:40.150> click<00:00:41.150> preview

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.630 
give an offset of say 10 click preview

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.260 
give an offset of say 10 click preview
make<00:00:42.320> sure<00:00:42.560> the<00:00:42.920> offset<00:00:43.310> is<00:00:43.460> towards<00:00:44.150> the

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
make sure the offset is towards the

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.750 
make sure the offset is towards the
inward<00:00:44.720> direction<00:00:45.350> if<00:00:45.530> it's<00:00:46.100> not<00:00:46.340> you<00:00:46.610> can

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
inward direction if it's not you can

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.660 
inward direction if it's not you can
click<00:00:46.940> on<00:00:47.180> this<00:00:47.360> red<00:00:47.600> arrow<00:00:47.870> and<00:00:48.230> you<00:00:48.500> can<00:00:48.770> swap

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
click on this red arrow and you can swap

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.360 
click on this red arrow and you can swap
the<00:00:49.880> direction<00:00:53.140> you<00:00:54.140> can<00:00:54.350> click<00:00:54.620> here<00:00:54.920> and<00:00:55.250> you

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
the direction you can click here and you

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.939 
the direction you can click here and you
can<00:00:55.400> slap

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
can slap

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.049 
can slap
so<00:00:57.550> once<00:00:58.149> that<00:00:58.269> is<00:00:58.390> done<00:00:58.660> click<00:00:58.899> on<00:00:59.140> okay<00:00:59.469> and

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
so once that is done click on okay and

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:07.710 
so once that is done click on okay and
then<00:01:02.429> go<00:01:03.429> to<00:01:03.659> the<00:01:04.710> extrude<00:01:05.710> command<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.970> so<00:01:07.570> it

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
then go to the extrude command and so it

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.280 
then go to the extrude command and so it
surface<00:01:08.259> Xcode<00:01:08.979> select<00:01:09.700> this<00:01:09.970> and<00:01:10.390> do<00:01:11.170> the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
surface Xcode select this and do the

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.730 
surface Xcode select this and do the
extrusion<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:13.360> little<00:01:13.869> bit<00:01:14.020> you<00:01:14.170> pull<00:01:14.470> the

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
extrusion so little bit you pull the

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.520 
extrusion so little bit you pull the
limit<00:01:15.310> downwards<00:01:15.880> that<00:01:16.330> this<00:01:17.080> particular

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
limit downwards that this particular

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.330 
limit downwards that this particular
part<00:01:17.860> is<00:01:18.670> coming

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
part is coming

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.840 
part is coming
and<00:01:21.479> click<00:01:22.479> on<00:01:22.659> okay

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
and click on okay

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.840 
and click on okay
and<00:01:23.940> do<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.080> same<00:01:25.320> step<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:26.190> do<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> extrusion

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
and do the same step to do the extrusion

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.710 
and do the same step to do the extrusion
for<00:01:27.300> our<00:01:27.920> second<00:01:28.920> sketch<00:01:29.190> here<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:30.060> do<00:01:30.570> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
for our second sketch here and do the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.920 
for our second sketch here and do the
same<00:01:30.960> step<00:01:31.320> here<00:01:31.650> as<00:01:31.880> your<00:01:32.880> your<00:01:33.240> extrusion

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
same step here as your your extrusion

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.320 
same step here as your your extrusion
was<00:01:34.140> coming<00:01:35.010> upwards<00:01:35.400> in<00:01:35.580> the<00:01:35.670> first<00:01:35.940> command

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
was coming upwards in the first command

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.390 
was coming upwards in the first command
it's<00:01:36.600> being<00:01:37.260> done<00:01:37.500> well<00:01:37.800> nightly<00:01:38.220> on<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
it's being done well nightly on the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.310 
it's being done well nightly on the
second<00:01:38.760> one<00:01:38.850> click<00:01:39.659> OK<00:01:40.050> and<00:01:40.619> now<00:01:41.840> we<00:01:42.840> need<00:01:43.020> to

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
second one click OK and now we need to

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.749 
second one click OK and now we need to
do<00:01:43.800> the<00:01:44.070> trim<00:01:44.580> command<00:01:45.619> select<00:01:46.759> this

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
do the trim command select this

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.270 
do the trim command select this
particular<00:01:48.030> extrude<00:01:48.869> er<00:01:49.080> done<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.590> this

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
particular extrude er done and this

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.150 
particular extrude er done and this
revolute<00:01:50.880> 3<00:01:52.040> one<00:01:53.040> two<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.940> then<00:01:54.900> other<00:01:55.740> side

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
revolute 3 one two and then other side

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:03.500 
revolute 3 one two and then other side
other<00:01:57.090> side<00:01:57.560> that's<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.800> click<00:01:59.759> OK

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.830 

again<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.380> need<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.680> do<00:02:04.800> the<00:02:04.980> same<00:02:05.190> step<00:02:05.840> for

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
again you need to do the same step for

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.100 
again you need to do the same step for
this<00:02:06.990> for<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.310> here<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:09.210> beginners<00:02:09.600> are<00:02:09.840> going

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
this for so here the beginners are going

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.930 
this for so here the beginners are going
to<00:02:10.320> face<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.620> difficulty<00:02:11.370> because<00:02:11.670> they'll<00:02:11.910> be

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
to face a difficulty because they'll be

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.780 
to face a difficulty because they'll be
wondering<00:02:12.510> where<00:02:13.140> is<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.440> surface<00:02:14.010> so<00:02:14.580> that's

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
wondering where is a surface so that's

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.700 
wondering where is a surface so that's
the<00:02:14.970> reason<00:02:15.270> I've<00:02:15.420> shown<00:02:16.020> you<00:02:16.050> you<00:02:16.440> need<00:02:16.680> to

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
the reason I've shown you you need to

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.410 
the reason I've shown you you need to
select<00:02:17.010> their<00:02:17.280> blue<00:02:17.550> 3<00:02:17.820> so<00:02:18.420> this<00:02:18.660> one<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.200> w3

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
select their blue 3 so this one and w3

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.560 
select their blue 3 so this one and w3
you<00:02:21.420> can<00:02:21.660> click<00:02:21.960> on<00:02:22.140> other<00:02:22.350> side<00:02:22.800> other<00:02:23.130> side

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
you can click on other side other side

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.140 
you can click on other side other side
click<00:02:24.570> ok<00:02:24.960> and<00:02:25.230> use<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.310> same<00:02:26.580> trimming

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
click ok and use the same trimming

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.950 
click ok and use the same trimming
technique<00:02:27.630> for<00:02:28.670> trimming<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.820> rest<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.480> the

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
technique for trimming the rest of the

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.020 
technique for trimming the rest of the
surfaces

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
surfaces

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.140 
surfaces
other<00:02:33.480> side

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.920 

so<00:02:36.860> here<00:02:37.860> it's<00:02:38.069> offset<00:02:38.640> so<00:02:39.000> make<00:02:39.239> sure<00:02:39.269> when

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
so here it's offset so make sure when

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.199

you have a portion of your Pentagon and

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.550 
you have a portion of your Pentagon and
hexagon<00:03:07.620> being<00:03:08.489> aligned<00:03:08.849> in<00:03:09.060> front<00:03:09.299> of<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:09.629> so

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
hexagon being aligned in front of you so

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.710 
hexagon being aligned in front of you so
the<00:03:11.250> next<00:03:11.489> step<00:03:11.790> is<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.510> go<00:03:12.959> to<00:03:13.019> insert<00:03:13.260> and

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
the next step is to go to insert and

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.899 
the next step is to go to insert and
operations<00:03:15.739> you<00:03:16.739> need<00:03:16.860> to<00:03:17.010> do<00:03:17.129> a<00:03:17.159> fill<00:03:17.519> up<00:03:17.670> for

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
operations you need to do a fill up for

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.710 
operations you need to do a fill up for
this<00:03:18.109> so<00:03:19.109> you<00:03:19.879> can<00:03:20.879> hide<00:03:21.120> this<00:03:21.269> particular

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
this so you can hide this particular

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:30.940 
this so you can hide this particular
part<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:22.549> sort<00:03:23.549> of<00:03:23.700> giving<00:03:24.450> Phillip

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.520 

so<00:03:31.580> you<00:03:31.640> have<00:03:31.819> selected<00:03:32.360> all<00:03:32.540> the<00:03:32.660> faces

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.090 

make<00:03:36.040> sure<00:03:37.590> okay

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
make sure okay

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.000 
make sure okay
as<00:03:39.430> this<00:03:40.000> isn't<00:03:40.210> a<00:03:40.390> hexagon<00:03:41.020> you'll<00:03:41.410> have<00:03:41.710> six

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
as this isn't a hexagon you'll have six

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.370 
as this isn't a hexagon you'll have six
phases<00:03:42.460> in<00:03:42.700> one<00:03:42.880> face<00:03:43.150> so<00:03:43.870> make<00:03:44.050> sure<00:03:44.080> you're

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
phases in one face so make sure you're

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.699 
phases in one face so make sure you're
having<00:03:44.590> seven<00:03:45.130> elements<00:03:45.460> here

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
having seven elements here

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.199 
having seven elements here
the<00:03:48.190> radius<00:03:48.610> as<00:03:49.360> before<00:03:50.610> so<00:03:51.610> you<00:03:51.670> have<00:03:51.970> your

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
the radius as before so you have your

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.100 
the radius as before so you have your
first<00:03:53.010> particular<00:03:54.420> element<00:03:55.420> being<00:03:55.659> created

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
first particular element being created

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.700 
first particular element being created
hide<00:03:56.680> this<00:03:57.069> and<00:03:58.620> unhide<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.950> other<00:04:00.280> part

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
hide this and unhide the other part

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.510 
hide this and unhide the other part
and<00:04:01.800> do<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.520> same<00:04:02.730> technique<00:04:03.060> for<00:04:03.540> this<00:04:04.520> that

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
and do the same technique for this that

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.560 
and do the same technique for this that
is<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:06.060> H<00:04:06.660> valid<00:04:07.140> and<00:04:07.640> here<00:04:08.640> your<00:04:09.030> number<00:04:09.450> of

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
is the H valid and here your number of

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:17.020 
is the H valid and here your number of
elements<00:04:10.260> should<00:04:10.650> be<00:04:11.030> 6

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.280 

and<00:04:17.560> click<00:04:18.560> ok<00:04:18.980> and<00:04:19.310> you<00:04:20.180> have<00:04:20.420> your<00:04:20.690> second

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
and click ok and you have your second

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.159
