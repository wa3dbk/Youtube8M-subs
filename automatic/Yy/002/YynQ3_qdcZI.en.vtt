00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.249
 designed to come to the city 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:19.329
 and wanted to buy more species of seed city plants to reproduce 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.700
 and one day I went to the bus terminal 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.440
 I met people that I knew from all my life and throughout life 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.689
 miss oh 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.529
 I do not know my show as well as 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.230
 distrustful and not say that 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.300
 that I came with them 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.650
 he told me nothing and my cousin kiva the military pro and yanuncay equaled the 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.030
 bus station 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.320
 and when they gave me they told me what are you going to do 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.900
 yes yes yes there is still no one by tito is alone here 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.620
 does not have any phone 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.420
 and it caused me a fear I do not know if because it was the first time I'm going to 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.020
 the city the only thing I do know is that I agreed to see them in the face 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.290
 at the airport and they told me on the way 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.860
 that they were going to give me the ticket back and that I was not going to a plane to Tijuana 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.280
 because they bought the berlocq clientele for the clothing store that 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.039
 They had 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:13.780
 They bought their clothes in Tijuana 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.820
 so that they could not leave me there just to go with them 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.470
 besides the terminal her husband of hers 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.470
 he told me I'm going to charge the child help connect 4 l 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.680
 this 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.420
 we do not move another one here - you started uphill the magazine 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.400
 just teramo 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.469
 immediately 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:37.350
 it was not filled with agents 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.630
 and it took about three hours when they came with the package analysis 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.619
 hyde inside the package they took out a substance with a very pungent odor 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.550
 this they and they loved acetylene morphine 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.810
 I did not even understand what that was 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.800
 but one of the medical court for almunia showed 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.080
 you're going to stay for many years because of this 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.040
 this is a drug other than very expensive 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.320
 it was a very dangerous joke where are you going to draw 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.580
 and the leader of the band 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.580
 Who do you work with 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.189
 they took a place that they had many old and 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:19.709
 I was selling 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:20.629
 there was a 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:21.919
 a lot of violence 

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:23.209
 this 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.640
 they burned me 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.559
 already in the last times the last two days 

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:31.159
 I remember that he took a priest people who nicknamed him the wolf has never been 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:32.049
 forgotten 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.630
 and he told ap we send that here and the matter where 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.019
 lose and go through a lot of places and you have not wanted to sing 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.149
 because with me even the modes speak although they are made 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.659
 I'm going to give a rape that did not prove life while you live 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.919
 When he did, I felt that this key was in a thousand pieces and I felt 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:56.230
 I felt vulnerable present I will leave I felt alone 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:59.990
 the only thing that I remember of laws the weak weight 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.939
 and that smell 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:04.939
 and he told me now if they are going to sign 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:07.829
 and brought a paper 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.199
 the first time I went to the court because they already showed me where I had signed 

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:13.260
 i 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.650
 girlfriends, but 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.090
 this xiv and the secretary of agreements and they told me that in the civil process 

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:21.010
 very fast because I was with freezer 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.129
 the mass requested that confesses it and all the terms that used 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.479
 it took about five months until my family realized 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:32.949
 for a newspaper from where I was spending the years amen of transmetro 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:34.959
 they swam to the penitentiary 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.739
 but it was so much my pain and so much micro of that 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.709
 the courage was what pushed me 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.859
 imef and high to what they say is called school 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:44.829
 in less than 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.209
 six months 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.599
 I did I chose and I was learning to read and write 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:50.989
 first I read 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.989
 run 

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:57.449
 and it said 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.749
 sentence 22 years 

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:05.029
 I think I ended up accepting what in that judge and that criminologist said to me 

00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:10.419
 what do I care if you were deceived if you were a victim of eta of 2001 things 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:11.740
 to me what matters to me 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.790
 is that he had guts over and for me that is what matters and my sentence 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.440
 and I thought that what brought pink Julia was going to jail brought me the 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.500
 ignorance in the sociocultural session 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.570
 he highlighted hunger 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.570
 He brought me one and a thousand things 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.129
 He spent all that time 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:38.939
 and one day they told me I was free 

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:40.259
 I could not believe 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:43.009
 and they said to the coast of a 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:46.419
 I want to see if it is true that my name I want to see if rosa julia leyva 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.389
 and that in that name that I good level 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.199
 and if it was true nibali 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.360
 when I got to jail I died for the people from outside inasi for a life cross 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.099
 now I am dying for this life this and not being again for my family I have 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:04.560
 down many say many side looking for a job and everywhere I ask for the 

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:06.249
 no criminal record 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:08.050
 what I do 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.729
 with victory of life I try to patch up little of the social fabric 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.819
 miyazaki liguilla 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:34.039
 sader
