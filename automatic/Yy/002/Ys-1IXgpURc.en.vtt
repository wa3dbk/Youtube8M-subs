bungee as well so the DC 1 2 &amp; 2

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.170 
bungee as well so the DC 1 2 &amp; 2
regulator<00:00:56.129> set<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.870> a<00:00:57.870> very<00:00:58.410> high<00:00:58.559> performance

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
regulator set is a very high performance

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.840 
regulator set is a very high performance
diaphragm<00:01:00.379> first<00:01:01.379> stage<00:01:01.649> with<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.579> fully

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
diaphragm first stage with a fully

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.890 
diaphragm first stage with a fully
balanced<00:01:03.180> second<00:01:03.510> stage<00:01:03.690> as<00:01:03.840> well<00:01:05.180> the<00:01:06.180> DC<00:01:06.780> 1

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
balanced second stage as well the DC 1

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.530 
balanced second stage as well the DC 1
first<00:01:07.080> stage<00:01:07.380> uses<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.340> low<00:01:08.549> pressure<00:01:08.790> swivel

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
first stage uses a low pressure swivel

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
first stage uses a low pressure swivel
so<00:01:09.780> you've<00:01:09.900> got<00:01:10.020> four

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
so you've got four

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.520 
so you've got four
low<00:01:11.430> pressure<00:01:11.610> ports<00:01:12.060> around<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.659> ring<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.049> a

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
low pressure ports around the ring and a

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.560 
low pressure ports around the ring and a
high<00:01:13.680> pressure<00:01:13.890> sorry<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.880> low<00:01:15.030> pressure<00:01:15.240> port

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
high pressure sorry a low pressure port

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.850 
high pressure sorry a low pressure port
in<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.689> end<00:01:15.810> as<00:01:15.930> well<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.320> do<00:01:16.439> have<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.650> high

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
in the end as well so you do have a high

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.780 
in the end as well so you do have a high
flow<00:01:17.240> port<00:01:18.240> there<00:01:18.479> if<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.750> need<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.520> got<00:01:20.520> to

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
flow port there if you need to got to

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.380 
flow port there if you need to got to
high<00:01:21.210> pressure<00:01:21.450> ports<00:01:21.840> obviously<00:01:22.320> one

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
high pressure ports obviously one

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.929 
high pressure ports obviously one

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.300 
one wound it all the way out make us
always<00:02:13.930> it<00:02:14.019> makes<00:02:14.170> it<00:02:14.349> much<00:02:14.829> easier<00:02:15.040> to

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
always it makes it much easier to

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.740 
always it makes it much easier to
breathe<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:16.750> also<00:02:16.900> have<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:17.170> venturi<00:02:17.799> control

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
breathe you also have a venturi control

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.899 
breathe you also have a venturi control
just<00:02:19.750> this<00:02:19.870> little<00:02:20.079> switch<00:02:20.200> here<00:02:20.879> which<00:02:21.879> just

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
just this little switch here which just

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.059 
just this little switch here which just
controls<00:02:22.629> the<00:02:22.780> way<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:22.959> airflow<00:02:23.530> is<00:02:23.680> inside

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
controls the way the airflow is inside

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.369 
controls the way the airflow is inside
the<00:02:24.220> second<00:02:24.519> stage<00:02:24.730> so<00:02:25.269> if<00:02:25.360> in<00:02:25.540> its<00:02:25.659> -<00:02:25.959> position

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
the second stage so if in its - position

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.080 
the second stage so if in its - position
it's<00:02:26.530> helping<00:02:26.769> to<00:02:26.950> prevent<00:02:27.220> free<00:02:27.519> flows<00:02:27.819> by

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
it's helping to prevent free flows by

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.940 
it's helping to prevent free flows by
forcing<00:02:28.540> air<00:02:28.659> back<00:02:29.140> towards<00:02:29.439> the<00:02:29.500> diaphragm

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
forcing air back towards the diaphragm

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.429 
forcing air back towards the diaphragm
and<00:02:30.189> helping<00:02:30.609> shut<00:02:30.849> that<00:02:31.000> valve<00:02:31.299> down<00:02:31.510> and

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:32.439 
and helping shut that valve down and

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:34.140 
and helping shut that valve down and
I'll<00:02:32.530> see<00:02:32.680> in<00:02:32.769> the<00:02:32.829> positive<00:02:32.980> mode<00:02:33.340> airs<00:02:33.909> are

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
I'll see in the positive mode airs are

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.130 
I'll see in the positive mode airs are
now<00:02:34.239> to<00:02:34.299> come<00:02:34.569> straight<00:02:34.780> forward<00:02:35.079> to
