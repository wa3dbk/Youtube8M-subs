00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 and they are male 2015 we will show you the 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.330
 intermediate versions in this video 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.790
 versions 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.200
 the sv version then the one that we are 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:16.260
 showing there the version s she has two 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.060
 engine options 1.0 engine and 1.6 engine 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.449
 s version has no fog lights 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.580
 as we can see however rear view mirrors 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.029
 have carcasses painted in the color of the 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.810
 Doorknobs are black wheels are 14 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.399
 inches with integral caps 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.899
 so it aesthetically does not have much 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.360
 difference from the input version 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.390
 which is a comfort version 1.0 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.980
 all have rear wiper and 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.140
 rear defroster 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.410
 the interior is that it brings the largest 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.670
 differences gives comfort to s good rs as 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.200
 the comfort comes with air conditioning 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.600
 direction with electric assistance 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.850
 board computer driver's seat 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.120
 with height adjustment 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.530
 however the sv version adds glass 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.620
 the four ports 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.180
 how can we see there locks 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.689
 the four doors and the 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.510
 key holder keyring pocketknife with a 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:14.130
 for opening the doors and the 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:18.390
 and rear-view mirrors also have 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.150
 is electric adjustment does not come with system 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.680
 sound is the air conditioning is manual type 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.950
 the steering wheel is very similar to the 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.020
 center is the top mid-size sedan of the 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.900
 Adding in Brazil with us you can see 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.420
 version with the rear windows 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.180
 electric coated doors 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.610
 plastic coating on black fabric and 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.990
 gray and two head restraints on the seat 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:50.159
 rear engine version 1.0 s always 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.530
 1.0 with 74 horses and there the version s 1.6 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.630
 then the intermediate version too 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.420
 immediately above gives comfort however 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.540
 with 1.6 engine the only differentiation in 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.790
 relation to 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.940
 1,100 basically a motor that she 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.230
 uses the same hubs even the wheels of 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.970
 14 inches 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:12.430
 even the dinghy in the back we have 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.910
 rear wiper and knobs 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.010
 painted in black 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.470
 so how can we see a version s 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:25.270
 which has as a differential the engine 1.6 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:32.290
 Four-cylinder 111 horsepower accelerates 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:34.750
 0-100 9.88 seconds or 9.59 ahead of the 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.540
 new nissan march front does not count 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.240
 with fog lights in this version that 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.330
 the version immediately above the version 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.470
 the interior also again in the 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.840
 versions 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.060
 It's just like this is the engine of the 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.000
 version with engine 1.6 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:56.680
 then there is no difference to the 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.140
 black seats in fabric sound system is 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.760
 it comes with preparation for the 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.060
 sound but does not come the air sound system 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.280
 manual control conditioning 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:10.600
 the electric window controls 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.550
 doors is also have a part is 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.910
 invested in tissue but most are 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:18.580
 black square air vents and there the 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.360
 People can take a look at the space 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.630
 internal 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:26.440
 we check that the knobs have 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:30.310
 a chrome finish in this version s 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:33.880
 Then mission Marchi, we'll go. 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.190
 show s version see that version 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.580
 immediately above s is still not top 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.040
 line top sl 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.050
 a v s version also has two options 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.270
 engine 1.0 and 1.6 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.910
 In this case we are showing version 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.160
 with engine 1.0 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.270
 it has as differential wheels of 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.270
 15 inch aluminum 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:04.840
 the knobs already come on at home in the color of 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:06.790
 car on the smallest part on the outside 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.970
 in front yet we have the part 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.830
 lower fender chrome equal to 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.110
 version no longer has any difference in 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.040
 relation to sr that the top of line and account 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:21.730
 with fog lights then this version 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:25.390
 sv of nilmar is already have account with a 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:27.520
 identical to the version sl 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:32.170
 except the right wheel because the wheels 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:37.120
 in the sl version are 16-inch wheels 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:39.460
 a diamond design but in the interior 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.340
 we have a breakthrough in relation to s 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.750
 still due to the version sr 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.050
 so let's take a look inside 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.860
 from version s v 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:52.150
 good the inside of the sv version too 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:56.340
 gray coating we already see 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:05:00.340
 the doors with a gray coating 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:02.530
 system that does not have a system 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.980
 with sl but has a system 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.440
 sound keeps the air 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.900
 journey and sound system it comes with cd 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.050
 player has mp3 player connectivity 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.910
 for ipod has four speakers have 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.490
 connection with bluetooth also then you 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.840
 allows you to connect your smartphone to it 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.730
 huh 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:25.950
 and streaming audio you have the 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:28.470
 multifunction steering wheel with 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:31.320
 steering wheel audio system that 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:36.000
 basically the same steering wheel you have in 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:37.380
 enter and then the back also glasses 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.880
 also in the four hours already 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.790
 it was in another version 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.780
 so this is mission march and a male 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.780
 usgs
