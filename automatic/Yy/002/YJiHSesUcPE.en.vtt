that<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.579> don't<00:00:57.000> think<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.329> much<00:00:57.559> that's

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
that I don't think that much that's

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.290 
that I don't think that much that's
because<00:00:59.010> I'm<00:00:59.609> thinking<00:00:59.910> about<00:00:59.940> all<00:01:00.180> you

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.049 
because I'm thinking about all you
people<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:02.039> leads<00:01:02.340> me<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.820> first

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
people so this leads me to the first

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.289 
people so this leads me to the first
point<00:01:03.270> before<00:01:03.510> we<00:01:03.780> go<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.070> melatonin

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
point before we go to melatonin

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.060 
point before we go to melatonin
tryptophane<00:01:06.299> we<00:01:07.110> need<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.320> first<00:01:07.500> look<00:01:07.740> at<00:01:07.890> our

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
tryptophane we need to first look at our

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.390 
tryptophane we need to first look at our
at<00:01:08.670> our<00:01:08.790> lifestyle<00:01:09.270> guru<00:01:09.470> I<00:01:10.470> think<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.189> most

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
at our lifestyle guru I think that most

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.920 
at our lifestyle guru I think that most
of<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.640> time<00:01:11.850> sleep<00:01:12.119> issues<00:01:12.479> are<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.659> lot<00:01:12.900> of

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
of the time sleep issues are a lot of

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.719 
of the time sleep issues are a lot of
time<00:01:13.260> are<00:01:13.470> really<00:01:13.680> from<00:01:13.890> stress<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.310> anxiety

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
time are really from stress and anxiety

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.270 
time are really from stress and anxiety
and<00:01:15.240> just<00:01:15.479> we<00:01:15.630> just<00:01:15.900> set<00:01:16.110> ourselves<00:01:16.259> up<00:01:16.650> for<00:01:16.710> a

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
and just we just set ourselves up for a

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.020 
and just we just set ourselves up for a
very<00:01:18.030> stressful<00:01:18.470> existence<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:20.040> unless<00:01:20.850> we

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
very stressful existence and unless we

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.580 
very stressful existence and unless we
manage<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.869> don't<00:01:22.049> think<00:01:22.080> there's<00:01:22.320> any

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
manage that I don't think there's any

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.370 
manage that I don't think there's any

actually<00:03:07.620> that<00:03:07.830> makes<00:03:08.040> melatonin<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:09.060> then

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
actually that makes melatonin and then

most people that I talked to about

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.120 
most people that I talked to about
melatonin<00:03:26.850> have<00:03:27.300> tried<00:03:27.570> it<00:03:27.720> doesn't<00:03:28.290> work<00:03:28.500> so

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
melatonin have tried it doesn't work so

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.290 
melatonin have tried it doesn't work so
that<00:03:29.280> doesn't<00:03:29.400> mean<00:03:29.640> it's<00:03:29.790> not<00:03:29.910> going<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:30.180> work

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
that doesn't mean it's not going to work

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.480 
that doesn't mean it's not going to work

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
that have shown that it can be effective

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.640 
and you have like switch sleep patterns
then<00:04:03.090> you<00:04:03.780> know<00:04:03.900> you<00:04:04.020> take<00:04:04.170> it<00:04:04.320> differently

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
then you know you take it differently

during<00:04:07.830> the<00:04:08.070> day<00:04:08.280> I<00:04:08.520> was<00:04:09.330> aware<00:04:09.630> of<00:04:09.690> patients

that were told by clinical nutritionist
actually<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:13.200> take<00:04:13.350> melatonin<00:04:13.560> and<00:04:14.130> tiny

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520

doses in the morning in to increase

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.050 
doses in the morning in to increase
towards<00:04:16.709> my<00:04:16.859> time<00:04:17.100> which<00:04:17.280> makes<00:04:17.520> some<00:04:17.730> sense

towards my time which makes some sense

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.240 
towards my time which makes some sense
it's<00:04:18.870> just<00:04:19.109> that<00:04:19.169> that<00:04:19.380> increases<00:04:19.950> the<00:04:20.070> risk

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
it's just that that increases the risk

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.060 
it's just that that increases the risk
of<00:04:20.400> breast<00:04:20.700> cancer<00:04:20.820> so<00:04:21.600> we<00:04:22.049> do<00:04:22.289> not<00:04:22.500> want<00:04:22.740> to<00:04:22.919> do

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
more than that and you'd want to stick
