 Today is this February, 43 registration 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:20.310
 Introducing the Swift 1.2 Ox place of Suzuki 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:25.439
 The current mileage is a lottery 900 km Car inspection is attached until February 26

 It is up to 100,000 kg until February of 2016 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.360
 The warranty of the new car settles down 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.949
 Hmm 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.949
 Hmm 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.100

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:52.160
 It is our car It is our company meeting 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.370
 It is a watering hole 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:01:01.340
 You say you do that train and commercial vehicles 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.090
 Where the floor mat living beneath the back are used in for I have visor is shortage 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.950

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.299

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:37.360
 Even though I have become Swift come of it is is that sweet black interior 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:43.960
 Very well built up is well done 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:48.860
 After all it feels like a global strategic car, so you can sit comfortably even if that person gets on 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:52.280
 It seems narrow but quite spacious 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.270
 I say it is spacious and I can paint it rather than cramped 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.270
 I think it is a car 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.080

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.140

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.280

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:48.680
 Push a smooth shift 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.680
 There is no such thing as a shock of shift especially 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:05:03.639
 Yes, there's no extra equipment to add, that's really now 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.479
 It is a feeling that it is a new car as it is. 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:09.460
 But 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:12.080
