some<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.829> pictures<00:00:35.010> we<00:00:35.280> took<00:00:35.309> at<00:00:35.579> the

Wii Remote and so it's got its laid out

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.849 
Wii Remote and so it's got its laid out
like<00:00:57.390> you'd<00:00:57.690> expect<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:58.170> normal<00:00:58.440> controller<00:00:58.710> to

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
like you'd expect a normal controller to

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.200 
like you'd expect a normal controller to
be<00:00:58.949> but<00:00:59.129> then<00:00:59.219> you've<00:00:59.340> got<00:00:59.489> this<00:00:59.579> huge<00:00:59.760> tablet

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
be but then you've got this huge tablet

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.750 
be but then you've got this huge tablet
there<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:01.170> seems<00:01:01.500> like<00:01:01.920> just<00:01:02.370> based<00:01:02.550> on

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
there and it seems like just based on

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.520 
there and it seems like just based on
the<00:01:02.820> stuff<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.270> saw<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.690> played<00:01:03.989> that

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
the stuff that I saw and I played that

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.140 
the stuff that I saw and I played that
they're<00:01:04.680> trying<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.040> walk<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.460> line<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.970> I

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
they're trying to walk that line and I

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.969 
they're trying to walk that line and I
don't<00:01:06.299> know<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.540> that's<00:01:06.710> we'll<00:01:07.710> see<00:01:07.860> how

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
don't know that that's we'll see how

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.649 
don't know that that's we'll see how
that<00:01:08.040> pans<00:01:08.610> out<00:01:08.850> for<00:01:09.090> them<00:01:09.180> because<00:01:09.299> yes

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
that pans out for them because yes

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.600 
that pans out for them because yes
technically<00:01:10.439> it's<00:01:10.650> possible<00:01:11.130> for<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.460> do

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
technically it's possible for you to do

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.850 
technically it's possible for you to do
a<00:01:11.640> core<00:01:11.939> game<00:01:12.150> on<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.450> system<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.080> have

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
a core game on that system and have

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.920 
a core game on that system and have
somebody<00:01:14.100> play<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.790> with<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.390> controller<00:01:15.840> that

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
somebody play it with a controller that

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.690 
somebody play it with a controller that
feels<00:01:16.229> roughly<00:01:16.770> like<00:01:17.040> what<00:01:17.250> they're<00:01:17.400> used<00:01:17.580> to

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
feels roughly like what they're used to

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.940 
feels roughly like what they're used to
and<00:01:18.030> it's<00:01:18.570> also<00:01:18.810> entirely<00:01:19.200> possible<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.830> do<00:01:19.920> a

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
and it's also entirely possible to do a

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.679 
and it's also entirely possible to do a
super<00:01:20.369> casual<00:01:20.700> game<00:01:20.880> on<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.180> thing<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.540> just

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
super casual game on that thing it just

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.330 
super casual game on that thing it just
requires<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.350> like<00:01:22.560> wave<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.979> tablet

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
requires you to like wave the tablet

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.370 
requires you to like wave the tablet
around<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:24.240> that's<00:01:24.420> all<00:01:24.570> well<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:24.840> good<00:01:25.049> but<00:01:25.200> I

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
around so that's all well and good but I

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.770 
around so that's all well and good but I
think<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.009> question<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.780> saying

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
think that the question is saying

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.749 
think that the question is saying
something<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.320> then<00:01:28.409> actually<00:01:28.829> executing<00:01:29.670> on

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
something and then actually executing on

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.429 
something and then actually executing on
it<00:01:29.880> are<00:01:29.970> two<00:01:30.090> very<00:01:30.119> different<00:01:30.420> things<00:01:30.720> now<00:01:31.229> Tom

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
it are two very different things now Tom

perspective the challenge with this is
that<00:03:10.200> what<00:03:10.560> you're<00:03:10.680> going<00:03:10.829> to<00:03:10.890> see<00:03:11.099> is<00:03:11.400> strong

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
that what you're going to see is strong

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
that Nintendo's making because in a lot

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.409 
that Nintendo's making because in a lot
of<00:03:43.889> ways<00:03:44.069> that's<00:03:44.310> going<00:03:44.549> to<00:03:44.609> set<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.940> tone<00:03:45.180> you

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
of ways that's going to set the tone you

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:48.440 
of ways that's going to set the tone you
know<00:03:46.200> because<00:03:46.919> i<00:03:47.069> think<00:03:47.340> we<00:03:47.880> sports<00:03:48.180> did<00:03:48.389> a

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
know because i think we sports did a

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.940 
know because i think we sports did a
phenomenal<00:03:48.630> job<00:03:48.989> of<00:03:49.200> setting<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.650> tone<00:03:49.889> for

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
phenomenal job of setting the tone for

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.550 
phenomenal job of setting the tone for
this<00:03:50.280> is<00:03:50.489> this<00:03:51.120> is<00:03:51.299> why<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.540> system<00:03:52.079> special

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
this is this is why the system special

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.879 
this is this is why the system special
and<00:03:53.090> so<00:03:54.090> nintendo<00:03:54.930> hasnt<00:03:55.079> set<00:03:55.319> the<00:03:55.410> tone<00:03:55.620> yet

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
and so nintendo hasnt set the tone yet

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:59.030 
and so nintendo hasnt set the tone yet
and<00:03:57.019> that's<00:03:58.019> good<00:03:58.290> definitely<00:03:58.829> going<00:03:58.980> to

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
and that's good definitely going to

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.309 
and that's good definitely going to
impact<00:03:59.430> what<00:04:00.090> third<00:04:00.329> parties<00:04:00.690> decide<00:04:01.019> to<00:04:01.169> do

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
know look at the Gamecube that had a lot

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:08.930 
know look at the Gamecube that had a lot
of<00:04:07.349> strong<00:04:07.620> third-party<00:04:08.190> support<00:04:08.549> probably

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
of strong third-party support probably

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.900 
of strong third-party support probably
some<00:04:09.060> of<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.209> strongest<00:04:09.870> I<00:04:10.079> think<00:04:10.260> Tom<00:04:10.440> right

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
some of the strongest I think Tom right

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.580 
some of the strongest I think Tom right
yeah<00:04:11.910> initially<00:04:12.569> initially<00:04:12.840> right<00:04:13.230> at<00:04:13.349> launch

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
yeah initially initially right at launch

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.229 
yeah initially initially right at launch
it<00:04:13.769> was<00:04:13.859> like<00:04:13.980> oh<00:04:14.099> my<00:04:14.340> god<00:04:14.519> like<00:04:14.549> this<00:04:15.030> first

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
it was like oh my god like this first

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.990 
it was like oh my god like this first
couple<00:04:15.569> months<00:04:15.599> you're<00:04:16.049> like<00:04:16.260> holy<00:04:16.560> crap<00:04:17.000> but

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
couple months you're like holy crap but

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.229 
couple months you're like holy crap but
then<00:04:18.209> obviously<00:04:18.570> things<00:04:19.079> changed<00:04:19.500> so<00:04:20.250> it's

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
then obviously things changed so it's

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.580 
then obviously things changed so it's
really<00:04:21.510> hard<00:04:21.780> to<00:04:21.900> say<00:04:22.049> because<00:04:22.200> they<00:04:22.530> were

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
really hard to say because they were

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.360 
really hard to say because they were
unreal<00:04:22.950> hot<00:04:23.190> and<00:04:23.370> cold<00:04:23.580> and<00:04:23.729> we've<00:04:23.880> not

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
unreal hot and cold and we've not

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.500 
unreal hot and cold and we've not
a<00:04:25.020> system<00:04:26.020> really<00:04:26.290> from<00:04:26.620> them<00:04:26.800> that<00:04:27.340> had<00:04:27.669> kind

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
a system really from them that had kind

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.330 
a system really from them that had kind
of<00:04:28.570> extensive<00:04:29.169> third-party<00:04:29.620> support<00:04:30.010> that's

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
of extensive third-party support that's

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.830 
of extensive third-party support that's
kind<00:04:30.669> of<00:04:30.699> commensurate<00:04:31.150> to<00:04:31.180> what<00:04:31.419> it<00:04:31.540> had<00:04:31.720> at

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
kind of commensurate to what it had at

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.780 
kind of commensurate to what it had at
the<00:04:31.900> beginning<00:04:32.100> Tom<00:04:33.100> what<00:04:33.310> does<00:04:33.490> what<00:04:33.760> does

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
the beginning Tom what does what does

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.370 
the beginning Tom what does what does
Nintendo<00:04:34.300> need<00:04:34.449> to<00:04:34.570> do<00:04:34.690> at<00:04:34.840> this<00:04:34.960> point<00:04:35.050> to

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
Nintendo need to do at this point to

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.170 
Nintendo need to do at this point to

sort of convince the hard core audience

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.200 
sort of convince the hard core audience
that<00:04:37.600> it's<00:04:37.840> serious<00:04:38.020> about<00:04:38.970> catering<00:04:39.970> towards

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
that it's serious about catering towards

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
systems within the pc if they offer that

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.529 
systems within the pc if they offer that
they'll<00:05:27.460> have<00:05:27.610> their<00:05:27.789> third<00:05:27.940> party<00:05:28.240> support

they'll have their third party support

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:29.969 
they'll have their third party support
but<00:05:28.720> it's<00:05:28.840> also<00:05:28.960> matter<00:05:29.260> if<00:05:29.500> they<00:05:29.740> have<00:05:29.860> to

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
but it's also matter if they have to

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.339 
but it's also matter if they have to
sell<00:05:30.190> a<00:05:30.220> lot<00:05:30.550> to<00:05:31.240> get<00:05:31.389> those<00:05:31.539> exclusives<00:05:32.110> that

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
sell a lot to get those exclusives that

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:34.320 
sell a lot to get those exclusives that
made<00:05:32.500> the<00:05:32.620> ps2<00:05:33.010> something<00:05:33.340> special<00:05:33.729> and<00:05:34.210> the

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
made the ps2 something special and the

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.870 
made the ps2 something special and the
game<00:05:34.479> you<00:05:34.660> never<00:05:34.780> had<00:05:35.020> well<00:05:35.740> one<00:05:36.400> thing<00:05:36.669> about

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
game you never had well one thing about

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.850 
game you never had well one thing about
third<00:05:37.150> parties<00:05:37.180> and<00:05:37.930> I<00:05:38.410> think<00:05:38.590> it's<00:05:38.710> the

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
third parties and I think it's the

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.370 
third parties and I think it's the
biggest<00:05:39.130> challenge<00:05:39.520> they've<00:05:39.700> got<00:05:39.940> is<00:05:40.210> you<00:05:41.139> use

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
biggest challenge they've got is you use

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.770 
biggest challenge they've got is you use
the<00:05:41.530> p-word<00:05:41.740> you<00:05:42.130> said<00:05:42.340> port<00:05:42.700> oh<00:05:42.940> yeah<00:05:43.510> and<00:05:43.660> i

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
the p-word you said port oh yeah and i

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.650 
the p-word you said port oh yeah and i
think<00:05:43.810> that's<00:05:44.200> that's<00:05:44.650> the<00:05:44.919> problem<00:05:45.190> i<00:05:45.660> think

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
think that's that's the problem i think

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.190 
think that's that's the problem i think
that<00:05:48.030> philosophically<00:05:49.030> they've<00:05:49.599> got<00:05:49.870> to<00:05:49.990> find

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
that philosophically they've got to find

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.930 
that philosophically they've got to find
a<00:05:50.320> way<00:05:50.349> to<00:05:50.530> make<00:05:51.039> it<00:05:51.070> worth<00:05:51.340> third<00:05:51.580> parties

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
a way to make it worth third parties

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.180 
a way to make it worth third parties
support<00:05:52.450> to<00:05:52.930> stop<00:05:53.199> for<00:05:53.410> a<00:05:53.440> second<00:05:53.830> take<00:05:54.160> a

is is it just going to be like an
additional<00:06:51.910> level<00:06:52.030> because<00:06:52.510> when<00:06:52.840> you're

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 
additional level because when you're

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.320 
additional level because when you're
talking<00:06:53.320> 360<00:06:53.860> and<00:06:54.010> ps3<00:06:54.190> it's<00:06:54.880> just<00:06:55.090> here's<00:06:55.270> a

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:56.950 
character here's a level but it's still

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.480
