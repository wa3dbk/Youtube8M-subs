00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.679
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.179
 tan 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.169
 Let's raise the pace in Ninohe City, so let's start with slide live. 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.340
 Do you hear or Tsukiagari of the hard stuff I 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:47.420
 Get up 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:47.420
 I'm going to peek at this 6000 before 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.950
 So it's not over and it's over 7000 revolutions 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.690
 A sense of bar lasts 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:03.710
 In roughly Once it was actually got to the way shift up riding the No. 1 par to 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:11.250
 We think that it is good to collect and tap at around 7000 rotations 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:15.480
 The Naa Michael a little long as, for example, it's the two-legged tension after, for example, in front of the corner 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:19.450
 I much after all the +1000 rotation to something when you say 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:24.430
 It is easy to run that there is a margin in high speed range 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:26.590
 If I think that I put 3 feet in front of such, I will immediately breathe again and I feel like usual 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.760
 Aren't you just busy? 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.330
 I do not have it 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.330
 In the sense 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:40.510
 It 's useful when flying Winding Road 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:45.720
 Characteristic that 's not the end is a party matter is I think a good 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.720
 Let me now go into s # mode 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:58.360
 It will have really become a turbo seems to human characteristics 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:02:00.380
 Recently there have been a lot of imports there, there's a lot of legal lawyer Turbo Ettinger after all 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:05.510
 It's a little different 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:13.000
 Why indeed like a'll have to demonstrate the turbo power characteristics 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:18.160
 It reminds us that the coming of this stimulus quite a bit longer hot era 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.430
 Then it is this car, but healer is very easy to do 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.690
 Why is that? 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:27.670
 In such a situation 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.080
 I usually put it, but I stepped on that brake firmly 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.390
 What 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:37.400
 In addition, it is a grape when it is going to go down with a hitch fu while holding a big house together 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:42.200
 Are there in a firm state and Oo 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:47.420
 I have to have the pitch of the brakes, but that's exactly this car 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.890
 Has become so this is it still the place that seems to like this Fu Naa's quite authentic 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:54.800
 It is 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:59.200
 Then, when it goes by so-called steering characteristic, it is that weak understeer feeling 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:03.240
 It is set to be able to astonishly that very 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.190
 So the rear tracking is quite high 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:10.050
 that 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.760
 I handle cut'd Pronto is I begin by the say of course at the same time as it re 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:17.400
 I am not standing with Am 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.810
 There is a feeling of saying that this neighborhood is still big 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.080
 ff 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.680
 Not the 4 parts of the base 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.730
 sa counter vertical orientation 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.150
 a 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:33.540
 ff It means that it is 4 districts based on 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.540
 That weight distribution goodness or center of gravity 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:42.510
 I think Fu that wonder if the effect of place to say so I was rotten not you have come up 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:50.880
 From 4 feet at the third gear to 4 Hayaon if Ne you when entering the corner 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:55.530
 3 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:58.530
 This your grandfather bullets Atamagaa at the time of going to was a shift entered 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:03.630
 It's not just me now, but my mother's 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:08.430
 After all, in the vertical placement of the engine and and say, Masaru Higuchi I do is good by cats Rette what Deka' 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:10.380
 Causes the linkage between echo shift and transmission to be quite long 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.610
 I think that there is also an effect of no place 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.610
 I love cherry blossoms 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.270
 Now it would have been How about a 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.710
 I was able to run the Winding Road comfortably this time 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.900
 so 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:30.689
 It was kept late comparatively fast pace and say why, but this 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:37.229
 For example, for steering operation 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:44.729
 The whole reaction comes out as a result with the feeling that it will be this way. 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:48.539
 So I was surprised that the road surface antifreeze was hot once on the way. 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:50.680
 Beyond even surprised I But even where husband 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:56.259
 School without complaining 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.740
 I can run while having confidence in the car while having something like confidence 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:00.160
 Ne 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:04.330
 I think this is a very important point 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:07.180
 When I'm running on the Winding Road for some reason, I'm always nervous when I do 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:10.960
 I wonder what the channel will be 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:16.849
 If it is a car of setting, after all I can not drive it, but like this 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:22.550
 Even if the engine characteristic that the future prediction always follows 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:28.789
 Even if you are able to put together your stability, you still feel your feelings 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:29.689
 The joy of being able to run together with the car while pouring it into this car while pouring all here 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:34.309
 I think there is 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:36.840
 Precisely because it was probably has become the car of the kind set 

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:41.400
 Nurburgring 24 Hours Just Hey! 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:47.389
 Even if you look at the overall class championship in a comprehensive way, you have bitten into higher ranks 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:47.389
 a kind of results were thought to Fu that kana not the enemy Stars
