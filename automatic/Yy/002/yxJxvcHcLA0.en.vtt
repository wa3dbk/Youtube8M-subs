00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
the intro okay first the best then you

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.270

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
cut in this way you can about muted code

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:38.719 
cut in this way you can about muted code
or<00:01:20.950> if<00:01:21.490> you<00:01:21.670> want<00:01:21.880> you<00:01:22.000> can<00:01:22.270> do<00:01:22.479> what<00:01:22.810> you<00:01:22.960> want

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.580 

fourth<00:01:39.729> on<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.060> e<00:01:40.270> on<00:01:40.930> the<00:01:41.110> a<00:01:41.140> sorry<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.840> this

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
fourth on the e on the a sorry and this

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:51.719 
fourth on the e on the a sorry and this
is<00:01:44.740> a<00:01:45.510> C<00:01:46.510> flat<00:01:46.869> chord<00:01:47.320> or<00:01:50.580> sorry

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
is a C flat chord or sorry

00:01:51.729 --> 00:02:01.100 
is a C flat chord or sorry
it's<00:01:52.450> a<00:01:52.600> C<00:01:53.140> sharp<00:01:53.170> or<00:01:53.830> D<00:01:54.280> flat

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.500 

and<00:02:02.110> this<00:02:02.409> is<00:02:02.560> a<00:02:02.590> g-sharp<00:02:03.580> manner<00:02:04.150> I<00:02:04.450> think

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
and this is a g-sharp manner I think

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.940 
and this is a g-sharp manner I think
basically<00:02:07.510> it's<00:02:07.900> like<00:02:08.880> you're<00:02:09.880> f-sharp<00:02:10.179> minor

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
basically it's like you're f-sharp minor

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:35.780 
basically it's like you're f-sharp minor
but<00:02:12.390> step<00:02:13.390> higher<00:02:15.570> but<00:02:16.570> you<00:02:16.840> leave<00:02:17.200> your

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:03:08.520 

second<00:02:40.350> camera<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:07.120> you<00:03:07.780> can<00:03:07.989> do<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.350> same

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
second camera and you can do the same

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:20.430 
second camera and you can do the same
concept<00:03:16.590> then<00:03:17.590> you<00:03:17.920> go<00:03:18.130> to<00:03:18.190> this<00:03:19.140> which<00:03:20.140> is<00:03:20.170> the

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
concept then you go to this which is the

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:28.220 
concept then you go to this which is the
P<00:03:20.650> E<00:03:21.959> major

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:04:07.369 

and<00:03:28.379> then<00:03:59.989> again<00:04:05.450> and<00:04:06.450> here<00:04:06.959> you<00:04:07.140> can

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
and then again and here you can

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:16.509 
and then again and here you can
experiment<00:04:08.280> a<00:04:08.549> little<00:04:08.670> bit<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:09.180> can<00:04:09.329> do<00:04:15.500> that

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
experiment a little bit you can do that

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:26.220 
experiment a little bit you can do that
you<00:04:17.519> go<00:04:17.729> back<00:04:17.940> to<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.209> image

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.440 

so<00:04:28.350> when<00:04:29.350> you<00:04:29.500> go<00:04:29.710> here<00:04:30.190> when<00:04:30.550> you<00:04:30.670> arrive<00:04:31.120> here

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
so when you go here when you arrive here

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:41.730 
so when you go here when you arrive here
you<00:04:31.510> go<00:04:32.050> back<00:04:32.230> to<00:04:32.380> the<00:04:32.470> image<00:04:32.770> of<00:04:36.480> I<00:04:40.470> don't<00:04:41.470> know

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
you go back to the image of I don't know

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.380 
you go back to the image of I don't know
what<00:04:42.010> colors<00:04:42.580> do<00:04:42.760> but<00:04:43.480> it's<00:04:43.810> like<00:04:44.970> b-but<00:04:45.970> you

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
what colors do but it's like b-but you

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
slide it just like three you go to the

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:10.740 
slide it just like three you go to the
fifth<00:04:58.630> fret<00:04:59.970> of<00:05:00.970> the<00:05:08.580> so<00:05:09.580> basically<00:05:09.880> it<00:05:10.180> you

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:39.250 
Road then you slide it whole step and

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:43.800 
Road then you slide it whole step and
you<00:06:39.730> play<00:06:40.420> like<00:06:41.050> these<00:06:41.260> you<00:06:41.710> just<00:06:42.240> you<00:06:43.240> learn
