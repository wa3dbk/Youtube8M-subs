look<00:00:41.780> at<00:00:41.900> the<00:00:42.019> back<00:00:42.230> those<00:00:42.530> are<00:00:42.680> some<00:00:42.830> of<00:00:42.890> the

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
look at the back those are some of the

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.619 
look at the back those are some of the
other<00:00:43.100> figures<00:00:43.460> in<00:00:43.489> the<00:00:43.940> wave<00:00:44.180> are<00:00:44.390> actually

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
other figures in the wave are actually

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:45.850 
other figures in the wave are actually
probably<00:00:44.870> all<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.170> other<00:00:45.320> figures<00:00:45.620> in<00:00:45.650> the

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
probably all the other figures in the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.170 
probably all the other figures in the
wave<00:00:46.010> they're<00:00:46.460> actually<00:00:46.699> pretty<00:00:46.879> cool

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
wave they're actually pretty cool

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.520 
wave they're actually pretty cool
they're<00:00:47.420> like<00:00:47.570> a<00:00:47.600> mix<00:00:47.989> of<00:00:48.339> Mega<00:00:49.339> Bloks<00:00:49.580> and

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
they're like a mix of Mega Bloks and

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.170 
they're like a mix of Mega Bloks and
Kubrick's<00:00:51.530> is<00:00:51.769> out<00:00:51.890> there<00:00:52.070> called<00:00:52.309> I<00:00:52.580> don't

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
Kubrick's is out there called I don't

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.430 
Kubrick's is out there called I don't
know<00:00:53.239> I<00:00:53.269> don't<00:00:53.479> collect<00:00:53.600> any<00:00:53.839> of<00:00:53.960> those<00:00:54.110> things

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
know I don't collect any of those things

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.320 
know I don't collect any of those things
and<00:00:54.739> then<00:00:54.830> omegas<00:00:55.280> are<00:00:55.430> smaller<00:00:55.790> but<00:00:56.089> it's<00:00:56.239> the

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
and then omegas are smaller but it's the

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.899 
and then omegas are smaller but it's the
same<00:00:56.540> kind<00:00:56.930> of<00:00:57.110> styling<00:00:57.680> so<00:00:58.549> they're<00:00:58.699> kind<00:00:58.879> of

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909 
same kind of styling so they're kind of

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:01.810 
same kind of styling so they're kind of
cool<00:00:59.059> Cortana<00:00:59.570> is<00:01:00.040> completely<00:01:01.040> translucent

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
cool Cortana is completely translucent

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.759 
cool Cortana is completely translucent
blue<00:01:02.030> it's<00:01:02.210> a<00:01:02.269> really<00:01:02.510> nice<00:01:02.780> translucent<00:01:03.290> blue

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
blue it's a really nice translucent blue

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.219 
blue it's a really nice translucent blue
and<00:01:04.070> they're<00:01:05.059> built<00:01:05.269> on<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:05.570> blocky<00:01:05.780> figure

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
and they're built on the blocky figure

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:07.149 
and they're built on the blocky figure
so<00:01:06.350> I'm<00:01:06.440> not<00:01:06.530> really<00:01:06.770> going<00:01:06.860> to<00:01:06.950> talk<00:01:07.070> about

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
so I'm not really going to talk about

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.550 
so I'm not really going to talk about
sculpt<00:01:07.549> too<00:01:07.729> much<00:01:07.909> but<00:01:08.750> they<00:01:08.869> did<00:01:09.020> sculpt<00:01:09.380> hair

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
sculpt too much but they did sculpt hair

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.580 
sculpt too much but they did sculpt hair
for<00:01:09.860> her<00:01:10.130> or<00:01:10.369> at<00:01:10.520> least<00:01:10.670> made<00:01:11.570> hair<00:01:12.260> that<00:01:12.470> they

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
for her or at least made hair that they

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.100 
for her or at least made hair that they
already<00:01:12.680> had<00:01:12.979> look<00:01:13.189> like<00:01:13.369> hers<00:01:13.750> so<00:01:14.750> that<00:01:14.900> looks

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
already had look like hers so that looks

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.830 
already had look like hers so that looks
cool<00:01:15.350> it's<00:01:15.680> nice<00:01:15.970> they<00:01:16.970> are<00:01:17.090> completely<00:01:17.540> like

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
cool it's nice they are completely like

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.990 
cool it's nice they are completely like
modular<00:01:18.440> that's<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.190> whole<00:01:19.370> thing<00:01:19.580> about<00:01:19.700> the

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
modular that's the whole thing about the

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.820 
modular that's the whole thing about the
mini<00:01:20.180> mates<00:01:20.450> so<00:01:20.960> that<00:01:21.080> does<00:01:21.230> just<00:01:21.470> come<00:01:21.650> off

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
mini mates so that does just come off

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.260 
mini mates so that does just come off
but<00:01:22.010> you<00:01:22.100> can<00:01:22.160> put<00:01:22.370> it<00:01:22.460> back<00:01:22.490> on<00:01:22.820> so<00:01:23.090> that's

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
but you can put it back on so that's

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.420 
but you can put it back on so that's
fine<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:23.990> paint<00:01:24.260> work<00:01:24.470> is<00:01:24.710> actually<00:01:25.010> really

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
fine the paint work is actually really

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.130 
fine the paint work is actually really
good<00:01:25.730> all<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:26.330> little<00:01:26.570> lines<00:01:26.780> the

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
good all the little lines the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.780 
good all the little lines the
latticework<00:01:27.680> or<00:01:28.070> whatever<00:01:28.400> you<00:01:28.460> want<00:01:28.580> to<00:01:28.640> call

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
latticework or whatever you want to call

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.060 
latticework or whatever you want to call
it<00:01:28.940> circuitry<00:01:29.540> in<00:01:29.690> her<00:01:29.870> body<00:01:30.080> is<00:01:30.320> good<00:01:30.590> the

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
it circuitry in her body is good the

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.070 
it circuitry in her body is good the
face<00:01:31.340> paints<00:01:31.730> really<00:01:32.090> clean<00:01:32.360> and<00:01:32.390> crisp<00:01:32.810> and

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
face paints really clean and crisp and

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.620 
face paints really clean and crisp and
she<00:01:33.650> does<00:01:33.800> have<00:01:34.010> the<00:01:34.300> hourglass<00:01:35.300> shape

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
she does have the hourglass shape

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.300 
she does have the hourglass shape
painted<00:01:36.170> on<00:01:36.290> to<00:01:36.500> her<00:01:36.560> even<00:01:36.770> though<00:01:36.920> she's<00:01:37.100> got

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
painted on to her even though she's got

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.360 
painted on to her even though she's got
the<00:01:37.520> blocky<00:01:38.030> figure<00:01:39.100> so<00:01:40.100> if<00:01:40.190> you're<00:01:40.280> not

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
the blocky figure so if you're not

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.620 
the blocky figure so if you're not
familiar<00:01:40.520> with<00:01:40.820> these<00:01:40.970> they<00:01:41.180> have<00:01:41.210> a<00:01:41.360> head

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
familiar with these they have a head

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.750 
familiar with these they have a head
swivel<00:01:42.050> it<00:01:42.500> actually<00:01:42.800> is<00:01:42.920> actually<00:01:43.280> more<00:01:43.460> I

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
swivel it actually is actually more I

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.730 
swivel it actually is actually more I
said<00:01:44.060> actually<00:01:44.360> twice<00:01:44.570> it's<00:01:45.140> actually<00:01:45.560> more

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
said actually twice it's actually more

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.290 
said actually twice it's actually more
of<00:01:45.770> like<00:01:45.920> a<00:01:45.950> ball<00:01:46.250> peg<00:01:46.580> it<00:01:46.760> just<00:01:46.940> doesn't<00:01:47.180> have

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
of like a ball peg it just doesn't have

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.570 
of like a ball peg it just doesn't have

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
a great range of motion but it does have

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.390 
a great range of motion but it does have

like the hair did

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.530 
like the hair did
that's<00:02:25.010> okay<00:02:25.370> because<00:02:25.520> it<00:02:25.790> works<00:02:26.000> fine<00:02:26.300> once

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
that's okay because it works fine once

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.660 
that's okay because it works fine once
it's<00:02:26.720> on<00:02:26.990> it<00:02:27.380> does<00:02:27.560> lemon<00:02:27.890> his<00:02:28.100> articulation

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
for his head a bit but it still looks

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.050 
for his head a bit but it still looks
kind<00:02:30.740> of<00:02:30.800> cool<00:02:30.920> it's<00:02:31.130> a<00:02:31.160> little<00:02:31.370> stylized<00:02:31.880> of

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
kind of cool it's a little stylized of

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.430 
kind of cool it's a little stylized of
course<00:02:32.330> but<00:02:32.630> it's<00:02:33.050> a<00:02:33.110> nice<00:02:33.290> little

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440

halo one masterchief the classic look or

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.050 
halo one masterchief the classic look or
maybe<00:02:39.650> it's<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:40.010> anniversary<00:02:40.430> look<00:02:40.940> but

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
maybe it's the anniversary look but

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.230 
maybe it's the anniversary look but
either<00:02:41.150> way<00:02:41.390> it's<00:02:41.990> the<00:02:42.230> mark-5<00:02:42.940> so<00:02:43.940> he's<00:02:44.090> got

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
either way it's the mark-5 so he's got

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.850 
either way it's the mark-5 so he's got
all<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.450> same<00:02:44.630> type<00:02:44.810> of<00:02:44.840> articulation<00:02:45.680> he's

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
all the same type of articulation he's

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.140 
all the same type of articulation he's
just<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.130> little<00:02:46.220> bit<00:02:46.460> limited<00:02:46.790> due<00:02:46.940> to<00:02:47.030> his

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
just a little bit limited due to his

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.300 
just a little bit limited due to his
sculpt<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:48.110> armor<00:02:48.530> for<00:02:48.710> his<00:02:48.800> torso<00:02:49.040> is

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
sculpt the armor for his torso is

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.740 
sculpt the armor for his torso is
actually<00:02:49.610> just<00:02:49.730> kind<00:02:49.970> of<00:02:50.030> like<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.210> vest<00:02:50.510> that

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
actually just kind of like a vest that

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.930 
actually just kind of like a vest that
slides<00:02:51.080> down<00:02:51.290> over<00:02:51.680> his<00:02:51.740> body<00:02:52.040> so<00:02:52.640> that<00:02:52.670> does

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
slides down over his body so that does

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.300 
slides down over his body so that does
limit<00:02:53.120> it<00:02:53.360> a<00:02:53.390> bit<00:02:53.660> more<00:02:53.900> but<00:02:54.680> it<00:02:54.830> still<00:02:54.980> okay

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
limit it a bit more but it still okay

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.670 
limit it a bit more but it still okay
the<00:02:55.850> hands<00:02:56.060> do<00:02:56.300> have<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.810> armor<00:02:57.170> sculpted<00:02:57.560> on

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
the hands do have the armor sculpted on

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.990 
the hands do have the armor sculpted on
to<00:02:57.890> him<00:02:57.980> and<00:02:58.070> they<00:02:58.130> actually<00:02:58.250> swivel<00:02:58.730> at<00:02:58.850> the

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
to him and they actually swivel at the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.320 
to him and they actually swivel at the
forearm<00:02:59.570> instead<00:03:00.200> of<00:03:00.440> at<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.310> wrist<00:03:01.730> so

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
forearm instead of at the wrist so

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.430 
forearm instead of at the wrist so
that's<00:03:02.600> a<00:03:02.660> little<00:03:02.780> bit<00:03:02.990> different<00:03:03.320> than

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
that's a little bit different than

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.670 
that's a little bit different than
Cortana<00:03:03.860> but<00:03:04.520> he<00:03:04.670> comes<00:03:04.940> with<00:03:05.180> his<00:03:05.680> assault

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
Cortana but he comes with his assault

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.940 
Cortana but he comes with his assault
rifle<00:03:07.070> which<00:03:07.160> I<00:03:07.280> believe<00:03:07.580> would<00:03:07.730> be<00:03:07.850> the<00:03:07.970> ma<00:03:08.920> 5b

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
rifle which I believe would be the ma 5b

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.190 
rifle which I believe would be the ma 5b
if<00:03:10.280> memory<00:03:10.640> serves<00:03:10.820> I<00:03:11.300> always<00:03:11.750> get<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:12.020> names

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
if memory serves I always get the names

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.530 
if memory serves I always get the names
of<00:03:12.350> the<00:03:12.500> rifles<00:03:13.040> mixed<00:03:13.370> up<00:03:13.520> but<00:03:14.000> he<00:03:14.090> can<00:03:14.300> hold

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
of the rifles mixed up but he can hold

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.560 
of the rifles mixed up but he can hold
it<00:03:15.430> holds<00:03:16.430> it<00:03:16.490> a<00:03:16.670> bit<00:03:16.850> of<00:03:16.940> an<00:03:17.030> angle<00:03:17.330> but<00:03:17.450> it's

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
it holds it a bit of an angle but it's

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.300 
it holds it a bit of an angle but it's
not<00:03:17.720> too<00:03:17.900> bad<00:03:18.140> so<00:03:18.560> that's<00:03:18.650> kind<00:03:18.950> of<00:03:19.010> cool<00:03:19.160> of

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
not too bad so that's kind of cool of

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.650 
not too bad so that's kind of cool of
course<00:03:19.520> he's<00:03:19.670> not<00:03:19.790> gonna<00:03:19.910> hold<00:03:20.090> it<00:03:20.240> across<00:03:20.480> his

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
course he's not gonna hold it across his

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.690 
course he's not gonna hold it across his
chest<00:03:20.900> or<00:03:21.080> anything<00:03:21.530> but<00:03:22.040> he<00:03:22.130> comes<00:03:22.340> with<00:03:22.490> that

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
the world but it's recognizable so he

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.050

the<00:03:42.530> big<00:03:42.709> Cortana<00:03:43.190> comes<00:03:43.430> with<00:03:43.670> a<00:03:43.730> big<00:03:43.910> chip<00:03:44.709> so

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
the big Cortana comes with a big chip so

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.020 
the big Cortana comes with a big chip so
that's<00:03:45.860> pretty<00:03:46.070> nice<00:03:46.310> this<00:03:46.489> is<00:03:46.730> the<00:03:47.209> I<00:03:47.570> think

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
that's pretty nice this is the I think

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.280 
that's pretty nice this is the I think
I'm<00:03:50.030> not<00:03:50.180> sure<00:03:50.360> if<00:03:50.420> this<00:03:50.570> chip<00:03:50.750> is<00:03:50.900> anything

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
I'm not sure if this chip is anything

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.020 
I'm not sure if this chip is anything
particular<00:03:51.890> it<00:03:52.040> looks<00:03:52.250> to<00:03:52.459> me<00:03:52.489> like<00:03:52.610> the<00:03:52.880> halo

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
particular it looks to me like the halo

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.930 
particular it looks to me like the halo
3<00:03:53.420> chip<00:03:53.690> but<00:03:54.560> it's<00:03:54.920> since<00:03:55.400> it's<00:03:55.580> not<00:03:55.670> supposed

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
3 chip but it's since it's not supposed

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.160 
3 chip but it's since it's not supposed
to<00:03:56.000> be<00:03:56.090> the<00:03:56.180> halo<00:03:56.390> 3<00:03:56.600> Cortana

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
to be the halo 3 Cortana

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.080 
to be the halo 3 Cortana
I<00:03:57.230> don't<00:03:57.410> I<00:03:57.500> doubt<00:03:57.860> it<00:03:58.070> this<00:03:58.430> part<00:03:58.760> can<00:03:58.880> come

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
I don't I doubt it this part can come

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.670 
I don't I doubt it this part can come
off<00:03:59.270> and<00:03:59.480> swivel<00:03:59.900> if<00:03:59.959> you<00:04:00.080> want<00:04:00.320> to

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
off and swivel if you want to

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.710 
off and swivel if you want to
so<00:04:01.100> that's<00:04:01.280> translucent<00:04:01.910> plastic<00:04:02.030> this<00:04:02.660> is

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
so that's translucent plastic this is

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.170

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
the same kind of plastic as Cortana and

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.630 
the same kind of plastic as Cortana and

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
you can peg her in there so that you can

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.850 
you can peg her in there so that you can
have<00:04:07.790> her<00:04:07.970> standing<00:04:08.330> on<00:04:08.450> their<00:04:08.600> chip<00:04:08.870> so<00:04:09.709> it's
