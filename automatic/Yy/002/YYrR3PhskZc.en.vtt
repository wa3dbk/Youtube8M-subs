00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
hips I really like that joint doesn't

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.070

look<00:03:32.910> like<00:03:33.060> it<00:03:33.180> does<00:03:33.270> much<00:03:33.510> but<00:03:33.720> it<00:03:33.810> actually

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
look like it does much but it actually

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.510 
look like it does much but it actually
works<00:03:34.260> pretty<00:03:34.350> well<00:03:34.590> like<00:03:34.950> he<00:03:35.070> can<00:03:35.220> actually

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
works pretty well like he can actually

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.970 
works pretty well like he can actually
cross<00:03:35.790> his<00:03:36.030> legs<00:03:36.230> with<00:03:37.230> that<00:03:37.410> joint<00:03:37.680> which<00:03:37.860> I

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
cross his legs with that joint which I

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.780 
cross his legs with that joint which I
thought<00:03:38.130> was<00:03:38.250> kind<00:03:38.430> of<00:03:38.520> surprising<00:03:40.730> but<00:03:41.730> uh

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
thought was kind of surprising but uh

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.910 
thought was kind of surprising but uh
got<00:03:42.750> a<00:03:42.780> nice<00:03:42.960> amount<00:03:43.170> of<00:03:43.320> movement<00:03:43.650> on<00:03:43.680> that

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
got a nice amount of movement on that

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.650 
got a nice amount of movement on that
and<00:03:44.760> nicely<00:03:45.060> a<00:03:45.330> jointed<00:03:46.260> legs<00:03:46.410> are<00:03:47.100> nice<00:03:47.310> and

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
and nicely a jointed legs are nice and

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.360 
and nicely a jointed legs are nice and
just<00:03:48.660> the<00:03:48.810> standard<00:03:49.080> back<00:03:49.380> and<00:03:49.560> forward<00:03:49.830> on

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
just the standard back and forward on

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.520 
just the standard back and forward on
the<00:03:50.520> foot<00:03:50.760> which<00:03:51.510> I<00:03:51.660> you<00:03:51.990> know<00:03:52.080> these<00:03:52.260> figures

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
the foot which I you know these figures

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.070 
the foot which I you know these figures
are<00:03:52.650> really<00:03:52.850> skinny<00:03:53.850> and<00:03:53.970> you<00:03:54.630> know<00:03:54.720> small

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
are really skinny and you know small

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.650 
are really skinny and you know small
footed<00:03:55.470> and<00:03:55.650> everything<00:03:55.980> so<00:03:56.940> it's<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.180> really

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
footed and everything so it's a really

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.700 
footed and everything so it's a really
good<00:03:57.840> that<00:03:57.960> they<00:03:58.050> come<00:03:58.260> with<00:03:58.380> the<00:03:58.560> stands

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710 
good that they come with the stands

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.520 
good that they come with the stands
which<00:04:01.710> they<00:04:01.890> actually<00:04:02.040> stand<00:04:02.610> up<00:04:02.760> pretty<00:04:02.970> well

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
which they actually stand up pretty well

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.810 
which they actually stand up pretty well
for<00:04:04.530> how<00:04:04.650> small<00:04:04.710> they<00:04:05.190> are<00:04:05.220> I<00:04:05.580> think<00:04:05.790> anyway

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
for how small they are I think anyway
