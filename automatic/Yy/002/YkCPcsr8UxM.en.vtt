enough for us to make an attempt at
getting<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.889> permit<00:00:14.309> so<00:00:14.700> not<00:00:14.849> only<00:00:15.000> is

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.230 
and I'm looking for a lifeboat to carry
over<00:02:03.409> the<00:02:03.560> mountain<00:02:04.010> but<00:02:04.189> I<00:02:04.460> also<00:02:04.820> want<00:02:05.119> it<00:02:05.180> to

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
over the mountain but I also want it to

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.580 
over the mountain but I also want it to
be<00:02:05.330> strong<00:02:05.630> enough<00:02:05.689> to<00:02:05.930> actually<00:02:06.170> run<00:02:06.470> the

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
be strong enough to actually run the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.560 
be strong enough to actually run the
river<00:02:06.740> so<00:02:07.130> it's<00:02:07.610> a<00:02:07.670> matter<00:02:07.850> of<00:02:07.909> finding<00:02:08.239> the

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
river so it's a matter of finding the

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.880 
river so it's a matter of finding the
right<00:02:08.929> balance<00:02:09.140> there

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
right balance there

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.190 
right balance there
so<00:02:10.759> we've<00:02:10.910> always<00:02:11.030> got<00:02:11.300> to<00:02:11.390> think<00:02:11.780> of

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
so we've always got to think of

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.730 
so we've always got to think of
durability<00:02:12.980> versus<00:02:13.730> performance<00:02:14.740> Geoff's

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
durability versus performance Geoff's

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.270

all over the mold they continue to spin
it<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:35.930> then<00:02:36.230> comes<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.709> moment<00:02:36.890> of<00:02:37.250> truth

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
it and then comes the moment of truth

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.850 
it and then comes the moment of truth
where<00:02:38.120> we<00:02:38.240> actually<00:02:38.540> open<00:02:38.900> up<00:02:38.990> the<00:02:39.140> mold<00:02:39.320> and

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
where we actually open up the mold and

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.670 
where we actually open up the mold and
see<00:02:40.100> if<00:02:40.190> you<00:02:40.310> did<00:02:40.520> everything<00:02:40.670> right<00:02:41.680> yes

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
see if you did everything right yes

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.870 
see if you did everything right yes
there's<00:02:43.070> a<00:02:43.130> hole<00:02:44.560> now<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.620> art<00:02:45.950> fitting<00:02:46.370> is<00:02:46.550> an

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
there's a hole now the art fitting is an

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.729 
there's a hole now the art fitting is an
important<00:02:47.390> part<00:02:47.690> of<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:48.020> strength<00:02:48.440> and

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
important part of the strength and

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.040 
important part of the strength and
safety<00:02:49.550> of<00:02:49.670> a<00:02:49.760> kite<00:02:50.000> it's<00:02:50.510> kind<00:02:50.810> of<00:02:50.870> your

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
safety of a kite it's kind of your

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.530 
safety of a kite it's kind of your
little<00:02:51.350> safety<00:02:51.950> capsule<00:02:52.790> if<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.120> like<00:02:53.330> and

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
little safety capsule if you like and

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.850 
little safety capsule if you like and
when<00:02:53.660> you<00:02:53.720> bounce<00:02:53.989> off<00:02:54.230> rocks<00:02:54.500> you<00:02:54.620> want<00:02:54.770> to

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
when you bounce off rocks you want to

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.620 
when you bounce off rocks you want to
make<00:02:54.980> sure<00:02:55.100> it<00:02:55.190> doesn't<00:02:55.340> Bend<00:02:55.760> it<00:02:56.270> doesn't

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
make sure it doesn't Bend it doesn't

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.990 
make sure it doesn't Bend it doesn't
fold<00:02:56.930> doesn't<00:02:57.560> flatten<00:02:57.860> anything<00:02:58.820> like<00:02:58.970> that

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
fold doesn't flatten anything like that

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.090 
fold doesn't flatten anything like that
so<00:02:59.720> once<00:02:59.930> again<00:03:00.080> I'm<00:03:00.380> going<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.590> take<00:03:00.800> a<00:03:00.830> few

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
so once again I'm going to take a few

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.000 
so once again I'm going to take a few
chances<00:03:01.300> the<00:03:02.300> benefit<00:03:02.900> of<00:03:03.020> having<00:03:03.410> a<00:03:03.650> lot<00:03:03.860> of

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
chances the benefit of having a lot of

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.430 
chances the benefit of having a lot of
kayak<00:03:04.400> to<00:03:04.610> carry<00:03:04.940> in<00:03:05.209> will<00:03:05.720> be<00:03:05.840> outweighed<00:03:06.410> by

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
kayak to carry in will be outweighed by

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.860 
kayak to carry in will be outweighed by
the<00:03:06.770> loss<00:03:07.160> of<00:03:07.340> durability<00:03:08.060> but<00:03:08.300> I<00:03:08.330> think<00:03:08.690> that

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
the loss of durability but I think that

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.270 
the loss of durability but I think that
for<00:03:09.110> this<00:03:09.230> trip<00:03:09.530> it's<00:03:09.709> going<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:09.950> get<00:03:10.070> me

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
for this trip it's going to get me

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.860 
for this trip it's going to get me
through<00:03:10.610> I'm<00:03:11.030> going<00:03:11.239> to<00:03:11.330> save<00:03:11.510> a<00:03:11.540> little<00:03:11.720> bit

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
through I'm going to save a little bit

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.900 
through I'm going to save a little bit
of<00:03:12.050> weight<00:03:12.230> and<00:03:12.500> I<00:03:13.010> think<00:03:13.430> it's<00:03:13.550> going<00:03:13.730> to<00:03:13.790> be

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
of weight and I think it's going to be

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.430 
of weight and I think it's going to be
safe<00:03:14.150> enough<00:03:14.390> for<00:03:14.570> me<00:03:14.720> to<00:03:14.810> actually<00:03:14.959> get<00:03:15.230> down

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
safe enough for me to actually get down

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.960 
safe enough for me to actually get down
the<00:03:15.590> river

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.050 

yep<00:03:19.070> 41<00:03:20.600> 88<00:03:22.040> feels<00:03:23.040> good<00:03:23.220> it's<00:03:23.400> amazing<00:03:23.520> what<00:03:24.030> a

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
yep 41 88 feels good it's amazing what a

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.630 
yep 41 88 feels good it's amazing what a
difference<00:03:24.120> seven<00:03:24.960> pounds<00:03:25.320> makes<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:26.400> last

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
difference seven pounds makes the last

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:38.120 
difference seven pounds makes the last
and<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:26.970> final<00:03:27.150> touch<00:03:28.790> yeah<00:03:36.710> we've<00:03:37.710> done<00:03:37.890> all

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
and the final touch yeah we've done all

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.130 
and the final touch yeah we've done all
the<00:03:38.280> training<00:03:38.460> and<00:03:38.910> preparation<00:03:39.360> that<00:03:39.840> we<00:03:39.990> can
