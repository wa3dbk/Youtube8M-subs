fixed I think is actually 25k by throw

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.000 
fixed I think is actually 25k by throw
on<00:01:05.670> some<00:01:06.360> chemistry<00:01:06.869> styles<00:01:07.320> as<00:01:07.409> well<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.890> make

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
on some chemistry styles as well to make

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.520 
on some chemistry styles as well to make
it<00:01:08.070> ran<00:01:08.310> 30<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:08.820> I'm<00:01:08.880> gonna<00:01:08.970> say<00:01:09.119> it's<00:01:09.299> 25<00:01:10.200> k

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
it ran 30 so I'm gonna say it's 25 k

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.530 
it ran 30 so I'm gonna say it's 25 k
without<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.430> chemistry<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.210> it's<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.360> team

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
without the chemistry so so it's a team

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.289 
without the chemistry so so it's a team
that<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.780> can<00:01:12.900> buy<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.880> 25,000<00:01:14.880> points<00:01:15.060> in

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
something to do here this might see the

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.020 
something to do here this might see the
M<00:04:46.960> right<00:04:47.200> and<00:04:47.620> it<00:04:47.980> works<00:04:48.250> so<00:04:48.430> well<00:04:48.580> that's<00:04:48.880> a

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
M right and it works so well that's a

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.700 
M right and it works so well that's a
great<00:04:49.270> little<00:04:49.660> filter<00:04:49.990> but<00:04:50.290> this<00:04:50.410> should<00:04:50.590> have

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
great little filter but this should have

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.500 
great little filter but this should have
gone<00:04:50.860> in<00:04:51.010> is<00:04:51.130> a<00:04:51.160> bit<00:04:51.340> lucky<00:04:51.610> but<00:04:52.150> what<00:04:52.300> I<00:04:52.360> did

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
gone in is a bit lucky but what I did

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.050 
gone in is a bit lucky but what I did
there<00:04:52.750> was<00:04:53.260> make<00:04:53.500> the<00:04:53.650> opponent<00:04:54.220> think<00:04:54.880> I'm

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
there was make the opponent think I'm

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.420 
there was make the opponent think I'm
doing<00:04:55.270> pointless<00:04:55.780> skills<00:04:56.230> and<00:04:56.470> then<00:04:56.770> use<00:04:57.250> an

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
doing pointless skills and then use an

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.090 
doing pointless skills and then use an
effective<00:04:57.910> skill<00:04:58.210> move<00:04:58.390> like<00:04:58.930> the<00:04:59.260> step<00:04:59.740> overs

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
effective skill move like the step overs

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.820 
effective skill move like the step overs
and<00:05:00.280> they<00:05:00.850> get<00:05:01.000> so<00:05:01.180> confused<00:05:01.390> at<00:05:01.870> it's<00:05:02.140> pretty

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
and they get so confused at it's pretty

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.070 
and they get so confused at it's pretty
much<00:05:03.100> guarantees<00:05:03.790> you're<00:05:04.540> gonna<00:05:04.660> get<00:05:04.870> past

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
much guarantees you're gonna get past

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.390 
much guarantees you're gonna get past
them<00:05:05.320> because<00:05:05.590> they<00:05:05.710> think<00:05:05.770> I'll<00:05:06.040> look<00:05:06.220> at<00:05:06.370> it

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
them because they think I'll look at it

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.130 
them because they think I'll look at it
as<00:05:06.550> being<00:05:06.580> all<00:05:06.850> fancy<00:05:07.300> and<00:05:07.450> they<00:05:07.870> try<00:05:08.110> and

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
as being all fancy and they try and

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.810 
as being all fancy and they try and
close<00:05:08.350> you<00:05:08.500> down<00:05:08.680> and<00:05:08.980> then<00:05:09.070> step<00:05:09.310> overs<00:05:09.670> and

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
close you down and then step overs and

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.210
