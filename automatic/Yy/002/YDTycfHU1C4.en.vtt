00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
very cool even though the kick still

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.310 
very cool even though the kick still
looks<00:04:20.400> like<00:04:20.549> it's<00:04:20.669> charging<00:04:21.030> it<00:04:21.359> still<00:04:21.750> has<00:04:22.169> to

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
looks like it's charging it still has to

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.830 
looks like it's charging it still has to
do<00:04:22.409> something<00:04:22.620> with<00:04:22.770> his<00:04:23.099> claws<00:04:23.729> and<00:04:24.479> I<00:04:24.599> like

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
do something with his claws and I like

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.610 
do something with his claws and I like
this<00:04:25.020> move<00:04:25.169> it's

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
this move it's

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.560 
this move it's
good<00:04:25.949> change<00:04:26.280> of<00:04:26.430> pace<00:04:26.460> and<00:04:26.940> I<00:04:27.210> didn't<00:04:27.449> really

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
good change of pace and I didn't really

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.210 
good change of pace and I didn't really
like<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:27.930> old<00:04:28.110> move<00:04:28.290> that<00:04:28.680> they<00:04:28.770> had<00:04:28.889> involved

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
like the old move that they had involved

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.879 
like the old move that they had involved
so<00:04:29.490> I'm<00:04:29.580> glad<00:04:29.699> to<00:04:29.790> change<00:04:30.060> since<00:04:30.210> Tamela<00:04:30.889> now

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
pretty much let's take a look at it

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.020 
pretty much let's take a look at it
special<00:05:05.669> move<00:05:05.789> shall<00:05:05.970> we<00:05:07.010> now<00:05:08.010> it's<00:05:08.699> neutral

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
special move shall we now it's neutral

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.120 
special move shall we now it's neutral
special<00:05:09.449> is<00:05:09.690> still<00:05:09.960> the<00:05:10.050> blaster<00:05:10.470> it's<00:05:10.770> a<00:05:10.889> bit

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
special is still the blaster it's a bit

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.350 
special is still the blaster it's a bit
slower<00:05:11.580> if<00:05:12.000> you<00:05:12.690> will<00:05:12.900> only<00:05:13.139> a<00:05:13.199> blast<00:05:13.500> for<00:05:13.770> me

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
slower if you will only a blast for me

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.420 
slower if you will only a blast for me
it's<00:05:15.360> a<00:05:15.389> bit<00:05:15.539> slower<00:05:15.900> and<00:05:16.229> you<00:05:16.860> know<00:05:16.949> does<00:05:17.190> half

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
it's a bit slower and you know does half

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.159 
it's a bit slower and you know does half
the<00:05:17.460> range<00:05:17.910> that<00:05:18.180> didn't<00:05:18.570> brawl<00:05:18.870> which<00:05:19.080> is

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
the range that didn't brawl which is

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.939 
the range that didn't brawl which is
weird<00:05:19.740> you<00:05:20.280> know<00:05:20.400> but<00:05:20.639> it's<00:05:20.970> still<00:05:21.180> good<00:05:21.949> now

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:22.949 
weird you know but it's still good now

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:25.100 
weird you know but it's still good now
the<00:05:23.010> wolf<00:05:23.580> flash<00:05:23.880> is<00:05:24.180> still<00:05:24.210> intact<00:05:24.720> you<00:05:25.020> know

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
the wolf flash is still intact you know

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.750 
the wolf flash is still intact you know
I'm<00:05:25.289> pretty<00:05:25.470> sure<00:05:25.560> it's<00:05:25.770> a<00:05:25.830> little<00:05:26.190> bit<00:05:26.280> faster

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
I'm pretty sure it's a little bit faster

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.360 
I'm pretty sure it's a little bit faster
but<00:05:27.030> I'm<00:05:27.539> not<00:05:27.810> 100%<00:05:28.169> sure<00:05:28.680> you<00:05:29.070> do<00:05:29.190> some

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
but I'm not 100% sure you do some

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.900 
but I'm not 100% sure you do some
research

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
research

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.469

now<00:05:30.419> his<00:05:30.860> reflector<00:05:31.860> is<00:05:32.099> as<00:05:32.789> you<00:05:32.940> can<00:05:33.000> see<00:05:33.240> much

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
now his reflector is as you can see much

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.690 
now his reflector is as you can see much
smaller<00:05:33.840> than<00:05:34.020> before<00:05:34.410> but<00:05:35.010> it<00:05:35.130> still<00:05:35.430> does

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
smaller than before but it still does

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.219 
smaller than before but it still does
all<00:05:35.880> the<00:05:36.030> great<00:05:36.150> capabilities<00:05:36.360> no<00:05:36.990> stronger

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
all the great capabilities no stronger

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:38.960 
all the great capabilities no stronger

can<00:06:14.970> see<00:06:15.120> here<00:06:15.360> which<00:06:15.930> is<00:06:16.080> weird<00:06:16.320> because<00:06:16.470> you

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 
can see here which is weird because you

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:19.909 
can see here which is weird because you
know<00:06:17.160> changing<00:06:17.820> a<00:06:17.910> throne<00:06:18.180> is<00:06:18.990> not<00:06:19.260> that<00:06:19.470> you

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
know changing a throne is not that you

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:21.800 
know changing a throne is not that you
know<00:06:20.010> unless<00:06:20.820> it<00:06:20.970> does<00:06:21.120> something<00:06:21.419> radically

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
know unless it does something radically

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:22.730 
know unless it does something radically
different<00:06:21.840> I<00:06:22.229> don't<00:06:22.289> see<00:06:22.530> why<00:06:22.620> they<00:06:22.710> should

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
different I don't see why they should

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.129 
different I don't see why they should
change<00:06:23.099> it<00:06:23.250> now<00:06:24.090> is<00:06:24.210> up<00:06:24.419> though<00:06:24.599> it's<00:06:25.020> still

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:25.139 
change it now is up though it's still

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:27.620 
change it now is up though it's still
Asajj<00:06:25.500> but<00:06:25.710> it's<00:06:25.800> a<00:06:25.860> bit<00:06:26.099> faster<00:06:26.669> animation

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:27.630 
Asajj but it's a bit faster animation

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.350 
Asajj but it's a bit faster animation
now<00:06:28.199> wolf<00:06:28.650> s-wave<00:06:29.010> -<00:06:29.220> sure<00:06:29.340> he's<00:06:29.880> pretty<00:06:30.150> good

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
now wolf s-wave - sure he's pretty good

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.850 
now wolf s-wave - sure he's pretty good
it's<00:06:30.539> pretty<00:06:30.720> fast<00:06:31.020> but<00:06:31.199> it's<00:06:31.349> kind<00:06:31.500> of<00:06:31.560> clunky

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
it's pretty fast but it's kind of clunky

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.290 
it's pretty fast but it's kind of clunky
so<00:06:32.190> it's<00:06:32.340> hard<00:06:32.550> to<00:06:32.639> pull<00:06:32.849> off

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
so it's hard to pull off

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.070 
so it's hard to pull off
you<00:06:33.750> know<00:06:33.900> so<00:06:34.910> outs<00:06:35.910> the<00:06:36.120> wave<00:06:36.300> -<00:06:36.510> for<00:06:36.690> wolf<00:06:36.930> but

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 
you know so outs the wave - for wolf but

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.260 
you know so outs the wave - for wolf but
it's<00:06:37.200> not<00:06:37.320> as<00:06:37.440> good<00:06:37.590> as<00:06:37.650> foxes<00:06:38.190> or<00:06:38.340> Falcons<00:06:38.730> and

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
it's not as good as foxes or Falcons and

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.350 
it's not as good as foxes or Falcons and
that's<00:06:39.450> for<00:06:39.630> sure

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 
that's for sure

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.580 
that's for sure
so<00:06:42.360> now<00:06:42.630> let's<00:06:42.900> take<00:06:43.050> a<00:06:43.080> look<00:06:43.230> at<00:06:43.350> this<00:06:43.410> time
