00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
here raises and lowers the monitor and

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.420 
here raises and lowers the monitor and
this<00:02:43.829> right<00:02:44.069> here<00:02:44.280> is<00:02:44.340> what<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.329> monitor<00:02:45.959> is

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
this right here is what the monitor is

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
hold on to or this is what the monitor

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.710 
hold on to or this is what the monitor
goes<00:02:50.250> on<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:50.639> I<00:02:50.670> should<00:02:50.760> say<00:02:51.120> so<00:02:51.420> I'm<00:02:51.510> showing

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
goes on to I should say so I'm showing

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.599 
goes on to I should say so I'm showing
you<00:02:51.870> guys<00:02:51.989> before<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.620> actually<00:02:52.889> get<00:02:53.250> into<00:02:53.400> the

you guys before I actually get into the

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.390 
you guys before I actually get into the
features<00:02:53.970> real<00:02:54.870> quick<00:02:55.139> so<00:02:55.739> let<00:02:56.129> me<00:02:56.250> go<00:02:56.370> ahead

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
features real quick so let me go ahead

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.330 
features real quick so let me go ahead
and<00:02:56.730> put<00:02:56.909> this<00:02:57.030> back<00:02:57.859> hopefully<00:02:58.859> doesn't<00:02:59.069> take

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
and put this back hopefully doesn't take

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:06.379 
and put this back hopefully doesn't take
too<00:02:59.519> long<00:03:00.349> all<00:03:01.349> right<00:03:04.459> as<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:05.609> said<00:03:05.819> before<00:03:06.000> you

I'll<00:03:17.430> show<00:03:17.760> you<00:03:17.819> a<00:03:17.970> little<00:03:18.480> bit<00:03:18.599> not<00:03:19.319> doing<00:03:19.560> it

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
I'll show you a little bit not doing it

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.920 
I'll show you a little bit not doing it
all<00:03:19.859> the<00:03:19.980> way<00:03:20.129> but<00:03:20.190> just<00:03:20.699> doing<00:03:21.419> you<00:03:21.569> guys<00:03:21.750> you

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
all the way but just doing you guys you

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.830 
all the way but just doing you guys you
can<00:03:22.139> do<00:03:22.319> it<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.910> little<00:03:24.120> knob<00:03:24.359> that<00:03:24.540> I<00:03:24.599> showed

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
can do it the little knob that I showed

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.680 
can do it the little knob that I showed
you<00:03:24.900> makes<00:03:25.379> the<00:03:25.560> monitor<00:03:26.069> go<00:03:26.489> up<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:26.910> down<00:03:27.060> so

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
you makes the monitor go up and down so

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.449 
you makes the monitor go up and down so
uh<00:03:27.720> me<00:03:27.989> I<00:03:28.760> think<00:03:29.760> it's<00:03:29.970> going<00:03:30.269> up<00:03:30.419> right<00:03:30.599> now

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
uh me I think it's going up right now

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.839 
uh me I think it's going up right now
and<00:03:32.459> then<00:03:33.299> if<00:03:33.480> I<00:03:33.599> do<00:03:33.659> this<00:03:33.930> it<00:03:34.139> goes<00:03:34.290> down<00:03:34.849> which

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
and then if I do this it goes down which

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.839 
and then if I do this it goes down which
is<00:03:36.000> a<00:03:36.030> neat<00:03:36.269> feature<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:37.079> that<00:03:38.010> little<00:03:38.280> pin

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
is a neat feature and that little pin

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.210 
is a neat feature and that little pin
that<00:03:38.879> you<00:03:39.180> saw<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:40.019> silver<00:03:40.290> pin<00:03:40.590> that

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
that you saw the silver pin that

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.390 
that you saw the silver pin that
actually<00:03:41.609> basically<00:03:42.799> holds<00:03:43.799> the<00:03:43.889> monitor<00:03:44.250> in

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
actually basically holds the monitor in

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.059 
actually basically holds the monitor in
place<00:03:44.669> so<00:03:45.269> all<00:03:45.569> I<00:03:45.629> have<00:03:45.930> to<00:03:46.079> do<00:03:46.260> is<00:03:46.500> let<00:03:46.829> just

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
place so all I have to do is let just

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.860 
place so all I have to do is let just
pin<00:03:47.310> up<00:03:47.489> to<00:03:47.639> a<00:03:47.669> 45<00:03:48.060> degree<00:03:48.209> angle

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
pin up to a 45 degree angle

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.780 
pin up to a 45 degree angle
push<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.409> monitor<00:03:49.799> up<00:03:49.949> and<00:03:50.159> there<00:03:50.609> you<00:03:50.639> have

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
push the monitor up and there you have

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.349 
push the monitor up and there you have
it<00:03:51.919> so<00:03:52.919> that's<00:03:53.220> pretty<00:03:53.280> easy<00:03:53.519> setup<00:03:54.120> right

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
it so that's pretty easy setup right

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.170 
it so that's pretty easy setup right
there<00:03:54.629> put<00:03:55.349> it<00:03:55.440> back<00:03:55.530> on<00:03:55.799> just<00:03:56.370> at<00:03:56.609> a<00:03:56.639> 45<00:03:57.060> degree

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
there put it back on just at a 45 degree

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.899 
there put it back on just at a 45 degree
angle<00:03:57.359> drop<00:03:58.199> it<00:03:58.319> in<00:03:58.440> place<00:03:58.680> let<00:03:59.489> go<00:03:59.639> of<00:03:59.819> the

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
angle drop it in place let go of the

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:03.170 
angle drop it in place let go of the
metal<00:04:00.180> clip<00:04:00.680> and<00:04:01.680> you're<00:04:01.859> ready<00:04:02.069> to<00:04:02.129> go<00:04:02.310> that's

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
metal clip and you're ready to go that's

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.280 
metal clip and you're ready to go that's
how<00:04:03.419> easy<00:04:03.479> it<00:04:03.989> is<00:04:04.459> all<00:04:05.459> right

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
how easy it is all right

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.920 
how easy it is all right
now<00:04:07.860> that's<00:04:08.489> pretty<00:04:08.819> much<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.299> main<00:04:09.450> features

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
now that's pretty much the main features

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.050 
now that's pretty much the main features
of<00:04:09.959> this<00:04:10.799> monitor<00:04:11.280> stand<00:04:11.549> it<00:04:11.849> also<00:04:12.060> comes<00:04:12.510> with

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
of this monitor stand it also comes with

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.210 
of this monitor stand it also comes with
cable<00:04:15.060> ties<00:04:15.239> or<00:04:15.510> cable<00:04:15.840> clamps<00:04:16.320> to<00:04:16.620> do<00:04:17.010> some

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
to put some LEDs in and here it is right

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.500 
to put some LEDs in and here it is right
here<00:04:29.780> here's<00:04:30.780> an<00:04:30.930> LED<00:04:31.350> three<00:04:31.710> millimeter<00:04:32.190> and

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
here here's an LED three millimeter and

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.620 
here here's an LED three millimeter and
it's<00:04:34.490> extended<00:04:35.490> right<00:04:35.970> here<00:04:36.120> I<00:04:36.150> saw<00:04:36.449> Greg

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
it's extended right here I saw Greg

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
right here then I put some heat shrink

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.490 
right here then I put some heat shrink
around<00:04:38.100> it<00:04:38.400> it's<00:04:39.360> also<00:04:39.539> got<00:04:39.900> some<00:04:40.050> work<00:04:40.229> to<00:04:40.260> do
