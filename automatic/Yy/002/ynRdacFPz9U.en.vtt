00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
when I got in there because I think

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.450 
when I got in there because I think
there's<00:00:18.990> only<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.170> size<00:00:19.470> four<00:00:19.859> displayed<00:00:20.310> on

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
there's only a size four displayed on

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.720 
there's only a size four displayed on
the<00:00:20.550> shelf<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.470> they<00:00:22.470> only<00:00:22.619> had<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:23.430> size

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
the shelf and they only had that size

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.880 
the shelf and they only had that size
four<00:00:24.000> in<00:00:24.150> these<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.630> these<00:00:24.779> are<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.990> size<00:00:25.260> 9<00:00:25.650> and

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
four in these and these are a size 9 and

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.820 
four in these and these are a size 9 and
I'm<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.570> lad<00:00:27.720> there<00:00:27.960> told<00:00:28.230> me<00:00:28.349> that<00:00:28.590> they<00:00:28.800> only

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
I'm the lad there told me that they only

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.569 
I'm the lad there told me that they only
do<00:00:29.449> from<00:00:30.449> sizes<00:00:31.170> four<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.949> size<00:00:32.130> nine<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.550> a

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
do from sizes four to size nine and a

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.790 
do from sizes four to size nine and a
half<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.940> think<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.960> don't<00:00:34.050> even<00:00:34.200> go<00:00:34.380> from<00:00:34.590> size

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
half I think so don't even go from size

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.310 
half I think so don't even go from size
ten<00:00:35.190> onwards<00:00:35.850> which<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:36.930> thought<00:00:37.079> was<00:00:37.170> quite

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
ten onwards which I thought was quite

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.410 
ten onwards which I thought was quite
misfortunate<00:00:38.070> considering<00:00:38.640> on<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.059> size<00:00:39.239> 11

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
misfortunate considering on the size 11

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.040 
misfortunate considering on the size 11
but<00:00:40.160> I<00:00:41.160> loved<00:00:41.910> them<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:42.300> much<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.780> I've<00:00:42.840> seen

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
but I loved them so much and I've seen

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.170 
but I loved them so much and I've seen
them<00:00:43.320> on<00:00:43.500> Instagram<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.340> things<00:00:44.789> like<00:00:44.940> that

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
them on Instagram and things like that

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.779 
them on Instagram and things like that
and<00:00:45.390> I've<00:00:45.600> just<00:00:45.840> really<00:00:46.440> really<00:00:47.370> had<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.610> get<00:00:47.760> a

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789

and I've just really really had to get a
pair<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.239> managed<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.660> squeeze<00:00:48.870> into<00:00:49.110> them

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
you can see whoever is it's not like

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.149 
you can see whoever is it's not like
cloth<00:01:31.850> it's<00:01:32.720> a<00:01:32.780> different<00:01:33.259> material<00:01:33.350> but<00:01:34.009> the

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
cloth it's a different material but the

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.639 
cloth it's a different material but the
nights<00:01:34.369> I'm<00:01:34.670> sort<00:01:35.030> of<00:01:35.060> like<00:01:35.210> a<00:01:35.409> thin<00:01:36.409> layer<00:01:36.590> of

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
nights I'm sort of like a thin layer of

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.830 
nights I'm sort of like a thin layer of
rubber<00:01:37.009> and<00:01:37.340> it's<00:01:38.000> so<00:01:38.149> got<00:01:38.299> all<00:01:38.390> like<00:01:38.570> the

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
rubber and it's so got all like the
