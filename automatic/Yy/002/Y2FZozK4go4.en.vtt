positive or negative or neutral response
and<00:01:05.579> I<00:01:06.149> preferred<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.869> first<00:01:07.079> one

and I preferred it in the first one

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.139 
and I preferred it in the first one
where<00:01:07.829> we<00:01:08.159> might<00:01:08.610> have<00:01:08.759> said<00:01:08.939> something

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
where we might have said something

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:11.690 
where we might have said something
before<00:01:09.420> was<00:01:10.109> going<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.499> be<00:01:10.700> interpreted

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
before was going to be interpreted

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.969 
before was going to be interpreted
positively<00:01:12.569> it<00:01:12.749> might<00:01:12.959> not<00:01:13.109> have<00:01:13.229> been<00:01:13.289> I<00:01:13.590> like

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
positively it might not have been I like

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.660 
positively it might not have been I like
that<00:01:14.100> whole<00:01:14.280> aspect<00:01:14.420> farber<00:01:16.130> combat<00:01:17.130> doesn't

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
that whole aspect farber combat doesn't

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.370 
that whole aspect farber combat doesn't
necessarily<00:01:18.240> need<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.420> go<00:01:18.569> back<00:01:18.749> to<00:01:18.899> origins

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
necessarily need to go back to origins

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.260 
necessarily need to go back to origins
but<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.679> think<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.549> whole<00:01:20.759> hack<00:01:21.029> and<00:01:21.240> slash

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
but I think the whole hack and slash

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.899 
but I think the whole hack and slash
mentality<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.319> second<00:01:22.740> game<00:01:22.920> needs<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.729> go

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
mentality of the second game needs to go

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.139 
mentality of the second game needs to go
maybe<00:01:24.569> a<00:01:24.659> compromise<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.529> two<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.579> dragon

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
maybe a compromise of the two so dragon

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.569 
maybe a compromise of the two so dragon
age<00:01:27.240> 2<00:01:27.539> style<00:01:27.899> where<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.859> using<00:01:29.219> the<00:01:29.310> button

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
age 2 style where you using the button

piece<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.609> the<00:01:32.880> combat<00:01:33.270> might<00:01:33.450> be<00:01:33.569> a<00:01:33.600> bit

00:01:33.769 --> 00:01:33.779 
piece of the combat might be a bit

like<00:01:52.979> we<00:01:53.189> could<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.459> the<00:01:53.549> first<00:01:53.899> one<00:01:54.899> thing

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:55.109 
like we could in the first one thing

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:56.330 
like we could in the first one thing
that<00:01:55.259> they<00:01:55.349> took<00:01:55.529> out<00:01:55.709> for<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.919> second<00:01:56.249> one

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
that they took out for the second one

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.489 
that they took out for the second one
which<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.579> really<00:01:56.969> couldn't<00:01:57.689> comprehend<00:01:58.349> is

00:01:58.489 --> 00:01:58.499 
which I really couldn't comprehend is

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:59.959 
which I really couldn't comprehend is
the<00:01:58.649> fact<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:58.919> we<00:01:59.099> can't<00:01:59.310> players<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.880> the

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
the fact that we can't players of the

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.959 
the fact that we can't players of the
races<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.659> appreciate<00:02:01.259> Hawk<00:02:02.069> as<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.429> character

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
races I appreciate Hawk as a character

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.909 
races I appreciate Hawk as a character
and<00:02:03.359> trying<00:02:03.749> to<00:02:03.899> give<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.259> main<00:02:04.409> character

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:04.919 
and trying to give the main character

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:06.979 
and trying to give the main character
some<00:02:05.310> real<00:02:05.489> personality<00:02:06.209> but<00:02:06.389> I<00:02:06.630> honestly

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:06.989 
some real personality but I honestly

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:09.320 
some real personality but I honestly
preferred<00:02:07.709> the<00:02:07.889> origins<00:02:08.340> aspect<00:02:08.789> where<00:02:09.060> you

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
preferred the origins aspect where you

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.140 
preferred the origins aspect where you
kind<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.720> knew<00:02:10.380> your<00:02:10.619> background<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.370> played

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
kind of knew your background and played

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.210 
kind of knew your background and played
through<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.630> origins<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.290> there<00:02:13.890> were<00:02:13.980> six

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
through the origins and there were six

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.250 
through the origins and there were six
different<00:02:14.550> options<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.300> really<00:02:15.510> felt

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
different options and it really felt

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.870 
different options and it really felt
much<00:02:16.890> better

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
much better

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.240 
much better
and<00:02:18.000> for<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.810> Dayton<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:19.320> gives<00:02:19.950> this

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
and for a Dayton that gives this

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.040 
and for a Dayton that gives this
illusion<00:02:20.910> that<00:02:20.940> you've<00:02:21.180> got<00:02:21.360> so<00:02:21.540> much<00:02:21.720> choice

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
illusion that you've got so much choice

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.130 
illusion that you've got so much choice
to<00:02:22.590> kind<00:02:22.800> of<00:02:22.860> play<00:02:23.070> as<00:02:23.310> hawk<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:23.970> nobody<00:02:24.900> else

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
to kind of play as hawk and nobody else

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.040 
to kind of play as hawk and nobody else
seemed<00:02:25.740> a<00:02:25.860> bit<00:02:25.890> hypocritical<00:02:26.460> in<00:02:27.210> my<00:02:27.720> opinion

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
seemed a bit hypocritical in my opinion

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.980 
seemed a bit hypocritical in my opinion
anyway<00:02:28.530> I'm<00:02:28.710> my<00:02:29.250> final<00:02:29.580> thing<00:02:29.820> in<00:02:30.240> terms<00:02:30.750> of

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
anyway I'm my final thing in terms of

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.800 
anyway I'm my final thing in terms of
reverting<00:02:31.710> back<00:02:31.740> to<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.220> origin<00:02:32.580> style<00:02:32.850> is<00:02:33.150> do

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
reverting back to the origin style is do

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.440 
reverting back to the origin style is do
not<00:02:34.020> base<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.410> game<00:02:34.620> on<00:02:34.910> just<00:02:35.910> saving<00:02:36.270> one

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
really have to think about your tactics

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
spawns which is what they seem to have

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.570 
spawns which is what they seem to have
adopted<00:03:15.210> because<00:03:15.960> dragon<00:03:16.620> age<00:03:16.740> is<00:03:16.920> capable<00:03:17.520> of

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
adopted because dragon age is capable of

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.360 
adopted because dragon age is capable of
giving<00:03:18.510> us<00:03:18.780> some<00:03:18.960> great<00:03:19.170> tactical<00:03:19.800> battles

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
giving us some great tactical battles

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.940 
giving us some great tactical battles
but<00:03:20.700> it<00:03:20.940> really<00:03:21.330> didn't<00:03:21.930> reach<00:03:22.380> its<00:03:22.620> potential

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
but it really didn't reach its potential

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.850 
but it really didn't reach its potential
I'd<00:03:23.550> also<00:03:23.820> say<00:03:24.240> make<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:25.050> choices<00:03:25.290> actually

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
I'd also say make the choices actually

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.190 
I'd also say make the choices actually
matter<00:03:26.100> because<00:03:26.610> a<00:03:26.910> lot<00:03:27.600> of<00:03:27.630> these<00:03:27.900> choices

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
matter because a lot of these choices

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.070 
matter because a lot of these choices
that<00:03:28.650> we<00:03:28.890> supposedly<00:03:29.550> make<00:03:30.060> they<00:03:30.690> just<00:03:30.930> seem

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
that we supposedly make they just seem

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.930 
that we supposedly make they just seem
to<00:03:31.110> have<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:31.530> same<00:03:31.560> outcome<00:03:32.130> every<00:03:32.490> time<00:03:32.730> and

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
to have the same outcome every time and

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.420 
to have the same outcome every time and
you<00:03:32.970> feel<00:03:33.630> like<00:03:33.900> I<00:03:34.590> may<00:03:34.920> as<00:03:34.980> well<00:03:35.070> not<00:03:35.370> have

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
you feel like I may as well not have

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.760 
you feel like I may as well not have
made<00:03:35.940> that<00:03:36.000> choice<00:03:36.390> because<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.440> outcome

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
made that choice because the outcome

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.410 
made that choice because the outcome
would<00:03:37.890> have<00:03:37.950> been<00:03:38.070> more<00:03:38.370> or<00:03:38.490> less<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.760> same<00:03:38.790> so

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
would have been more or less the same so

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.450 
would have been more or less the same so
give<00:03:39.660> us<00:03:39.690> some<00:03:39.990> earth-shattering<00:03:40.460> choices

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 
give us some earth-shattering choices

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.140 
including multiplayer in dragon age but
if<00:04:01.170> they<00:04:01.380> do<00:04:01.440> which<00:04:02.160> has<00:04:02.340> been<00:04:02.490> rumored<00:04:02.760> i

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
if they do which has been rumored i

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.820 
if they do which has been rumored i
think<00:04:03.720> they<00:04:03.810> should<00:04:03.959> go<00:04:04.050> down<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.380> hole<00:04:04.500> co-op

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
think they should go down the hole co-op

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.620 
think they should go down the hole co-op
routes<00:04:05.250> rather<00:04:05.550> than<00:04:05.760> competitive

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630

multiplayer like has been rumored i

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.720 
multiplayer like has been rumored i
think<00:04:09.540> something<00:04:09.810> akin<00:04:10.470> to<00:04:10.530> Mass<00:04:11.070> Effect<00:04:11.400> 3's

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
think something akin to Mass Effect 3's

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.430 
think something akin to Mass Effect 3's
co-op<00:04:12.209> where<00:04:12.450> they<00:04:12.630> have<00:04:12.750> a<00:04:12.780> bunch<00:04:13.050> of<00:04:13.200> side

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
co-op where they have a bunch of side

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.660 
co-op where they have a bunch of side
missions<00:04:13.470> that<00:04:13.950> don't<00:04:14.190> affect<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.520> main

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
missions that don't affect the main

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.820 
missions that don't affect the main
story<00:04:14.940> but<00:04:15.510> in<00:04:15.690> their<00:04:15.900> own<00:04:16.049> right<00:04:16.290> very

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
story but in their own right very

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.610 
story but in their own right very
playable<00:04:17.330> missions<00:04:18.330> I<00:04:18.600> think<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:19.470> whole

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
playable missions I think the whole

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.099 
playable missions I think the whole
battle<00:04:20.070> system<00:04:20.489> would<00:04:21.060> work<00:04:21.090> really<00:04:21.540> well<00:04:21.720> in

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
battle system would work really well in

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.500 
battle system would work really well in
co-op<00:04:22.560> fighting<00:04:23.400> massive<00:04:23.910> dragons<00:04:24.330> and

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
co-op fighting massive dragons and

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.850 
co-op fighting massive dragons and
massive<00:04:24.780> enemies<00:04:25.110> with<00:04:25.290> your<00:04:25.410> friends<00:04:25.770> I

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
massive enemies with your friends I

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.280 
massive enemies with your friends I
think<00:04:26.100> would<00:04:26.190> be<00:04:26.280> really<00:04:26.310> cool<00:04:26.790> but<00:04:27.600> fighting

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
think would be really cool but fighting

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.110 
think would be really cool but fighting
against<00:04:28.710> each<00:04:28.830> other<00:04:29.070> whilst<00:04:29.520> riding<00:04:29.790> dragons

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
against each other whilst riding dragons

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.519 
against each other whilst riding dragons
while<00:04:30.720> it<00:04:30.870> sounds<00:04:31.200> cool

00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:31.529 
while it sounds cool

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:33.469 
while it sounds cool
I<00:04:31.769> don't<00:04:32.399> think<00:04:32.639> it<00:04:32.759> would<00:04:32.879> work<00:04:32.909> that<00:04:33.299> well

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
I don't think it would work that well

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.509 
I don't think it would work that well
all<00:04:34.049> the<00:04:34.379> suggestions<00:04:34.739> i<00:04:34.979> would<00:04:35.099> have<00:04:35.279> a

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:35.519 
all the suggestions i would have a

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:38.389 
all the suggestions i would have a
bigger<00:04:36.089> variety<00:04:36.359> of<00:04:36.749> locations<00:04:37.169> i<00:04:37.679> can't

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:38.399 
bigger variety of locations i can't

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:40.429 
bigger variety of locations i can't
believe<00:04:38.459> the<00:04:38.909> amount<00:04:38.939> of<00:04:39.299> recycled<00:04:39.959> dungeons

00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:40.439 
believe the amount of recycled dungeons

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:42.979

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:47.399 
big an offender but i still think more

whore but the Dragon Age series kind of

00:05:07.769 --> 00:05:10.849 
whore but the Dragon Age series kind of
looks<00:05:08.069> a<00:05:08.339> bit<00:05:08.819> dated<00:05:09.119> in<00:05:09.569> terms<00:05:09.989> of<00:05:10.169> graphics<00:05:10.409> I

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:10.859 
looks a bit dated in terms of graphics I

00:05:10.859 --> 00:05:13.009 
looks a bit dated in terms of graphics I
appreciate<00:05:11.339> the<00:05:11.669> fact<00:05:11.849> that<00:05:11.999> not<00:05:12.539> every<00:05:12.839> game

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:13.019 
appreciate the fact that not every game

00:05:13.019 --> 00:05:15.379 
appreciate the fact that not every game
can<00:05:13.289> look<00:05:13.529> incredible<00:05:14.339> but<00:05:14.609> I'm<00:05:14.999> sure<00:05:15.359> they

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
can look incredible but I'm sure they

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:17.509 
can look incredible but I'm sure they
can<00:05:15.599> squeeze<00:05:16.349> more<00:05:16.679> out<00:05:16.739> of<00:05:16.919> the<00:05:17.099> engine<00:05:17.249> than

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:17.519 
can squeeze more out of the engine than

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:19.489 
can squeeze more out of the engine than
they<00:05:17.609> have<00:05:17.759> done<00:05:18.029> I<00:05:18.179> mean<00:05:18.359> mass<00:05:18.899> effect<00:05:19.259> is<00:05:19.469> a

00:05:19.489 --> 00:05:19.499 
they have done I mean mass effect is a

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:22.339 
they have done I mean mass effect is a
similar<00:05:19.979> game<00:05:20.129> in<00:05:20.369> size<00:05:21.029> and<00:05:21.209> scope<00:05:21.479> yet<00:05:22.109> it

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:22.349 
similar game in size and scope yet it

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:24.859 
similar game in size and scope yet it
looks<00:05:22.409> considerably<00:05:23.159> better<00:05:23.699> so<00:05:24.689> i<00:05:24.719> think

00:05:24.859 --> 00:05:24.869 
looks considerably better so i think

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:26.899 
looks considerably better so i think
that<00:05:25.289> there's<00:05:25.709> a<00:05:25.799> lot<00:05:26.009> of<00:05:26.039> room<00:05:26.279> to<00:05:26.309> maneuver

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:26.909 
that there's a lot of room to maneuver

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:28.789 
that there's a lot of room to maneuver
and<00:05:27.089> if<00:05:27.479> they<00:05:27.659> really<00:05:27.839> put<00:05:28.259> some<00:05:28.409> effort<00:05:28.529> and

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:28.799 
and if they really put some effort and

00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:30.399 
and if they really put some effort and
then<00:05:29.039> they<00:05:29.339> can<00:05:29.519> improve<00:05:29.639> the<00:05:29.999> graphics

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:30.409 
then they can improve the graphics

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:33.409 
then they can improve the graphics
considerably<00:05:31.409> and<00:05:31.649> also<00:05:32.339> load<00:05:32.909> times<00:05:33.239> are

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
considerably and also load times are

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.719 
considerably and also load times are
insanely<00:05:34.169> high<00:05:34.499> whether<00:05:35.069> they<00:05:35.219> can<00:05:35.279> improve

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
insanely high whether they can improve

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:38.029 
insanely high whether they can improve
that<00:05:35.759> with<00:05:36.449> improving<00:05:37.229> the<00:05:37.319> graphics<00:05:37.679> also<00:05:38.009> i

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
that with improving the graphics also i

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.829 
that with improving the graphics also i
don't<00:05:38.219> know<00:05:38.519> but<00:05:38.999> that's<00:05:39.179> one<00:05:39.360> thing<00:05:39.539> i<00:05:39.719> would

00:05:39.829 --> 00:05:39.839 
don't know but that's one thing i would

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:41.959 
don't know but that's one thing i would
definitely<00:05:40.110> like<00:05:40.439> improving<00:05:40.860> not<00:05:41.549> imperative

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:41.969 
definitely like improving not imperative

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:44.179 
definitely like improving not imperative
but<00:05:42.629> when<00:05:42.809> you're<00:05:42.959> traveling<00:05:43.469> from<00:05:43.619> location

00:05:44.179 --> 00:05:44.189 
but when you're traveling from location

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:45.889 
but when you're traveling from location
to<00:05:44.219> location<00:05:44.369> it<00:05:44.999> starts<00:05:45.239> to<00:05:45.329> become<00:05:45.419> really

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:45.899 
to location it starts to become really

00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:48.469 
to location it starts to become really
noticeable<00:05:46.409> but<00:05:47.339> they<00:05:47.639> are<00:05:47.789> more<00:05:48.329> or<00:05:48.449> less

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
noticeable but they are more or less

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.179 
noticeable but they are more or less
minor<00:05:48.839> things<00:05:49.229> there's<00:05:49.679> something<00:05:50.069> that

00:05:50.179 --> 00:05:50.189 
minor things there's something that

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:52.389 
minor things there's something that
could<00:05:50.309> be<00:05:50.399> put<00:05:50.519> on<00:05:50.639> the<00:05:50.699> back<00:05:50.909> burner<00:05:50.989> the<00:05:51.989> main

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:52.399 
could be put on the back burner the main

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:54.829 
could be put on the back burner the main
aspects<00:05:53.399> i<00:05:53.579> would<00:05:53.759> like<00:05:53.879> improving<00:05:54.299> are<00:05:54.719> the

00:05:54.829 --> 00:05:54.839 
aspects i would like improving are the

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:57.199 
aspects i would like improving are the
ones<00:05:55.019> i<00:05:55.169> alluded<00:05:55.589> to<00:05:55.739> previously<00:05:55.769> in<00:05:56.579> terms<00:05:57.089> of

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:57.209 
ones i alluded to previously in terms of

00:05:57.209 --> 00:05:59.719 
ones i alluded to previously in terms of
the<00:05:57.360> game<00:05:57.569> design<00:05:57.959> now<00:05:58.649> many<00:05:58.979> may<00:05:59.279> think<00:05:59.639> that

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
the game design now many may think that

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:02.059 
the game design now many may think that
i've<00:06:00.059> been<00:06:00.449> unnecessarily<00:06:01.169> harsh<00:06:01.529> on<00:06:01.739> Dragon

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:02.069 
i've been unnecessarily harsh on Dragon

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:04.609 
i've been unnecessarily harsh on Dragon
Age<00:06:02.189> 2<00:06:02.219> I<00:06:02.699> still<00:06:03.479> really<00:06:03.779> enjoyed<00:06:04.199> dragon<00:06:04.529> age

00:06:04.609 --> 00:06:04.619 
Age 2 I still really enjoyed dragon age

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:07.429 
Age 2 I still really enjoyed dragon age
2<00:06:04.859> it<00:06:05.129> just<00:06:05.399> it<00:06:05.609> felt<00:06:06.359> so<00:06:06.749> disappointing

00:06:07.429 --> 00:06:07.439 
2 it just it felt so disappointing

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:09.199 
2 it just it felt so disappointing
compared<00:06:07.829> to<00:06:07.919> the<00:06:08.039> first<00:06:08.219> I'm<00:06:08.519> not<00:06:08.969> saying

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:09.209 
compared to the first I'm not saying

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:10.909 
compared to the first I'm not saying

origins<00:06:11.129> to<00:06:11.759> obviously<00:06:12.599> give<00:06:12.839> it<00:06:12.929> its<00:06:13.079> own

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:15.919 
origins to obviously give it its own
identity<00:06:13.429> but<00:06:14.429> stick<00:06:14.999> to<00:06:15.149> what<00:06:15.299> made<00:06:15.539> dragon

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:15.929 
identity but stick to what made dragon

00:06:15.929 --> 00:06:17.659 
identity but stick to what made dragon
age<00:06:16.049> so<00:06:16.259> popular<00:06:16.739> in<00:06:16.859> the<00:06:16.949> first<00:06:17.129> place<00:06:17.339> and

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669 
age so popular in the first place and

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:20.599 
age so popular in the first place and
that<00:06:18.179> was<00:06:18.389> going<00:06:19.199> back<00:06:19.409> to<00:06:19.559> its<00:06:19.739> roots<00:06:19.949> of<00:06:20.279> a

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:20.609 
that was going back to its roots of a

00:06:20.609 --> 00:06:24.139 
that was going back to its roots of a
classic<00:06:21.499> western<00:06:22.499> RPG<00:06:23.039> style<00:06:23.339> and<00:06:23.669> that's

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:24.149 
classic western RPG style and that's

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:26.539 
classic western RPG style and that's
basically<00:06:24.659> what<00:06:25.289> I<00:06:25.499> think<00:06:25.949> more<00:06:26.369> or<00:06:26.459> less

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:26.549 
basically what I think more or less

00:06:26.549 --> 00:06:28.729 
basically what I think more or less
every<00:06:26.849> Dragon<00:06:27.179> Age<00:06:27.299> fun<00:06:27.539> would<00:06:27.719> like<00:06:27.929> I'd<00:06:28.469> say

every Dragon Age fun would like I'd say

00:06:28.739 --> 00:06:30.649 
every Dragon Age fun would like I'd say

innovate without reinventing the wheel

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:32.909 
that would be the most appropriate term
