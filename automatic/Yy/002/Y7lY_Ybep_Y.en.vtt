yesterday<00:00:33.810> the<00:00:34.810> scheme<00:00:35.110> is<00:00:36.100> unique<00:00:36.880> in<00:00:37.150> the

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
yesterday the scheme is unique in the

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.840 
yesterday the scheme is unique in the
fact<00:00:37.360> that<00:00:37.660> it<00:00:37.870> has<00:00:38.079> a<00:00:38.380> lot<00:00:39.010> of<00:00:39.040> tips<00:00:39.460> will<00:00:39.760> a

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
fact that it has a lot of tips will a

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.660 
fact that it has a lot of tips will a
trip<00:00:40.320> we<00:00:41.320> pull<00:00:41.559> back<00:00:41.590> when<00:00:42.040> we<00:00:42.160> see<00:00:42.340> that's<00:00:42.550> a

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
trip we pull back when we see that's a

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.730 
trip we pull back when we see that's a
black<00:00:42.910> there<00:00:43.150> right<00:00:43.390> there<00:00:43.600> hopefully

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:44.740 
black there right there hopefully

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.190 
black there right there hopefully
absolutely<00:00:45.610> that's<00:00:45.820> gonna<00:00:46.060> scare<00:00:46.540> everyone

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
absolutely that's gonna scare everyone

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.920 
absolutely that's gonna scare everyone
and<00:00:47.680> soft<00:00:47.950> condition<00:00:48.670> could<00:00:48.820> be<00:00:48.880> dragons<00:00:49.600> like

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
and soft condition could be dragons like

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.860 
and soft condition could be dragons like
steel<00:00:50.350> mountain--<00:00:50.410> sounds<00:00:51.070> good<00:00:51.600> that's<00:00:52.600> kind

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
steel mountain-- sounds good that's kind

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.630 
steel mountain-- sounds good that's kind
of<00:00:52.930> cool

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.820 

seen<00:00:58.500> zero<00:00:59.550> basis<00:01:00.550> before<00:01:00.780> here<00:01:01.780> we<00:01:01.900> have<00:01:02.110> the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830 
seen zero basis before here we have the

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.310 
seen zero basis before here we have the
new<00:01:03.040> zero<00:01:03.310> base<00:01:03.580> so<00:01:04.059> this<00:01:04.210> is<00:01:04.330> the<00:01:04.449> RCS<00:01:04.930> zero

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
new zero base so this is the RCS zero

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.620 
new zero base so this is the RCS zero
the<00:01:06.220> nice<00:01:06.400> thing<00:01:06.430> about<00:01:06.670> this<00:01:07.030> base<00:01:07.270> is

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
the nice thing about this base is

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.090 
the nice thing about this base is
compared<00:01:08.500> to<00:01:08.560> the<00:01:08.740> old<00:01:09.150> wax<00:01:10.150> less<00:01:11.100> non

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
compared to the old wax less non

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.570 
compared to the old wax less non
pattern-based<00:01:12.700> skis<00:01:13.420> this<00:01:14.200> new<00:01:14.710> zero<00:01:15.070> product

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
pattern-based skis this new zero product

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.550 
pattern-based skis this new zero product
is<00:01:16.410> far<00:01:17.410> greater<00:01:18.720> capability<00:01:19.720> and<00:01:20.229> by<00:01:20.380> that<00:01:20.500> I

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
is far greater capability and by that I

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.170 
is far greater capability and by that I
mean<00:01:20.680> that<00:01:20.890> it<00:01:21.160> can<00:01:21.340> handle<00:01:21.550> greater

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
mean that it can handle greater

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.600 
mean that it can handle greater
differences<00:01:22.780> in<00:01:22.930> snow<00:01:23.170> crystals<00:01:23.650> and<00:01:24.040> snow

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
differences in snow crystals and snow

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.469 
differences in snow crystals and snow
temperatures<00:01:25.090> than<00:01:25.479> last<00:01:26.320> year's<00:01:27.479> material

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
temperatures than last year's material

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:35.950 
temperatures than last year's material
could<00:01:28.690> so<00:01:29.200> that<00:01:29.229> will<00:01:29.470> benefit<00:01:30.270> excellent

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:44.880 

the<00:01:36.170> classic<00:01:37.010> product

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.140 

importantly<00:01:45.790> we<00:01:46.060> have<00:01:46.090> added<00:01:46.710> 172s<00:01:47.710> and<00:01:48.159> also

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
importantly we have added 172s and also

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.690 
importantly we have added 172s and also
medium<00:01:49.600> flexes<00:01:50.080> to<00:01:50.229> the<00:01:50.350> carbon<00:01:50.680> line<00:01:50.800> sounds

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
medium flexes to the carbon line sounds

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.620 
medium flexes to the carbon line sounds
coming<00:01:52.120> year<00:01:52.420> we've<00:01:53.320> also<00:01:53.530> added<00:01:54.060> soft<00:01:55.060> track

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
coming year we've also added soft track

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.530 
coming year we've also added soft track
version<00:01:56.080> of<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.680> part<00:01:56.920> of<00:01:57.010> my<00:01:57.130> day<00:01:57.300> so<00:01:58.300> this

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
version of the part of my day so this

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.600 
version of the part of my day so this
ski<00:01:58.750> is<00:01:58.780> going<00:01:59.170> to<00:01:59.260> have<00:01:59.380> a<00:01:59.409> different<00:02:00.040> camper

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
ski is going to have a different camper

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.540 
ski is going to have a different camper
profiles<00:02:01.119> and<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.660> existing<00:02:02.320> carbon<00:02:02.800> way<00:02:02.920> and

profiles and the existing carbon way and

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.840 
profiles and the existing carbon way and
help<00:02:03.729> it<00:02:03.880> perform<00:02:04.210> better<00:02:04.630> in<00:02:04.750> this<00:02:05.530> office

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
help it perform better in this office

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.590 
help it perform better in this office
new

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
new

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.630 
new
very<00:02:11.170> exciting<00:02:11.710> is<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.160> whole<00:02:12.340> scheme

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
very exciting is the whole scheme

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.900 
very exciting is the whole scheme
so<00:02:14.300> brand<00:02:14.660> new<00:02:14.810> for<00:02:15.020> this<00:02:15.110> year<00:02:15.910> limited

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
so brand new for this year limited

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.040 
so brand new for this year limited
quantities<00:02:17.480> will<00:02:17.780> be<00:02:17.900> equals<00:02:19.780> this<00:02:20.780> may<00:02:20.990> seem

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
quantities will be equals this may seem

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.170 
quantities will be equals this may seem
like<00:02:22.010> a<00:02:22.069> minor<00:02:22.459> difference

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
like a minor difference

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.179 
like a minor difference
but<00:02:24.420> in<00:02:24.540> reality<00:02:24.780> after<00:02:25.200> skiing<00:02:25.650> on<00:02:25.799> it<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.040> was

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
but in reality after skiing on it I was

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.690 
but in reality after skiing on it I was
shocked<00:02:26.519> at<00:02:26.760> how<00:02:27.390> much<00:02:27.569> difference<00:02:27.959> it<00:02:28.109> made

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
shocked at how much difference it made

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.780 
shocked at how much difference it made
the<00:02:29.700> whole<00:02:30.510> represents<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.349> 5<00:02:31.650> gram<00:02:32.099> reduction

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
the whole represents a 5 gram reduction

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.660 
the whole represents a 5 gram reduction
in<00:02:32.909> weight<00:02:33.090> at<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.569> tip<00:02:33.980> allowing<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.189> ski<00:02:35.459> to

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
in weight at the tip allowing the ski to

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
in weight at the tip allowing the ski to
have

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
have
