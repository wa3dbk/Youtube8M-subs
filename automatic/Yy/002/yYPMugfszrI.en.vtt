00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.130
 all right 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.850
 hello friends I am Mrs. Alejandra and 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.600
 today we are going to work making a 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:19.290
 crown for 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:24.330
 now we use wire for that 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:27.800
 crimp we go 55 centimeters east 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.650
 ribbon cited that they are pure flowers 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.739
 we occupy 70 centimeters we occupy the 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:39.780
 flowers depends on the color and size 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:42.480
 the head of the girl scissor clamps 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.410
 flower floral ribbon and yes 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.989
 we are going to bend here a little bit 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.780
 because here we need to leave a kind of 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.750
 ring because in the end that's where 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.510
 let's put this here for 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.000
 close 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.000
 here we are going to occupy the floral ribbon 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:12.640
 we are going to cut ourselves to conform 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:16.119
 we are going to occupy this tape so that 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:20.979
 work better we always have us 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.810
 to put that if we pull it the 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.030
 Poplars 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.479
 she is always going to come very well 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.630
 because many times we do not pull it 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.149
 enough and it does not stick and we cut 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:40.110
 again the tape and so let's go 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:42.150
 working us everything that we 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.510
 as long as we want 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.510
 to work 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:52.070
 we put the same thing here we have to leave 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.930
 not the flower so attached to the wire or very 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.170
 long so that we stay 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:02.200
 so that we have a space that the 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:06.710
 flower we are paraditas and this one 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.259
 we continue working the wire in what 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.110
 we are working always have to 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.860
 be as straight as we are 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:21.319
 we can see left because if we 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:24.709
 we let it get bent bent or 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:29.110
 what we will not be able to work because 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:31.300
 It will not leave us the same 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:36.720
 and we are going to make sure that we have the 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.720
 equal distance from one to another 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:47.030
 and since one ends it, it already accommodates 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:49.180
 well all the infinite 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.769
 it accommodates you 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.769
 the flower that we have left for 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.769
 manage them 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:03.770
 and we return to accommodate 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.770
 another little flower watching the distance 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:15.280
 we can also do it on tiaras the 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:18.610
 we can make cool to age depends 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.909
 of the girl then we have a good 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:25.620
 coronary depends on age because there 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:28.620
 drinks because they can not 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.620
 wear 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.480
 they took a brick in the forehead by 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.300
 not be the others 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.849
 they do not leave it to him and apart because it's too bad 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.250
 because they are so tiny 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:44.460
 then no 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:48.290
 we put back a flower 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:52.510
 white as we begin 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.510
 and leaving the same distance 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:59.480
 now we are going to put this other tone of 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:04.720
 rose is a rosewood because it already 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.720
 we put a Mexican rose 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:17.400
 after we finish we go that 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:21.390
 ribbon that we have with florets the 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:25.620
 let's accommodate so that we already fix better 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:29.780
 the flowers fix the tape better and we already 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.780
 it's going to be perfectly fine 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:41.520
 we 're done if you're going to see what 

00:04:37.179 --> 00:04:44.729
 little time we can do it 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:48.030
 here we done to accommodate us 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:50.360
 the little flowers now we are going to close 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.080
 us here 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.979
 I'm going to remove a little tape and 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.979
 let's close 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:08.210
 and we close we put here 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.110
 in this ring that we had already left 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.460
 initially 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.150
 here it is 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:18.919
 Now with the clamp and we bend it to 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:22.620
 ensure it very well that we look good 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:24.870
 well closed here and we were left now 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.200
 we are going to put tape so that we are left 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.400
 there completely 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.400
 very well radius 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.129
 I am going to accommodate this tape 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.790
 I'm going to paste it 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:59.230
 it's at the beginning and at the end we're going to go 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.230
