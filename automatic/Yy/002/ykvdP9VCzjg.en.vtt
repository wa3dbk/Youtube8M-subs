wireless<00:02:51.530> ready<00:02:51.769> TV<00:02:52.459> I<00:02:52.780> think<00:02:53.780> it's<00:02:53.900> pretty

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
wireless ready TV I think it's pretty

00:02:54.049 --> 00:03:01.270 
wireless ready TV I think it's pretty
decent<00:02:56.380> for<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.410> price<00:02:59.500> compared<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.560> others

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
decent for the price compared to others

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.589 
decent for the price compared to others
so<00:03:02.209> I<00:03:02.739> hope<00:03:03.739> this<00:03:03.950> helps<00:03:04.250> somebody<00:03:04.400> when<00:03:04.880> with

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
so I hope this helps somebody when with

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.220 
so I hope this helps somebody when with
purchasing<00:03:06.319> their<00:03:06.560> TV
