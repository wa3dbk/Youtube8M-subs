rare and it's even more rare that it

rare and it's even more rare that it

the Huey but the Black Shark provides
the<00:01:12.600> better<00:01:13.140> overall<00:01:13.500> experience<00:01:13.590> for<00:01:14.159> me<00:01:14.340> and

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
the better overall experience for me and

the multiplayer mesh missions I often
partake<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.340> personally<00:01:17.939> think<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.180> the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
partake in I personally think that the

partake in I personally think that the
Huey<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.259> lot<00:01:19.619> more<00:01:19.770> fun<00:01:20.040> actually<00:01:20.520> than<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
Huey is a lot more fun actually than the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.890 
Huey is a lot more fun actually than the
Black<00:01:20.939> Shark<00:01:21.150> when<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.450> comes<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.780> the
