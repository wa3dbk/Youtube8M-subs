00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 Hi everyone, today I talk about one 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.779
 indispensable tool for anyone 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.610
 have a dog or leash 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.010
 I once heard a comparison that I did 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.259
 loved it 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:16.109
 or 6 drops were in a car the 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.720
 leash we should n't think of it as the 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.490
 Brake or worse as they wheel 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.420
 of the car but like the belt of 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.650
 safety 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.720
 they really exist on the market 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.640
 a multitude of different models 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.349
 there really is plenty of choice 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.930
 but apart from the aesthetics then the colors 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.340
 different with or without studs with or without 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.620
 stress 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.200
 there are important features 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.510
 to be taken into consideration for example 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.280
 one of these is the material of which it is 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.890
 made up the leash 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.629
 I do not recommend owners to use i 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.149
 chain leashes because you are 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.590
 canelli threw a sudden and you 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.890
 you are holding it on a leash or it 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.730
 take to the chain you really could 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.309
 hurt me 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.230
 for this reason I suggest instead of 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.989
 take the guin cuts you both make of 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.510
 a fabric webbing feature 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.430
 the length by law is important 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.420
 leash can be long at most 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.850
 a meter and a half 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.340
 I would say rightly because if we are 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.009
 walking on the sidewalk is not 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.780
 correct that this is three meters away 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.650
 from us because maybe we annoy 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.509
 someone or hinder the passage though 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.280
 according to me it's not even right for 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.770
 leash is shorter than a meter e 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.810
 half because how we have to leave a 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.960
 certain freedom of movement to the dog not 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.850
 must stick to his legs ed 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.369
 eva that considers not to use with a 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.640
 minimum of serenity heaven that walk 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.920
 this is why I prefer e 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.070
 leashes that have fixed, however 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.409
 possibility of having different lengths 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.009
 for example, I'll show you this with 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:58.480
 the rings which has three rings so it is 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:01.150
 however, there is the possibility of keeping it 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.660
 the minimum of a meter and a half instead 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:07.930
 that the average length but yes 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.000
 hooks into the middle rather than the 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.760
 maximum length that can be two 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.400
 meters and a half otherwise this why 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.080
 because maybe if we are at the park than not 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.390
 there is none and we don't bother 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.130
 no one can even leave a little 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.490
 more freedom to the dog to leave it 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.920
 sniff more serenely 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.780
 however also the rings with some loved ones 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.230
 may be a bit dangerous because if 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.530
 give the tug we leave our fingers 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:38.260
 for this there are also leashes 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.960
 plan two lengths but they are smooth then 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.930
 they do not have intermediate rings for example 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.850
 I will show you this, but only 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.610
 the ring is at the base where it engages 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.670
 farella small at this is the length 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:55.030
 minimum of a meter and a half and length 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.160
 maximum of 3 meters and at the end 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.630
 just the opposite is there but limited to 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.340
 restrain 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.070
 among other things sorry did not tell me that 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.800
 this I did it is beautiful has me 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.540
 done that morning to sicily finally 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.180
 there is another type of leash that 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.070
 It is this true loved ones and their Guenzani 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.250
 extendable that I strongly advise against 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.230
 for several reasons above all not 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.150
 we have a good perception of where I am 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.150
 dog because these leads come 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.160
 up to 5 meters and if we might be there 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.930
 we are also talking 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.480
 on information we are a moment 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:33.070
 distracted we do not have the perception that 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:36.070
 rises both to 1 2 3 4 5 meters away 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.590
 from us and this quite dangerous the 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.930
 dog can in a moment cross the 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.020
 street rather than cutting the road 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.110
 cyclists or annoying people o 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:50.280
 he can still end up with another dog in his mouth 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:53.560
 because if it is not blocked by the kilo and so 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.300
 it is often not blocked the dog in a 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.410
 blink of an eye 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.650
 on the other hand also with this type 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.560
 of leash 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:07.310
 I learn to shoot because there is always one 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.489
 tension that no matter how slight of 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.069
 here in Italy always in tension e 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:15.680
 so do learn that while hearing the 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.620
 tension he does not stop he can 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.780
 continue people teaches how to shoot 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.850
 summarizing leave them leash a 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.759
 a very important choice therefore 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.050
 Spend some time researching what 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:30.139
 is the mini cut most suited to yours 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.090
 needs and those of your dog said 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.720
 this I wish you good 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.100
 walk 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.100
 see you soon. Bye
