 still have an almost human face 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.739
 are less resistant and it is possible 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.089
 to eliminate them in melee it is 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.620
 so recommended to attack them 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:57.479
 discreetly from behind for the

 the latter are at a stage of infection 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.589
 much more advanced they are called 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.210

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.750
 locate the humans they can 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.280
 attack they use this system 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.900
 echolocation because they can not 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.430
 more see because of their mutation the
