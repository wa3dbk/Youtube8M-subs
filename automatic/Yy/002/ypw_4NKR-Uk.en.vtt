00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 andreas janke and poljana estimation 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.509
 the challenge to face the 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.790
 Temporary boys should be different from one another 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.170
 polo to the porsche book act that is 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.480
 at least the challenge before the 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.519
 mobile.de she created is the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.890
 whole also facebook because the boys 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.350
 your dream car a lucrativeren never 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.080
 can afford to hit mobile.de in front of him 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.880
 as an alternative to porsche to act that 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.019
 Nobody really knows as well as it does 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.960
 we work it simply 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.849
 try and the principle of the so far the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.859
 The theory is you buy a car and 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.050
 sell it again if you look at it 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.090
 you do it halfway cleverly 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.700
 So it really works 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.309
 that's why andreas janisch should be at seven 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.930
 car sales from this polo after one 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.500
 almost half a year in a Porsche 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.360
 land 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.149
 at best, with some help the 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.469
 facebook fans and can us too 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.690
 then give tips if you yourself 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.190
 something on mobile.de find something 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.050
 maybe it could be exciting for us 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.239
 and he becomes diligent even then 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.710
 comments the more they get involved 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.090
 and maybe good hints and 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.559
 The bigger the one, the better 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.629
 chance that we end up, of course 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.909
 gigantic porsche have stood and 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.040
 not one that always falls apart 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.080
 they can win that too 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.090
 but first had to come there times 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:18.119
 a lot to be done on the initial model 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.920
 has front right then quite amusing 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.180
 damage caused in the garage 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.740
 that the previous owner against a 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.030
 driven sink had me also 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.630
 sink showed that was all very much 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.640
 plausible 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.130
 the delle now has a paint damage 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.759
 leave and accordingly it is 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.890
 not quite like that 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.869
 So come on as a quiet stand 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.119
 There is also a radio with it 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.100
 coffered ceiling and a seat heating 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.899
 besides, a dresser has the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.970
 Interior and the upholstery made pretty 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.490
 but now it gets serious the two 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.509
 first potential buyers come and 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.509
 do a test drive 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.340
 Do you believe something for her? I guess 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.760
 well, yes 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.830
 hagen it was ok and had air conditioning 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.750
 fog lights 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:08.670
 wrong it was honestly my 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.500
 girls in interview the boys of tempo 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:17.520
 rama even try with the oldschool 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:19.320
 cassettes radio to score or bibi 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.550
 blocksberg because cassettes radio 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.320
 you do not know anymore today and 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.180
 are the guys told earlier guest 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.590
 cassettes and for the girlfriend it should 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.900
 either the bibi blocksberg or 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.550
 a ticket ag may benjamin 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.440
 floret 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.520
 there must be a fat profit 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.590
 jump out at the polo 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.370
 anyway, the next car will already be 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.500
 Well we have the prix we wanted 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.730
 Seen yesterday at the tank in the district 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.180
 is a car what people outside 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:53.250
 will not know yet in the size 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:59.310
 So Japanese possibilities for small 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:11.730
 slim to exotically round out then exclaim 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:13.680
 so the ugliest on multiple task 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.239
 could be the car that the the 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.590
 ugliest car in the world the most beautiful 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.870
 places and to work 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.820
 But they do not want the next car 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.410
 just looking at the computer but have 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.940
 also special actions for her 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.920
 devised facebook fans 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.750
 we do something like a brand 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.390
 roulette we make a nice slice 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.530
 turn it once and when it does 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.920
 elvira da lands then it has to stop 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.050
 Unfortunately, that is the advantage 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:41.010
 Vehicle market on the internet like now 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.120
 mobile.de have represented all brands 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.590
 if you tag together 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.360
 used car dealer go pending 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.610
 get which cars is not 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.320
 inevitably one now 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.760
 Czech on the tempo rama 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.010
 facebook page there is always the 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.840
 current status andreas and jammer 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.360
 Anyhow hope that it continues like that 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.830
 so far and then they are coming soon from 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.830
 polo to the porsche
