00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.850
 Hello everyone of intermission, that's power r 5 series 

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:13.320
 love is a 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:18.330
 Today is a product review, though 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.910
 It is a new nurse's new concealer, but this is 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.350
 That Radiant Creamy Concealer 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:30.820
 Maybe this month 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:33.250
 In Toka America I know ten different colors, but in this 1244 number of them in five colors in Japan 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:40.670
 It becomes a color called custard 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:44.809
 It's a little bit too hot, so it 's a hot color on the skin that I've ruled on 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.929
 Besides, of course, pink tone color or darker color 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.500
 There was to Fu that more white color stuff 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:52.750
 This is better 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.520
 Do you become a leaflet 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:00.560
 This is ten meals in all 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:02.090
 So I think that in Japan there was a color just around the middle here and there 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.380
 I will 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.460
 A Te 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:11.480
 Of course the names are similar, so I think they are understandable . 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:16.160
 I say it 's a pure pheasant tt for the nurse, it's here 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:19.370
 Compatibility with this is a batch so both today 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:25.710
 I already use it 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:29.430
 I'm just a little pokkot and I'm getting married here and the country is always dark 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:34.100
 What this week and concealer of various Mac 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.330
 Even though I'm certain I've used a variety or a concealer of Revlon 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.190
 By any means 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:55.190
 After painting 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:02:00.180
 Boo flower 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:04.100
 Take off with Dimi pom pom and familiar city 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:08.830
 Most foundation and Kedomo I just 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:14.350
 I am familiar without any boundaries 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:17.730
 Even though it has been hours since there is no feeling that the concealer has become special 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:26.299
 I am surprised such a feeling 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:26.299
 Of about not Kawan true other now be seen in the late night painted it in about noon yesterday 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.390
 In either of the apparent 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.290
 Of course each dent is a fact 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:41.180
 Even though we know it 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:45.420
 Do you see that this stain is also thinner than usual ? 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.780
 This is really going to use more and more concealer 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.069
 I stand out but 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:56.720
 In fact here like this 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:59.170
 I'm fighting tick but I'm already doing teak, for example 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.170
 this 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.099
 Put it true 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.920
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:18.010
 Recently I brushed teak again from above 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.010
 I think it's so hard to understand now because this concealer has been taken away 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:27.159
 I will 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:27.159
 You can go in at this in another all this one Toka around the around the nose of the mouth 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.569
 Yes 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.400
 How to do a little color 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:41.060
 Brightness 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:43.910
 I really use it as a concealer because it may not come 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.630
 Of course I just bought it 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.890
 I do not know If you do not take a little more using the I mean if you really say 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.569
 But 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:59.480
 It is really nice to say that as the second impression pressure to say first 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:04:01.170
 I asked this to see the color at the counter and I thought it would be a day to think about it one day 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.239
 But also 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:11.970
 Even after all what very well think that is good not to have the painted felt 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:13.860
 I returned to the world again and went to that day and bought this 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.740
 In a 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.250
 When 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:20.579
 Coverage is 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:24.300
 Medium to high- quality fab children 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:28.800
 It depends on whether you can add layers but 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:33.129
 More and more depending on the number of times the paint that 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:36.680
 That flower can go up the cash register here 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:41.870
 It seems that there is a light camouflage effect 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:46.180
 Let Deko degree of light and paint to Toka such'll Ntoko was painted 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.180
 Damage skip a guy are you stain or wrinkle 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:59.160
 It is supposed to fly the key with light 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:05:04.230
 The most effective is moisturizing skin care I like moisturizing I so dry skin 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:10.289
 Because this foundation is said to be moisturizing as a moisturizer 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:15.809
 It's also moist, so go and it wo n't dry at all 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:17.510
 Wrinkle is there is little to be or have been conspicuous use after the elapsed time 

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:19.460
 For now 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.900
 So dry skin 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.729
 From well 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.150
 Normal skin 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:29.260
 Is it kind of kind of oily skin? 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:33.210
 Because it is this two troubles 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:35.639
 By all means from normal to plain skin 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.590
 Wonder if Tari will try 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:42.540
 It is the impression of feeling say 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.540
 So much smell apart 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:51.920
 I'm not talking about this at last 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.920
 Both alcohol and parapen should be clean 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:59.330
 Synthetic fragrance nonuse parapen is free 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:09.469
 So why not try it by all means 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:11.510
