00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
technician Scyther or scissor but we're

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.540 
technician Scyther or scissor but we're
covering<00:00:46.410> Scyther<00:00:46.860> for<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.160> sake<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.370> this

video<00:00:47.820> because<00:00:48.090> it's<00:00:48.480> fast<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.260> can<00:00:49.559> equip<00:00:50.070> a

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
video because it's fast and can equip a

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.819 
video because it's fast and can equip a
choice<00:00:50.520> band<00:00:50.850> at<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.870> same<00:00:52.050> time<00:00:52.289> as<00:00:52.530> opposed

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
choice band at the same time as opposed

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.479 
choice band at the same time as opposed
to<00:00:52.920> being<00:00:53.100> slow<00:00:53.489> with<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.149> choice<00:00:54.360> band<00:00:55.489> but

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
to being slow with a choice band but

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.610 
to being slow with a choice band but
anyway<00:00:56.760> we're<00:00:57.210> fast<00:00:57.570> we<00:00:57.840> have<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.989> choice<00:00:58.260> band

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
anyway we're fast we have a choice band

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.340 
anyway we're fast we have a choice band
and<00:00:58.859> we<00:00:59.370> can<00:00:59.609> use<00:00:59.789> this<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.239> great<00:01:00.480> effect<00:01:00.629> to

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
and we can use this to great effect to

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.369 
and we can use this to great effect to
clean<00:01:01.649> up<00:01:01.920> late<00:01:02.309> game<00:01:02.730> let<00:01:03.270> me<00:01:03.390> explain<00:01:03.780> we

there we have u-turn we have Ariel a

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
switch gets the technician boost and

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.230 
switch gets the technician boost and
although<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.400> doesn't<00:01:14.549> get<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.790> technician

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
although it doesn't get the technician

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
boost we have knock off the hits even

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.789 
boost we have knock off the hits even
steel<00:01:17.729> types<00:01:18.030> because<00:01:18.299> brick<00:01:18.720> break<00:01:19.020> doesn't

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
steel types because brick break doesn't

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.609 
steel types because brick break doesn't
do<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.430> much<00:01:20.670> even<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.330> like<00:01:21.509> mega<00:01:22.080> aggron

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
do that much even the like mega aggron

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.999 
do that much even the like mega aggron
and<00:01:22.890> stuff<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:24.259> knock<00:01:25.259> off<00:01:25.439> doesn't<00:01:25.890> either

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
and stuff and knock off doesn't either

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.070 
and stuff and knock off doesn't either
but<00:01:26.490> knock<00:01:26.820> off<00:01:27.030> holds<00:01:27.330> better<00:01:27.450> utility

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
but knock off holds better utility

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.190 
but knock off holds better utility
against<00:01:28.650> like<00:01:28.860> bulky<00:01:29.310> ghost<00:01:29.549> types<00:01:30.020> Celebi

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
against like bulky ghost types Celebi

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.050 
against like bulky ghost types Celebi
well<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.560> guess<00:01:31.740> Celebi<00:01:32.130> will<00:01:32.280> die<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.729> u-turn

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
well I guess Celebi will die to a u-turn

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.060 
well I guess Celebi will die to a u-turn
but<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.509> know<00:01:33.600> what<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.750> mean<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.710> gives<00:01:34.890> good

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
but you know what I mean it gives good

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.620 
but you know what I mean it gives good

coverage it hits medic or super

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.539 
coverage it hits medic or super

blasts<00:03:42.730> so<00:03:43.199> just<00:03:44.199> go<00:03:44.349> for<00:03:44.379> fury<00:03:44.829> cutter<00:03:45.129> there

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:45.639 
blasts so just go for fury cutter there

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:47.849 
blasts so just go for fury cutter there
is<00:03:45.760> one<00:03:46.030> downside<00:03:46.540> to<00:03:46.599> this<00:03:46.840> one<00:03:47.230> downside<00:03:47.769> of

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
is one downside to this one downside of

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.650 
is one downside to this one downside of
this<00:03:47.980> move<00:03:48.160> and<00:03:48.310> that's<00:03:48.459> that<00:03:48.669> it's<00:03:48.819> not<00:03:49.060> 100%

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
this move and that's that it's not 100%

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.229 
this move and that's that it's not 100%
accurate<00:03:50.109> it's<00:03:50.530> 95<00:03:51.250> though<00:03:51.549> and<00:03:51.819> that's<00:03:51.970> as

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
accurate it's 95 though and that's as

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.990 
accurate it's 95 though and that's as
good<00:03:52.480> as<00:03:52.599> you're<00:03:52.720> gonna<00:03:52.780> get<00:03:53.079> outside<00:03:53.709> of<00:03:54.000> 100

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
good as you're gonna get outside of 100

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.309 
good as you're gonna get outside of 100
so<00:03:55.919> you<00:03:56.919> know<00:03:57.310> I<00:03:57.659> don't<00:03:58.659> think<00:03:58.930> you'll<00:03:59.049> miss

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
so you know I don't think you'll miss

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.559 
so you know I don't think you'll miss
that<00:03:59.620> much<00:03:59.859> but<00:04:00.310> I've<00:04:00.579> missed<00:04:00.819> air<00:04:01.120> slash<00:04:01.540> a

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
that much but I've missed air slash a

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.379 
that much but I've missed air slash a
lot<00:04:01.989> so<00:04:02.440> it's<00:04:02.949> totally<00:04:03.250> possible<00:04:03.400> you<00:04:04.239> could

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:04.389 
lot so it's totally possible you could

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:05.670 
lot so it's totally possible you could
all<00:04:04.510> you<00:04:04.720> know<00:04:04.810> you<00:04:04.900> can<00:04:05.079> always<00:04:05.230> run<00:04:05.530> the

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
all you know you can always run the

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.039 
all you know you can always run the
standard<00:04:06.069> bug<00:04:06.310> bite<00:04:06.579> set<00:04:06.970> or<00:04:07.510> the<00:04:07.659> bug<00:04:07.840> bite

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
standard bug bite set or the bug bite

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.439 
standard bug bite set or the bug bite
move<00:04:08.349> which<00:04:08.620> was<00:04:08.769> like<00:04:09.010> a<00:04:09.220> steady<00:04:09.340> 120<00:04:10.269> power

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:10.449 
move which was like a steady 120 power

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:13.259 
move which was like a steady 120 power
but<00:04:11.319> fury<00:04:11.769> cutter<00:04:12.040> enables<00:04:12.579> you<00:04:12.760> to<00:04:12.790> pretty

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
but fury cutter enables you to pretty

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.509 
but fury cutter enables you to pretty
much<00:04:13.479> late-game<00:04:13.840> clean<00:04:14.590> even<00:04:14.949> with

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
much late-game clean even with

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.789 
much late-game clean even with
resistances<00:04:16.359> there<00:04:16.630> I<00:04:16.840> think<00:04:17.409> the<00:04:17.530> only<00:04:17.680> thing

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
resistances there I think the only thing

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:18.990 
resistances there I think the only thing
that's<00:04:18.039> gonna<00:04:18.159> be<00:04:18.340> able<00:04:18.400> to<00:04:18.519> take<00:04:18.789> your

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
that's gonna be able to take your

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.310 
that's gonna be able to take your
physical<00:04:19.539> hits<00:04:19.750> really<00:04:20.320> well<00:04:20.709> is<00:04:20.950> gonna<00:04:21.700> be

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
physical hits really well is gonna be

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.839 
physical hits really well is gonna be
mega<00:04:23.320> aggron<00:04:23.830> if<00:04:24.039> you<00:04:24.159> get<00:04:24.310> that<00:04:24.520> out<00:04:24.639> of<00:04:24.729> the

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:24.849 
mega aggron if you get that out of the

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:25.650 
mega aggron if you get that out of the
way<00:04:25.030> you're

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
way you're

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.020 
way you're
pretty<00:04:25.780> much<00:04:25.930> good<00:04:26.200> to<00:04:26.350> go<00:04:26.620> there<00:04:27.580> is<00:04:27.700> one

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
pretty much good to go there is one

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.520 
pretty much good to go there is one
thing<00:04:28.330> though<00:04:28.630> one<00:04:29.020> thing<00:04:29.170> you<00:04:29.260> need<00:04:29.320> to<00:04:29.380> watch

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
thing though one thing you need to watch

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.230 
thing though one thing you need to watch
out<00:04:29.740> for<00:04:31.140> I'm<00:04:32.140> not<00:04:32.410> sure<00:04:32.680> if<00:04:32.950> fake-out<00:04:33.520> resets

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
out for I'm not sure if fake-out resets

out for I'm not sure if fake-out resets
the<00:04:34.450> power<00:04:34.660> of<00:04:34.990> fury<00:04:35.230> cutter<00:04:35.500> I'm<00:04:35.740> totally<00:04:36.400> not

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
the power of fury cutter I'm totally not

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.170 
the power of fury cutter I'm totally not
sure<00:04:36.880> on<00:04:37.000> that<00:04:37.320> I<00:04:38.320> would<00:04:39.010> imagine<00:04:39.280> it<00:04:39.640> duck

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
sure on that I would imagine it duck

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.720 
sure on that I would imagine it duck
doesn't<00:04:40.630> because<00:04:41.260> your<00:04:42.100> mute<00:04:42.280> you're<00:04:42.550> using

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
doesn't because your mute you're using

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.930 
doesn't because your mute you're using
the<00:04:42.910> move<00:04:43.090> in<00:04:43.210> succession<00:04:43.630> I<00:04:44.020> think<00:04:44.590> so<00:04:45.370> I

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
the move in succession I think so I

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.420 
the move in succession I think so I
don't<00:04:46.690> know<00:04:46.810> but<00:04:46.990> it<00:04:47.590> could<00:04:47.770> very<00:04:48.010> well<00:04:48.040> stop

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
don't know but it could very well stop

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.730 
don't know but it could very well stop
it<00:04:48.610> so<00:04:48.790> be<00:04:48.910> wary<00:04:49.120> of<00:04:49.180> that<00:04:49.450> one<00:04:50.380> last<00:04:50.560> thing<00:04:50.680> I

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
it so be wary of that one last thing I

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:51.990 
it so be wary of that one last thing I
want<00:04:50.890> to<00:04:50.950> cover<00:04:51.070> as<00:04:51.370> well

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
want to cover as well
