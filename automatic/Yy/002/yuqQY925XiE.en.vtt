00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.910 

Monty<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.119> going<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.449> be<00:00:18.539> driving<00:00:18.810> sine<00:00:19.650> waves

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
Monty is going to be driving sine waves

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.029 
Monty is going to be driving sine waves
into<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.430> Rubens<00:00:21.000> tube<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.930> Rubens<00:00:22.320> tube<00:00:22.410> is

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
into the Rubens tube the Rubens tube is

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.599 
into the Rubens tube the Rubens tube is
a<00:00:23.330> tube<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.109> pump<00:00:25.439> propane<00:00:25.949> into<00:00:26.369> or<00:00:26.580> a

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
a tube that you pump propane into or a

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.310 
a tube that you pump propane into or a
flammable<00:00:27.300> gas<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.960> then<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.140> have<00:00:28.289> a

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
flammable gas and then you have a

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.780 
flammable gas and then you have a
speaker<00:00:28.800> mounted<00:00:29.189> at<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.340> far<00:00:29.670> side<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.900> then

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
speaker mounted at the far side and then

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.150 
speaker mounted at the far side and then
you<00:00:32.790> get<00:00:32.910> standing<00:00:33.390> waves<00:00:33.890> and<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.010> have

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
you get standing waves and you have

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.920 
you get standing waves and you have
holes<00:00:35.430> across<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.969> time<00:00:36.180> sorry<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.840> have

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
holes across the time sorry you have

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.959 
holes across the time sorry you have
holes<00:00:37.260> across<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.800> top<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.550> propane

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
holes across the top so the propane

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.209 
holes across the top so the propane
shoots<00:00:39.270> out<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.600> top<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.020> guns<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.530> burns<00:00:40.950> and

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
shoots out of top and guns and burns and

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.090 
shoots out of top and guns and burns and
so<00:00:41.460> then<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:42.270> modify<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.920> doesn't

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
so then you modify it so that it doesn't

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.910 
so then you modify it so that it doesn't
burn<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.460> whole<00:00:44.579> machine<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.149> then<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:46.260> the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
burn the whole machine and then and the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.029 
burn the whole machine and then and the
flames<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.550> haven't<00:00:47.910> seen<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.329> yet<00:00:48.480> but<00:00:49.079> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
flames I haven't seen it yet but the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.630 
flames I haven't seen it yet but the
pressure<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.449> air<00:00:52.160> built<00:00:53.160> up<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.430> little

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
pressure of the air built up a little

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.040 
pressure of the air built up a little
bit<00:00:53.760> more<00:00:53.940> in<00:00:54.149> some<00:00:54.360> spots<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.780> less<00:00:54.899> than

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
bit more in some spots and less than

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.709 
bit more in some spots and less than
other<00:00:55.170> spots<00:00:55.469> shows<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:57.059> reflected<00:00:57.629> in

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
other spots shows you it's reflected in

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.510 
other spots shows you it's reflected in
the<00:00:57.809> height<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.170> flames<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:59.039> we<00:00:59.309> should

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
the height of the flames so we should

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.209 
the height of the flames so we should
see<00:00:59.789> is<00:01:00.000> some<00:01:00.840> kind<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.289> harmonic<00:01:01.859> pattern

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
see is some kind of a harmonic pattern

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.450 
see is some kind of a harmonic pattern
across<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.550> top<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.000> pipe<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.500> a<00:01:04.500> burning

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
across the top of the pipe and a burning

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.160 
across the top of the pipe and a burning
Barbie<00:01:06.299> bride<00:01:06.659> doll<00:01:07.250> so<00:01:08.250> here<00:01:08.549> we<00:01:08.700> go<00:01:09.020> which<00:01:10.020> is

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
Barbie bride doll so here we go which is

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.420 
Barbie bride doll so here we go which is
optional<00:01:10.590> it's<00:01:10.740> not<00:01:10.860> really<00:01:11.070> part<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.369> the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
optional it's not really part of the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.910 
optional it's not really part of the
science<00:01:11.939> yeah<00:01:12.420> well<00:01:13.049> why<00:01:13.320> she's<00:01:13.530> doing<00:01:13.799> she's

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
science yeah well why she's doing she's

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.600 
science yeah well why she's doing she's
got<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.130> big<00:01:14.280> cast<00:01:14.580> or<00:01:14.820> propane<00:01:15.240> down<00:01:15.509> here<00:01:16.610> this

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
got a big cast or propane down here this

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.810 
got a big cast or propane down here this
is<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.000> propane<00:01:18.420> she<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.140> turning<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.619> on

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
is the propane she is turning it on

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.859 
is the propane she is turning it on
someone's<00:01:20.820> going<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.090> like<00:01:21.240> something<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
someone's going to like something the

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.630 
someone's going to like something the
little<00:01:22.020> robot<00:01:22.470> who<00:01:22.770> says<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.250> look<00:01:23.400> nice

today<00:01:23.970> because<00:01:24.689> we<00:01:24.869> did

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
today because we did

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.260 
today because we did
right<00:01:26.170> like<00:01:26.830> it<00:01:27.070> just<00:01:27.700> like<00:01:27.760> starting<00:01:28.210> a

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
right like it just like starting a

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.110 
right like it just like starting a
little<00:01:28.330> fire<00:01:29.250> not<00:01:30.250> to<00:01:30.400> be<00:01:30.520> done<00:01:30.670> in<00:01:30.820> two<00:01:30.970> words

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
little fire not to be done in two words

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.730 
little fire not to be done in two words
oh<00:01:33.120> they're<00:01:34.120> okay<00:01:34.390> ready<00:01:34.690> to<00:01:34.870> see<00:01:35.050> the<00:01:35.200> shape

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
oh they're okay ready to see the shape

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.389 
oh they're okay ready to see the shape
is<00:01:36.979> changing<00:01:37.729> as<00:01:38.329> the<00:01:38.360> frequency<00:01:38.780> changes<00:01:39.649> we

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
is changing as the frequency changes we

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.039 
is changing as the frequency changes we
can<00:01:40.610> really<00:01:40.850> see<00:01:41.060> a<00:01:41.299> lot<00:01:41.390> of<00:01:41.600> complete

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
can really see a lot of complete

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.030 
can really see a lot of complete
waveforms<00:01:42.770> you<00:01:43.729> can<00:01:43.939> see<00:01:44.090> that<00:01:44.270> some<00:01:44.950> some<00:01:45.950> of

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
waveforms you can see that some some of

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.580 
waveforms you can see that some some of
these<00:01:46.390> doesn't<00:01:47.390> hit<00:01:47.570> on<00:01:47.689> so<00:01:48.020> can<00:01:48.259> you<00:01:48.350> see<00:01:48.470> it

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
these doesn't hit on so can you see it

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.060 
these doesn't hit on so can you see it
all<00:01:48.649> right<00:01:48.830> there<00:01:48.979> but<00:01:49.420> please<00:01:50.560> okay<00:01:51.560> some<00:01:51.979> of

all right there but please okay some of

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.880 
all right there but please okay some of
these<00:01:52.159> waveforms<00:01:52.930> have<00:01:55.570> have<00:01:56.570> nodes<00:01:56.929> they

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
these waveforms have have nodes they

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.179 
these waveforms have have nodes they
somehow<00:01:58.420> somehow<00:01:59.420> big<00:01:59.770> lumps<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:00.920> some<00:02:01.070> have

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
somehow somehow big lumps and some have

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.010 
somehow somehow big lumps and some have
troughs<00:02:01.549> in<00:02:01.880> different<00:02:02.479> places<00:02:02.630> along<00:02:02.960> the

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
troughs in different places along the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.060 
troughs in different places along the
play<00:02:04.689> now<00:02:05.689> I<00:02:05.750> would<00:02:06.110> think<00:02:06.320> yeah<00:02:06.590> a<00:02:06.619> little<00:02:06.979> oh

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
play now I would think yeah a little oh

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.559 
play now I would think yeah a little oh
yeah<00:02:07.369> I<00:02:07.580> don't<00:02:07.759> say<00:02:07.880> a<00:02:07.909> little<00:02:08.149> lower<00:02:08.330> you're

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
yeah I don't say a little lower you're

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:09.550 
yeah I don't say a little lower you're
going<00:02:08.720> to<00:02:08.780> get<00:02:08.869> into<00:02:09.049> the<00:02:09.170> range<00:02:09.350> of

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
going to get into the range of

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.820 
going to get into the range of
wavelengths<00:02:10.100> that<00:02:14.230> was<00:02:15.230> about<00:02:15.500> first

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
wavelengths that was about first

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.530 
wavelengths that was about first
harmonics<00:02:16.400> everyone<00:02:16.730> but<00:02:16.910> not<00:02:17.030> get<00:02:17.209> commander

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
harmonics everyone but not get commander

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.309

something in the way we're killing them
okay<00:03:17.900> this<00:03:19.030> yes<00:03:20.030> it<00:03:20.870> does<00:03:20.900> work<00:03:21.319> the<00:03:21.530> way<00:03:21.650> you
