through Maine this game probably came

through Maine this game probably came
out<00:00:26.910> because<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.869> popular<00:00:28.199> Tetris<00:00:28.949> at<00:00:29.070> the

out because of popular Tetris at the
time<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.609> was<00:00:29.880> just<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.060> puzzle<00:00:30.359> game<00:00:30.449> many<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:30.810> us

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
time I was just a puzzle game many of us

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.810 
time I was just a puzzle game many of us
know<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.769> another<00:00:31.920> puzzle<00:00:32.279> game<00:00:32.460> very

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
know this is another puzzle game very

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.130 
know this is another puzzle game very
unique<00:00:33.180> thought<00:00:33.420> I've<00:00:33.480> never<00:00:33.630> seen<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.870> puzzle

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
unique thought I've never seen a puzzle

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.840 
unique thought I've never seen a puzzle
game<00:00:34.230> quite<00:00:34.559> like<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.980> no<00:00:35.250> object<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.640> to

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
game quite like this no object is to

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.760 
game quite like this no object is to
seem<00:00:36.510> simple<00:00:36.870> now<00:00:36.989> if<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.200> suppose<00:00:37.380> effect

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
seem simple now if you suppose effect

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.459 
seem simple now if you suppose effect
one<00:00:38.460> end<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.730> pipe<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.360> energy<00:00:39.660> together<00:00:39.899> to

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
one end of pipe the energy together to

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.680 
one end of pipe the energy together to
clear<00:00:40.710> line<00:00:40.950> seems<00:00:41.309> simple<00:00:41.579> enough<00:00:41.640> but<00:00:42.570> this

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
clear line seems simple enough but this

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.200 
clear line seems simple enough but this
game<00:00:42.960> does<00:00:43.590> get<00:00:44.100> challenging<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.879> once<00:00:45.120> you

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
game does get challenging and once you

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.479 
game does get challenging and once you
clear<00:00:45.450> stage<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.649> right<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:47.070> build<00:00:47.399> this

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
clear stage on the right you build this

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.520 
clear stage on the right you build this
kind<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.030> Frankenstein<00:00:48.719> looking<00:00:49.079> character

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
kind of Frankenstein looking character

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.610 
kind of Frankenstein looking character
so<00:00:49.890> kind<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.730> an<00:00:50.820> interesting<00:00:51.120> theme<00:00:51.620> the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
so kind of an interesting theme the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.069 
so kind of an interesting theme the
stage<00:00:52.940> seems<00:00:53.940> very<00:00:54.180> easy<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.840> first

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
stage seems very easy this is the first

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.319 
stage seems very easy this is the first
stage<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.530> everybody's<00:00:55.980> nothing<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.610> but

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
stage so everybody's nothing to it but

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.420 
stage so everybody's nothing to it but
the<00:00:57.510> scheme<00:00:57.840> does<00:00:58.260> get<00:00:58.829> changed<00:00:59.250> especially

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
the scheme does get changed especially

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.150 
the scheme does get changed especially
on<00:00:59.910> over<00:01:00.149> stages<00:01:00.629> because<00:01:00.989> sometimes<00:01:01.949> we<00:01:02.070> just

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
on over stages because sometimes we just

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.189 
on over stages because sometimes we just
give<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.370> our<00:01:02.520> block<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.809> don't<00:01:03.960> give<00:01:04.080> me

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
give you our block and you don't give me

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.750 
give you our block and you don't give me
pipes<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.739> have<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.010> try<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.220> get<00:01:05.400> out<00:01:05.489> and

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
pipes and you have to try to get out and

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.910 
pipes and you have to try to get out and
a<00:01:05.880> pipe<00:01:06.119> through<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.990> think<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.680> see<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:07.830> created

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
a pipe through I think you see I created

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.780 
a pipe through I think you see I created
the<00:01:08.250> head<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:08.580> Frankenstein<00:01:09.210> lady

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
the head of this Frankenstein lady

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.039 
the head of this Frankenstein lady
so<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.850> complete<00:01:12.150> three<00:01:12.390> sparks<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:12.810> here<00:01:12.960> you

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
so I complete three sparks so here you

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.480 
so I complete three sparks so here you
go<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.530> an<00:01:13.619> example<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.189> see<00:01:14.369> how<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
go so this is an example so see how the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.030 
go so this is an example so see how the
pipe<00:01:14.790> goes<00:01:15.450> up<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.229> have<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.470> connect<00:01:16.920> that

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
pipe goes up and I have to connect that

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.420 
pipe goes up and I have to connect that
pipe<00:01:17.930> to<00:01:18.930> go<00:01:19.110> basically<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.040> what<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
pipe to go basically to the what to the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.510 
pipe to go basically to the what to the
left<00:01:20.610> now<00:01:20.840> so<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.259> does<00:01:22.560> get<00:01:22.799> challenging<00:01:22.860> in

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
left now so it does get challenging in

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.789 
left now so it does get challenging in
the<00:01:23.580> sense<00:01:23.610> now<00:01:23.909> they<00:01:24.060> do<00:01:24.119> have<00:01:24.710> circuits<00:01:25.710> that

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
the sense now they do have circuits that

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.640 
the sense now they do have circuits that
come<00:01:25.920> down<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.280> can<00:01:26.340> clear<00:01:26.869> if<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:28.049> can<00:01:28.470> kind

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
come down you can clear if you can kind

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.440 
come down you can clear if you can kind
of<00:01:28.680> start<00:01:29.009> over<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.700> speak<00:01:29.970> which<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.299> which

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
of start over so to speak which is which

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.719 
of start over so to speak which is which
is<00:01:30.479> nice<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.960> have<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.200> get<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.409> do-over<00:01:31.729> but

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
is nice and have it get a do-over but

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:33.920 
is nice and have it get a do-over but
see<00:01:32.850> how<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:32.939> just<00:01:33.000> connect<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.509> bottom<00:01:33.659> there

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
see how I just connect the bottom there

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.899 
see how I just connect the bottom there
and<00:01:34.320> then<00:01:34.950> that's<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.340> arrow<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.850> the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
and then that's the arrow this is the

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.880 
and then that's the arrow this is the
kind<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.180> do-over<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:36.869> if<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.290> messed<00:01:37.470> up<00:01:37.680> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
kind of do-over so if you messed up the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.609 
kind of do-over so if you messed up the
arrows<00:01:38.070> come<00:01:38.250> down<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:39.450> need<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.689> clears

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
arrows come down and you need to clears

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.780 
arrows come down and you need to clears
that<00:01:40.920> particular<00:01:41.369> line

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
that particular line

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.490 
that particular line
unfortunately<00:01:42.450> because<00:01:42.540> without<00:01:42.750> those<00:01:43.140> this

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
unfortunately because without those this

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.819 
unfortunately because without those this
game<00:01:43.710> would<00:01:43.860> be<00:01:43.890> nearly<00:01:44.759> impossible<00:01:45.829> so

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
game would be nearly impossible so
