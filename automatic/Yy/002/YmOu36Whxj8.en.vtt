here<00:02:06.650> we<00:02:06.770> are<00:02:06.800> getting<00:02:07.010> into<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.370> inking<00:02:07.850> a

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
here we are getting into the inking a

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.030 
here we are getting into the inking a
little<00:02:08.180> bit<00:02:08.330> and<00:02:08.540> I<00:02:08.570> like<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:09.740> thing<00:02:09.920> with

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
little bit and I like the thing with

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.040 
little bit and I like the thing with
inking<00:02:10.460> is<00:02:10.610> it's<00:02:10.850> it's<00:02:11.120> a<00:02:11.210> lot<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.420> same<00:02:11.750> thing

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
inking is it's it's a lot the same thing

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.510 
inking is it's it's a lot the same thing
I<00:02:13.570> skip<00:02:14.570> around<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:15.860> I'm<00:02:15.980> looking<00:02:16.130> I'm

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
I skip around and I'm looking I'm

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.460 
I skip around and I'm looking I'm
squinting<00:02:16.790> my<00:02:17.000> eyes<00:02:17.240> trying<00:02:17.930> to<00:02:18.050> figure<00:02:18.350> out

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
squinting my eyes trying to figure out

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.340 
squinting my eyes trying to figure out
what<00:02:18.650> needs<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:19.100> be<00:02:19.280> dark<00:02:19.640> what<00:02:19.970> needs<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.420> make

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
what needs to be dark what needs to make

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.670 
what needs to be dark what needs to make
the<00:02:21.530> drawing<00:02:21.710> pop<00:02:22.100> out<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:22.400> little<00:02:22.640> bit<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:24.470> so

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
the drawing pop out a little bit and so

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.830 
the drawing pop out a little bit and so
I'll<00:02:25.010> eat<00:02:25.850> a<00:02:25.880> little<00:02:26.120> bit<00:02:26.300> here<00:02:26.570> and<00:02:26.660> there

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
I'll eat a little bit here and there

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.750 
I'll eat a little bit here and there
move<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:27.770> the<00:02:27.860> other<00:02:27.980> side<00:02:28.250> of<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.460> character

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
move to the other side of the character

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.110 
move to the other side of the character
inked<00:02:29.270> there<00:02:29.570> and<00:02:30.470> make<00:02:31.070> my<00:02:31.190> way<00:02:31.220> basically

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
inked there and make my way basically

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.870 
inked there and make my way basically
around<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.600> figure<00:02:32.780> until<00:02:33.460> until<00:02:34.460> it<00:02:34.550> starts

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
around the figure until until it starts

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.830 
around the figure until until it starts
to<00:02:35.090> give<00:02:35.630> shape<00:02:36.020> and<00:02:36.320> form<00:02:37.300> that's<00:02:38.300> also<00:02:38.570> why<00:02:38.810> I

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
to give shape and form that's also why I

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.190 
to give shape and form that's also why I
draw<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:40.150> did<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.240> original<00:02:41.600> drawing<00:02:41.900> and

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
draw the did the original drawing and

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.170 
draw the did the original drawing and
it's<00:02:42.560> actually<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:42.950> light<00:02:43.190> blue<00:02:43.520> non-photo

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
it's actually a light blue non-photo

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.980 
it's actually a light blue non-photo
blue<00:02:44.300> pencil<00:02:45.040> I<00:02:46.040> draw<00:02:46.670> it<00:02:47.000> really<00:02:47.180> light<00:02:47.540> even

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
blue pencil I draw it really light even

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.150 
blue pencil I draw it really light even
though<00:02:48.080> you<00:02:48.140> can<00:02:48.350> barely<00:02:48.560> see<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:49.010> blue

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
though you can barely see the blue

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.650 
though you can barely see the blue
anyways

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
anyways

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.680 
anyways
that<00:02:51.170> way<00:02:51.290> it's<00:02:51.770> easier<00:02:52.160> for<00:02:52.190> me<00:02:52.460> to<00:02:52.490> to<00:02:53.360> erase

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
that way it's easier for me to to erase

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.470 
that way it's easier for me to to erase
it<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.640> redraw<00:02:56.120> it<00:02:56.360> and<00:02:56.540> go<00:02:57.050> back<00:02:57.200> over<00:02:57.560> it

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
it and and redraw it and go back over it

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.900 
it and and redraw it and go back over it
but<00:02:59.480> then<00:02:59.630> the<00:03:00.080> non-photo<00:03:00.530> blue<00:03:00.620> it<00:03:01.610> helps

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
but then the non-photo blue it helps

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.000 
but then the non-photo blue it helps
because<00:03:02.090> once<00:03:02.810> I<00:03:02.930> go<00:03:03.080> over<00:03:03.350> it<00:03:03.410> with<00:03:03.500> ink<00:03:03.740> I

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
because once I go over it with ink I

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.770 
because once I go over it with ink I
don't<00:03:04.520> have<00:03:04.670> to<00:03:04.850> erase<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.330> blue<00:03:05.510> underneath

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
don't have to erase the blue underneath

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.690 
don't have to erase the blue underneath
it<00:03:06.080> I<00:03:06.200> could<00:03:06.380> just<00:03:06.410> make<00:03:06.680> copies<00:03:07.130> and<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.550> blue

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
it I could just make copies and the blue

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.130 
it I could just make copies and the blue
doesn't<00:03:08.030> show<00:03:08.180> up<00:03:08.860> and<00:03:10.510> this<00:03:11.510> pen<00:03:11.870> that<00:03:12.050> I'm

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
doesn't show up and this pen that I'm

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.580 
doesn't show up and this pen that I'm
working<00:03:12.410> with<00:03:12.739> is<00:03:13.010> a<00:03:13.750> zebra<00:03:14.750> brush<00:03:15.080> pen<00:03:15.320> and

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
working with is a zebra brush pen and

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.880 
working with is a zebra brush pen and
it's<00:03:16.130> got<00:03:16.250> a<00:03:16.280> really<00:03:16.520> nice<00:03:16.820> narrow<00:03:17.390> tip<00:03:17.890> but

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
it's got a really nice narrow tip but

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.830 
it's got a really nice narrow tip but
it's<00:03:19.010> still<00:03:19.190> flexible<00:03:19.370> so<00:03:19.760> I<00:03:19.820> can<00:03:20.000> get<00:03:20.150> I<00:03:20.360> can

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
it's still flexible so I can get I can

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.920 
it's still flexible so I can get I can
get<00:03:21.260> good<00:03:21.770> whips<00:03:22.670> of<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.090> line<00:03:23.300> to<00:03:23.690> give<00:03:23.840> it

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
get good whips of the line to give it

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.320 
get good whips of the line to give it
that<00:03:23.959> line<00:03:24.260> variation<00:03:24.910> that<00:03:25.910> makes<00:03:26.120> it<00:03:26.209> look

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
that line variation that makes it look

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.120 
that line variation that makes it look
like<00:03:26.360> the<00:03:26.720> like<00:03:27.050> the<00:03:27.200> chin<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.770> side<00:03:27.950> of<00:03:28.070> the

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
like the like the chin the side of the

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.530 
like the like the chin the side of the
chin<00:03:28.370> is<00:03:28.550> is<00:03:28.790> a<00:03:29.209> going<00:03:29.989> from<00:03:30.290> thick<00:03:30.560> to<00:03:30.739> then

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
chin is is a going from thick to then

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.320 
chin is is a going from thick to then
gives<00:03:32.540> it<00:03:32.630> that<00:03:32.810> dynamic<00:03:33.680> shape<00:03:34.010> to<00:03:34.250> it<00:03:34.330> makes

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
gives it that dynamic shape to it makes

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.199 
gives it that dynamic shape to it makes
it<00:03:35.450> look<00:03:35.570> like<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:36.130> the<00:03:37.130> it's<00:03:37.850> a<00:03:37.970> really

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
it look like the the it's a really

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.020 
it look like the the it's a really
organic<00:03:38.950> instead<00:03:39.950> of<00:03:40.040> a<00:03:40.100> dead<00:03:40.310> line<00:03:40.550> like<00:03:40.820> you

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
organic instead of a dead line like you

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.110 
organic instead of a dead line like you
get<00:03:41.300> with<00:03:41.450> a<00:03:41.480> mechanical<00:03:42.380> pen<00:03:42.700> like<00:03:43.700> a<00:03:43.730> micron

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
get with a mechanical pen like a micron

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.729 
get with a mechanical pen like a micron
pigma<00:03:44.540> or<00:03:44.810> a<00:03:44.840> faber<00:03:45.590> castell<00:03:46.010> pencil<00:03:46.489> and<00:03:47.739> it

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
pigma or a faber castell pencil and it

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.140 
pigma or a faber castell pencil and it
gives<00:03:48.950> you<00:03:49.070> a<00:03:49.130> much<00:03:49.310> more<00:03:49.550> dynamic

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
gives you a much more dynamic

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.490 
gives you a much more dynamic
organic<00:03:51.019> sort<00:03:51.560> of<00:03:51.650> line<00:03:52.480> variation<00:03:53.510> it<00:03:53.989> makes

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
organic sort of line variation it makes

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.840 
organic sort of line variation it makes
your<00:03:54.620> drawings<00:03:54.830> a<00:03:55.010> lot<00:03:55.130> more<00:03:55.280> energetic<00:03:55.640> and

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
your drawings a lot more energetic and

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.199 
your drawings a lot more energetic and
exciting

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
exciting
