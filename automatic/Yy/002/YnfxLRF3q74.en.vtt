impression was that it sounded
completely<00:01:42.210> different<00:01:42.570> than<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.840> first

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
completely different than the first

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.380 
completely different than the first
model<00:01:43.530> still<00:01:44.220> not<00:01:44.399> really<00:01:44.579> sure<00:01:44.700> why<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.119> is

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
model still not really sure why that is

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.660 
model still not really sure why that is
but<00:01:45.810> within<00:01:46.439> four<00:01:46.710> or<00:01:46.740> five<00:01:47.009> days<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.430> putting

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
but within four or five days of putting

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.030 
but within four or five days of putting
this<00:01:47.790> one<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.030> place<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.290> stop<00:01:49.619> brewing

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040

little spot right there you put the lid
down<00:03:49.410> and<00:03:50.010> what<00:03:50.190> you're<00:03:50.340> going<00:03:50.460> to<00:03:50.490> see<00:03:50.730> now<00:03:50.910> is

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
down and what you're going to see now is

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.620 
down and what you're going to see now is
you<00:03:51.330> can<00:03:51.360> select<00:03:51.840> your<00:03:52.350> coffee<00:03:53.300> based<00:03:54.300> on<00:03:54.510> the

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
you can select your coffee based on the

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.510 
you can select your coffee based on the
number<00:03:54.930> that<00:03:55.080> should<00:03:55.380> be<00:03:55.500> on<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.800> k-cup<00:03:56.010> and

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
number that should be on the k-cup and

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.010 
number that should be on the k-cup and
this<00:03:56.940> is<00:03:57.120> where<00:03:57.300> I<00:03:57.330> think<00:03:57.450> some<00:03:57.870> of<00:03:57.900> the

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
this is where I think some of the

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.660 
this is where I think some of the
features<00:03:58.380> are<00:03:58.560> really<00:03:58.590> poorly<00:03:59.250> implemented

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
features are really poorly implemented

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.080 
features are really poorly implemented

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
you want it's set up to brew strong and

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.789 
you want it's set up to brew strong and

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
a 10 ounce cup and then you hit brew

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:20.450 
a 10 ounce cup and then you hit brew
without<00:04:16.799> this<00:04:17.010> in<00:04:17.280> place<00:04:18.680> you<00:04:19.680> can't<00:04:19.979> access

without this in place you can't access

without this in place you can't access

out<00:04:23.010> strong

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
out strong

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.740 
out strong
it's<00:04:24.139> just<00:04:24.530> one<00:04:24.860> to<00:04:25.669> brew<00:04:26.650> so<00:04:27.650> why<00:04:28.599> would<00:04:29.599> it

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
it's just one to brew so why would it

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.969 
it's just one to brew so why would it
take<00:04:30.160> three<00:04:31.160> steps<00:04:31.610> to<00:04:32.110> get<00:04:33.110> to<00:04:33.289> a<00:04:33.319> favorite

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
take three steps to get to a favorite

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:42.040 
take three steps to get to a favorite
one<00:04:36.220> two<00:04:38.020> three<00:04:39.020> and<00:04:39.319> then<00:04:40.250> brew<00:04:40.690> when<00:04:41.690> I<00:04:41.750> could

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
one two three and then brew when I could

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.650 
one two three and then brew when I could
do<00:04:42.199> the<00:04:42.380> exact<00:04:42.830> same<00:04:42.949> thing<00:04:43.490> off<00:04:44.090> the

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
do the exact same thing off the

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.120 
do the exact same thing off the
favorites<00:04:45.169> list<00:04:45.259> with<00:04:46.250> one<00:04:46.330> two<00:04:47.330> brew<00:04:48.259> so<00:04:49.069> I

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
favorites list with one two brew so I

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.580 
favorites list with one two brew so I
think<00:04:49.190> that's<00:04:49.430> a<00:04:49.520> shortcoming<00:04:50.030> a<00:04:50.270> form

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
think that's a shortcoming a form

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.189 
think that's a shortcoming a form
implementation<00:04:51.849> of<00:04:52.849> the<00:04:53.270> software<00:04:53.449> that<00:04:54.020> runs

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199 
implementation of the software that runs

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.980 
implementation of the software that runs
the<00:04:54.470> device<00:04:54.800> but<00:04:55.400> nonetheless<00:04:55.580> you<00:04:56.210> can<00:04:56.630> get

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
the device but nonetheless you can get

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.659 
the device but nonetheless you can get
there<00:04:57.229> you<00:04:57.560> can<00:04:57.740> brew<00:04:57.889> a<00:04:57.919> nice<00:04:58.130> cup<00:04:58.370> of<00:04:58.400> coffee

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
there you can brew a nice cup of coffee

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:00.730 
there you can brew a nice cup of coffee
so<00:04:59.300> let's<00:04:59.509> take<00:04:59.720> a<00:04:59.750> quick<00:04:59.960> listen<00:05:00.259> at<00:05:00.500> what<00:05:00.530> it

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
so let's take a quick listen at what it

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.710 
so let's take a quick listen at what it
sounds<00:05:01.099> like<00:05:01.190> we<00:05:01.789> put<00:05:02.030> our<00:05:02.150> coffee<00:05:02.389> cup

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
sounds like we put our coffee cup

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.469 
sounds like we put our coffee cup
underneath<00:05:03.669> we're<00:05:04.669> going<00:05:04.880> with<00:05:05.030> a<00:05:05.090> 10<00:05:05.330> out

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
underneath we're going with a 10 out

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:07.420 
underneath we're going with a 10 out
strong<00:05:05.870> cup<00:05:06.199> and<00:05:06.409> I'm<00:05:06.770> just<00:05:06.949> gonna<00:05:07.069> let<00:05:07.370> this

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
strong cup and I'm just gonna let this

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.620 
strong cup and I'm just gonna let this
brew<00:05:08.199> so<00:05:09.199> that<00:05:09.319> you<00:05:09.470> can<00:05:09.620> hear<00:05:09.830> the<00:05:09.949> machine<00:05:10.630> we

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
brew so that you can hear the machine we

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.149 
brew so that you can hear the machine we
got<00:05:11.659> a<00:05:11.780> couple<00:05:12.020> of<00:05:12.169> laps<00:05:12.409> out<00:05:12.710> of<00:05:12.830> this<00:05:12.949> it

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:13.159 
got a couple of laps out of this it

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:24.010 
got a couple of laps out of this it
sounds<00:05:13.340> to<00:05:13.610> me<00:05:13.729> like<00:05:13.759> frogs<00:05:14.270> in<00:05:14.509> a<00:05:14.569> pond<00:05:23.020> it's

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
sounds to me like frogs in a pond it's

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.140 
sounds to me like frogs in a pond it's
not<00:05:24.199> the<00:05:24.349> fastest<00:05:24.830> brew<00:05:25.039> in<00:05:25.159> the<00:05:25.250> world<00:05:25.430> but<00:05:26.030> it

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
not the fastest brew in the world but it

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.510 
not the fastest brew in the world but it
does<00:05:26.330> do<00:05:26.509> an<00:05:26.659> adequate<00:05:27.110> job<00:05:27.349> compared<00:05:28.280> to<00:05:28.400> the

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
does do an adequate job compared to the

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.610 
does do an adequate job compared to the
Cuisinart<00:05:29.090> that<00:05:29.270> I<00:05:29.300> had<00:05:29.539> before<00:05:29.750> this<00:05:30.139> one<00:05:30.409> I

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
Cuisinart that I had before this one I

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.089 
Cuisinart that I had before this one I
spent<00:05:31.219> $200<00:05:32.030> on<00:05:32.060> the<00:05:32.479> Cuisinart<00:05:33.050> it<00:05:33.440> lasted<00:05:33.979> me

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
spent $200 on the Cuisinart it lasted me

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.279 
spent $200 on the Cuisinart it lasted me
two<00:05:34.340> and<00:05:34.490> a<00:05:34.550> half<00:05:34.729> years<00:05:35.120> and<00:05:35.360> really<00:05:35.990> I<00:05:36.020> didn't

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:36.289 
two and a half years and really I didn't

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:38.290 
two and a half years and really I didn't
have<00:05:36.440> any<00:05:36.560> problems<00:05:37.070> with<00:05:37.310> it<00:05:37.340> until<00:05:37.639> the<00:05:38.150> day

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
have any problems with it until the day

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.010 
have any problems with it until the day
it<00:05:38.479> died

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
it died

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.659 
it died
we<00:05:39.259> ended<00:05:39.500> up<00:05:39.590> having<00:05:39.650> addy<00:05:40.130> scale<00:05:40.460> it<00:05:40.610> a

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
we ended up having addy scale it a

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:42.459 
we ended up having addy scale it a
couple<00:05:40.880> of<00:05:41.030> times<00:05:41.300> but<00:05:41.659> you<00:05:41.930> know<00:05:42.259> there<00:05:42.380> is

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:42.469 
couple of times but you know there is

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:44.140 
couple of times but you know there is
some<00:05:42.650> hardware<00:05:43.099> around<00:05:43.250> here<00:05:43.639> so<00:05:43.820> that's<00:05:44.030> not

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
some hardware around here so that's not

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.820 
some hardware around here so that's not
a<00:05:44.659> surprise

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
a surprise

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.270 
a surprise
but<00:05:46.400> I<00:05:46.430> was<00:05:46.669> shocked<00:05:47.030> that<00:05:47.530> with<00:05:48.530> never<00:05:48.979> having

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
but I was shocked that with never having

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.300 
but I was shocked that with never having
to<00:05:49.460> clean<00:05:49.699> the<00:05:50.150> needles<00:05:50.539> on<00:05:50.810> my<00:05:50.870> Cuisinart<00:05:51.710> why

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
to clean the needles on my Cuisinart why

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.430 
to clean the needles on my Cuisinart why
would<00:05:52.550> I<00:05:52.580> have<00:05:52.789> to<00:05:52.849> clean<00:05:53.449> the<00:05:53.630> needles<00:05:53.960> on<00:05:54.229> the

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
would I have to clean the needles on the

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.050 
would I have to clean the needles on the
brand-new<00:05:54.740> cure<00:05:55.069> a<00:05:55.130> gave<00:05:55.400> every<00:05:55.729> three<00:05:55.969> to

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
brand-new cure a gave every three to

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.270 
brand-new cure a gave every three to
five<00:05:56.240> brews<00:05:56.599> but<00:05:57.259> that<00:05:57.409> seems<00:05:57.680> to<00:05:57.800> be<00:05:57.919> the<00:05:58.159> way

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
five brews but that seems to be the way
