Nova 6 crawlers they have the green pus
they<00:01:47.040> are<00:01:47.220> really<00:01:47.490> demented<00:01:48.060> because<00:01:48.270> they

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
they are really demented because they

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.700 
they are really demented because they
have<00:01:48.540> all<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.780> time<00:01:48.840> they<00:01:49.259> spent<00:01:49.500> and

basically what we get is kino der toten
with<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.590> Nazis<00:01:53.070> Canada<00:01:54.060> token<00:01:54.560> is<00:01:55.560> basically

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
with the Nazis Canada token is basically

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.990 
with the Nazis Canada token is basically
a<00:01:56.240> testing<00:01:57.240> lab<00:01:57.390> where<00:01:58.049> they<00:01:58.200> basically<00:01:58.320> had

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
a testing lab where they basically had

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.679 
a testing lab where they basically had
Max's<00:02:00.000> early<00:02:00.270> developments<00:02:00.990> for<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.680> basic

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
Max's early developments for the basic

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.539 
Max's early developments for the basic
zombies<00:02:03.689> because<00:02:04.409> we<00:02:04.710> get<00:02:04.829> this<00:02:04.979> because<00:02:05.340> we

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
zombies because we get this because we

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.760 
zombies because we get this because we
have<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:06.240> green<00:02:06.540> canisters<00:02:07.079> for<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.350> Nova<00:02:07.560> 6

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
have the green canisters for the Nova 6

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.859 
have the green canisters for the Nova 6
crawlers<00:02:08.280> we<00:02:08.879> have<00:02:09.119> all<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.479> sort<00:02:09.780> of

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
crawlers we have all that sort of

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.420 
crawlers we have all that sort of
information<00:02:10.229> pointing<00:02:10.830> towards<00:02:11.099> that<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.310> was

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
information pointing towards that it was

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.170 
information pointing towards that it was
a<00:02:11.459> testing<00:02:11.879> lab<00:02:12.060> for<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.540> not

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
a testing lab for the not

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.140 
a testing lab for the not
Richthofen<00:02:14.180> him<00:02:14.420> access<00:02:14.980> so<00:02:15.980> basically<00:02:16.820> we

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
Richthofen him access so basically we

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.060 
Richthofen him access so basically we
get<00:02:17.330> that<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.570> Nova<00:02:17.990> 6<00:02:18.200> crawlers<00:02:18.530> or<00:02:18.620> that<00:02:18.860> and

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
get that the Nova 6 crawlers or that and

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.060 
get that the Nova 6 crawlers or that and
now<00:02:19.220> basically<00:02:19.610> when<00:02:19.910> you're<00:02:20.030> there<00:02:20.360> uh<00:02:21.070> since

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
now basically when you're there uh since

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.220 
now basically when you're there uh since
its<00:02:22.220> 1960<00:02:22.850> since<00:02:23.030> they<00:02:23.180> teleported<00:02:23.750> there's

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
its 1960 since they teleported there's

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.800 
its 1960 since they teleported there's
the<00:02:24.380> urban<00:02:24.680> area<00:02:25.010> and<00:02:25.280> it<00:02:25.670> shows<00:02:25.970> that<00:02:26.300> it's<00:02:26.510> so

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
the urban area and it shows that it's so

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.980 
the urban area and it shows that it's so
modern<00:02:27.440> you're<00:02:28.310> wondering<00:02:28.730> why<00:02:29.330> they<00:02:29.660> are

in the maps they all get older

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.590 
in the maps they all get older
recovering<00:03:07.670> as<00:03:07.790> more<00:03:07.970> of<00:03:08.060> a<00:03:08.120> gray<00:03:08.360> hair

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600

character some people thought that it
might<00:04:08.959> be<00:04:09.110> Max's<00:04:09.560> but<00:04:10.010> why<00:04:10.250> would<00:04:10.520> they<00:04:10.670> have

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
might be Max's but why would they have

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.580 
might be Max's but why would they have
four<00:04:11.090> portraits<00:04:11.510> of<00:04:11.720> those<00:04:11.930> people<00:04:12.410> there

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
four portraits of those people there

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.280 
four portraits of those people there
were<00:04:12.800> they<00:04:12.950> heroes<00:04:13.480> my<00:04:14.480> opinions<00:04:14.870> are<00:04:15.050> that

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
were they heroes my opinions are that

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.750 
were they heroes my opinions are that
though<00:04:15.560> they<00:04:15.890> have<00:04:16.010> those<00:04:16.130> four<00:04:16.370> portraits

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
though they have those four portraits

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.760 
though they have those four portraits
sort<00:04:17.540> of<00:04:17.660> as<00:04:17.810> because<00:04:18.170> they're<00:04:18.350> heroes

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:18.770 
sort of as because they're heroes

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.710 
sort of as because they're heroes
because<00:04:19.040> people<00:04:19.790> could<00:04:19.910> say<00:04:20.090> that<00:04:20.299> they<00:04:20.420> saved

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
because people could say that they saved

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.780 
because people could say that they saved
the<00:04:20.900> war<00:04:21.140> and<00:04:22.070> that<00:04:22.130> they<00:04:22.340> were<00:04:22.400> developing

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
the war and that they were developing

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.370 
the war and that they were developing
all<00:04:23.120> these<00:04:23.150> cool<00:04:23.479> things<00:04:23.540> but<00:04:23.990> we<00:04:24.110> don't<00:04:24.260> know

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
all these cool things but we don't know

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
all these cool things but we don't know
but

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
but

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.310 
but
who<00:04:25.729> knows<00:04:25.970> what<00:04:26.210> those<00:04:26.330> missing<00:04:26.780> patrons<00:04:27.169> I

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
personally think that the black portrait

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.170 
personally think that the black portrait
was<00:04:30.139> supposed<00:04:30.500> to<00:04:30.680> be<00:04:30.860> Peter<00:04:31.729> but<00:04:32.000> Peter

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
was supposed to be Peter but Peter
