00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.869
 I greet you friends Pavel Shakira 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.630
 microphone and as you know relatively 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:22.210
 recently on until gta 5 came out which caused 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.460
 for a bunch of vidos on youtube but ours 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.690
 tastes are very specific if you 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.760
 understand what I mean 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.160
 so for you, I found a new one 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.529
 portion of elite video content shkoloty 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.600
 benefit of their dirty little hands with impatience 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.670
 grabbed the camera phone and gnarled 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.350
 bandicam all to teach us 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:43.350
 play gta 5 in general drove 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.350
 compressors 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:55.179
 author or sing again at it gently 

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:57.549
 it is said to compare only what is possible only 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:59.469
 with this unexpected car came up 

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:02.440
 teenagers knocked on the window 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.780
 Sergey lowered the glass and immediately got 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.850
 spitting in the face is similar to watering in the face 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.950
 he could just show an overview of this 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.050
 schoolboy I'm sure that this man right 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.420
 I would drive in a fit with foam 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.430
 at the mouth also adds a special flavor 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.990
 red font that says 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.240
 us that the next review will be 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.700
 better but as they say hunchbacked not 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.560
 the next video fixes a grave 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.390
 no longer hear 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.390
 our young funny 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.530
 bracelet without 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.700
 what are you here for now show how you are 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.700
 there won't be much difference 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.549
 Ukraine su-100 know such a feeling 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.619
 like he does us a favor by saying 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.659
 removes his review as if I alone and 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.969
 I do what am waiting for another masterpiece on his 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.939
 channel but everything turned out to be much easier 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:00.250
 should n't can talk but if you 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.750
 shut up that will not be better because 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.849
 your videos look like after 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:10.979
 two weeks rubbing myself in the eyes 

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:10.979
 laundry soap I watched his reviews 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.209
 in of course and burn on that case 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.040
 America 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.110
 what a great thing you decided to read 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.610
 subtitles himself would never be able to 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.459
 do because in order to 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.060
 you must read them at least 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.340
 magnifying glass 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.110
 just look at these letters like 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.299
 as if rubbed with sandpaper 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.519
 some very hard carpenter 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.980
 possible as old grandfather overclocked 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:41.519
 the quality of his video on the other here especially 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.519
 nothing to say see for yourself they 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.599
 what are you talking about hell is it 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.549
 I ask this question in moments when 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.709
 though he says anything at it and 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.720
 it is difficult to call it speech in a normal 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.940
 man at least for the rest 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.130
 time he is just silent I would show you 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.650
 these moments but you are going crazy 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.760
 go mad with boredom because silence 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.760
 then their madness 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:32.040
 if this local product lines were not 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:34.110
 pass making a review sunny he said 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.269
 after ten minutes Galimov letspleya 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.610
 By the way, you get a great overview. 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.379
 buddy the only thing that I learned so it 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.810
 the name of this game at the very beginning 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:45.060
 that I knew everything else without you 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.160
 slurred moo silence of what are you 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.440
 decided that your review someone needs well 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.390
 except me naturally on youtube already 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.549
 a whole bunch of cool reviews from uncles with 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.840
 voices like dogged actors and diction 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.840
 like leading radio 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.290
 noticed what he mumbled at the end 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.209
 request to put him like 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.340
 as if he knew that instead of a finger 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.650
 up in will meet the fires of the Inquisition to 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.620
 Unfortunately, the review ends here but 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:18.780
 never mind i found something else hello 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:21.419
 Glebchik with you 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:26.100
 and still endless pauses between the inscriptions 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:28.380
 and this is gta v 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.330
 and still it is insanity to write 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.639
 colorful font that you can 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.380
 say but the good of the author of this video 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.270
 just enough for a few 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.880
 the footprints of them at the end 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.840
 in the end, I would not want 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.160
 rant and read morals 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.289
 instead I'll just take advantage 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.389
 immortal phrase from the movie jay 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:49.760
 silent bob need to tear these 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.760
 schoolchildren spends long upward ass 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:05:10.879

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.879
