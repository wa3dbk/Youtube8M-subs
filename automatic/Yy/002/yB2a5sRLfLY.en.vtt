00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.670
 for us women have a 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.500
 legs of them is not only a matter of 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.050
 aesthetic but that can help us 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.670
 strengthen our self-esteem that's why 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.680
 that this time I prepare a routine that 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.869
 It is great to tone your legs 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.730
 and the best thing is that it can be done at home 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.800
 as long as we have 15 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.210
 minutes a day I invite you to discover it 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.210
 in the section begin 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.200
 besides now you have some legs 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.120
 plump and thin legs or well 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.400
 they already have them thin and what they want 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.080
 is to have muscle mass for all 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.660
 cases and the exercises that I'm going to 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.220
 show the only thing they need is a pair 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.470

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:51.350

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.859
 desire to achieve beautiful legs 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.640
 we started this routine with rudeness 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:57.620
 holding the dumbbells to the 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.690
 sides take the right leg towards 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.339
 forward and bending in such a way 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.649
 both legs are at an angle of 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.920
 90 degrees although the back should not 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:09.310
 touching the floor your back should stay 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.710
 straight 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.930
 return to the starting position and repeat 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.530
 the exercise do it later with the 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.530

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.609
 of the feet and we repeat 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.180
 to finish we take out the tips of the 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.550
