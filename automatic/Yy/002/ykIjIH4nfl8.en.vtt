00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.920
 two 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.290
 Tell me what it means more 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.440
 for you 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:14.350
 totally a great institution in the 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.470
 which I come with many illusions of 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.019
 defend the deaths 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.369
 and be able to stay many years until 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:24.090
 Now that you have seemed to live in the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.320
 Mexico City pretty well we have 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.509
 left because for this issue be 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.529
 concentrated for training but he tried 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.509
 so cute 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.669
 many many things people have 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:35.010
 treated well so I go pretty well 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.239
 after nine years still strange 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.379
 Argentina is strange things the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.690
 family parents my brothers 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.699
 they really are things that a strange one already 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.159
 Although as I say nothing more than nine 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.229
 years that does not change anything or in time 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:55.210
 or anything that is what you remember most about 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:57.879
 your stay in santos lagoon 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.000
 many things the truth that they were six 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:04.590
 really important years but then you 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.690
 I said just take friends 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.880
 the power to return and that court or that 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.800
 be with another shirt and receive the 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.509
 love not only the people in the 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.759
 court but from the same people who 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.190
 works there for one is the most 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.780
 gratifying that there is I do not know which could 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.000
 be one of the most important moments 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.160
 of your career 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.800
 in having come out champion I think for 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.750
 all play about for prisoners and the 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.020
 more difficult 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.390
 when 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.369
 I had to have an operation on my knee, it has never 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.979
 gone from being injured for a while 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:43.640
 It was not much, but if it really was 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.640
 complicated within everyone 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:52.259
 and apart from the session your friends the 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.950
 family friends friends and family 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:59.340
 from manuel they call me daniel 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.829
 we are more more liberal with that hey you 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.420
 stylist is always the same and 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.570
 anyone can be that cut of meat 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.090
 the same the same 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.229
 this same about how long you take 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.310
 making you the cut 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.390
 30 minutes every 7 days every 7 how 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.620
 days 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:24.569
 and is never think about changing the look 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.819
 that you have cabals I do not believe only in 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.560
 God though what do you do before each 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.720
 match 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.670
 ask God that leave a party 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.830
 healthy that all players who are 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.150
 within the field of play can not give 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.830
 no lesson or anything bad and that 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.290
 that above all things ask them 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.450
 that covers us all and that there is not 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.910
 no injured as much of my team as 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.990
 of the other team which progresses meters 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.200
 for arrivals 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.960
 be sincere and one of your faults is not 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.610
 know how to say no, finally, if not 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:05.830
 you were a footballer that would be 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.830
 very difficult or I do not know how to do anything 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:16.360
 another sport I do not like to see yes but 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.580
 do it then out there if I would focus 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.280
 in some in something else if not 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.310
 would have been a favorite could be in this 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.310
 moment
