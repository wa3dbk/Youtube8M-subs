00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.120
 talking about 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.070
 progressive hair dyeing 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.260
 organic mood of the day 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.960
 attachment large external should be 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.720

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.820
 more healthy and they will answer you exactly 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.710
 beauty long silky hair 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.410
 always attracted attention 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.750
 the opposite sex but snag in 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.360
 our time is that this hair in 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.670
 most cases, its extensions 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.379
 which is not only not very natural 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.829
 look upon closer inspection 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:42.360
 and we spoil our own 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.059
 solemn occasions when we 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.200
 need hairstyle jackets and overhead 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.460
 hair is justified 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.200
 we talk about daily condition and condition 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:56.300
 mosque please that hair is slow 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:01:00.540
 grow split and thin but there is a solution 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.840
 transition to organic care staining 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.759
 each will be a kind of care and 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.890
 the results will not take long 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.560
 the fact that the hair is a modern woman 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.799
 must look decent every day and 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.990
 my new find is napura paint 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.030
 it contains oil 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.740
 mineral micro pigment in this way 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.490
 is created 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.280
 synergy of unique essential oils and 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.049
 by this and micro pigment 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.780
 we get a great color and gentle 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:32.210
 effects on the skin and hair during 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.020
 the staining smell is very nice that 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.670
 talks about the naturalness of the component 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.580
 ammonia free bleach powder for 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.710
 lightening any degree does not hurt 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.899
 herat new hair structure from 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.530
 staining before staining color is very 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:51.770
 resistant and sparkling in general 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.500
 the benefits of hair alone and 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.209
 the growth rate I am very happy and very 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.040
 the main thing is that my hair is red 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:01.590
 becomes more healthy and beautiful 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.520
 and honestly I forgot what 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:09.270
 split ends and washed color think 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.490
