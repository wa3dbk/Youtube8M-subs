00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.440
 hi guys all right with you and 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.509
 wild or less a video here 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.620
 to tag the secret life of a 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.330
 youtube here just to do this there was 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.460
 beautiful wonderful political roberta 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.739
 disease so do not know she said good 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.300
 there watched vision is very cool and if not 

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:20.399
 I'm wrong, the santa is already very old in the 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.829
 youtube ers it seems that who made the 

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:25.199
 first time among the ghetto people was 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:28.229
 marin and transit here Brazil was pro 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.029
 the name of ifri then them down here 

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:32.309
 let's start thinking two questions and 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.899
 This is the first question for how long ago 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.510
 time you're an insult to brewster 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.929
 first video on youtube on the 21st of 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.480
 May 2013 has 47 been so to the already are 

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:44.129
 almost two years when you think it will 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.440
 stop making videos I sincerely 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.390
 I do not know when will I stop having 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.160
 want to make videos more while 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.050
 I feel good, I'll be doing it and I'll do it. 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.489
 I'm in the mood to make a joint effort in 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.320
 total in the weather but I will continue 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.179
 I do not have plans to stop by 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.199
 while what is the best thing about being a 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:00:59.519
 insult beer 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.019
 I think it's best to be here in 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.269
 community is meeting new people 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.799
 people who have the same tastes as the 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:06.630
 people who do not have the 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.820
 same tastes but we also learn 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.649
 to like the things they like me 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.990
 I think this is pretty cool and what's the worst 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:15.479
 What do you do for a living? 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.909
 I think the worst thing and highlight is the 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.469
 stress of comments to respond 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.689
 video to show with a certain 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:23.549
 even if you do not have ex days 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.780
 betting on biodiesel still has a 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.210
 a frequency of at least one week 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.539
 to think in and I think bc is 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.700
 This is interesting and it's boring, but I 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.710
 I tried not to call so much for this, I have to 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.689
 do when you want when I'm around 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.549
 Will to do as I really do not 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.380
 I had nothing to do and I felt that I 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.090
 I do so I will do the animal is a 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.009
 I like it a lot but I do not like 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.049
 I express myself more or less many photos 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.689
 you usually take the thumbnail from the 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.979
 video I usually do not take boxing 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.840
 for the video thumbnail I had a 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.850
 print from some part of the video that I 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.490
 I think it's cool, my face is very cool. 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.950
 so I do but sometimes 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.420
 When I'm reviewing the hospital, I 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.010
 photo with the book but it 's not much 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.510
 frequent 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.970
 obviously I'll take photos for 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.950
 and I did not even remember that because 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.090
 Do you have a crush here on youtube? 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.800
 when someone takes this into account in 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.900
 The first person that comes to my mind is 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.520
 Why are you with the docs and me girls ? 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.080
 I will go through probably 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.030
 You'll never see this video but it's mine. 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.070
 soul mate to fall in love with her since 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.780
 who discovered the video of them we are going to 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.480
 wonderful and of course there are 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.930
 people here Brazilian pilot but let's 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.790
 leave it off, right? 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.830
 what else in October would you like 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.360
 make a video I have a lot of desire to 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.880
 make a video with the band is acting 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.500
 how did it go because she is mine too 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.210
 soul mate and also how many women 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.130
 Christians that I know here by 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.750
 the first people I knew and it is 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.320
 very cool so I really wanted to make a 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.750
 video with her the dog with what you 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.720
 is wearing the waist down is 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.760
 change because I'm the devil at home 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.770
 how long does it take for you to really 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.470
 starts to record I think the 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.440
 least 40 mind I'll go take a shower and then 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.120
 then I fix this thing here to 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.280
 stand in front of my business 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.810
 lamps and I have to take it well because 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.890
 do not stay with kalou that I have to see 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.110
 everything I have to do right 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.430
 I think this gives a 40 minutes more 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.260
 or at least an hour I do not know how long 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.850
 but it's more or less that takes a while 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.530
 bit right because we have to 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.470
 prepare because if not video 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.690
 would be worse looks right as you 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.090
 feel about the community or culture of 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.180
 youtube look I think what we people 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.010
 do it here in the club at least it's cool 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.230
 because we how to achieve our 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.180
 read and maybe cool because I 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.070
 I have already spoken to people who 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.840
 came a lion makes books for half an hour 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.780
 So I think this is a cool part. 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.310
 to do this in addition to talking to 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.530
 people and discuss the opinions 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.720
 everything we read I intend to stay 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.040
 here for quite some time I do not know how much 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.720
 time the place but I hope it lasts 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.090
 enough and also the feedback that I 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.970
 I have to continue because that's what 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.160
 keep the live channel what your secret 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.080
 for a channel success is not that I am 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.480
 an expert ti but I think the first 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.400
 thing you have to do to have a 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.950
 channel success doing what you want not 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.640
 asks for help from people of the 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.410
 Hi, how are you? 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.780
 I should dig, will I tell you about 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.400
 This book will make me tag this. 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.350
 What should I do? I think 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.690
 You have to research what you want. 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.730
 to do you do the way you want 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.640
 Why do you want it and I think it's this? 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.770
 that will move the channel I think you 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.160
 you can access it so you will not 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.720
 doin 'your videos due to 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.970
 other person you have to do the 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.250
 videos mainly for you because it is 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.070
 boring to be here making the virus to 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.450
 other people when they will not 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.860
 watch so soon then first 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.720
 I do not know why you think it's 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.580
 It's best not to beg for help at all. 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.890
 world do not watch your channel on the 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.750
 video of the others I do not ask for there and 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.370
 do not be asking to share 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.020
 the video is not asking you to watch on 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.030
 your video simply share you 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.830
 have facebook page share it 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.630
 Do you want to call people to enjoy? 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.940
 your page with facebook life needs 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.380
 stay on the link all the time if you want 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.180
 seal sharing these things 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.190
 share on your social networks but 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.990
 not dig a video of a person left 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.880
 link there asking you to watch your 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.440
 video because this is very annoying and I do not 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.030
 I want you to do it with me, I think 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.919
 I never did it for sure not 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.810
 I think I do not like it but at least not 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.910
 does these things and I think it will 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.740
 all right for you and the last question is 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.050
 who are you sending me will I say 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.400

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.900
 breathe because I think not yet 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.330

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.760

 book motto if you do not make a tag for 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.540
