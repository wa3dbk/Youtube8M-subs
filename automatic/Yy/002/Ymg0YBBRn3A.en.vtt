going<00:00:49.579> to<00:00:49.640> have<00:00:49.910> I<00:00:50.180> also<00:00:50.360> rigged<00:00:50.690> up<00:00:50.780> a<00:00:50.899> little

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
going to have I also rigged up a little

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.690 
going to have I also rigged up a little
fan<00:00:51.379> that<00:00:51.620> hooks<00:00:51.829> in<00:00:51.980> here<00:00:52.160> that<00:00:52.309> keeps<00:00:52.520> the

fan that hooks in here that keeps the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.310 
fan that hooks in here that keeps the
area<00:00:52.940> cool<00:00:53.239> and<00:00:53.480> keeps<00:00:53.629> air<00:00:53.809> circulation

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
area cool and keeps air circulation

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.130 
area cool and keeps air circulation
going<00:00:55.090> this<00:00:56.090> is<00:00:56.270> the<00:00:56.300> eyepiece<00:00:56.750> I'm<00:00:56.960> probably

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
going this is the eyepiece I'm probably

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.840 
going this is the eyepiece I'm probably
going<00:00:57.350> to<00:00:57.410> be<00:00:57.500> using<00:00:57.890> for<00:00:57.920> initial

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
going to be using for initial

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.150 
going to be using for initial
acquisition<00:00:59.030> this<00:00:59.899> is<00:01:00.079> a<00:01:00.110> wide<00:01:00.350> field<00:01:00.590> 42

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
acquisition this is a wide field 42

acquisition this is a wide field 42
millimeter<00:01:01.610> eyepiece<00:01:01.820> but<00:01:02.690> when<00:01:02.870> you're

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
millimeter eyepiece but when you're

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:04.450 
millimeter eyepiece but when you're
actually<00:01:03.140> when<00:01:03.649> you've<00:01:03.770> got<00:01:03.949> it<00:01:03.980> hooked<00:01:04.190> up

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
actually when you've got it hooked up

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.969 
actually when you've got it hooked up
you're<00:01:05.059> going<00:01:05.180> to<00:01:05.239> be<00:01:05.360> using<00:01:05.690> the<00:01:05.780> webcam<00:01:05.990> the

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
you're going to be using the webcam the

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.690 
you're going to be using the webcam the
webcam<00:01:07.430> is<00:01:07.700> just<00:01:08.570> a<00:01:08.750> log<00:01:09.020> tech<00:01:09.259> 4000<00:01:10.009> off<00:01:10.460> the

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
webcam is just a log tech 4000 off the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.830 
webcam is just a log tech 4000 off the
shelf<00:01:10.940> for<00:01:11.920> $40.00<00:01:12.920> webcam<00:01:13.640> that<00:01:14.210> I<00:01:14.240> modified

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
shelf for $40.00 webcam that I modified

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.050 
shelf for $40.00 webcam that I modified
so<00:01:15.500> the<00:01:15.619> eyepiece<00:01:16.039> fits<00:01:16.399> in<00:01:16.610> there<00:01:16.759> and<00:01:16.880> I<00:01:16.910> use

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
so the eyepiece fits in there and I use

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.669 
so the eyepiece fits in there and I use
this<00:01:17.210> for<00:01:17.420> planetary<00:01:17.810> photography<00:01:18.470> and<00:01:18.590> it

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:18.679 
this for planetary photography and it

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:20.380 
this for planetary photography and it
occurred<00:01:18.950> to<00:01:18.979> me<00:01:19.130> that<00:01:19.429> when<00:01:20.240> the

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
occurred to me that when the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.089 
occurred to me that when the
International<00:01:20.899> Space<00:01:21.110> Station<00:01:21.170> is<00:01:21.649> passing

International Space Station is passing

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:24.339 
International Space Station is passing
over<00:01:22.429> it's<00:01:22.940> about<00:01:23.209> the<00:01:23.390> same<00:01:23.630> brightness<00:01:23.840> and

00:01:24.339 --> 00:01:24.349 
over it's about the same brightness and

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:26.410 
over it's about the same brightness and
about<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:24.649> same<00:01:24.860> size<00:01:25.099> as<00:01:25.399> Jupiter<00:01:25.849> or<00:01:26.090> Saturn

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
about the same size as Jupiter or Saturn

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.050 
about the same size as Jupiter or Saturn
or<00:01:26.780> things<00:01:26.990> I<00:01:27.140> was<00:01:27.289> already<00:01:27.500> imaging<00:01:28.099> now<00:01:29.000> the

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
or things I was already imaging now the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.730 
or things I was already imaging now the
big<00:01:29.420> problem<00:01:29.450> you're<00:01:29.929> going<00:01:30.050> to<00:01:30.110> have<00:01:30.319> is

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
big problem you're going to have is

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.190 
big problem you're going to have is
focus<00:01:31.729> and<00:01:31.970> tracking<00:01:32.599> because<00:01:32.840> when<00:01:33.020> your

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
focus and tracking because when your

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.169 
focus and tracking because when your
national<00:01:33.560> space<00:01:33.770> station<00:01:34.190> moves<00:01:34.399> over<00:01:34.729> it's

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.179 
national space station moves over it's

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:37.300 
national space station moves over it's
going<00:01:35.330> to<00:01:35.390> be<00:01:35.479> moving<00:01:35.660> like<00:01:35.869> a<00:01:35.899> star<00:01:36.319> so<00:01:37.099> there

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
going to be moving like a star so there

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.070 
going to be moving like a star so there
is<00:01:37.459> their<00:01:37.729> sophisticated<00:01:38.330> tracking<00:01:38.660> software

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
is their sophisticated tracking software

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.680 
is their sophisticated tracking software
out<00:01:39.440> there<00:01:39.679> however<00:01:39.890> our<00:01:40.490> scope<00:01:40.849> doesn't<00:01:41.450> even

it's what you're going to have is tell

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.649 
it's what you're going to have is tell
ran<00:01:51.289> right<00:01:51.560> here<00:01:51.829> for<00:01:52.070> a<00:01:52.100> target<00:01:52.520> err<00:01:52.610> this<00:01:53.479> is

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
ran right here for a target err this is

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.139 
ran right here for a target err this is
going<00:01:53.840> to<00:01:53.930> track<00:01:54.229> and<00:01:54.740> like<00:01:55.640> say<00:01:55.880> an<00:01:56.000> airplane

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
going to track and like say an airplane

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.240 
going to track and like say an airplane
tracking<00:01:56.810> over<00:01:56.930> right<00:01:57.229> now<00:01:57.380> that's<00:01:57.950> actually

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
tracking over right now that's actually

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.330 
tracking over right now that's actually
a<00:01:58.490> good<00:01:58.789> way<00:01:59.000> to<00:01:59.259> to<00:02:00.259> use<00:02:00.470> what<00:02:01.070> we're<00:02:01.159> going<00:02:01.310> to

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
a good way to to use what we're going to

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.850 
a good way to to use what we're going to
do<00:02:01.549> we<00:02:02.060> have<00:02:02.240> a<00:02:02.270> pot<00:02:02.630> grabber<00:02:03.020> here<00:02:03.409> you<00:02:03.710> could

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
do we have a pot grabber here you could

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.359 
do we have a pot grabber here you could
use<00:02:04.039> a<00:02:04.070> pool<00:02:04.429> stick<00:02:04.640> a<00:02:05.060> broomstick<00:02:06.369> anything

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
use a pool stick a broomstick anything

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.460 
use a pool stick a broomstick anything
that<00:02:07.549> would<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:08.209> idea<00:02:08.599> is<00:02:08.929> you<00:02:09.050> want<00:02:09.110> to<00:02:09.319> guide

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
that would the idea is you want to guide

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.740 
that would the idea is you want to guide
it<00:02:09.649> like<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.280> old-style<00:02:10.610> cameras<00:02:11.300> you<00:02:11.480> see

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
it like the old-style cameras you see

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.540 
it like the old-style cameras you see
where<00:02:12.319> they<00:02:12.440> had<00:02:12.680> it<00:02:12.830> where<00:02:13.069> you're<00:02:13.190> guiding

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
where they had it where you're guiding

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.449 
where they had it where you're guiding
it<00:02:13.670> like<00:02:13.849> this<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.569> what<00:02:15.319> I'm<00:02:15.440> doing<00:02:15.860> is<00:02:16.250> I'm

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
it like this and what I'm doing is I'm

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.850 
it like this and what I'm doing is I'm
aiming<00:02:16.910> through<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.209> reticle<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:17.860> I'm

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
aiming through the reticle and I'm

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.110 
aiming through the reticle and I'm
tracking<00:02:19.160> I'll<00:02:19.489> do<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.670> little<00:02:19.819> demonstration

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
tracking I'll do a little demonstration

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.839 
tracking I'll do a little demonstration
of<00:02:20.599> it<00:02:20.720> in<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:20.900> moment<00:02:21.049> and<00:02:21.590> you're<00:02:22.400> trying<00:02:22.640> kind

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
of it in a moment and you're trying kind

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.250 
of it in a moment and you're trying kind
of<00:02:22.940> like<00:02:23.030> a<00:02:23.060> triple<00:02:23.330> a<00:02:23.569> gun<00:02:23.810> you're<00:02:24.019> kind<00:02:24.230> of

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
of like a triple a gun you're kind of

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.690 
of like a triple a gun you're kind of
tracking<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.830> satellite<00:02:25.250> as<00:02:25.370> it<00:02:25.489> moves

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
tracking the satellite as it moves

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.400 
tracking the satellite as it moves
overhead<00:02:26.060> now<00:02:26.750> you're<00:02:26.900> not<00:02:26.989> going<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.230> get<00:02:27.290> the

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
overhead now you're not going to get the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.009 
overhead now you're not going to get the
satellite<00:02:27.739> in<00:02:27.980> every<00:02:28.220> frame<00:02:28.519> the<00:02:29.360> idea<00:02:29.540> for

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
satellite in every frame the idea for

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.559 
satellite in every frame the idea for
this<00:02:30.140> is<00:02:30.349> you<00:02:30.950> want<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.220> get<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.489> satellite<00:02:32.000> if

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
this is you want to get the satellite if

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.539 
this is you want to get the satellite if
you<00:02:32.989> watch<00:02:33.200> it<00:02:33.440> when<00:02:33.590> you<00:02:33.680> see<00:02:33.860> on<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.099> imagery

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
you watch it when you see on the imagery

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.160 
you watch it when you see on the imagery
you're<00:02:34.910> going<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.090> see<00:02:35.299> it<00:02:35.390> like<00:02:35.569> hop<00:02:35.810> around

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
you're going to see it like hop around

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.690 
you're going to see it like hop around
but<00:02:36.739> you're<00:02:36.890> going<00:02:36.980> to<00:02:37.040> want<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.250> just<00:02:37.430> grab

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
but you're going to want to just grab

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.460 
but you're going to want to just grab
one<00:02:38.000> or<00:02:38.120> two<00:02:38.239> good<00:02:38.480> frames<00:02:38.780> out<00:02:39.049> of<00:02:39.140> maybe<00:02:39.290> out

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
one or two good frames out of maybe out

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.289 
one or two good frames out of maybe out
of<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.650> thousand<00:02:40.190> you'll<00:02:40.310> get<00:02:40.489> 20<00:02:40.730> good<00:02:41.030> frames

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
of a thousand you'll get 20 good frames

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.140 
of a thousand you'll get 20 good frames
that<00:02:41.510> will<00:02:41.599> show<00:02:41.810> an<00:02:41.930> image<00:02:42.170> in<00:02:42.380> it<00:02:42.500> but<00:02:43.250> that's

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
that will show an image in it but that's

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.759 
that will show an image in it but that's

show<00:03:53.620> you<00:03:53.680> briefly<00:03:53.980> just<00:03:54.490> how<00:03:54.640> I<00:03:54.670> have<00:03:55.000> to<00:03:55.120> be

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.210 
show you briefly just how I have to be

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.210 
show you briefly just how I have to be
positioned<00:03:55.750> when<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.380> satellites<00:03:56.800> coming<00:03:57.040> up

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
positioned when the satellites coming up

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.520 
positioned when the satellites coming up
overhead<00:03:57.630> I'm<00:03:58.630> looking<00:03:59.050> down<00:03:59.170> through<00:03:59.410> this

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
overhead I'm looking down through this

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.710 
overhead I'm looking down through this
reticle<00:03:59.980> right<00:04:00.160> here<00:04:00.460> and<00:04:00.610> then<00:04:01.120> I'm<00:04:01.240> guiding

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
reticle right here and then I'm guiding

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.060 
reticle right here and then I'm guiding
it<00:04:01.840> like<00:04:01.990> this<00:04:02.200> and<00:04:02.380> I'm<00:04:02.500> trying<00:04:02.710> to<00:04:02.740> keep<00:04:02.890> it

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
it like this and I'm trying to keep it

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.950 
it like this and I'm trying to keep it
centered<00:04:03.280> centered<00:04:03.790> centered<00:04:04.180> I've<00:04:04.660> already

centered centered centered I've already

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.690 
centered centered centered I've already
got<00:04:05.050> the<00:04:05.140> software<00:04:05.560> set<00:04:05.980> so<00:04:06.460> when<00:04:06.610> the

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
got the software set so when the

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.370 
got the software set so when the

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
satellite comes overhead and I see it I

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.830 
satellite comes overhead and I see it I
just<00:04:08.470> have<00:04:08.800> to<00:04:08.920> hit<00:04:09.100> like<00:04:09.640> record<00:04:10.180> and<00:04:10.480> it's

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
just have to hit like record and it's

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.660 
just have to hit like record and it's
all<00:04:11.020> focused<00:04:11.350> and<00:04:11.770> ready<00:04:12.070> because<00:04:12.280> you<00:04:12.520> don't

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
all focused and ready because you don't

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:13.980 
all focused and ready because you don't

for<00:04:16.000> the<00:04:16.090> focus<00:04:16.570> on<00:04:16.780> it<00:04:16.989> what<00:04:17.440> I<00:04:17.470> do<00:04:17.620> is<00:04:18.070> I<00:04:18.489> try

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
for the focus on it what I do is I try

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.880 
for the focus on it what I do is I try
to<00:04:18.730> find<00:04:19.060> something<00:04:19.480> bright<00:04:19.900> that<00:04:20.230> is<00:04:20.410> similar

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
to find something bright that is similar

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.820 
to find something bright that is similar
to<00:04:21.100> the<00:04:21.190> ISS<00:04:21.640> over<00:04:21.970> the<00:04:22.090> horizon<00:04:22.600> venus<00:04:23.590> makes

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
to the ISS over the horizon venus makes

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.340 
to the ISS over the horizon venus makes
a<00:04:23.950> very<00:04:24.160> good<00:04:24.460> target<00:04:24.700> Venus<00:04:25.600> is<00:04:25.780> similar<00:04:26.110> in

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
a very good target Venus is similar in

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.620 
a very good target Venus is similar in
brightness<00:04:26.680> and<00:04:27.160> magnitude<00:04:27.640> to<00:04:27.880> the<00:04:27.970> ISS<00:04:28.390> and

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
brightness and magnitude to the ISS and

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.720 
brightness and magnitude to the ISS and
it's<00:04:28.750> stationary<00:04:29.020> so<00:04:29.980> you<00:04:30.070> can<00:04:30.310> have<00:04:30.460> it<00:04:30.610> all

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
it's stationary so you can have it all

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.150 
it's stationary so you can have it all
set<00:04:31.060> up<00:04:31.090> in<00:04:31.420> the<00:04:31.870> focus<00:04:32.110> and<00:04:32.470> the<00:04:32.560> line<00:04:32.740> and<00:04:33.100> the

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
set up in the focus and the line and the

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.650 
set up in the focus and the line and the
shutter<00:04:33.400> speed<00:04:33.730> and<00:04:33.940> everything<00:04:34.030> I<00:04:34.420> shoot

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
shutter speed and everything I shoot

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.550 
shutter speed and everything I shoot
maybe<00:04:34.930> about<00:04:35.250> one<00:04:36.250> 500<00:04:36.880> shutter<00:04:37.690> speed<00:04:37.990> is<00:04:38.200> a

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
maybe about one 500 shutter speed is a

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.250 
maybe about one 500 shutter speed is a
good<00:04:38.890> turn<00:04:39.820> speed<00:04:40.090> to<00:04:40.210> shoot<00:04:40.420> at<00:04:40.570> for<00:04:40.810> the<00:04:40.870> ISS

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
good turn speed to shoot at for the ISS

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.780 
good turn speed to shoot at for the ISS
because<00:04:41.530> it's<00:04:41.650> similar<00:04:41.860> to<00:04:42.010> what<00:04:42.220> Venus<00:04:42.580> is

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
because it's similar to what Venus is

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.480 
because it's similar to what Venus is
but<00:04:43.420> this<00:04:43.540> is<00:04:43.750> basically<00:04:44.410> our<00:04:44.530> setup<00:04:45.160> in<00:04:45.340> its

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
but this is basically our setup in its

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:53.790 
but this is basically our setup in its
this<00:04:45.760> is<00:04:45.820> how<00:04:46.030> we<00:04:46.120> try

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:04.230 

you

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.520 

set<00:05:04.509> up<00:05:04.630> here<00:05:04.840> you<00:05:05.050> can<00:05:05.229> be<00:05:05.349> shooting

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
set up here you can be shooting

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:13.570 
set up here you can be shooting
satellites<00:05:06.160> tonight

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.639 

you
