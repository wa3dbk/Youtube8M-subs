I'm going to do is I'm going to film
during<00:00:43.660> the<00:00:43.840> day<00:00:44.050> and<00:00:44.290> make<00:00:44.500> it<00:00:44.650> look<00:00:44.769> like

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
during the day and make it look like

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.500 
during the day and make it look like
it's<00:00:45.100> at<00:00:45.220> night<00:00:45.400> this<00:00:45.790> is<00:00:45.879> known<00:00:46.030> as<00:00:46.150> day<00:00:46.300> for

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
it's at night this is known as day for

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.790 
it's at night this is known as day for
night<00:00:46.629> photography<00:00:46.809> and<00:00:47.230> it<00:00:47.290> to<00:00:47.410> do<00:00:47.500> that<00:00:47.680> we

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
night photography and it to do that we

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.439 
night photography and it to do that we
need<00:00:47.830> direct<00:00:48.250> sunlight<00:00:48.460> and<00:00:48.790> lots<00:00:49.000> of<00:00:49.090> shadows

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
need direct sunlight and lots of shadows

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.320 
need direct sunlight and lots of shadows
so<00:00:49.660> found<00:00:49.930> the<00:00:50.290> moon<00:00:50.530> which<00:00:51.190> is<00:00:51.489> some<00:00:52.120> of<00:00:52.239> the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.330 
so found the moon which is some of the

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.360 
so found the moon which is some of the
light<00:00:52.510> deathwing<00:00:53.110> down<00:00:53.350> there<00:00:53.650> the<00:00:54.129> reason

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
light deathwing down there the reason

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.619 
light deathwing down there the reason
I've<00:00:54.460> chosen<00:00:54.489> down<00:00:54.910> here<00:00:55.180> is<00:00:55.269> because<00:00:55.390> it

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
I've chosen down here is because it

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.090 
I've chosen down here is because it
means<00:00:55.720> the<00:00:55.839> sun's<00:00:56.050> pointing<00:00:56.440> directly<00:00:56.559> at<00:00:56.860> me

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
means the sun's pointing directly at me

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.560 
means the sun's pointing directly at me
as<00:00:57.220> a<00:00:57.250> poster<00:00:57.610> behind<00:00:57.760> me<00:00:58.030> so<00:00:58.180> it<00:00:58.239> illuminates

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
as a poster behind me so it illuminates

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.619 
as a poster behind me so it illuminates
my<00:00:58.660> faith<00:00:58.989> there's<00:00:59.530> a<00:00:59.620> lot<00:00:59.649> of<00:00:59.800> shadow<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:01.329> so

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
my faith there's a lot of shadow and so

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:02.819 
my faith there's a lot of shadow and so
it's<00:01:01.809> a<00:01:01.899> good<00:01:02.020> shot<00:01:02.200> that<00:01:02.350> some<00:01:02.469> shadow<00:01:02.649> in<00:01:02.800> the

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
it's a good shot that some shadow in the

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.020 
it's a good shot that some shadow in the
foreground<00:01:03.219> the<00:01:03.520> scenario<00:01:03.850> in<00:01:03.969> the

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
foreground the scenario in the

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.359 
foreground the scenario in the
background<00:01:04.509> so<00:01:05.229> I'm<00:01:05.649> like<00:01:05.830> going<00:01:06.070> through<00:01:06.160> the

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
background so I'm like going through the

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.279
