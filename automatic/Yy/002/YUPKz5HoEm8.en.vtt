00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
close range but sometimes they are quite

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.880 
close range but sometimes they are quite
retarded<00:00:30.330> unhand<00:00:30.960> an<00:00:31.080> eviscerated<00:00:31.410> fund<00:00:31.740> that

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
other keepers but it didn't make some

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.880 
other keepers but it didn't make some
absolutely<00:00:35.820> outstanding<00:00:36.000> saves<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.500> rap<00:00:37.770> but

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
absolutely outstanding saves the rap but

for<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:44.970> left<00:01:45.119> like<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.360> median<00:01:45.630> managed<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.990> get

me two girls which were actually

me two girls which were actually
penalties<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.000> i<00:01:48.420> think<00:01:48.479> he<00:01:48.689> does<00:01:48.869> have<00:01:49.049> about

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
penalties so i think he does have about

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.590 
penalties so i think he does have about
high<00:01:49.470> seven<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:49.950> maybe<00:01:50.159> 80<00:01:50.460> penalties<00:01:51.060> which

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
high seven is maybe 80 penalties which

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.530 
high seven is maybe 80 penalties which
is<00:01:51.720> pretty<00:01:51.899> decent<00:01:52.409> for<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.649> left-back<00:01:53.540> it

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
is pretty decent for a left-back it

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.480 
is pretty decent for a left-back it
means<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.320> go<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.590> cam<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.070> left

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
it's thiago and in my opinion he

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.050 
it's thiago and in my opinion he
probably<00:02:02.009> was<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.250> worst<00:02:02.520> play<00:02:02.759> on<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:03.000> team

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060
