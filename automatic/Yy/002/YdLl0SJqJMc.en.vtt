anti-air<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.930> noticed<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.140> I'm<00:00:19.230> getting<00:00:19.560> hit

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
anti-air I noticed that I'm getting hit

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.040 
anti-air I noticed that I'm getting hit
with<00:00:19.890> air<00:00:20.220> attacks<00:00:20.670> about<00:00:20.910> 80%<00:00:21.690> of<00:00:21.780> the<00:00:21.840> time

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
with air attacks about 80% of the time

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.600 
with air attacks about 80% of the time
so<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.290> figured<00:00:22.620> what<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.830> heck<00:00:23.070> let's<00:00:23.280> give<00:00:23.580> it

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:23.610 
so I figured what the heck let's give it

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:24.230 
so I figured what the heck let's give it
a<00:00:23.760> try

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
a try

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.210 
a try
let's<00:00:24.540> slightly<00:00:25.110> move<00:00:25.320> things<00:00:25.650> around<00:00:25.830> so

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
let's slightly move things around so

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.820 
let's slightly move things around so

Tesla's<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.760> idea<00:01:03.090> here<00:01:03.510> being<00:01:03.540> that<00:01:04.229> if

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
Tesla's the idea here being that if

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.050 
Tesla's the idea here being that if
they're<00:01:04.439> going<00:01:04.619> for<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:04.920> safety<00:01:05.339> one<00:01:05.759> star

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
they're going for that safety one star

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.910 
they're going for that safety one star
if<00:01:06.180> maybe<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.600> stopped<00:01:07.020> their<00:01:07.229> air<00:01:07.409> attack<00:01:07.740> and

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
if maybe I stopped their air attack and

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.139 
if maybe I stopped their air attack and
they're<00:01:08.009> coming<00:01:08.189> in<00:01:08.369> with<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.610> heroes<00:01:08.939> down

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
they're coming in with the heroes down

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:11.239 
they're coming in with the heroes down
there<00:01:09.509> hopefully<00:01:10.139> I<00:01:10.439> can<00:01:10.590> stop<00:01:10.979> them<00:01:11.219> from

00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:11.249 
there hopefully I can stop them from

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:14.239 
there hopefully I can stop them from
grabbing<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:11.969> star<00:01:12.270> for<00:01:12.450> 50%<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:14.100> the

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:14.249 
grabbing that star for 50% and in the

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:16.069 
grabbing that star for 50% and in the
clan<00:01:14.459> castle<00:01:14.729> right<00:01:15.119> now<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.329> like<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.840> lava

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.079 
clan castle right now I like the lava

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:18.289 
clan castle right now I like the lava
hound<00:01:16.499> it<00:01:16.679> is<00:01:16.829> kind<00:01:17.039> of<00:01:17.130> hit<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.399> miss<00:01:17.490> but<00:01:18.149> it

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
hound it is kind of hit and miss but it

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.300 
hound it is kind of hit and miss but it
has<00:01:18.450> been<00:01:18.630> effective<00:01:18.780> more<00:01:19.530> than<00:01:19.770> once<00:01:20.069> on

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
has been effective more than once on

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.190 
has been effective more than once on
recent<00:01:20.729> occasions<00:01:21.179> so<00:01:21.719> we're<00:01:21.899> gonna<00:01:22.020> get

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
recent occasions so we're gonna get

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.410 
recent occasions so we're gonna get
right<00:01:22.469> into<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.889> replays<00:01:23.279> here<00:01:23.609> again<00:01:24.209> I'm

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
right into the replays here again I'm

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.359 
right into the replays here again I'm
not<00:01:24.600> winning<00:01:24.929> all<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.409> time<00:01:25.649> I've<00:01:25.920> probably

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
not winning all the time I've probably

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.309 
not winning all the time I've probably
maybe<00:01:26.549> closer<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.029> 50%<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.719> the<00:01:27.810> time<00:01:27.990> against

00:01:28.309 --> 00:01:28.319 
maybe closer to 50% of the time against

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:30.379 
maybe closer to 50% of the time against
air<00:01:28.499> attacks<00:01:28.829> but<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.310> pretty<00:01:29.579> good<00:01:29.819> so

00:01:30.379 --> 00:01:30.389 
air attacks but that is pretty good so

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:32.149 
air attacks but that is pretty good so
right<00:01:30.630> here<00:01:30.899> you<00:01:31.079> see<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.560> lava<00:01:31.740> hounds

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
right here you see that lava hounds

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.769 
right here you see that lava hounds
moving<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.609> from<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.850> air<00:01:32.969> attack<00:01:33.270> right<00:01:33.539> away

00:01:33.769 --> 00:01:33.779 
moving in from the air attack right away

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:35.989 
moving in from the air attack right away

and<00:01:38.999> now<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.149> can<00:01:39.389> see<00:01:39.569> the<00:01:39.719> lava<00:01:39.929> hounds<00:01:40.229> are

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
and now you can see the lava hounds are

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.529 
and now you can see the lava hounds are
going<00:01:40.709> down<00:01:40.889> on<00:01:41.099> the<00:01:41.189> offending<00:01:41.670> side<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.179> the

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
going down on the offending side and the

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:43.879 
going down on the offending side and the
balloons<00:01:42.899> have<00:01:43.079> kind<00:01:43.319> of<00:01:43.409> grouped<00:01:43.679> together

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:43.889 
balloons have kind of grouped together

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:46.160 
balloons have kind of grouped together
and<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.819> think<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.270> may<00:01:45.450> have<00:01:45.479> something<00:01:46.049> to

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
and I think that may have something to

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.719 
and I think that may have something to
do<00:01:46.289> with<00:01:46.439> where<00:01:46.649> those<00:01:46.799> gold<00:01:47.159> storages<00:01:47.700> and

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
do with where those gold storages and

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.730 
do with where those gold storages and
gold<00:01:47.999> mines<00:01:48.240> are<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.990> balloons<00:01:49.349> are<00:01:49.469> always

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
gold mines are the balloons are always

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.980 
gold mines are the balloons are always
going<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.039> target<00:01:50.340> defenses<00:01:51.179> and<00:01:51.359> so<00:01:51.810> those

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
going to target defenses and so those

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.659 
going to target defenses and so those
balloons<00:01:52.380> grouped<00:01:52.740> up<00:01:52.919> and<00:01:53.099> that<00:01:53.189> definitely

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:53.669 
balloons grouped up and that definitely

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:55.760 
balloons grouped up and that definitely

the way but it is just not going to be

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:25.460 
the way but it is just not going to be
enough

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
enough

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.340

to get to 50% and this attacker is going

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.150 
to get to 50% and this attacker is going

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
to be left with a painful loss so let's

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.980 
to be left with a painful loss so let's
move<00:04:32.340> on<00:04:32.520> to<00:04:32.610> another<00:04:32.700> attack<00:04:33.390> replay<00:04:33.810> and

move on to another attack replay and

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.140 
move on to another attack replay and
again<00:04:34.320> we<00:04:34.530> see<00:04:34.740> just<00:04:35.100> two<00:04:35.280> lava<00:04:35.550> hounds<00:04:35.940> being

again we see just two lava hounds being

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.640 
again we see just two lava hounds being

the balloons move in look at the massive
