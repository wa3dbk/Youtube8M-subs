of yet why did that fight fall apart I

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.660 
of yet why did that fight fall apart I
think<00:00:36.960> there's<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.260> lot<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:38.190> know<00:00:38.219> Floyd

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
think there's a lot of you know Floyd

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.940 
think there's a lot of you know Floyd
reason<00:00:39.600> that's<00:00:40.230> why<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.440> fighters<00:00:40.770> concert

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
reason that's why the fighters concert

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.410 
reason that's why the fighters concert
and<00:00:42.350> what<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.379> believe<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.890> Floyd<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:45.120> doesn't

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
and what I believe is Floyd it doesn't

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.479 
and what I believe is Floyd it doesn't
want<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.750> fight<00:00:45.930> many<00:00:46.680> there<00:00:47.039> was<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.219> lot<00:00:47.430> of

want to fight many there was a lot of

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.819 
want to fight many there was a lot of
negotiation<00:00:48.329> with<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.809> type<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.469> blood

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
negotiation with the type of blood

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.100 
negotiation with the type of blood
testing<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.879> would<00:00:51.090> be<00:00:51.239> for<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.480> fight<00:00:51.870> a

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.870 
you know it's going to be a victim I
HIPAA<00:01:58.939> training<00:01:58.969> on<00:01:59.359> that<00:01:59.509> time<00:02:00.109> and<00:02:00.560> I<00:02:00.979> think

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
HIPAA training on that time and I think

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.440 
HIPAA training on that time and I think
it's<00:02:02.750> not<00:02:02.990> is<00:02:03.170> that<00:02:03.409> good<00:02:03.560> to<00:02:03.740> do<00:02:04.070> about<00:02:04.450> the

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
it's not is that good to do about the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.569 
it's not is that good to do about the
dog<00:02:05.600> blood<00:02:05.780> testing<00:02:06.170> on<00:02:06.289> that<00:02:06.439> on<00:02:07.189> that<00:02:07.250> date

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
dog blood testing on that on that date

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.559 
dog blood testing on that on that date
because<00:02:09.519> 15<00:02:10.519> days<00:02:10.640> before<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.000> fight<00:02:11.150> is<00:02:11.330> it's
