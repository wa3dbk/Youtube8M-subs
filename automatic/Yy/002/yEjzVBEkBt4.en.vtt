00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.290
 Hello UTB Peter today we will 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.410
 talking about green meat will be more accurate 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.190
 straight recipe cooking process so 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.389
 further planned that will be devoted 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.670
 as if to the goods 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.250
 but it turned out that the main focus 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.720
 pushed all the same on the meat directly 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:28.680
 now see the result of this case 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:31.859
 now I hand over the word they which will 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.600
 cook jerky not talking about 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:39.450
 how to make it all work 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.860
 hello my name is Anya today we 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.780
 we cook building this meat 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.930
 South African or as he calls in 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.000
 russia just usually jerky recipe 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.120
 taken from love magazine who will 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.579
 interesting reference we give we need 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.399
 cut the meat as thin as possible 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.100
 must be thin and small we 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.670
 take the meat look like he go 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.479
 the fibers we need to cut along the fibers 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:13.260
 that is, I will have this knife 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.770
 which i will cut and the cold steel 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.770
 product 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.180
 that's about this thickness should 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.490
 get pieces the thinner the piece 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.490
 piece the faster it is checked 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.120
 after all the knife manipulations we have 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.360
 form these slices of meat to me 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.130
 very thick medium we are all doing 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:56.580
 we lay in any enameled ware 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:02:01.150
 and parallel cook seasoning for meat 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:04.390
 per kilo of meat we need immediately 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.160
 I will say that we have 300 bodies, so I will 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.950
 a little more put on a kilo 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.850
 means salt tablespoon with a hill 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.940
 I got such a spoon with a big 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.500
 a hill 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.240
 here still 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:24.250
 pebbles, in principle, nothing terrible 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.280
 following means this is a tablespoon 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.170
 ground coriander without slides since 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:34.780
 us body 300 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.410
 we take a tablespoon without a slide and another 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.840
 a little bit 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.950
 In principle, coriander is the main 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:45.820
 seasoning in meat and I think never 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:49.680
 maybe we need a song next 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:57.250
 teaspoon with a slide of sugar 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:03:00.780
 take a teaspoon take sugar and we 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.790
 get a teaspoon with a pile of sugar 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:09.870
 further a teaspoon of black ground 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.870
 pepper with a slide 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:23.140
 and add a little red pepper not 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:29.230
 so a little bit so i'm the whole thing 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:31.390
 mix actually could have prepared 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.830
 seasoning mix for meat 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:38.950
 the next step is we take the meat itself and 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:41.410
 sprinkle it with my wine vinegar 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.830
 Here is such a vinegar he should be 6 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.980
 interest we sprinkle at all 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.740
 a little bit 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.730
 so that the meat is just soaked 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.940
 opened his pores and calm avalon 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:59.410
 soak up all the seasonings 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:08.430
 shuffle shuffle to all 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:11.320
 the pieces were in vinegar further our task 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:15.340
 carefully dip each piece in 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:18.040
 seasoning all and fold accordingly 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.870
 all this in the dishes so that 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.870
 every piece was a piece now i 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:27.060
 I show how we do take 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.060
 just pour the meat on the board 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:35.620
 while I put it on so combined 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.360
 take each piece and just by 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.719
 a little bit 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.039
 rub it all spiced up in any 

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:44.229
 case they 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.000
 pieces that will be on top of each other 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.909
 lying they will share with anyway 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.490
 neighbor missing seasonings so 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:54.340
 say here and back fold to the bottom 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.469
 the dishes so just a piece 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:00.659
 a piece then on top 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:05:00.659
 other pieces and so on 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.430
 in fact I told you very early 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.350
 time to fold the piece neatly 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.570
 because then the best of all things 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.910
 stir once more to 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:40.650
 seasoning evenly distributed over 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.650
 all over meat 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:46.160
 the next stage means we have turned 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.230
 such a bowl with neatly laid out 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.950
 the meat we cover the bowl 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:55.420
 plate and big and set us up 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.420
 will pick up the refrigerator for six hours 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:07.270
 that's 12 hours have passed we came to the most 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:10.750
 climaxes in general all our events 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:14.110
 task initially it means 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:16.300
 rinse the meat into the wine to wash it off 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:19.140
 would be all seasoning because there will be 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:22.770
 sharp enough 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:25.450
 principle if you go to beer and only to him 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:28.480
 it will be very cold 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:30.220
 well you can do in half an example 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.980
 half sleep half leave as 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:37.210
 There is, in principle, I think to do this 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:39.910
 i said after we actually 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.620
 washed meat will not show how it is 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:45.550
 do i think so you understand it 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:47.460
 washed and after already 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:52.890
 prepare 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:57.600
 hang on the window you squeeze it 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:58.870
 after the meat cheer we wait 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.390
 a day or two 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:04.870
 looks like a thicker piece than before 

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:07.560
 becomes ready to say words already on 

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:12.180
 the next day you can enjoy 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:15.850
 delicious meat with beer is possible without beer 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:17.620
 she retired with us almost twice 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:20.770
 Well, we have already tried 70 grams 

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.490
 ate a little more than twice the meat 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.880
 roasted 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:26.680
 diminished in size 

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.140
 I hope you have the best recipe
