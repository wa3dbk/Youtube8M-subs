00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello by this video i will you 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.809
 show how to use paint 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.400
 metallic food this little product 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.559
 can be found in all stores 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.320
 specialized or then you can the 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.840
 find on the internet so against 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.170
 it's quite expensive it's between 7 and 10 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.330
 euros the small bottle of 25 milliliters 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.599
 so for my part I chose a 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.970
 purple color you will need a 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.059
 special brush kitchen for power 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.430
 apply your paint and I will 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.600
 recommend using it on small 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.690
 biscuits 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.030
 because of the price and the quantity 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.960
 has fun painting big cake that's fine 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.149
 quickly come back dearly so as I 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.890
 you said this metal painting 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.949
 and specially planned for 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.379
 supply 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:01:01.680
 the principle is simple I open my little 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:06.290
 bottle and I drop directly on the 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.290
 biscuit a small drop of paint 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:21.240
 like this is using my brush 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:27.450
 lethal play gradually like this 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:31.320
 so I leave the center to come back on 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.750
 the sides then to know if you in 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:39.290
 put on the fingers do not panic 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.290
 his share in the wash obviously 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:56.490
 so I put a small drop in the center 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:59.350
 and I lay down with my brush like this 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.759
 so you find different colors 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.800
 in store the pink of the blue green of the 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.270
 red 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.670
 so there is way to make gradients 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.900
 of colors simply by using 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:17.050
 two or three different colors 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:21.280
 and here is the result my little cookies 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:26.470
 are metallized all mimi and I can 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:28.510
 enjoy and here I let it dry in 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.940
 hardly a few seconds and I can 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.940
 serve my little biscuits metallized
