00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 the fashion is good now the homemade and to know 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.080
 if this business is really good 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:15.299
 We'll meet a ball well. 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:17.760
 different from love, I do not like 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.850
 eat that cute cuddly cake 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.680
 for Grandma because it's more the lack of 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.519
 time often does not allow this 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.439
 regalia 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.240
 thinking about that some people decided 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.189
 bet on this market 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.230
 create a cozy and 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.260
 Home-made cakes 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.719
 is the case of romagnoli steak gastronomy 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.280
 she created a different space with 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.379
 various recipes 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.860
 many years we had an interest in 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.020
 working with commercial cakes was already 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.899
 cake for the friends on my baby too 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.300
 I already made cakes when we moved here. 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.670
 bcp is the people came to eat chunks 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.250
 cake who commissioned the oxen and 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.559
 they wanted to eat that was starting our 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.960
 our little tables, we'll put 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.300
 the tables there I wanted a coffee that has a 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.700
 the indimplÃªncia wants to know of a 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.479
 thing that will record boller would be over 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.479
 That turned that around 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.610
 the wake still went beyond thought of 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.640
 recipes for all tastes and 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.250
 needs in different flavors of 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.770
 traditional cakes in lactose-free cakes 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.290
 and still sugarless cake 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.950
 we do not want to be another store 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.259
 cake 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.729
 we decided to work with the 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:39.170
 restrictions or with allergies 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:41.000
 food and we seek are ingredients 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.460
 that all people can eat the 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.630
 celiac diabetics, everyone who has 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.610
 allergy to gluten or lactose to fructose 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.679
 sometimes there are eggs and sometimes people 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.869
 they play and if she makes you a cake without 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:56.479
 nothing and how tasty it is 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.369
 so are some of the spells that we 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.840
 cooks we have 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.380
 So we really work with 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.380
 all restrictions 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.410
 Good but if the person does not want to eat there 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.410
 even in bolivia 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.290
 she can just pick pick in 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.020
 Take-away shop saves you the time 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.210
 preparing at home does not like it much since 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.340
 the price is well in mind 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.830
 I jest that making a cake has a whole 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.540
 time is not the person besides having all 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.030
 ingredients she has to have the oven 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.510
 prepared and in a tone of an hour and a half 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.060
 40 hours for you to drop a cake then 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.280
 not everyone has this time available 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.920
 and sometimes you do not like cooking either 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.800
 The injuries have been channeled to other 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.550
 activities that are not so 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:03.280
 kitchen and in the meantime is more practical 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.920
 You pass I play so it's so much more 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.930
 delicious you get caught in the taste that 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.940
 Do you want the time you want with 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.880
 filling with coverage and takes him home 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.670
 It's the party, it's ready, it does not have to 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.470
 stay looking at the market every month 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.310
 a plus of videos ingredient in thing 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:25.330
 so also more functional for this and 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.880
 in relation to price we can leave 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.410
 for example a homemade cake that is grandpa 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.110
 do at home for example 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.030
 look this was a real home made cake 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.030
 that we do not even work with the products 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.160
 more organic nor do I our our shop 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.260
 works with more natural products 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.239
 they come out a little louder but if you 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.380
 works with second line flour 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:50.560
 third line is the egg as where farm 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.080
 that's when it comes out more, but a cake 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.470
 to be bacaninha adding everything not 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.150
 out - of $ 5 times the person 's time 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.550
 depending on the profession she has 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.910
 Will not stop to make a cookie that 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.920
 it will be worth 7 reais you agree 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.980
 so for example I have a lot of people 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.769
 can retire 10 or mothers with children 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.980
 School goes from school to lunch. 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.190
 or I get home I need a snack and already 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.350
 are discovering 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.110
 what is better to eat with these cares 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.440
 that sometimes gluten-free for improvement of 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:26.810
 management or no lactose because they are 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.140
 of inflammation and allergist one thing and 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.910
 such 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.220
 So the kids are already looking for me. 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.140
 I have a lot of children that bring the father and mother. 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.300
 To snack here is very cute. 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.070
 A 4-year-old child leaves school for 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.710
 a mother is way is not the way sometimes 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.440
 Nothing, I live far from here, but I went to her. 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.430
 It's already very cute because it's already 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.040
 understanding 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.650
 the school itself already teaches how best 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.720
 I started pesticides going outside, right? 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.640
 the star has opened aboliria but not 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.460
 just bound to cakes 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:58.010
 You can have tea and eat. 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.750
 brigadeiros pies among others of a 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.780
 market need, it has created a 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:05.120
 full of goodies and customers 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.980
 after all they are going to make your 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.980
 now move on 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.400
 it is interesting to see how the Brazilian is 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.680
 creative, right? 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.990
 a simple homemade cake turns into 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.100
 product and enables the creation of a 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.040
 new company 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.620
 the ideas are there in the air you just 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.770
 pick up and transform into your first 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.770
 business
