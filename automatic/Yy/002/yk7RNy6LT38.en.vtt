believe this probably at the edge be
very<00:00:58.379> low<00:00:58.589> speed<00:00:58.949> since<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.549> only<00:00:59.850> sends<00:01:00.479> and

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
very low speed since it only sends and

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.600 
very low speed since it only sends and
receives<00:01:00.750> emails<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:02.220> know<00:01:02.339> it's<00:01:02.489> not

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
have the same charging method they use

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.940 
have the same charging method they use
mini<00:02:32.690> USB<00:02:32.900> well<00:02:33.890> micro<00:02:34.340> USB<00:02:34.880> and<00:02:35.290> so<00:02:36.290> does<00:02:36.500> my

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
normal smartphone so I like the fact

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.590 
normal smartphone so I like the fact
that<00:02:39.170> doesn't<00:02:39.590> have<00:02:39.710> a<00:02:39.770> proprietary

I'll<00:03:37.370> do<00:03:37.550> some<00:03:37.700> more<00:03:37.820> videos<00:03:38.739> of<00:03:39.739> that<00:03:40.220> but

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
I'll do some more videos of that but

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.760 
I'll do some more videos of that but
just<00:03:41.090> looking<00:03:41.420> at<00:03:41.570> the<00:03:41.720> keyboard<00:03:41.989> you<00:03:42.440> can<00:03:42.470> see

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
just looking at the keyboard you can see

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.120 
just looking at the keyboard you can see
it's<00:03:42.890> illuminated<00:03:43.580> with<00:03:44.540> a<00:03:44.600> blue<00:03:44.900> LED<00:03:45.530> the

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
it's illuminated with a blue LED the

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.699 
it's illuminated with a blue LED the
keys<00:03:46.370> are<00:03:46.610> nice<00:03:46.790> and<00:03:47.120> spaced<00:03:47.390> out<00:03:47.630> you<00:03:48.530> can

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
keys are nice and spaced out you can

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.430 
keys are nice and spaced out you can
type<00:03:48.950> with<00:03:49.250> little<00:03:49.670> mistakes<00:03:50.120> the<00:03:50.750> only<00:03:51.200> thing

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
type with little mistakes the only thing

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.340 
type with little mistakes the only thing
I<00:03:51.620> notice<00:03:52.070> is<00:03:52.220> that<00:03:52.610> when<00:03:53.120> I<00:03:53.150> was<00:03:53.360> going<00:03:54.080> into

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
I notice is that when I was going into

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.180 
I notice is that when I was going into
the<00:03:54.440> setup<00:03:54.890> the<00:03:56.410> typing<00:03:57.410> kind<00:03:57.620> of<00:03:57.739> lacks<00:03:57.980> a

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
the setup the typing kind of lacks a

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.120 
the setup the typing kind of lacks a
little<00:03:58.220> bit<00:03:58.519> if<00:03:58.610> you<00:03:58.700> type<00:03:58.970> too<00:03:59.000> fast<00:03:59.239> uh<00:04:00.130> in

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
little bit if you type too fast uh in

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.250 
little bit if you type too fast uh in
wheel<00:04:01.400> lag<00:04:01.730> and<00:04:01.970> we'll<00:04:02.239> skip<00:04:02.540> some<00:04:02.750> keys<00:04:02.959> so

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
wheel lag and we'll skip some keys so

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.530 
wheel lag and we'll skip some keys so
you<00:04:03.290> will<00:04:03.650> have<00:04:03.680> to<00:04:04.100> type<00:04:04.340> slower<00:04:05.150> on<00:04:05.390> this

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
you will have to type slower on this

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.050 
you will have to type slower on this
device<00:04:05.840> which<00:04:06.110> is<00:04:06.260> a<00:04:06.350> major<00:04:06.590> downside<00:04:07.310> that's

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
device which is a major downside that's

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.140 
device which is a major downside that's
probably<00:04:08.300> due<00:04:08.660> to<00:04:08.690> the<00:04:08.959> low<00:04:09.560> power<00:04:09.910> CPU<00:04:10.910> that's

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
probably due to the low power CPU that's

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
probably due to the low power CPU that's
in<00:04:11.300> this<00:04:11.739> device<00:04:12.739> is<00:04:13.070> pretty<00:04:13.940> darn<00:04:14.209> held<00:04:14.810> back

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
in this device is pretty darn held back

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.170 
in this device is pretty darn held back
so<00:04:15.769> very<00:04:16.010> basic<00:04:16.489> device<00:04:16.850> I<00:04:17.440> doesn't<00:04:18.440> have<00:04:18.470> any

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
so very basic device I doesn't have any

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.240 
so very basic device I doesn't have any
extras<00:04:20.180> like<00:04:20.390> I<00:04:20.540> said<00:04:20.780> internet<00:04:21.650> browser

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
extras like I said internet browser

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.430 
extras like I said internet browser
calculator<00:04:22.910> you<00:04:23.450> won't<00:04:23.660> find<00:04:23.900> them<00:04:24.140> in<00:04:24.320> this

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
calculator you won't find them in this

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.670 
calculator you won't find them in this
device

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
device

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.920 
device
the<00:04:27.680> only<00:04:27.949> other<00:04:28.100> downside<00:04:28.910> i<00:04:28.940> see<00:04:29.449> with<00:04:29.780> the

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
the only other downside i see with the

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.670 
the only other downside i see with the
device<00:04:30.259> is<00:04:30.620> in<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:31.880> keyboard<00:04:32.360> again<00:04:32.590> so<00:04:33.590> you

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
device is in the keyboard again so you

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.279 
device is in the keyboard again so you
can<00:04:33.830> see<00:04:34.130> the<00:04:34.789> symbols<00:04:35.300> aren't<00:04:35.570> integrated

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:36.289 
can see the symbols aren't integrated

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:37.779 
can see the symbols aren't integrated
much<00:04:36.440> like<00:04:36.650> they<00:04:36.800> are<00:04:36.979> in<00:04:37.250> a<00:04:37.460> normal

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789 
much like they are in a normal

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.740 
Vice also i forgot to mention it's
pretty<00:06:06.199> darn<00:06:06.440> lightweight<00:06:07.090> it's<00:06:08.090> about<00:06:08.330> half

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
pretty darn lightweight it's about half

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.439 
pretty darn lightweight it's about half
the<00:06:08.780> weight<00:06:09.289> of<00:06:09.530> my<00:06:09.560> motorola<00:06:10.190> q<00:06:10.610> with<00:06:11.300> the

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:11.449 
the weight of my motorola q with the

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:13.740 
the weight of my motorola q with the
extended<00:06:12.259> battery<00:06:12.320> and<00:06:12.860> of<00:06:13.009> course<00:06:13.280> and

extended battery and of course and

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.710 
extended battery and of course and
that's<00:06:14.750> probably<00:06:14.990> because<00:06:15.320> it<00:06:15.560> lacks<00:06:15.830> those

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 
that's probably because it lacks those

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.050 
that's probably because it lacks those
other<00:06:17.720> features<00:06:18.229> it<00:06:18.380> doesn't<00:06:18.710> even<00:06:18.830> have<00:06:19.159> you

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
when I first unboxed the unit I thought

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.210 
when I first unboxed the unit I thought
this<00:06:25.580> little<00:06:25.940> hole<00:06:26.449> right<00:06:26.479> here<00:06:26.810> was<00:06:27.289> perfect

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.220
