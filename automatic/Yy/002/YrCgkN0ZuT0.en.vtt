00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.320
 [Music] 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.760
 300 is undoubtedly an iconic movie 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.920
 full of adrenaline action 300 is the 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.930
 favorite movie of many today les 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.769
 we will tell you a couple of curiosities about 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.300
 this great appointment let's start 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.400
 inspiration this movie is the 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.410
 adaptation of a comic or graphic novel 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.690
 how do you want to tell which one is 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.670
 inspired in turn by a movie that 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.590
 in turn is borrowing many 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.570
 elements of a real battle like that is 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.059
 we go by parties frank miller the creator 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.860
 of the 300 comic book found inspiration 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.460
 for his work watching the movie of the 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.739
 300 Spartans tape from 1962 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.870
 this movie told the facts of a 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.729
 battle known as the battle of the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.860
 thermopiles of this work by frank miller 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:01.860
 is where this tape is inspired 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.689
 Directed by zack snyder preparation 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.760
 the script required that the 

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:08.040
 actors were showing the torso the 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.659
 most of the time therefore it 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.880
 they had to undergo training 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.189
 rigorous to strengthen the abdomen and 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.409
 the pectorals without counting the rigorous ones 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.150
 diets or combat readiness 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.280
 I now understand why so misshapen 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.229
 I had muscles however it is also 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.520
 known that there is a great challenge that of 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.280
 makeup to increase visibility 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.049
 of those cadres the production team 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.480
 it took approximately 2 months 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.990
 building the shields the spears and 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.180
 the 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.189
 however not all weapons were 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.439
 manufactured items were recycled 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.810
 the movies of Troy and Alexander the Great 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.820
 as an aggregate more than 600 were created 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.180
 Costumes and enough prosthetics 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.580
 to simulate the pile of corpses 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.860
 this film meant the debut of michael 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.780
 fassbender as a movie actor who 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.060
 is currently known for interpreting 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.789
 a young magneto in the movies of 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.110
 x-men the lies naider is the son of 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.360
 director of the movie 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.340
 zack snyder here in light who plays 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.190
 the children's version of the king Leonidas 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.649
 zack snyder is known for trying to 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.450
 reproduce almost in the same way all 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.920
 the comic scenes but to do the 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.540
 most attractive movie to an audience 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.370
 changes were made to the 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.620
 history as the creatures include 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.420
 monstrous and all these other changes 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.610
 they were backed by frank miller 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.980
 who was working as a consultant 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.900
 in all creative aspects though 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.790
 already the comic itself had enough 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.950
 changes to the original battle 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.560
 later we will talk about that the 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.930
 filming materialized in approximately 60 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.420
 days of which only 2 were taken 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.620
 out of the studio the movie had 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.000
 a great display of effects 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.819
 special when creating the 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.250
 aesthetics and the setting of the 1500 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.739
 shots about 1300 have effects 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.569
 specials likewise more than 10 companies 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.400
 different worked in the production 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.440
 of the effects making the 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.959
 post - production of the film will take a 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.019
 year approximately 6 times more than 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:01.110
 that it took to sign the tape will be used 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.940
 90% of blue screens and 10% of 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.040
 green because the blue squared 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.870
 better with the lighting the green was 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.060
 too bright and you could not 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.709
 highlight the red spartan layers in 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.079
 actually this tape was recorded 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.060
 completely in a studio and almost without 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.489
 no exterior historical inaccuracies 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.959
 if we know it's cool but this 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.150
 movie has more than a couple of 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.620
 historical imprecisions we know that the 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.569
 movies should not look like the 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.940
 reality but in this adaptation it 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.650
 they flew many times the fence in first 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.720
 here it is stipulated that the Spartans 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.459
 they fought almost naked and although that 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.560
 It may sound very appealing to 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.329
 girls really the Spartans are 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.129
 covered with a thick and heavy armor 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.260
 to fight but it's true that 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:41.910
 contributed in their red suits this 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.010
 so that the Spartans were 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.349
 -specifically highlights and threats 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.079
 for its rivals besides the red 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.849
 hid the blood of the battle one of 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.799
 the most chinky gas scenes when 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.780
 Leonidas kicks the Persian messenger a 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.459
 hole really did not happen 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.980
 historically according to the historian 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.140
 herodoto jerjes knows that the Spartans 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.420
 They were unfriendly to visitors or 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.129
 messengers and it was common to be 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.349
 will charge the clown so jerjes 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:09.659
 never sent a messenger to ask 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.940
 the Spartans who would surrender one of 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.769
 the most glaring errors to which it is 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.840
 attributes not only sneijder but frank 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.850
 miller is putting the Persians as 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.039
 barbarian beings in search of destruction and 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.870
 blood actually the Persians are 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:24.210
 known as a rich culture and 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.919
 extremely cultured if they have warriors 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.560
 but they were not close to being so 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:31.080
 disgusting like its 300 versions 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.970
 although it is said romantically that 300 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.830
 men detained an army of 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.590
 hundreds of thousands of people actually 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.419
 it is believed there were about 1,400 soldiers 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.240
 fighting among those who were in 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:44.310
 mostly light spartans and test 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.440
 piano fighting in the battle of the 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.470
 thermopile on their part the army 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.700
 Persian was around 100,000 or 150,000 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.650
 soldiers 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.140
 a little bit of historical inaccuracies 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.300
 for nobody is a secret that the movie 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.340
 It was a resounding success at the box office for the 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.290
 director zack snyder this would represent 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.990
 his second big production the first 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.550
