00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:32.940
 today, among other things, a lot of money 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.990
 remittances 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.289
 how much time do the banks allow themselves? 

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:39.820
 the next topic is not new but always up to date 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.260
 It's about transfers and the time how long the money goes from one to the other 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.920
 Bank is on the go because many of your bank statements in this regard are not accurate 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.970
 check 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.080
 can it ever happen that banks both of them not the customer but only 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.940
 have your own in mind 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.579
 but who resists it 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.579
 has good chances to recover some euros 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:05.950
 Harri Schmitt 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.000
 Being so multi-layered he feels cheated out of his former bank 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.590
 The entrepreneur has been running a small advertising agency for seven years 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.890
 Employees in the vicinity of Heilbronn 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.240
 For years, he trusted his house bank in finance 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.070
 Had business accounts 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.760
 but at some point and he became suspicious of whether the credit institution his 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.490
 Accounts feels neat 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.859
 He took a closer look at the account statements 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:38.509
 time and again the date on which inputs are booked on accounts 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.079
 and the time when the money was actually well written around 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.870
 several days apart from it should turn 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.550
 Significant discrepancies noticed that is percent and fonts are up to 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.550
 95 days late will be put 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.000
 Payment defaults up to six days premature 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.630
 and that is hiking 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.900
 to get closer and percent 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.550
 the appraisers had determined damage now solely through the representation of 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.590
 about 50 thousand euros 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.829
 because by transfers from customers in the opinion of Schmidt takes too long 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:14.349
 or credited too late 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.749
 were could unnecessarily long in the minus and the entrepreneur had accordingly 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:21.749
 overdraft interest numbers 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.229
 hans-peter a way is a freelance expert 

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:31.369
 He has already tested hundreds on behalf of private individuals and companies 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:34.219
 of bank accounts 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:35.639
 his result 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:38.859
 as long as transfer data is removed from the transferred value date 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:42.799
 other mistakes and in favor of the customer are not uncommon 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.040
 only a single account so Heidel had been accommodated so far that completely 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.040
 was done correctly 

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:57.829
 Customers of them usually complain that burdens immediately 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.029
 Courage writings but delayed hearth are put the harm of 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:04.399
 unnecessary overdraft interest arises 

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:07.890
 could be considerable even with private customers over the years 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.890
 Martha also does not believe in a coincidence 

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:14.779
 yes in my view clearly 

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:16.630
 about a manipulation 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.759
 because that's not something 

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:23.649
 extraordinary to make a hole and then correct 

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:26.699
 make 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:29.340
 so far, it's all about the question 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.149
 How long can a transfer then paint 

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:37.959
 The law stipulates that remittances are to be effected as soon as possible 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.959
 means the bank is technically possible so fast 

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:46.100
 but no matter if bonds or par accounts 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.060
 there is a generous statutory maximum period for a transfer 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.709
 within Germany it is three business days 

00:03:57.089 --> 00:04:02.589
 pbe on the customer's account must be no later than one business day 

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:06.649
 to be credited after receipt of money Banks like to refer to this 

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:08.269
 regulations 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.870
 and that the bank actually has money on an account faster 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.380
 It is difficult for consumers to prove that they can transfer money 

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:18.489
 The burden of proof lies with the customer 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.470
 Consumer advocates know the problem but also completely defenseless one is 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.319
 Not 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:28.409
 Always check moss on account statements and when i thought 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:31.960
 Considering it is not crucial the book and date is turned off 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.370
 You also have to inquire about when else had transferred and if then 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.419
 On the other hand, it is legal precedents that have lasted longer than three days 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.940
 Otherwise you can complain to the bank directly or at our platform 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.749
 use 

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:51.219
 Consumer advocates also advise in each case to keep account statements 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.400
 m especially with long-back booking errors with could be included 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.400
 Interest high claims against the bank may have arisen 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:02.970
 Incidentally, even in such cases, it is according to consumer advocates 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.630
 a limitation period of three years, however, only begins when the 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.750
 Customer knowledge of a mistake now raises in July Fatma n sold out to 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.630
 50 percent Harri Schmitt has because of the supposedly wrong leadership 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.919
 his business accounts to his paw wall 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.659
 but they only wanted to set a value retroactively in one case 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:25.389
 now the entrepreneur wants to legalize the bank's approach 

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:30.299
 Incidentally, at his current bank, he has so far no irregularities 

00:05:30.299 --> 00:05:30.339
 detected
