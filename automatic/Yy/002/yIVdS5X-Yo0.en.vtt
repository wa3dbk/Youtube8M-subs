00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
everything in there as well so I think

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.539

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
should be able to move forward here so

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.859 
should be able to move forward here so
now<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.189> everyone's<00:01:08.610> ready<00:01:08.850> here<00:01:09.180> let's<00:01:09.659> go

now that everyone's ready here let's go

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.320 
now that everyone's ready here let's go
ahead<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.470> go<00:01:10.680> forward<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.130> assume<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:12.030> think<00:01:12.060> we

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
ahead and go forward I assume I think we

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.000 
ahead and go forward I assume I think we
all<00:01:12.510> have<00:01:12.689> our<00:01:12.720> stuff<00:01:13.080> here<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.680> let's<00:01:13.860> go

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
all have our stuff here so let's go

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.820 
all have our stuff here so let's go
ahead<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.460> go<00:01:14.670> up<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.479> go<00:01:16.080> out<00:01:16.229> again<00:01:16.259> we<00:01:16.650> did

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
ahead and go up and go out again we did

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.249 
ahead and go up and go out again we did
switch<00:01:17.159> sides<00:01:17.490> completely<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:18.900> think<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
switch sides completely so I think the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.499 
switch sides completely so I think the
blue<00:01:19.470> team<00:01:19.500> should<00:01:20.340> possibly<00:01:20.820> come<00:01:21.090> out<00:01:21.270> of

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
blue team should possibly come out of

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.480 
blue team should possibly come out of
there<00:01:21.750> at<00:01:21.930> some<00:01:22.200> point<00:01:22.229> oh<00:01:22.650> yeah<00:01:23.009> yeah<00:01:23.189> the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
there at some point oh yeah yeah the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.890 
there at some point oh yeah yeah the
blue<00:01:23.670> team<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.090> right<00:01:24.330> there<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:24.750> they're

the frags and so we can also use that as
well<00:04:42.730> so<00:04:43.060> let's<00:04:43.480> see<00:04:43.660> this<00:04:43.840> let's<00:04:44.140> try<00:04:44.290> to

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
well so let's see this let's try to

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.250 
well so let's see this let's try to
let's<00:04:45.220> see<00:04:45.340> oh<00:04:45.370> they're<00:04:46.300> still<00:04:46.570> here<00:04:46.900> they

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
let's see oh they're still here they

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.170 
let's see oh they're still here they
still<00:04:47.620> have<00:04:47.800> some<00:04:48.070> lives<00:04:48.310> they're<00:04:48.910> probably

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
still have some lives they're probably

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.770 
still have some lives they're probably
somewhere<00:04:49.690> lurking<00:04:50.380> around<00:04:50.740> like<00:04:51.720> possibly<00:04:52.720> I

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
somewhere lurking around like possibly I

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.540 
somewhere lurking around like possibly I
don't<00:04:53.320> know<00:04:53.410> they<00:04:53.500> could<00:04:53.650> either<00:04:53.740> be<00:04:53.950> by<00:04:54.070> we

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
don't know they could either be by we

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:55.680 
don't know they could either be by we
gonna<00:04:54.730> we<00:04:54.880> don't<00:04:55.060> put<00:04:55.150> on<00:04:55.240> a<00:04:55.270> helmet<00:04:55.390> this<00:04:55.570> I

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
gonna we don't put on a helmet this I

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.510 
gonna we don't put on a helmet this I
feel<00:04:55.840> like<00:04:55.930> this<00:04:56.350> actually<00:04:56.800> helps<00:04:57.070> us<00:04:57.220> see

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
feel like this actually helps us see

alright so Paige was just out with the

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.320 
alright so Paige was just out with the
gravity<00:05:02.500> hammer<00:05:02.740> she's<00:05:03.250> getting<00:05:03.490> hit<00:05:03.640> so<00:05:03.670> much

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
gravity hammer she's getting hit so much

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.270 
gravity hammer she's getting hit so much
with<00:05:04.600> the<00:05:04.690> gravity<00:05:05.050> hammer<00:05:05.230> it's<00:05:05.500> insane<00:05:06.040> I

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
with the gravity hammer it's insane I

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.370 
with the gravity hammer it's insane I
wish<00:05:07.150> I<00:05:07.270> had<00:05:07.360> an<00:05:07.420> opportunity<00:05:07.660> to<00:05:08.080> get<00:05:08.230> the

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
wish I had an opportunity to get the

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.140 
wish I had an opportunity to get the
gravity<00:05:08.710> hammer<00:05:08.950> because<00:05:09.250> it's<00:05:09.400> like<00:05:09.490> a<00:05:09.520> giant

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
gravity hammer because it's like a giant

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.000 
gravity hammer because it's like a giant
hammer<00:05:10.390> our<00:05:10.930> Earl<00:05:11.110> was<00:05:11.380> just<00:05:11.590> shot<00:05:11.830> by

we<00:05:51.910> can<00:05:52.060> use<00:05:52.240> the<00:05:52.390> gravity<00:05:52.630> hammer<00:05:53.080> here

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
we can use the gravity hammer here

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.140 
we can use the gravity hammer here
alright<00:05:54.130> there<00:05:54.580> we<00:05:54.730> have<00:05:54.910> it
