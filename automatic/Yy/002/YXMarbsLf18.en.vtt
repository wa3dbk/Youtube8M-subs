00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
appear in the video description if you

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.440 
appear in the video description if you
check<00:01:23.000> that

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.109 

i<00:01:30.789> would<00:01:31.789> estimate<00:01:31.820> it<00:01:32.390> just<00:01:32.600> standing<00:01:33.170> about

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
i would estimate it just standing about

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.609 
i would estimate it just standing about
five<00:01:35.119> miles<00:01:35.450> from<00:01:35.719> what<00:01:35.960> I'm<00:01:36.049> filming<00:01:36.469> right

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
five miles from what I'm filming right

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:46.120 
five miles from what I'm filming right
now<00:01:36.880> maybe<00:01:37.880> four

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.770 

see<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.670> apparently<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.120> roughly<00:01:48.660> a

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
see this is apparently a roughly a

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.230 
see this is apparently a roughly a
quarter<00:01:49.020> quote<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.950> Coronado<00:01:50.340> area<00:01:50.940> local

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
quarter quote the Coronado area local

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.780 
quarter quote the Coronado area local
yet<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.660> think<00:01:52.470> that's<00:01:52.590> kind<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:52.950> just<00:01:53.160> passed

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
yet I think that's kind of just passed

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.870 
yet I think that's kind of just passed
cool

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.219 

I'm<00:01:58.880> sort<00:01:59.090> of<00:01:59.149> struggling<00:01:59.450> to<00:01:59.630> determine<00:02:00.079> what

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
I'm sort of struggling to determine what

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.260 
I'm sort of struggling to determine what
my<00:02:00.439> role<00:02:00.679> should<00:02:00.950> be<00:02:01.009> in<00:02:01.250> this<00:02:01.429> crisis<00:02:01.969> because

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
my role should be in this crisis because

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.880

away from what I'm focusing on in New
Hampshire<00:02:25.660> anyway<00:02:26.660> so<00:02:26.720> it's<00:02:26.930> occurred<00:02:27.200> to<00:02:27.230> me

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
Hampshire anyway so it's occurred to me

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.559 
Hampshire anyway so it's occurred to me
to<00:02:27.680> do<00:02:27.830> maybe<00:02:28.069> one<00:02:28.340> of<00:02:28.370> two<00:02:28.610> things<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:29.150> thought

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
to do maybe one of two things I thought

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.380 
to do maybe one of two things I thought
maybe<00:02:29.780> I<00:02:29.870> should<00:02:30.200> go<00:02:30.380> to<00:02:30.440> a<00:02:31.239> one<00:02:32.239> of<00:02:32.329> the

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
maybe I should go to a one of the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.420 
maybe I should go to a one of the
shelters<00:02:32.630> and<00:02:33.140> focus<00:02:33.440> on<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.950> the

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
shelters and focus on the the

government-run shelters and maybe also I

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.890 
government-run shelters and maybe also I
should<00:02:41.900> go<00:02:42.140> up<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.440> a<00:02:42.470> checkpoint<00:02:42.739> or<00:02:43.099> two<00:02:43.900> and

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
should go up to a checkpoint or two and

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.630 
should go up to a checkpoint or two and
just<00:02:44.959> see<00:02:45.290> how<00:02:45.319> that<00:02:45.739> looks<00:02:45.769> and<00:02:46.160> feels<00:02:46.370> and

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
just see how that looks and feels and

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.089 
just see how that looks and feels and
how<00:02:46.760> they're<00:02:46.940> handling<00:02:47.329> people<00:02:48.099> obviously

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
how they're handling people obviously

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:50.410 
how they're handling people obviously
the<00:02:49.370> mainstream<00:02:49.760> media<00:02:49.849> will<00:02:50.090> do<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.209> good<00:02:50.360> job

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
the mainstream media will do a good job

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.710 
the mainstream media will do a good job
of<00:02:50.629> filming<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.319> flames<00:02:51.590> which<00:02:51.950> I<00:02:52.069> just<00:02:52.220> did

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
of filming the flames which I just did

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.020 
of filming the flames which I just did
but<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.810> mainstream<00:02:54.140> media<00:02:54.230> will<00:02:54.500> do<00:02:54.620> that

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
but the mainstream media will do that

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.140 
but the mainstream media will do that
what<00:02:56.030> I<00:02:56.060> can<00:02:56.299> do<00:02:56.450> maybe

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.800 

these<00:03:00.150> are<00:03:00.270> handling<00:03:00.540> things<00:03:01.700> but<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:03.150> may<00:03:03.569> wait

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
these are handling things but I may wait

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.240 
these are handling things but I may wait
till<00:03:04.020> I've<00:03:04.140> got<00:03:04.290> my<00:03:04.440> equipment<00:03:04.830> problems

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
till I've got my equipment problems

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.360 
till I've got my equipment problems
resolved<00:03:05.550> too<00:03:06.120> much<00:03:06.150> more<00:03:06.920> another<00:03:07.920> issue<00:03:08.099> is

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
resolved too much more another issue is

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.760 
resolved too much more another issue is
getting<00:03:08.880> close<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:09.660> a<00:03:09.900> checkpoint<00:03:10.200> off<00:03:10.590> and

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
getting close to a checkpoint off and

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.430 
getting close to a checkpoint off and
means<00:03:11.390> clogging<00:03:12.390> up<00:03:12.510> traffic<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:13.080> little<00:03:13.319> bit

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
means clogging up traffic a little bit

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.220 
means clogging up traffic a little bit
so<00:03:13.739> I'm<00:03:13.890> reluctant<00:03:14.580> to<00:03:14.880> do<00:03:15.060> that<00:03:15.090> unless<00:03:15.989> I

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
so I'm reluctant to do that unless I

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.290 
so I'm reluctant to do that unless I
know<00:03:16.290> I<00:03:16.410> can<00:03:16.620> get<00:03:16.800> something<00:03:17.580> beneficial<00:03:17.880> to

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
know I can get something beneficial to

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.180 
know I can get something beneficial to
the<00:03:18.420> public<00:03:18.720> out<00:03:18.840> of<00:03:18.989> it<00:03:19.080> that<00:03:19.110> outweighs<00:03:19.680> the

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
the public out of it that outweighs the

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.420 
the public out of it that outweighs the
harm<00:03:20.400> of<00:03:20.580> kind<00:03:20.819> of<00:03:20.880> getting<00:03:21.030> in<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.209> way
