00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
to the tree pin blocks and all that then

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.560 
to the tree pin blocks and all that then
that<00:03:20.739> should<00:03:20.950> be<00:03:20.980> issue<00:03:21.400> about<00:03:21.730> you<00:03:21.880> fear<00:03:22.060> if

videos I make here helps you guys get a

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.070 
videos I make here helps you guys get a
better<00:05:08.760> perspective<00:05:09.120> on<00:05:09.510> how<00:05:09.660> the<00:05:09.720> room<00:05:09.960> is

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
better perspective on how the room is

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:16.379 
better perspective on how the room is
like

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:18.600 

so<00:05:17.020> if<00:05:17.409> you<00:05:17.590> are<00:05:17.680> thinking<00:05:18.069> of<00:05:18.280> maybe

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
so if you are thinking of maybe

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.140 
so if you are thinking of maybe
upgrading<00:05:19.439> from<00:05:20.439> the<00:05:20.800> normal<00:05:21.219> room<00:05:21.430> to<00:05:21.909> the

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
upgrading from the normal room to the

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.350 
upgrading from the normal room to the
executive<00:05:22.930> room<00:05:23.909> this<00:05:24.909> is<00:05:25.090> what<00:05:25.210> you're

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
executive room this is what you're

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.029 
executive room this is what you're
getting<00:05:25.689> so<00:05:28.050> this<00:05:29.050> is<00:05:29.169> the<00:05:29.289> corner<00:05:29.590> unit

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
getting so this is the corner unit

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:34.110 
getting so this is the corner unit
