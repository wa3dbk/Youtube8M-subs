00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.189
 and later 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.680
 to those dark circles and remembering for this 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.910
 requirement but also that commitment 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.910
 so big for your shapes 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.370
 and I was happy that the only thing that you 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.839
 they asked was environmental things and the 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.870
 vice president of the national company 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:52.610
 and your students how to ask 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.839
 why they were thinking about the environment 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.399
 you know what they did with their effluents 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:57.399
 why they treated us like that 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.220
 since they delivered in addition to knowledge 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.510
 the love for the profession that is 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.290
 important that each one of you 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.720
 loves what they studied 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.910
 the passion for the area and let's not forget 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.910
 dear students that intelligence 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:22.380
 that each one of you is a gift that 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:24.570
 have but kindness is a choice and 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.560
 that's what the training has 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.560
 integral 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:44.000
 in chemical engineers at the university 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.170
 of the years really is a pride 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.539
 great and it's also a responsibility 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.069
 because then we are going to be the 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.229
 that we're going to start demonstrating the 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:52.369
 university name after outside 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.829
 show what Tadeo is really 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.090
 in chemical engineering because we have to 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.860
 take it out but it's also a very good thing 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.479
 because we know we have all the 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.069
 tools to do it well all 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.259
 both teachers and students do not 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:06.500
 We were willing to experiment and 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.660
 last four and a half years studying what 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.129
 that one wants knowing that it is the 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.920
 first time they open a university 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.690
 and leave with so many learnings with 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.700
 so many lessons not only at the 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.700
 professional but on a personal level is 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.880
 gratifying because it has recognition 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.840
 already in all Colombia so many 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.180
 professionals who have left here 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.530
 to sense these careers about everything 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.610
 This marks the university also 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.870
 besides being excellent 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.489
 professionals the human quality that 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.379
 has every professional us being 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.700
 first production we are very few 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:38.239
 those that we are recording but then 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.750
 what's coming is going to be great this is one 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.750
 of the most successful programs 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.510
 has been projected today we have 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.730
 semiannually more than 100 students is 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.120
 the university of bogotÃ¡ that more 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.080
 students enter the first 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.080
 semester in this 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.799
 so that the three really 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.549
 jairo andrÃ©s de sal 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.980
 here 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:30.659
 jessica let's go 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.659
 I think the happiest 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.640
 and the beings
