controversial for a lot of people

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.979

going on backstage between those two all

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.180 
going on backstage between those two all
that<00:03:25.239> we<00:03:25.360> do<00:03:25.570> know<00:03:25.810> that<00:03:26.110> there<00:03:26.590> was<00:03:26.680> a<00:03:26.739> lot<00:03:27.160> of

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
that we do know that there was a lot of

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.710 
that we do know that there was a lot of
animosity<00:03:27.850> between<00:03:29.160> Mia<00:03:30.160> and<00:03:30.549> Brandon<00:03:31.390> at<00:03:31.570> the

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
animosity between Mia and Brandon at the

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.870

very beginning of the season I don't

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.520 
very beginning of the season I don't
think<00:03:34.000> Mia<00:03:34.530> was<00:03:35.530> that<00:03:36.310> easy<00:03:36.610> to<00:03:37.329> persuade<00:03:38.290> as

think Mia was that easy to persuade as

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.160 
think Mia was that easy to persuade as
far<00:03:38.860> as<00:03:39.220> what<00:03:40.030> you<00:03:40.150> thought<00:03:40.269> about<00:03:40.329> Brandon<00:03:40.989> I

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
the spices in the way of an apology but

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.699 
the spices in the way of an apology but
maybe<00:03:46.450> she<00:03:46.989> was<00:03:47.140> speaking<00:03:47.350> from<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:47.590> heart

that and the piece was very clearly

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:46.990 
a little bit of foxy here but there's

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.600 
a little bit of foxy here but there's
some<00:06:47.140> new<00:06:47.320> stuff<00:06:47.590> here<00:06:47.920> that<00:06:47.950> I've<00:06:48.130> never<00:06:48.310> seen

some new stuff here that I've never seen

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.120 
some new stuff here that I've never seen
before<00:06:48.790> so<00:06:49.180> that<00:06:49.330> must<00:06:49.630> be<00:06:49.810> what<00:06:50.380> Joey<00:06:50.650> put<00:06:50.920> in

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.130 
before so that must be what Joey put in

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.450 
before so that must be what Joey put in
I<00:06:51.340> wasn't<00:06:51.910> seeing<00:06:52.270> that<00:06:52.540> I<00:06:52.810> mean<00:06:53.710> they<00:06:54.220> could

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:54.460 
I wasn't seeing that I mean they could

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.090 
I wasn't seeing that I mean they could
nitpick<00:06:54.700> about<00:06:54.940> the<00:06:55.600> wrist<00:06:55.840> action<00:06:56.170> not<00:06:56.710> being

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:57.100 
nitpick about the wrist action not being

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.270 
nitpick about the wrist action not being
fluid<00:06:57.880> enough<00:06:58.150> blah<00:06:58.540> blah<00:06:58.780> blah<00:06:58.810> any<00:06:59.500> flexible

wrist<00:07:00.490> a<00:07:00.820> lot<00:07:01.270> of<00:07:01.390> falsies<00:07:01.810> choreographer

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:02.380 
wrist a lot of falsies choreographer

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.220 
wrist a lot of falsies choreographer
came<00:07:02.650> from<00:07:03.010> the<00:07:03.190> core<00:07:03.610> and<00:07:03.970> I<00:07:04.690> think<00:07:04.990> you<00:07:05.200> can

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:05.230 
came from the core and I think you can

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.290 
came from the core and I think you can
see<00:07:05.710> that<00:07:05.980> even<00:07:06.250> if<00:07:06.460> you're<00:07:06.490> not<00:07:06.610> a<00:07:06.790> dancer<00:07:07.060> but

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:07.300 
see that even if you're not a dancer but

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.030 
see that even if you're not a dancer but
you<00:07:07.540> had<00:07:08.110> a<00:07:08.140> lot<00:07:08.320> of<00:07:08.350> experience<00:07:08.800> watching

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:09.040 
you had a lot of experience watching

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.510 
you had a lot of experience watching
musicals<00:07:09.810> studying<00:07:10.810> dancers<00:07:11.440> and<00:07:11.800> having

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:12.520 
musicals studying dancers and having

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.300 
musicals studying dancers and having
some<00:07:12.880> exposure<00:07:13.240> to<00:07:13.450> that<00:07:13.690> and<00:07:14.230> I<00:07:14.800> just<00:07:15.070> don't

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:15.310 
some exposure to that and I just don't

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.610 
some exposure to that and I just don't
think<00:07:15.670> that<00:07:15.790> Joey<00:07:16.480> darlin<00:07:16.960> did<00:07:17.080> a<00:07:17.110> really<00:07:17.440> good

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:17.620 
think that Joey darlin did a really good

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:22.350 
think that Joey darlin did a really good
job<00:07:17.680> of<00:07:18.300> delineating<00:07:19.530> where<00:07:20.640> foxy<00:07:21.640> began<00:07:22.000> and

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:22.360 
job of delineating where foxy began and

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.110 
job of delineating where foxy began and
ended<00:07:23.050> and<00:07:23.500> where<00:07:23.980> her<00:07:24.160> contributions<00:07:24.820> began

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.120 
ended and where her contributions began

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.750 
ended and where her contributions began
ended<00:07:25.600> and<00:07:25.780> I<00:07:26.290> think<00:07:26.620> Randy<00:07:26.950> and<00:07:27.430> Evans

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:27.760 
ended and I think Randy and Evans

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.240 
ended and I think Randy and Evans
suffered<00:07:28.240> for<00:07:28.420> that<00:07:28.630> and<00:07:28.870> I<00:07:29.650> find<00:07:30.010> that<00:07:30.190> very

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:30.250 
suffered for that and I find that very

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.540 
suffered for that and I find that very
very<00:07:31.170> disappointing<00:07:32.170> and<00:07:32.320> of<00:07:32.710> course<00:07:32.980> the

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:33.550 
very disappointing and of course the

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:35.910 
very disappointing and of course the
judges<00:07:33.940> panel<00:07:34.210> is<00:07:34.780> not<00:07:35.110> going<00:07:35.320> to<00:07:35.380> say<00:07:35.590> that

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:35.920 
judges panel is not going to say that

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.740 
judges panel is not going to say that
especially<00:07:36.490> since<00:07:36.970> both<00:07:37.450> Mary<00:07:38.020> and<00:07:38.200> Mia<00:07:38.950> are

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:39.750 
especially since both Mary and Mia are

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:42.540 
especially since both Mary and Mia are
dancers<00:07:40.750> and<00:07:40.990> cobalt<00:07:41.440> maybe<00:07:41.950> not<00:07:42.220> now<00:07:42.520> but

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:42.550 
dancers and cobalt maybe not now but

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.060 
dancers and cobalt maybe not now but
they're<00:07:43.450> dancers<00:07:43.900> and<00:07:44.170> choreographers<00:07:44.230> as

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:45.070 
they're dancers and choreographers as

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:47.970 
they're dancers and choreographers as
well<00:07:45.310> and<00:07:45.720> they're<00:07:46.720> going<00:07:46.870> to<00:07:46.960> be<00:07:47.350> a<00:07:47.380> little

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:47.980 
well and they're going to be a little

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.640 
well and they're going to be a little
careful<00:07:48.460> about<00:07:49.180> stepping<00:07:49.660> on<00:07:49.780> toes<00:07:49.930> of<00:07:50.470> their

careful about stepping on toes of their

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.920 
careful about stepping on toes of their
colleagues<00:07:50.920> especially<00:07:51.370> on<00:07:51.820> the<00:07:51.970> show<00:07:52.180> people

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:52.930 
colleagues especially on the show people

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:54.840 
colleagues especially on the show people
they<00:07:53.080> have<00:07:53.200> to<00:07:53.350> work<00:07:53.560> with<00:07:53.800> and<00:07:53.980> not<00:07:54.460> just<00:07:54.700> on

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:54.850 
they have to work with and not just on

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:56.850 
they have to work with and not just on
the<00:07:55.000> show<00:07:55.180> but<00:07:55.390> in<00:07:55.600> the<00:07:55.810> dance<00:07:56.050> world<00:07:56.200> itself

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:56.860 
the show but in the dance world itself

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:00.540 
the show but in the dance world itself
because<00:07:57.310> it's<00:07:57.610> a<00:07:57.820> very<00:07:58.410> very<00:07:59.410> small<00:07:59.650> community

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:00.550 
because it's a very very small community

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:03.300 
because it's a very very small community
but<00:08:01.270> having<00:08:01.690> said<00:08:01.720> that<00:08:01.990> I'm<00:08:02.560> afraid<00:08:02.920> that

but having said that I'm afraid that

bottom three for the first time if it

bottom three for the first time if it
does<00:08:08.170> I<00:08:08.470> don't<00:08:09.070> think<00:08:09.250> they're<00:08:09.370> going<00:08:09.460> to<00:08:09.550> be

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:09.610 
does I don't think they're going to be

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:11.640 
does I don't think they're going to be
in<00:08:09.670> any<00:08:09.820> danger<00:08:10.000> of<00:08:10.210> going<00:08:10.390> home<00:08:10.540> but<00:08:11.350> this<00:08:11.530> is

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:11.650 
in any danger of going home but this is

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:13.950 
in any danger of going home but this is
one<00:08:11.800> of<00:08:11.830> those<00:08:11.920> instances<00:08:12.400> where<00:08:12.610> I<00:08:12.960> honestly

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:13.960 
one of those instances where I honestly

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.140 
one of those instances where I honestly
and<00:08:14.320> seriously<00:08:14.530> think<00:08:15.100> that<00:08:15.340> they<00:08:15.850> were<00:08:15.910> let

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:16.150 
and seriously think that they were let

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:17.180 
and seriously think that they were let
down<00:08:16.180> by<00:08:16.570> the<00:08:16.630> courtyard

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:17.190
