thing keep in mind this the racial

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.210 
thing keep in mind this the racial
factor<00:02:45.489> muscle<00:02:45.879> that's<00:02:46.540> very<00:02:46.870> important<00:02:47.410> the

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
factor muscle that's very important the

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.789 
factor muscle that's very important the
ratio<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.849> factor<00:02:49.269> muscle<00:02:49.629> is<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.780> key<00:02:50.140> to

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
ratio the factor muscle is the key to

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.369 
ratio the factor muscle is the key to
growing<00:02:51.040> always<00:02:51.370> to<00:02:51.700> get<00:02:51.879> your<00:02:52.090> body<00:02:52.329> and<00:02:52.659> see

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
growing always to get your body and see

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.220 
growing always to get your body and see
how<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.680> body<00:02:54.129> is<00:02:54.489> firming<00:02:55.299> up<00:02:55.450> if<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.930> body

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
how the body is firming up if the body

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.800 
how the body is firming up if the body
is<00:02:56.860> soft<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:57.730> your<00:02:57.849> training<00:02:58.120> consistently

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
is soft and your training consistently

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.020 
is soft and your training consistently
that<00:02:59.470> means<00:02:59.739> you're<00:02:59.950> breaking<00:03:00.400> down<00:03:00.430> more

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
that means you're breaking down more

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.270 
that means you're breaking down more
muscle<00:03:01.840> tissue<00:03:02.109> than<00:03:02.769> the<00:03:02.890> body<00:03:03.099> to

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
muscle tissue than the body to

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.729 
muscle tissue than the body to
compensate<00:03:03.519> for<00:03:05.489> so<00:03:06.489> actually<00:03:07.090> you<00:03:07.510> get<00:03:07.739> to

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
compensate for so actually you get to

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.880 
compensate for so actually you get to
make<00:03:08.920> it<00:03:09.069> very<00:03:09.190> simple<00:03:09.310> if<00:03:09.760> I<00:03:09.849> can<00:03:10.890> forget

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
make it very simple if I can forget

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.080 
make it very simple if I can forget
about<00:03:11.950> secrets<00:03:12.760> because<00:03:12.970> there<00:03:13.120> aren't<00:03:13.329> any

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
about secrets because there aren't any

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.460 
about secrets because there aren't any
that's<00:03:16.090> what<00:03:16.359> I<00:03:16.390> want<00:03:16.660> to<00:03:16.750> remember<00:03:16.870> there<00:03:17.319> are

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
that's what I want to remember there are

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.330 
that's what I want to remember there are
no<00:03:17.650> secret<00:03:18.160> of<00:03:18.370> youth<00:03:18.519> it<00:03:18.819> realizes<00:03:19.480> no<00:03:19.629> secret

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
no secret of youth it realizes no secret

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.190 
no secret of youth it realizes no secret
then<00:03:21.340> you<00:03:21.489> see<00:03:21.700> you<00:03:21.849> can<00:03:22.090> do<00:03:22.329> this<00:03:22.540> in<00:03:22.780> a<00:03:22.870> very

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
then you see you can do this in a very

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.800 
then you see you can do this in a very
measured<00:03:23.739> manner<00:03:24.540> because<00:03:25.540> you're<00:03:25.690> not

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
measured manner because you're not

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.960 
measured manner because you're not
looking<00:03:26.109> for<00:03:26.139> some<00:03:26.500> kind<00:03:26.829> of<00:03:26.919> big<00:03:27.190> explosion

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
looking for some kind of big explosion

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.990 
looking for some kind of big explosion
some<00:03:28.480> kind<00:03:28.750> of<00:03:29.160> dynamic<00:03:30.160> thing<00:03:30.430> that<00:03:30.609> you<00:03:30.730> take

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
some kind of dynamic thing that you take

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.940 
some kind of dynamic thing that you take
off<00:03:31.269> and<00:03:31.840> just<00:03:32.169> that's<00:03:32.349> gonna<00:03:32.560> do<00:03:32.799> the<00:03:32.919> job

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
off and just that's gonna do the job

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.909 
off and just that's gonna do the job
just<00:03:33.400> say<00:03:33.730> it's<00:03:34.090> no<00:03:34.269> secret<00:03:34.510> I<00:03:34.959> gotta<00:03:35.410> go<00:03:35.560> step

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:35.919 
just say it's no secret I gotta go step

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:39.420 
just say it's no secret I gotta go step
by<00:03:35.950> step<00:03:36.599> and<00:03:37.599> not<00:03:37.840> only<00:03:38.139> will<00:03:38.410> you<00:03:38.620> progress

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
by step and not only will you progress

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.199 
by step and not only will you progress
but<00:03:40.359> the<00:03:40.480> body<00:03:40.690> will<00:03:40.900> say<00:03:41.109> thank<00:03:41.440> you<00:03:42.209> so
