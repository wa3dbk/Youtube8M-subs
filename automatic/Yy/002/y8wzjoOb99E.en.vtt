debris<00:00:14.040> on<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.549> glass<00:00:14.969> itself<00:00:15.590> and<00:00:16.590> you<00:00:16.890> put

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
debris on the glass itself and you put

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.279 
debris on the glass itself and you put
the<00:00:17.190> resist<00:00:17.580> on<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:18.660> avoid<00:00:19.020> may<00:00:19.230> be

the resist on you avoid may be

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.370 
the resist on you avoid may be
scratching<00:00:20.130> that<00:00:20.310> glass<00:00:20.900> plus<00:00:21.900> it's<00:00:22.109> just<00:00:22.289> a

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
scratching that glass plus it's just a

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.300 
scratching that glass plus it's just a
good<00:00:22.500> idea<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:23.010> have<00:00:23.039> clean<00:00:23.519> glass<00:00:24.230> so<00:00:25.310> glass

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
good idea to have clean glass so glass

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.660 
good idea to have clean glass so glass
is<00:00:26.550> clean<00:00:27.080> the<00:00:28.080> next<00:00:28.410> thing<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.710> do<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:29.160> put<00:00:29.550> on

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
is clean the next thing I do is put on

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.990 
is clean the next thing I do is put on
the<00:00:29.820> resist<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.480> try<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.170> cut<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.650> in<00:00:31.890> advance<00:00:32.550> to

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
the resist I try to cut it in advance to

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.229 
the resist I try to cut it in advance to
roughly<00:00:33.649> the<00:00:34.649> size<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.460> glass<00:00:35.730> because

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
roughly the size of the glass because

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.389 
roughly the size of the glass because
this<00:00:36.420> runs<00:00:36.690> about<00:00:36.960> an<00:00:37.140> old<00:00:37.350> buck<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.890> half<00:00:37.920> a

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
this runs about an old buck and a half a

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.660 
this runs about an old buck and a half a
square<00:00:38.640> foot<00:00:38.969> now<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.890> hip<00:00:40.890> adds<00:00:41.190> up<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:41.640> i

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
square foot now and hip adds up so i

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.850 
square foot now and hip adds up so i
saved<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.270> scraps<00:00:42.570> for<00:00:42.870> nameplates<00:00:43.440> or<00:00:43.739> to

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
saved the scraps for nameplates or to

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.090 
saved the scraps for nameplates or to
patch<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.489> edges<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.879> things<00:00:45.800> it's<00:00:46.800> good

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
patch the edges of things it's good

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.830 
patch the edges of things it's good
don't<00:00:47.309> don't<00:00:47.730> throw<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.149> away<00:00:48.210> if<00:00:48.480> it's<00:00:48.600> any

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
don't don't throw it away if it's any

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.029 
don't don't throw it away if it's any
decent<00:00:49.590> size<00:00:49.879> ok<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:50.910> fold<00:00:51.449> back<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.809> top<00:00:52.800> of

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
decent size ok I fold back the top of

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.270 
decent size ok I fold back the top of
the<00:00:53.640> top<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.180> backing<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.860> I<00:00:55.860> turn<00:00:56.160> it

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
the top of the backing and I turn it

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.490 
the top of the backing and I turn it
over<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.789> hold<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.500> like<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:58.890> my<00:00:59.789> thumbs<00:01:00.120> and

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
over and I hold it like so my thumbs and

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.470 
over and I hold it like so my thumbs and
then<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.649> stretch<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.399> out<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.850> be<00:01:03.000> sure<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.239> don't

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
then I stretch it out to be sure I don't

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.429 
then I stretch it out to be sure I don't
have<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.960> all<00:01:04.080> cockeyed<00:01:04.589> somewhere<00:01:06.229> and<00:01:07.229> then

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
have it all cockeyed somewhere and then

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.830 
have it all cockeyed somewhere and then
I<00:01:07.560> just<00:01:07.880> for<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.939> heck<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.360> just<00:01:09.570> stick

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
I just for the heck of it just stick

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.350 
I just for the heck of it just stick
this<00:01:10.020> one<00:01:10.350> piece<00:01:11.100> down<00:01:11.369> then<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.760> smooth<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.240> out

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
this one piece down then I smooth it out

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.240 
this one piece down then I smooth it out
to<00:01:12.570> be<00:01:12.659> sure<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.260> resists<00:01:13.710> all<00:01:13.950> over

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
to be sure that that resists all over

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.969 
to be sure that that resists all over
the<00:01:14.340> glass<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.540> do<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:16.140> then<00:01:16.290> i<00:01:16.320> will<00:01:16.650> start

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
the glass and I do so then i will start

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.580 
the glass and I do so then i will start
smoothing<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.270> don't<00:01:18.990> like<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.229> use<00:01:19.439> a

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
smoothing it I don't like to use a

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.770 
smoothing it I don't like to use a
squeegee<00:01:20.070> as<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.909> think<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.270> squeegees

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
squeegee as I think the squeegees

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.350 
squeegee as I think the squeegees
stretch<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.380> weak<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.799> resist<00:01:23.250> as<00:01:24.150> you

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
stretch and weak and the resist as you

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.850 
stretch and weak and the resist as you
can<00:01:24.509> see<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:24.990> way<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.290> go<00:01:25.530> at<00:01:25.650> your<00:01:25.830> own

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
can see this way you go at your own

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.219 
can see this way you go at your own
speed<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.700> you're<00:01:27.270> feeling<00:01:27.840> if<00:01:27.990> there's<00:01:28.170> a

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
speed and you're feeling if there's a

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.749 
speed and you're feeling if there's a
little<00:01:28.439> piece<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.920> anything<00:01:29.310> under<00:01:29.549> there<00:01:29.700> and

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
little piece of anything under there and

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.480 
little piece of anything under there and
believe<00:01:30.119> me<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.329> found<00:01:30.720> like<00:01:31.650> grains<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.159> sand

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
believe me I found like grains of sand

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.830 
believe me I found like grains of sand
underneath<00:01:33.000> there<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.360> don't<00:01:33.509> know<00:01:33.689> how<00:01:33.810> they

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
underneath there I don't know how they

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.450 
underneath there I don't know how they
get<00:01:34.200> their<00:01:34.409> weather<00:01:34.619> there<00:01:34.860> between<00:01:35.040> the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
paper and the resist or what but I just

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.020 
paper and the resist or what but I just
go<00:01:38.310> as<00:01:38.460> slowly<00:01:38.850> as<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.390> resist<00:01:39.810> goes<00:01:40.880> that<00:01:41.880> way

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
go as slowly as the resist goes that way

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.550 
go as slowly as the resist goes that way
I<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.390> no<00:01:42.570> bubbles<00:01:42.990> or<00:01:43.229> very<00:01:43.590> few<00:01:43.860> bubbles

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.250 

turn<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:16.190> that<00:02:16.880> wasn't<00:02:17.120> as<00:02:17.600> clear<00:02:17.930> cut<00:02:18.050> as

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
turn it and that wasn't as clear cut as

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.530 
turn it and that wasn't as clear cut as
I<00:02:18.500> would<00:02:18.680> like<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:19.220> can<00:02:19.550> see<00:02:19.790> how<00:02:19.940> laying<00:02:20.270> it

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
I would like you can see how laying it

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:29.350 
I would like you can see how laying it
down<00:02:21.010> really<00:02:22.010> helps<00:02:27.730> sometimes<00:02:28.730> you'll<00:02:29.210> need

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
down really helps sometimes you'll need

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.810 
down really helps sometimes you'll need
to<00:02:29.510> make<00:02:29.540> an<00:02:29.780> expert<00:02:30.170> cut<00:02:30.410> course<00:02:31.400> I'm<00:02:31.550> not<00:02:31.730> at

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
to make an expert cut course I'm not at

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.840 
to make an expert cut course I'm not at
my<00:02:31.850> studio<00:02:32.270> work<00:02:32.660> table<00:02:33.110> so<00:02:33.370> it's<00:02:34.370> not<00:02:34.580> quite

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
my studio work table so it's not quite

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:42.700 
my studio work table so it's not quite
as<00:02:35.030> good<00:02:35.240> down<00:02:35.510> here<00:02:35.540> in<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.230> kitchen<00:02:41.560> but<00:02:42.560> you

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
as good down here in the kitchen but you

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.760 
as good down here in the kitchen but you
can<00:02:42.890> see<00:02:43.130> using<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.700> knife<00:02:43.910> against<00:02:44.620> just<00:02:45.620> a

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
can see using the knife against just a

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.860 
can see using the knife against just a
seemed<00:02:46.070> edge<00:02:46.280> of<00:02:46.460> glass<00:02:46.760> will<00:02:47.150> dull<00:02:47.420> it<00:02:47.600> so<00:02:47.810> you

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
seemed edge of glass will dull it so you

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.500 
seemed edge of glass will dull it so you
don't<00:02:48.200> want<00:02:48.410> to<00:02:48.500> use<00:02:49.280> a<00:02:49.310> good<00:02:49.730> way<00:02:49.910> so<00:02:50.270> just

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
don't want to use a good way so just

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.340 
don't want to use a good way so just
keep<00:02:50.720> a<00:02:51.340> designated<00:02:52.340> knife<00:02:52.720> this<00:02:53.720> or<00:02:53.960> to<00:02:54.110> go<00:02:54.230> in

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
keep a designated knife this or to go in

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.610 
keep a designated knife this or to go in
your<00:02:54.500> cabinet<00:02:55.010> okay<00:02:56.020> so<00:02:57.020> that's<00:02:57.230> pretty<00:02:57.530> much

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
your cabinet okay so that's pretty much

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.650 
your cabinet okay so that's pretty much
that<00:02:58.210> now<00:02:59.210> what<00:02:59.630> I<00:02:59.660> do<00:02:59.780> is<00:03:01.120> if<00:03:02.120> I'm<00:03:02.330> going<00:03:02.570> to

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
that now what I do is if I'm going to

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.740 
that now what I do is if I'm going to
use<00:03:02.870> this<00:03:03.470> glass<00:03:03.860> so<00:03:04.700> that<00:03:04.730> i<00:03:04.970> can<00:03:05.030> save<00:03:05.450> both

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
use this glass so that i can save both

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.190 
use this glass so that i can save both
pieces<00:03:06.140> of<00:03:06.500> it<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:06.890> use<00:03:07.130> both<00:03:07.460> pieces<00:03:08.020> then<00:03:09.020> i

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
pieces of it and use both pieces then i

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.990 
pieces of it and use both pieces then i
will<00:03:09.410> need<00:03:09.500> to<00:03:09.680> cut<00:03:09.860> what<00:03:10.040> I<00:03:10.070> call<00:03:10.400> a<00:03:10.640> double

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
will need to cut what I call a double

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.440 
will need to cut what I call a double
line<00:03:11.240> I<00:03:11.600> have<00:03:12.560> found<00:03:12.770> that<00:03:12.950> using<00:03:13.270> one<00:03:14.270> of<00:03:14.300> the

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
line I have found that using one of the

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.810 
line I have found that using one of the
fat<00:03:14.690> sharpies<00:03:15.290> on<00:03:15.500> its<00:03:15.710> edge<00:03:15.920> makes<00:03:16.370> about<00:03:16.670> the

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
fat sharpies on its edge makes about the

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.449 
fat sharpies on its edge makes about the
perfect<00:03:17.090> width<00:03:17.590> so<00:03:18.590> I'll<00:03:18.739> decide<00:03:19.100> where<00:03:19.430> I

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
perfect width so I'll decide where I

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.550 
perfect width so I'll decide where I
want<00:03:19.580> this<00:03:19.940> to<00:03:20.000> go<00:03:20.300> let's<00:03:20.780> say<00:03:20.989> we<00:03:21.230> want<00:03:21.440> it<00:03:21.530> to

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
want this to go let's say we want it to

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.330 
want this to go let's say we want it to
go<00:03:21.830> hoop<00:03:22.130> that<00:03:22.370> isn't<00:03:22.640> very<00:03:22.670> fat<00:03:23.980> want<00:03:24.980> to<00:03:25.190> go

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
go hoop that isn't very fat want to go

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.370 
go hoop that isn't very fat want to go
just<00:03:25.520> across<00:03:25.880> and<00:03:26.390> if<00:03:26.450> it<00:03:26.570> isn't<00:03:26.720> quite<00:03:27.080> fat

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
just across and if it isn't quite fat

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:34.900 
just across and if it isn't quite fat
enough<00:03:27.709> just<00:03:28.070> give<00:03:28.910> it<00:03:29.030> a<00:03:29.090> little<00:03:29.270> more<00:03:33.910> once

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
enough just give it a little more once

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.780 
enough just give it a little more once
again<00:03:35.209> you<00:03:35.360> don't<00:03:35.480> have<00:03:35.630> to<00:03:35.930> be<00:03:36.790> exactly

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
again you don't have to be exactly

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.380 
again you don't have to be exactly
accurate<00:03:38.150> because<00:03:39.790> you<00:03:40.790> can<00:03:40.970> follow<00:03:41.239> along

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
accurate because you can follow along

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.750 
accurate because you can follow along
and<00:03:42.050> then<00:03:42.320> compensate<00:03:42.770> on<00:03:43.160> the<00:03:43.280> other<00:03:43.430> side

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
and then compensate on the other side

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.580 
and then compensate on the other side
when<00:03:44.000> you<00:03:44.120> cut<00:03:44.360> so<00:03:44.870> now<00:03:45.020> I'm<00:03:45.110> going<00:03:45.290> to<00:03:45.350> cut

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
when you cut so now I'm going to cut

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.070 
when you cut so now I'm going to cut
this<00:03:46.480> with<00:03:47.480> my<00:03:47.750> super<00:03:48.470> new<00:03:48.650> grip<00:03:49.010> old<00:03:49.250> knife

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
with the cushion grip which is really

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.400 
with the cushion grip which is really
nice<00:03:53.300> if<00:03:53.540> you're<00:03:53.660> going<00:03:53.810> to<00:03:53.870> spend<00:03:54.050> a<00:03:54.230> lot<00:03:54.380> of

way your resist blast fits inside the

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
Griffin poker and

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.249 
Griffin poker and
pull<00:04:25.130> it<00:04:25.340> off<00:04:25.520> if<00:04:26.330> I<00:04:26.569> saw<00:04:26.840> that<00:04:26.990> there<00:04:27.169> was

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:27.259 
pull it off if I saw that there was

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:29.320 
pull it off if I saw that there was
something<00:04:27.530> really<00:04:27.860> narrow<00:04:28.310> like<00:04:28.910> say<00:04:29.090> right

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
something really narrow like say right

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.540 
something really narrow like say right
here<00:04:29.360> that's<00:04:29.780> a<00:04:29.960> little<00:04:30.229> narrower<00:04:30.590> than<00:04:30.710> some

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
here that's a little narrower than some

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.879 
here that's a little narrower than some
of<00:04:31.669> this<00:04:31.759> other<00:04:32.050> just<00:04:33.050> go<00:04:33.229> up<00:04:33.380> here<00:04:33.680> a<00:04:33.710> little

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
of this other just go up here a little

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:35.620 
of this other just go up here a little
ways<00:04:34.160> and<00:04:34.220> push<00:04:34.699> your<00:04:34.849> knife<00:04:35.030> against<00:04:35.509> the

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
ways and push your knife against the

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.969 
ways and push your knife against the
edge<00:04:35.780> and<00:04:36.759> widen<00:04:37.759> that<00:04:37.789> somewhat<00:04:38.979> remember

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
edge and widen that somewhat remember

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:41.680 
edge and widen that somewhat remember
you<00:04:40.069> don't<00:04:40.160> have<00:04:40.280> to<00:04:40.520> be<00:04:40.639> totally<00:04:40.880> accurate

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
you don't have to be totally accurate

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:42.969 
you don't have to be totally accurate
and<00:04:41.810> perfect<00:04:42.229> here<00:04:42.410> because<00:04:42.680> you're<00:04:42.800> going<00:04:42.919> to

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
and perfect here because you're going to

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:44.920 
and perfect here because you're going to
be<00:04:43.130> blowing<00:04:43.460> this<00:04:43.729> piece<00:04:44.000> of<00:04:44.180> glass<00:04:44.389> totally

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
be blowing this piece of glass totally

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.719 
be blowing this piece of glass totally
out<00:04:45.500> of<00:04:45.560> the<00:04:45.860> middle<00:04:46.099> of<00:04:46.190> it<00:04:46.370> and<00:04:46.400> then<00:04:46.580> you're

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
out of the middle of it and then you're

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.089 
out of the middle of it and then you're
going<00:04:46.849> to<00:04:46.910> be<00:04:47.030> working<00:04:47.240> on<00:04:47.569> it<00:04:47.720> later<00:04:47.930> so<00:04:48.289> just

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:49.099 
going to be working on it later so just

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:50.680 
going to be working on it later so just
kind<00:04:49.370> of<00:04:49.490> get<00:04:49.849> it<00:04:49.970> the<00:04:50.060> way<00:04:50.180> you<00:04:50.240> want<00:04:50.599> it

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
kind of get it the way you want it

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.120 
kind of get it the way you want it
because<00:04:50.810> you'll<00:04:51.050> be<00:04:51.080> changing<00:04:51.470> the<00:04:51.740> shape<00:04:51.919> of

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
because you'll be changing the shape of

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.659 
because you'll be changing the shape of
it<00:04:52.280> somewhat<00:04:52.610> later<00:04:53.110> now<00:04:54.110> if<00:04:54.440> I<00:04:54.889> were<00:04:55.099> to<00:04:55.310> just

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
it somewhat later now if I were to just

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.460 
it somewhat later now if I were to just
take<00:04:56.449> this<00:04:57.550> piece<00:04:58.550> of<00:04:58.580> glass<00:04:59.060> and<00:04:59.419> this<00:05:00.169> is<00:05:00.320> how

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
take this piece of glass and this is how

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.999 
take this piece of glass and this is how
a<00:05:00.500> lot<00:05:00.740> of<00:05:00.800> people<00:05:01.210> shaped<00:05:02.210> glass<00:05:02.599> and<00:05:03.009> just

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:04.009 
a lot of people shaped glass and just

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:08.860 
a lot of people shaped glass and just
cut<00:05:04.310> a<00:05:04.520> line<00:05:04.820> like<00:05:05.120> this<00:05:05.599> and<00:05:07.509> then<00:05:08.509> pull<00:05:08.840> it

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
cut a line like this and then pull it

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.680 
cut a line like this and then pull it
off<00:05:09.199> I<00:05:12.160> would<00:05:13.160> cut<00:05:13.400> through<00:05:13.669> this<00:05:13.910> of<00:05:14.300> course

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
off I would cut through this of course

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.930 
off I would cut through this of course
but<00:05:15.320> I<00:05:15.380> would<00:05:15.590> lose<00:05:15.830> this<00:05:16.070> entire<00:05:16.490> piece<00:05:16.759> of

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
but I would lose this entire piece of

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.839 
but I would lose this entire piece of
glass<00:05:17.180> it<00:05:17.479> would<00:05:17.570> be<00:05:17.690> blasted<00:05:18.320> and<00:05:18.729> it<00:05:19.729> would

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
glass it would be blasted and it would

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:21.460 
glass it would be blasted and it would
take<00:05:20.030> you<00:05:20.150> a<00:05:20.180> lot<00:05:20.479> longer<00:05:20.539> to<00:05:20.990> cut<00:05:21.289> through

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
take you a lot longer to cut through

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.710 
take you a lot longer to cut through
because<00:05:21.830> you<00:05:22.009> only<00:05:22.159> have<00:05:22.520> one<00:05:22.849> edge<00:05:23.330> of<00:05:23.599> the

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
because you only have one edge of the

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.930 
because you only have one edge of the
resist<00:05:24.169> keeping<00:05:24.919> the<00:05:25.009> blast<00:05:25.310> in<00:05:25.580> a<00:05:25.669> given

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
resist keeping the blast in a given

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.589 
resist keeping the blast in a given
place<00:05:26.800> so<00:05:27.800> that's<00:05:28.009> about<00:05:28.190> it<00:05:28.340> for<00:05:28.520> now<00:05:28.729> we<00:05:29.360> are

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:29.599 
place so that's about it for now we are

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:31.649 
place so that's about it for now we are
going<00:05:29.870> to<00:05:29.960> blast<00:05:30.199> through<00:05:30.830> this<00:05:31.130> as<00:05:31.370> well

00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:31.659 
going to blast through this as well

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:33.879 
going to blast through this as well
because<00:05:32.659> then<00:05:32.900> we'll<00:05:33.050> take<00:05:33.289> this<00:05:33.530> piece<00:05:33.860> and

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
because then we'll take this piece and

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.070 
because then we'll take this piece and
kind<00:05:34.400> of<00:05:34.460> make<00:05:34.639> it<00:05:34.669> into<00:05:35.030> some<00:05:35.240> unusual<00:05:35.810> shape

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
kind of make it into some unusual shape

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.830 
kind of make it into some unusual shape
once<00:05:36.349> we<00:05:36.560> finished<00:05:36.979> so<00:05:37.190> i'll<00:05:37.729> put<00:05:37.909> a<00:05:37.970> give<00:05:38.720> you

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
once we finished so i'll put a give you

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.499 
once we finished so i'll put a give you
stick<00:05:39.199> that<00:05:39.349> piece<00:05:39.680> of<00:05:39.710> resist<00:05:40.280> back<00:05:40.550> on<00:05:40.820> for

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:41.509 
stick that piece of resist back on for

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:44.320 
stick that piece of resist back on for
now<00:05:41.690> and<00:05:42.080> remove<00:05:42.889> it<00:05:43.070> when<00:05:43.219> we're<00:05:43.430> up<00:05:44.030> there

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
now and remove it when we're up there

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.480 
now and remove it when we're up there
blasting<00:05:44.599> so<00:05:45.500> we're<00:05:45.710> going<00:05:45.860> to<00:05:45.949> wander<00:05:46.280> over

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
blasting so we're going to wander over

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.560 
blasting so we're going to wander over
and<00:05:47.030> up<00:05:47.659> and<00:05:47.870> around<00:05:48.139> and<00:05:48.380> through<00:05:48.650> to<00:05:48.889> the

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
and up and around and through to the

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.959 
and up and around and through to the
blast<00:05:50.570> room<00:05:50.900> and<00:05:51.080> we<00:05:51.800> will<00:05:52.039> show<00:05:52.550> you<00:05:52.610> how<00:05:52.759> to

00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:52.969 
blast room and we will show you how to

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:55.570 
blast room and we will show you how to
cut<00:05:53.240> this<00:05:53.389> glass<00:05:53.750> into<00:05:54.229> and<00:05:54.500> perhaps<00:05:55.219> make<00:05:55.520> a

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
cut this glass into and perhaps make a

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.610 
cut this glass into and perhaps make a
few<00:05:55.849> levels<00:05:56.060> on<00:05:56.389> it<00:05:56.539> kind<00:05:56.780> of<00:05:56.840> like<00:05:56.960> mike<00:05:57.199> smart
