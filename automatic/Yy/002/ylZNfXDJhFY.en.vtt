print is really thoroughly saturated
with<00:02:20.609> ink<00:02:20.819> pretty<00:02:21.569> much<00:02:21.719> throughout<00:02:22.200> the

composition combined with a real
interest<00:02:25.019> in<00:02:25.489> detail<00:02:26.489> so<00:02:27.060> specific

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
interest in detail so specific

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.420 
interest in detail so specific
ornamental<00:02:28.920> details<00:02:29.579> that<00:02:30.000> he<00:02:30.180> elaborated<00:02:31.049> by

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
ornamental details that he elaborated by

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.569 
ornamental details that he elaborated by
introducing<00:02:32.430> variation<00:02:33.329> in<00:02:33.569> texture<00:02:34.169> and

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
introducing variation in texture and

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.069 
introducing variation in texture and
texture<00:02:35.579> is<00:02:35.849> something<00:02:36.719> that's<00:02:36.900> very

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
texture is something that's very

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.589 
texture is something that's very
difficult<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.859> describe<00:02:38.310> in<00:02:38.849> the<00:02:39.180> printmaking

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
difficult to describe in the printmaking

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.860 
difficult to describe in the printmaking
medium<00:02:40.109> so<00:02:40.379> this<00:02:40.409> is<00:02:40.709> one<00:02:41.370> of<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:42.150> kind<00:02:42.840> of

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
medium so this is one of the kind of

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.440 
medium so this is one of the kind of
virtuoso<00:02:43.620> touches<00:02:44.129> that<00:02:44.370> we<00:02:44.400> can<00:02:44.700> observe<00:02:45.030> we

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
virtuoso touches that we can observe we

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.229 
virtuoso touches that we can observe we
are<00:02:45.599> exhibiting<00:02:45.870> together<00:02:46.560> with<00:02:47.250> invited

are exhibiting together with invited
student<00:02:48.870> contributions<00:02:49.680> that<00:02:49.980> will<00:02:50.159> be

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
student contributions that will be

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.490 
student contributions that will be
exhibited<00:02:51.060> so<00:02:51.389> the<00:02:51.510> students<00:02:52.019> works<00:02:52.260> are

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
exhibited so the students works are

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.610 
exhibited so the students works are
created<00:02:53.040> in<00:02:53.280> response<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:54.269> the<00:02:54.780> ruo<00:02:55.049> prints
