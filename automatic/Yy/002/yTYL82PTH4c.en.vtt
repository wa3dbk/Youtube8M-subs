00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:16.499
 that other road users lighting your vehicle is 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:20.380
 consisting of headlamps of low beam headlamps

 and fog lights 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.099
 there are also signal elements the stock effect the 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.589
 turn signals and hazard lights 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:30.589
 today there are four technologies in all the 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:33.799
 standard filament bulbs dislodge discharge lamps 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.000
 and xenon lamps 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.550
 for your vehicle depending on the lights you should know that there is 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.160
 different in everyone expecting his whole 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.960
 so it's better not to go wrong 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.320
 the most common being asthmatics a lot of the 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.350
 auto headlights 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.010
 the tasks kate double laments team codes and lighthouses 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.500
 h 7 ethics dipped beam 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.260
 there is also the crew of the iss eyi h3 used for the headlights 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.440
 anti-fog 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.780
 the person w used for the position fire tongue 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.829
 but it's also true for much of the interior lighting as 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:13.280
 the trunk the glove box the ceiling light it was rare 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.310
 flashing employees are two men trying to watten there are 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.140
 of three kinds the white single then 21w 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.140
 the oranje and y 21 'w 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.050
 he had tried a double effect of the slightly bluish bm in the light 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.540
 is orange 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.540
 for new cars most lighting is by allogene 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.870
 it is inadvisable to take low-end halogen bulbs they 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.790
 in general have a life span far too short compared to their prices 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.680
 these women an employee not replaced when she no longer works 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.100
 to replace your employees there is nothing simpler provided that the 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.870
 constructor help us because easy access this one is less and less the 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.550
 case for new vehicles it is then necessary to demonstrate the optics to access 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.750
 to work 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.360
 here is the manipulation to make to change a bulb a lot of 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.540
 modern vehicles requires disassembly of the optics to access 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.440
 cash back 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.560
 indeed the catch 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.999
 ap 

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:11.999
 and disconnected the crisis 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.739
 to eclipse the small island 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.639
 pictet 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:19.639
 eyi indeed the employer 

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:24.349
 you will find that the base of the ampoulÃ© and still soggy with 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.529
 different way from one bulb to another so we can not 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:29.739
 the interchange team with another 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.739
 replaced the new bulbs 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:37.249
 to replace the shopkeeper 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:40.249
 and have plugged the crisis 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.879
 put the cover back 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.079
 make a habit of not touching halogen bulbs talking about bavaria 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.359
 always take talk pellet 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.529
 And now, voila 

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:58.209
 small tip do not forget that it is better to change the bulbs by 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.699
 earth to keep the same temperature and light intensities of each 

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:03.329
 side of the vehicle 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.939
 and always keep a bullet in your neck and in your useful life it can 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.939
 always serve and it's obligatory 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:11.179
 Let's go
