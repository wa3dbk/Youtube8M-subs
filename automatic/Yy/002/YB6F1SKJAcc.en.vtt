00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 at 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.750
 Hello dane everyone sowed it 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.400
 dead and happy to find you a 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.260
 again on my channel this time 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.520
 ci for a particular subject and 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.350
 for a gameplay is also 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.779
 particular then we go away talked about 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.310
 of the gameplay it's in league cf zy had 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.450
 water so we know you very well in 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.670
 liga is four against four 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.410
 so you'll see that this gameplay is 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.250
 pretty good or very good especially when 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.470
 we know it's four against 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.730
 four is a strategic point its 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.650
 class game there it is more precisely 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.760
 to be honest with you i'll you 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.860
 will bring him into the description I know 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.699
 that he has the smc he had first flash 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.350
 or paralyzing 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:46.720
 no matter what the scores are with you 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.000
 do you see them also a storm missile 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.379
 lightning and aircraft lots of things 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.489
 to tell you today really 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.170
 a lot of things so I tried 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.930
 because of being fast enough happening 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.460
 a few eight minutes to be honest 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.629
 first of all i'm going to be going 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.030
 honest with you so I'm not his 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.860
 partners with machinima ago there are two 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.620
 three days so what does this 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.390
 includes outside the remuneration of 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.650
 videos so already on this point there I 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.810
 will be very clear I will not win 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.460
 the 10000 euros a month far from it and 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.690
 and then this compensation i'm going to be 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.340
 honest with you will serve me 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.310
 certainly or make lots and has 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.509
 in quotation marks to my subscribers 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.310
 this mini pay that I can 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.840
 to have because in some sides 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.549
 it's mostly thanks to you that I was able to 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.710
 sign this partnership that is in some 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.719
 so the concretization during dream 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.490
 but the finality of a job that is 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:31.509
 recognized and it's mostly thanks to you at 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.890
 number that you are and to the audience 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.090
 concrete so thank you 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.149
 sincerely is the minimum that I can 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.710
 to do so is to pay back in lots 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.719
 that I could win in the future on 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.640
 my videos see the closed parenthesis 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:44.409
 today I wanted mostly treated 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.409
 of a subject that happened to me that you 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.759
 certainly happened to you too 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.380
 and I 'm going to bring in one of my 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.460
 compatriots you will understand after I 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.979
 will bring him in after you 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.170
 rest assured it is the passage of life 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.340
 on the xbox live of life if we can 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.619
 call it that, but at least 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.929
 relationships that we can have to life 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.329
 irl is the real life you lead 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:06.070
 every day so be aware that in 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:07.840
 for example on black ops it's more 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.240
 too much the case on these new games you 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.620
 could do some research on the live 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.910
 according to your region 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.800
 so that's what happened to me 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.970
 I did that it happened like that 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.040
 I was with my brother I was at 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.480
 bordeaux my brother was in the 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.000
 southwest much lower at home 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.700
 I started a game for two and we 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.070
 fell into a living room where there was a 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.690
 guy who had a pretty little nickname 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.250
 common and who began to speak in the 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.440
 salon actually my brother having in 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.480
 his gamertag number 40 and who is the 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.500
 number of my department 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.120
 he knows how to talk to us in us 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.420
 asking if we were indeed one of the 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.460
 moors 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.950
 my first reaction to me and my brother 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.780
 it was what wants us him 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.220
 knows the community sometimes she is 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.030
 a little angry so what makes 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.410
 what he wants when he still wants 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.180
 purple on the ratio or I do not know what 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.160
 then we avoided it in the group of friends 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.300
 and then not at all it turned out who 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.790
 simply called us because 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.950
 that he was in the same place as us and 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.480
 so that from one thread to another we will say 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.220
 we in hamburg thought why not 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.910
 playing together would cost 1 since they 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.520
 were from the region 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.200
 why not play together then 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.670
 how that's how it all evolved I 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.380
 do not go into details and the 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.700
 pound not know it's not interesting 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:16.360
 but it's mostly that he became at 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.860
 thread of time wire games a friend everything 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.360
 just so much that it's even 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.340
 come to my birthday this year 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.260
 two years ago I did not even know 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.440
 this title I do not even know who he was 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.600
 where he came from and thanks to them 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.670
 to this magic of xbox live is magic 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.610
 internet cheddar pu fall into this 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.820
 living room with this boy there comes to add 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.830
 in my friendly environment a person in 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.410
 more who's him so i'm going to stop from 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.180
 fight and present him sorry for the 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.210
 dog barking is always when 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:52.940
 I record here it is there with us 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:54.500
 hello roman hello then what are you 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.570
 first agree with everything 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.010
 that I mean yes I'm quite 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.640
 okay it's the same touch you want 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.640
 pay 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.350
 here I am romer I wanted to do 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.850
 intervene because to show I 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.770
 do not miss these truths you 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.710
 do not worry i do not have skype and before 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.900
 reading is everything for a friend 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.160
 which does not count the interest we have 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.930
 even been in spain two days ago we 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.700
 will not revive our lives with veils 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.739
 there is now a Roman you agree 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:26.450
 but hey, it's very often when 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:29.030
 even now often so that's true 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:32.510
 we 're not quite there 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.190
 is at km comic and we have a good half 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.040
 in the good half-hour drive we got it 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.150
 25 km 25,30 road focus 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.770
 which as for the series that we do not see 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.200
 we will not mess around every night where 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.169
 everything tiny but as soon as we can 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.760
 by the ubs at his job mine to 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:50.820
 accounts can have some free time 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.470
 to grant which is found and we 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.640
 still learns today 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.930
 to do how many years when we got 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.500
 crossed over that he was staying on black 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.120
 observe elite then it was on w3 so 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.370
 over a year and a half this subway theme 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.380
 was not good like that no it's mw3 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.110
 do you see you go thank you alex tv at 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:12.060
 web then at the very beginning of any beginning of 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:13.560
 mw3 certainly stayed maybe podium 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.090
 it was bullshit but I think 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.770
 it's early this month so yeah 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.530
 it is sure that their other is 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:23.760
 it's a care the scene ben on the beginning 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:24.630
 2003 and a half and so is this proof 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.570
 real 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.610
 honestly that we can transform 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.070
 meetings irl we have plenty of 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.230
 meetings held such meeting of the 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.030
 live forgiveness since ben me I knew 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.990
 my team like that I've never seen them 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.510
 in real life but I knew my 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.830
 team like that and Roman too from 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.390
 the needle has finally come to know the 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.160
 people and who plays and I know the 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.660
 people and who plays and romain 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.580
 but all this in a boon always 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.640
 on the live and interactive 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.050
 whereas rohmer is less well proved 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.390
 still inhabited only 25 minutes by car 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.980
 we thought why not to the point of 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.480
 unless I still have his rates 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.770
 free delictuel while Roman as 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:04.350
 it was when it was a huge screen 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:06.450
 it's true the proposal was that but 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.590
 it was still before doing 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.150
 drunk year since as it goes 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.320
 I was going to his house feel second 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.120
 joystick and then we play together and we 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.120
 did it by the way is good but we did it 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.470
 done so I do not know if you my 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.330
 subscribers or those who watch this 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.280
 video that does not necessarily help before the 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:23.130
 Machine that happened to you if this is the 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.810
 case you know very well at home end of 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.680
 month on this chain the space 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.960
 comments is reserved from 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.460
 interactivity and so do not hesitate to 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.630
 great pleasure to put if you do that 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.060
 happened this 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:38.010
 this factor to meet foolishly 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:40.800
 people in the living room and it became a 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.930
 friend even limit to the serious people brothers 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.170
 or just nobody I know 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.550
 nothing makes it become rohmer people do not 

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:50.610
 risk nothing they risk not coming 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:52.050
 no one here on the contrary we learn to 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.780
 to know each other we share a little more 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.070
 that's just become more 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.810
 a buddy that has become a friend here 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.770
 otherwise he will pour it would not have come to 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.170
 my birthday 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.400
 closed parenthesis that's seen from big 

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:06.450
 private domain when we will not tell 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:08.520
 all the things we do at two no 

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.080
 madam this is the real human proof to 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.160
 I wanted to approach it so it's true 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.200
 that it's very fast but it's a 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.090
 topic that I absolutely wanted to address 

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.680
 and especially avoid the person concerned 

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:18.350
 with me because this gameplay is 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.000
 finish it's going super fast 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:23.700
 this is the real proof that to read 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.430
 rl live or irl there are times a 

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:28.020
 very small gap that is necessarily what is 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.640
 sometimes nothing at all if it just comes 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:32.010
 to see a party in a living room 

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.780
 stupidly and optically or call and 

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:36.420
 it becomes a true friend all 

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:37.440
 just here is robert I find and 

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.390
 election I have the gameplay under the 

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.010
