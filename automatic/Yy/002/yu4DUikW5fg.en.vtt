00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.100
 i 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.730
 during extreme temperatures the sun 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.160
 the neglect of irrigation and compaction 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.740
 of the soil can cause great damage 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.119
 to the plants in our garden 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.740
 constituted by different species with 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:19.190
 obviously different ailment this 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.190
 season 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.090
 since the sun hardens the layer 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.220
 surface of the soil we must remove it 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.800
 to allow the entry of air water and 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.660
 nutrients to the roots we are going to 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.239
 decompact the soil so that the earth 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.430
 let loose fluffy we use a chest 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.059
 big for the beds and small for 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.059
 the flowerpots 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.510
 after breaking the surface layer 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.510
 we add lampa sand 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.550
 by eliminating stress the plant could 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.050
 recover fully or partially 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.640
 will start to grow from your yolks and 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.020
 little by little he will recover his 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.450
 basic functions such as 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.610
 photosynthesis and metabolism for 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.680
 facilitate this process the ideal is 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.330
 apply a stimulating day which can 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.630
 be expressed directly on the 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.630
 foliage 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.690
 and it is common for the grass to react to 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.340
 high temperatures turning straw-colored if 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.990
 is a product of lack of water because 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.240
 it could also be from the attack of 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.230
 fungi will appear in the brown spots 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.230
 irregularly 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.530
 they perform the same operation 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.530
 let's share and add lampa sand 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.969
 and then we apply fertilizer to 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.200
 meadows rich in nitrogen that will promote 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:54.200
 the formation of green leaves 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.250
 hope we wrote in our 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.230
 site because it has a pot of 40 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.060
 centimeters deep and you want 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.880
 know if it's enough to grow your 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.500
 clear tomatoes obviously the depth 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.690
 will depend on the species you want 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.700
 grow between more spaces you have to 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.250
 develop your roots more will grow the 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.870
 plant however 40 centimeters of 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.870
 enough depth for your tomatoes 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.560
 Clear 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.200
 It is recommended gift in several times 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.599
 a day for light to avoid 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.219
 formation of puddles remember that this 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.439
 program is available nadal you 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:42.239
 same point cl for you to review it and we 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:44.599
 send your inquiries been that 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.599
 be well
