00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.780 
said I'm not a big fan this Cape is
actually<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.350> lot<00:02:01.469> different<00:02:01.799> from<00:02:01.860> Batman<00:02:02.340> you

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
actually a lot different from Batman you

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.190 
actually a lot different from Batman you
can<00:02:02.939> check<00:02:03.060> out<00:02:03.180> my<00:02:03.270> baton<00:02:03.540> review<00:02:03.869> if<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.049> go

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
can check out my baton review if you go

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.469 
can check out my baton review if you go
to<00:02:04.259> my<00:02:04.500> channel<00:02:05.009> but<00:02:05.939> it's<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.180> lot<00:02:06.299> different

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
to my channel but it's a lot different

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.510 
to my channel but it's a lot different
Batman's<00:02:07.079> keep<00:02:07.530> us<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.740> lot<00:02:07.860> more<00:02:07.979> flexible

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
Batman's keep us a lot more flexible

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.609 
Batman's keep us a lot more flexible
this<00:02:08.700> one's<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.970> little<00:02:09.030> more<00:02:09.209> stiff<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:10.379> can't

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
this one's a little more stiff you can't

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.980 
this one's a little more stiff you can't
really<00:02:10.770> move<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.069> around<00:02:11.160> that

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
really move it around that

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.080 
really move it around that
but<00:02:12.380> I<00:02:12.410> like<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.800> black<00:02:13.010> s<00:02:13.250> on<00:02:13.490> that<00:02:13.910> back

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
but I like the black s on that back

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.600 
but I like the black s on that back
though<00:02:14.330> that's<00:02:14.900> pretty<00:02:15.110> cool<00:02:15.320> and<00:02:15.650> there's<00:02:16.580> a

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
though that's pretty cool and there's a

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.450 
though that's pretty cool and there's a
little<00:02:16.790> bit<00:02:16.970> color<00:02:17.510> wash<00:02:18.470> over<00:02:18.920> here<00:02:19.130> also<00:02:19.430> I

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
little bit color wash over here also I

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.350 
little bit color wash over here also I
don't<00:02:19.550> like<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:19.790> really<00:02:19.880> see<00:02:20.210> that<00:02:22.360> it's

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
don't like to really see that it's

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.030 
don't like to really see that it's
really<00:02:23.570> hard<00:02:23.780> to<00:02:23.840> tell<00:02:24.050> on<00:02:24.260> this<00:02:24.440> but<00:02:24.740> then<00:02:24.890> in

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
really hard to tell on this but then in

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.200 
really hard to tell on this but then in
person<00:02:25.250> you<00:02:25.460> could<00:02:25.610> definitely<00:02:25.730> see<00:02:26.060> it

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
person you could definitely see it

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.470 
person you could definitely see it
there's<00:02:26.780> a<00:02:26.810> little<00:02:26.900> bit<00:02:27.050> darker<00:02:27.410> on<00:02:27.560> top<00:02:27.770> here

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
there's a little bit darker on top here

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.520 
there's a little bit darker on top here
what<00:02:29.480> definitely<00:02:29.780> really<00:02:29.930> nice<00:02:30.110> you<00:02:30.320> can<00:02:30.350> see

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530

either's all over the body as you see
the<00:03:14.690> small<00:03:14.900> line<00:03:15.140> ridges<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:16.160> belts<00:03:16.460> really

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
the small line ridges the belts really

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.280 
the small line ridges the belts really
nice<00:03:16.850> -<00:03:17.090> I<00:03:17.120> like<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:17.480> belt<00:03:17.690> it<00:03:17.780> sags<00:03:18.050> down<00:03:18.200> a

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
nice - I like the belt it sags down a

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.080 
nice - I like the belt it sags down a
little<00:03:18.470> bit<00:03:18.620> in<00:03:18.740> the<00:03:18.800> middle<00:03:18.950> it's<00:03:19.550> rubber<00:03:19.880> you

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
little bit in the middle it's rubber you

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.240 
little bit in the middle it's rubber you
can<00:03:20.120> feel<00:03:20.390> this<00:03:20.480> rubber<00:03:20.810> but<00:03:21.170> it's<00:03:22.070> pretty

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
can feel this rubber but it's pretty

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.100 
can feel this rubber but it's pretty
welded<00:03:22.730> on<00:03:22.850> to<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.150> body<00:03:23.360> it's<00:03:23.600> not<00:03:23.750> like<00:03:23.960> an

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
welded on to the body it's not like an

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.590 
welded on to the body it's not like an
attachment<00:03:24.410> like<00:03:24.620> a<00:03:24.710> belt<00:03:25.100> like<00:03:25.370> say<00:03:26.300> like<00:03:26.480> one

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
attachment like a belt like say like one

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.090 
attachment like a belt like say like one
of<00:03:26.690> these<00:03:26.840> you<00:03:27.230> know<00:03:27.350> you<00:03:27.380> could<00:03:27.740> take<00:03:27.890> it<00:03:28.010> off

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
of these you know you could take it off

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.800 
of these you know you could take it off
eventually<00:03:28.700> I<00:03:28.880> don't<00:03:29.300> feel<00:03:29.420> like<00:03:29.570> I<00:03:29.660> don't

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
eventually I don't feel like I don't

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.720 
eventually I don't feel like I don't
think<00:03:29.930> you<00:03:29.990> can<00:03:30.080> take<00:03:30.230> this<00:03:30.380> off<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:31.460> chest

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
think you can take this off the chest

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.450 
think you can take this off the chest
the<00:03:32.150> S<00:03:32.270> on<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.540> chest<00:03:32.810> is<00:03:33.280> plastic<00:03:34.280> it's

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:34.460 
the S on the chest is plastic it's

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.190 
the S on the chest is plastic it's
pretty<00:03:34.670> hard<00:03:34.820> plastic<00:03:35.240> you<00:03:35.510> can't<00:03:35.720> take<00:03:36.080> it

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
pretty hard plastic you can't take it

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.940 
pretty hard plastic you can't take it
off<00:03:36.490> and<00:03:37.720> as<00:03:38.720> is<00:03:38.900> it<00:03:38.990> creates<00:03:39.350> a<00:03:39.410> new<00:03:39.560> looking<00:03:39.770> s

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
off and as is it creates a new looking s

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.790 
off and as is it creates a new looking s
