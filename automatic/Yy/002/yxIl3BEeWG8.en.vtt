00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.910
 Servus by popular request of the user 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.090
 but I'll do a video today 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.469
 I think about my leather suit 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:14.849
 my bmw s 1000 teacher had 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:47.879
 and be less funny feeling 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:54.480
 to be in there again where I am 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:56.940
 then the fracture had discovered her 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.800
 a significant premiums I had the 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.210
 armor not on head as it gets worse 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:07.439
 Unfortunately, they have become the ones 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:11.210
 written down but not synonymous 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.210
 lying directly on is nothing at all 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.250
 Of course, it is also completely and 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.939
 on the leg down here which is very funny 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.909
 This hole can see very nice 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.060
 it is really through and i have here 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.060
 in 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.190
 something has gone through this 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.900
 the combination and I seemed to be on rails 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:48.210
 pressed what I also many weeks 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:51.360
 after that has hurt a lot over the 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.640
 border in the form of boots that has to happen 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.710
 I do not know if that's the footsteps 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.710
 I was not sure 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.470
 otherwise the combination has really itself 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:14.989
 strayed and I think he has too 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.280
 His job certainly turns into a job 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.569
 shoemakers bring that up 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.640
 look what you can do that 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.100
 At least do it again 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.510
 whole and you should go back a few 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.800
 received a thousand kilometers 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.800
 until then servus
