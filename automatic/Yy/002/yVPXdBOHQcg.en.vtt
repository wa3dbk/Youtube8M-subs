00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.749
 On the 22nd of May 2006 the free University of Bochum was founded 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:33.239
 during the public Senate meeting on tuition fees in the Audimax 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.020
 missed that day finally become clear that the 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:39.880
 existing university system is in a deep crisis 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.460
 Universities are not allowed to get a training place not with the 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.380
 Founding thoughts of the broadest possible education serve but above all 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.170
 the interests of industry 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.070
 Therefore, it is high time to implement alternative concepts of higher education 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.200
 Kuno Misha lives with her on the principles of free education 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.180
 to return 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.850
 Be assured tenant then we remain two perspectives 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.170
 Firstly, I would not skimp on badly paid raving 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.590
 or second, I quit my apartment and see that Campos GP Ahlen 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.350
 and for a life without running water and without electricity sideways years super 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.820
 States another problem 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.480
 it is a fixed that is what it means in the current occupation of higher education policy 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.460
 that the administrative organs of the student and simply eat with 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.600
 Feet kicking red after that they will just have everything depend on student 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.570
 representatives 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.740
 the administration in Baghdad alternative proposals 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.479
 Under Excel would have understanding if criticism he held that for the 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.300
 Rhineland police violence from the neck 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.789
 the first window climbed on 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.220
 future development of the new universities 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.230
 the wide fee debate in the summer semester clearly showed how 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.980
 Strongly the need for the greatest possible participation of one 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.980
 critical public on this topic 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.619
 More than 1,500 students and universities employees participate in one 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.230
 open discussion event in early May 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.350
 and more than 2,000 university members when having the following senses 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.619
 That's why it would be a scandal if a meeting in the Audimax 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.590
 final fees decision in Bochum calculated in the 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.799
 Semester holidays is brought about 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.959
 The pisa study shows that the same time in German 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.399
 Educational system is already an illusion 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:27.369
 I'll be right from the distance entire education tuition 

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:31.069
 punish 7 which in spite of poor financial resources on one 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.599
 Get involved in studies 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.939
 if Christians are not only students but also employees 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:40.199
 as employees and I speak here now also lead much of the 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:41.949
 Employees of the University 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:46.739
 is that so we fear that by the introduction of 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.329
 Tuition fees will be less students at the university and that has 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.439
 then also direct impact on our jobs and we 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:58.879
 In the medium or long term, they are worried about jobs even further 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:03.119
 are degraded beyond what already happens now as the 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:06.309
 Employees and also as trade unionists 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:10.749
 a little against the introduction of tuition and would like the Senate 

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:12.549
 ask 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.139
 to demand votes and tuition fees 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.299
 to support this concern when the students are free 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.309
 University still at Berlin 

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:24.849
 especially since it is about more than tuition 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.059
 In January, the so-called University Freedom Act comes into force 

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:31.499
 opened with a privatization of NLB Unis door and gate 

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:36.239
 The so-called Freedom of the University Act has in fact not been for the 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.079
 There is little to be done for universities 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.150
 This means that higher education institutions are relinquishing their financial responsibility 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.959
 Above all, that means that there will be no benefits for you 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.659
 Subsidies of the country will be further reduced 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:51.059
 moreover, according to the so-called village guards, they would have killed 

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:53.959
 the colleges in future in the university competition will be the 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:54.780
 mainly 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.720
 So busy with people from the economy are walking with the dog 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.750
 have nothing to do with the tuition fees 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.889
 m and the University Freedom Act tries the state government 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:07.209
 the responsibility for ensuring a quality teacher 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.339
 at college and students I think that percent 

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:12.919
 I do that very much 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.819
 the DRK air against tuition fees 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.909
 continues to be actively and intensively continued because that can be easy 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:22.330
 not be that we stand next to such an important topic and 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.899
 Germany right while angels like social justice and freedom 

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:28.979
 Gradually the kick-off will be the Senators 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.750
 need to be aware of that 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.060
 getting ahead - consists of innumerable protection from court 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.159
 Educational biographies destroyed 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:41.909
 general tuition fees then in particular a slap in the face of 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:44.909
 op from financially weak families 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.409
 They really can every man 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:54.419
 the educational career she would have disturbing with alleged decision 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.419
 we also see the eyes 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:09.710
 absolutely none 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.710
 No cock
