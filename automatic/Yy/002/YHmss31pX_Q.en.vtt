 In this video, we'll introduce three files to help you easily move your GoPro camera. 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:16.470
 The method of transferring to a computer. You can take advantage of GoPro Studio, card reader or other on your computer 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:23.170
 application. GoPro's free desktop software, GoPro Studio, automates the import process. 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:29.350
 First, download this software from gopro.com and open it on your computer. 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.940
 Then turn on your GoPro camera and connect it to your computer using the included USB cable. 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:47.340
 Enter the name of your computer and select the location where you want to save the file. If you like, 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.699
 You can set Studio Importer to be after importing media files 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:58.149
 Automatically delete files from the memory card. GoPro Importer will then import from the memory card 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:04.269
 Photos and videos. If you choose not to automatically delete these files from the memory card after importing, 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:11.530
 You can choose to keep or delete them after the import is complete. GoPro Studio will follow the date, camera and 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:18.190
 The patterns used are arranged in these files. The imported file is now on GoPro Studio and on your computer. 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.430
 If you want to transfer files manually, but on the desktop or in the Finder on your Mac 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.500
 I didn't see the SD card of the camera, don't worry, this phenomenon is completely normal. 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.960
 The camera has been designed to automatically transfer files to a computer. 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.630
 smart device. If you prefer to transfer files manually, this is not a problem. Just 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:54.300
 Close the auto-importer in GoPro Studio and insert the memory card into the card reader or 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:01.830
 Or an adapter. The camera's memory card appears as a removable drive on your computer. then, 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.850
 You can view the files manually and copy them to your computer. The last import option is to take advantage of 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.780
 Applications such as Image Capture, iPhoto, or Autoplay. Use these apps, 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.280
 You can automatically import files to your computer. If you are a Mac user, connect your camcorder to your computer. 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.960
 Then turn on the camera. Open Image Capture, iPhoto or your favorite application. 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.080
 Typically, you can set the selected app to 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.270
 Open the default app for GoPro content. This way, each time you connect your camcorder to your computer, 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.810
 The default application will open so you can easily import GoPro camera files. 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.640
 If you are a Windows user, simply connect your camera to your computer and select
