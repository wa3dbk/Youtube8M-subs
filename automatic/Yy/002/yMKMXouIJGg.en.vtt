hey guys Sebastian here so now that I
have<00:00:02.429> two<00:00:02.700> different<00:00:02.939> microphones<00:00:03.720> the<00:00:04.259> rode

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
have two different microphones the rode

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.460 
have two different microphones the rode
videomic<00:00:04.890> pro<00:00:05.130> and<00:00:05.609> the<00:00:05.819> zoom<00:00:06.000> h1<00:00:06.240> I<00:00:06.720> wanted<00:00:07.350> to

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
videomic pro and the zoom h1 I wanted to

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.560 
videomic pro and the zoom h1 I wanted to
try<00:00:07.799> out<00:00:07.830> which<00:00:08.429> microphone<00:00:08.940> would<00:00:09.300> be<00:00:09.450> the

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
try out which microphone would be the

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.709 
try out which microphone would be the
best<00:00:09.780> to<00:00:10.290> use<00:00:10.469> as<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.769> voice<00:00:11.040> over<00:00:11.280> microphone

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:11.719 
best to use as a voice over microphone

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.900 
best to use as a voice over microphone
keep<00:00:12.719> in<00:00:12.870> mind<00:00:13.110> that<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:13.679> do<00:00:14.070> these<00:00:14.250> tests<00:00:14.730> in

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
keep in mind that I do these tests in

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.180 
keep in mind that I do these tests in
this<00:00:15.179> bedroom<00:00:15.509> so<00:00:16.289> you<00:00:16.320> will<00:00:16.680> hear<00:00:16.890> some

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
this bedroom so you will hear some

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.700 
this bedroom so you will hear some
reverb<00:00:17.789> from<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.270> room<00:00:18.480> but<00:00:19.020> that's<00:00:19.230> because

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
reverb from the room but that's because

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.560 
reverb from the room but that's because
I<00:00:20.070> want<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.430> use<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.760> microphones<00:00:21.210> in<00:00:21.330> this

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
I want to use the microphones in this

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.200 
I want to use the microphones in this
scenario<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:22.350> can't<00:00:22.920> afford<00:00:23.160> something<00:00:23.789> like<00:00:24.180> a

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
scenario I can't afford something like a

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.380 
scenario I can't afford something like a
studio<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:25.529> this<00:00:25.800> will<00:00:26.039> be<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.430> place<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.330> I

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
studio so this will be the place that I

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.470 
studio so this will be the place that I
will<00:00:27.660> do<00:00:27.810> my<00:00:28.080> voice<00:00:28.289> over<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.429> future<00:00:29.970> so

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
will do my voice over in the future so

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.150 
will do my voice over in the future so
that's<00:00:30.660> why<00:00:30.869> I'm<00:00:30.990> testing<00:00:31.439> them<00:00:31.560> right<00:00:31.800> here

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
that's why I'm testing them right here

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.790 
that's why I'm testing them right here
so<00:00:32.759> let's<00:00:33.000> immediately<00:00:33.840> just<00:00:34.110> jump<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.770> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
so let's immediately just jump to the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.950 
so let's immediately just jump to the
voiceover<00:00:35.700> tests<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.270> then<00:00:36.510> we'll<00:00:36.660> see<00:00:36.840> the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
voiceover tests and then we'll see the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.900 
voiceover tests and then we'll see the
conclusion<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.800> words<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.489> I'm<00:00:38.610> recording

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
conclusion of the words so I'm recording

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.760 
conclusion of the words so I'm recording

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
when it comes to equalizing microphones

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.800 
when it comes to equalizing microphones
but<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.430> will<00:01:47.670> give<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.060> kind<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.450> an<00:01:48.600> idea

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
but this will give you kind of an idea

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.600 
but this will give you kind of an idea
how<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.500> will<00:01:49.740> sound<00:01:49.950> off<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.430> some

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
how it will sound off to some

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.030 
how it will sound off to some
post-processing<00:01:51.439> what<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.470> can<00:01:52.710> conclude

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
post-processing what I can conclude

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.670 
post-processing what I can conclude
after<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:53.909> video<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.630> one<00:01:55.229> I'm<00:01:55.500> not

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
after this video is that one I'm not

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.679 
after this video is that one I'm not
that<00:01:55.890> great<00:01:56.070> at<00:01:56.189> equalizing<00:01:57.000> microphones<00:01:57.509> and

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
that great at equalizing microphones and

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.870 
that great at equalizing microphones and
two<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.350> think<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.979> rode<00:01:59.159> videomic<00:01:59.670> pro

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
two I think that the rode videomic pro

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.300 
two I think that the rode videomic pro
sounds<00:02:00.479> better<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.990> think<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.829> sounds<00:02:02.159> better

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
sounds better I think it sounds better

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.100 
sounds better I think it sounds better
because<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.909> sounds<00:02:03.240> more<00:02:03.420> like<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.659> radio

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
because it sounds more like a radio

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.160 
because it sounds more like a radio
voice<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.740> has<00:02:04.920> more<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.759> deep<00:02:06.030> sound

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
voice it has more of a deep sound

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.350 
voice it has more of a deep sound
and<00:02:07.259> also<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:08.099> can<00:02:08.310> filter<00:02:08.580> out<00:02:08.700> my<00:02:09.060> voice

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
and also it can filter out my voice

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.199 
and also it can filter out my voice
better<00:02:09.929> than<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.319> zoom<00:02:10.500> h1<00:02:10.970> also<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.000> think

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
better than the zoom h1 also I think

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.390 
better than the zoom h1 also I think
it's<00:02:12.540> more<00:02:12.750> handy<00:02:13.319> to<00:02:13.500> use<00:02:13.709> because<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.220> has

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
it's more handy to use because it has

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.699 
it's more handy to use because it has
this<00:02:14.580> built-in<00:02:15.030> shock<00:02:15.360> mount<00:02:15.660> which<00:02:15.959> means

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
this built-in shock mount which means

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.339 
this built-in shock mount which means
that<00:02:16.980> noises<00:02:17.459> from<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.849> computer<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.450> noises

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
that noises from the computer and noises

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.760 
that noises from the computer and noises
from<00:02:19.560> for<00:02:20.370> example<00:02:20.430> my<00:02:20.880> hands<00:02:21.239> getting<00:02:21.989> onto

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
from for example my hands getting onto

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.190 
from for example my hands getting onto
this<00:02:23.130> desk<00:02:23.430> you<00:02:24.120> don't<00:02:24.480> really<00:02:24.660> hear<00:02:24.989> that

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
this desk you don't really hear that

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.670 
this desk you don't really hear that
that<00:02:25.380> much<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:26.010> as<00:02:26.790> if<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.420> were<00:02:27.630> using<00:02:27.930> the

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
that much and as if you were using the

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.100 
that much and as if you were using the
zoom<00:02:28.890> h1<00:02:29.100> so<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:29.910> can<00:02:30.090> buy<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.330> shock<00:02:30.660> mount<00:02:30.840> for

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
zoom h1 so you can buy a shock mount for

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.410 
zoom h1 so you can buy a shock mount for
the<00:02:31.200> zoom<00:02:31.380> h1<00:02:31.530> but<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.160> will<00:02:32.370> mean<00:02:33.000> that<00:02:33.030> it

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
the zoom h1 but that will mean that it

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.400 
the zoom h1 but that will mean that it
becomes<00:02:33.810> more<00:02:34.080> expensive<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:35.870> so<00:02:36.870> still

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
becomes more expensive and so still

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.610 
becomes more expensive and so still
after<00:02:38.010> hearing<00:02:38.400> this<00:02:38.550> I<00:02:38.790> think<00:02:38.849> that<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.840> both

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
after hearing this I think that the both

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.949 
after hearing this I think that the both
microphones<00:02:41.130> are<00:02:41.580> in<00:02:41.760> debt<00:02:42.000> great<00:02:42.480> for<00:02:42.780> using

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
microphones are in debt great for using

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.050 
microphones are in debt great for using
as<00:02:43.200> a<00:02:43.230> voice<00:02:43.470> over<00:02:43.650> microphone<00:02:44.040> because<00:02:44.910> it

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
as a voice over microphone because it

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.600 
as a voice over microphone because it
just<00:02:45.360> doesn't<00:02:45.750> really<00:02:46.140> get<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.890> detail<00:02:47.340> out

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
just doesn't really get the detail out

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.820 
just doesn't really get the detail out
of<00:02:47.640> my<00:02:47.940> voice<00:02:48.209> if<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:49.019> hear<00:02:49.200> a<00:02:49.230> voice<00:02:49.350> over

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
of my voice if you hear a voice over

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.220 
of my voice if you hear a voice over
microphone<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.519> has<00:02:50.670> quite<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.390> lot<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.660> detail

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
microphone it has quite a lot of detail

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.080 
microphone it has quite a lot of detail
and<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.709> can<00:02:52.920> hear<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.220> highs<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.850> lows

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
and you can hear the highs and the lows

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.449 
and you can hear the highs and the lows
really<00:02:54.510> well<00:02:54.690> where<00:02:55.319> this<00:02:55.470> microphone<00:02:56.069> seems

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
really well where this microphone seems

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.360 
really well where this microphone seems
to<00:02:56.670> really<00:02:56.970> focus<00:02:57.360> on<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.900> mid-tones<00:02:58.769> but<00:02:59.160> not

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
to really focus on the mid-tones but not

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.699 
to really focus on the mid-tones but not
on<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.790> lower<00:03:00.360> tones<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:00.989> not<00:03:01.200> really<00:03:01.470> on<00:03:01.590> the

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
on the lower tones and not really on the

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.300 
on the lower tones and not really on the
higher<00:03:02.130> tones<00:03:02.549> and<00:03:03.140> so<00:03:04.140> I'm<00:03:04.350> not<00:03:04.560> sure<00:03:04.890> if<00:03:05.160> I

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
higher tones and so I'm not sure if I

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.250 
higher tones and so I'm not sure if I
want<00:03:05.610> a<00:03:05.790> voiceover<00:03:06.180> microphone<00:03:06.810> because<00:03:06.989> they

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
want a voiceover microphone because they

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.710 
want a voiceover microphone because they
are<00:03:07.440> quite<00:03:07.739> expensive<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:08.730> it<00:03:09.330> would<00:03:09.510> mean

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
are quite expensive and it would mean

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.840 
are quite expensive and it would mean
that<00:03:09.900> I<00:03:09.930> have<00:03:10.140> another<00:03:10.830> microphone<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.670> take

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
that I have another microphone to take

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.120 
that I have another microphone to take
with<00:03:12.150> me<00:03:12.359> if<00:03:12.600> I<00:03:13.079> have<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.470> go<00:03:13.650> somewhere<00:03:14.100> and

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
with me if I have to go somewhere and

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.130 
with me if I have to go somewhere and
shoot<00:03:14.519> somewhere<00:03:14.970> but<00:03:15.600> tell<00:03:15.810> me<00:03:15.930> in<00:03:16.049> the

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
shoot somewhere but tell me in the

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.900 
shoot somewhere but tell me in the
comments<00:03:16.560> which<00:03:16.769> microphone<00:03:17.250> did<00:03:17.579> you<00:03:17.730> like

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
comments which microphone did you like

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.360 
comments which microphone did you like
the<00:03:18.090> most<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.660> would<00:03:19.170> you<00:03:19.320> buy<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.829> voiceover

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
the most and would you buy a voiceover

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.670 
the most and would you buy a voiceover
microphone<00:03:21.150> instead<00:03:21.690> of<00:03:21.959> these<00:03:22.200> microphones

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
microphone instead of these microphones

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.220 
microphone instead of these microphones
if<00:03:23.100> you<00:03:23.430> would<00:03:23.790> use<00:03:24.000> it<00:03:24.180> plainly<00:03:24.570> for<00:03:25.109> our
