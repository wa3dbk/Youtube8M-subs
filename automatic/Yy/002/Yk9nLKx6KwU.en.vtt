people<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.530> world<00:01:28.710> doing<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.040> big<00:01:29.250> roof

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
people in the world doing this big roof

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.249 
people in the world doing this big roof
gap<00:01:29.790> they<00:01:30.240> start<00:01:30.570> thinking<00:01:30.869> are<00:01:31.020> they<00:01:31.110> gonna

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259

them jump 100 times on the floor at the
same<00:01:41.250> distance<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.420> can<00:01:42.570> do<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.689> hundred

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
same distance and you can do a hundred

same distance and you can do a hundred
times<00:01:43.200> without<00:01:43.500> failure<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:43.979> what<00:01:44.100> difference

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
times without failure so what difference

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.190 
times without failure so what difference
does<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.549> make<00:01:44.759> when<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.000> go<00:01:45.119> up<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.420> up<00:01:46.049> on<00:01:46.170> a

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
roof it makes no difference and it's

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.240 
roof it makes no difference and it's
really<00:01:48.479> hard<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.899> explain<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.560> amazing

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250

to progress my life you start using it

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.860 
to progress my life you start using it
as<00:02:28.440> a<00:02:28.500> life<00:02:28.830> tool<00:02:29.160> like<00:02:29.400> if<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.569> can<00:02:30.690> get
