00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
different and like I said this would be

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.160 
different and like I said this would be
a<00:01:32.670> pretty<00:01:33.030> smooth<00:01:33.270> transition<00:01:33.780> for<00:01:33.900> people

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
a pretty smooth transition for people

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
and would actually make this one of the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.450 
and would actually make this one of the
top<00:01:39.000> tier<00:01:39.270> katanas<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:39.960> my<00:01:40.200> opinion<00:01:40.680> are<00:01:40.829> two

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
top tier katanas in my opinion are two

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.520 
top tier katanas in my opinion are two
things<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.030> one<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.990> fact<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.350> the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
things and one is the fact that the

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.399 
things and one is the fact that the
blade<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:44.009> almost<00:01:44.310> invisible<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:45.409> certain

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
blade is almost invisible in certain

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.370 
blade is almost invisible in certain
angles<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.340> blade<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.880> are<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.869> pretty<00:01:49.110> much

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
angles the blade is are is pretty much

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.130 
angles the blade is are is pretty much
invisible<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.420> obviously<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.600> other<00:01:51.750> angles

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
invisible and obviously in other angles

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.510 
invisible and obviously in other angles
you<00:01:52.229> can<00:01:52.350> kind<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.649> see<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.979> little<00:01:53.159> bit<00:01:53.340> more

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
you can kind of see it a little bit more

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.300 
you can kind of see it a little bit more
but<00:01:54.299> that's<00:01:55.229> one<00:01:55.530> thing<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:55.920> really<00:01:56.159> like

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
but that's one thing that I really like

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.920 
but that's one thing that I really like
for<00:01:56.460> PvP<00:01:56.880> I'll<00:01:57.060> talk<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.509> I'll<00:01:57.750> talk

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
for PvP I'll talk to that I'll talk

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.929 
for PvP I'll talk to that I'll talk
about<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.320> little<00:01:58.560> bit<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.399> second<00:01:59.790> thing

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
about that a little bit the second thing

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.459 
about that a little bit the second thing
that<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.119> really<00:02:00.509> really<00:02:00.540> like<00:02:00.869> about<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.170> is

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
that I really really like about it is

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.530 
that I really really like about it is
the<00:02:01.770> fact<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.159> the

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
the fact that the

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.810 
the fact that the
the<00:02:04.320> special<00:02:04.800> effect<00:02:05.100> on<00:02:05.190> this<00:02:05.340> weapon<00:02:05.700> is

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
the special effect on this weapon is

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.730 
the special effect on this weapon is
that<00:02:05.970> the<00:02:06.120> strong<00:02:06.360> attack<00:02:06.720> has<00:02:07.380> shield

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
that the strong attack has shield

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.670 
that the strong attack has shield
piercing<00:02:08.720> now<00:02:09.720> this<00:02:09.990> is<00:02:10.110> another<00:02:10.410> thing<00:02:10.620> that

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
piercing now this is another thing that

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.880 
piercing now this is another thing that
I<00:02:10.860> really<00:02:11.160> like<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.990> and<00:02:12.990> it's<00:02:13.740> something

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
I really like and and it's something

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.560 
I really like and and it's something
that<00:02:14.040> it's<00:02:14.280> been<00:02:14.430> pretty<00:02:14.640> common<00:02:15.060> for<00:02:15.210> me<00:02:15.360> I've

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
that it's been pretty common for me I've

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.970 
that it's been pretty common for me I've
actually<00:02:15.810> been<00:02:16.080> running<00:02:16.260> across<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.710> lot<00:02:16.950> of

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
actually been running across a lot of

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.440 
actually been running across a lot of
people<00:02:17.160> with<00:02:17.460> albert's<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.120> what<00:02:18.300> their

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
people with albert's and what their

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.750 
people with albert's and what their
shields<00:02:18.750> up<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:20.100> fact<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.550> strong

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
shields up the fact that the strong

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.240 
shields up the fact that the strong
attack<00:02:20.880> is<00:02:21.560> well<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.680> strong<00:02:22.860> attack<00:02:22.980> for

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
attack is well the strong attack for

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.860 
attack is well the strong attack for
one-handed<00:02:23.580> this<00:02:23.820> is<00:02:23.940> how<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.180> mainly<00:02:24.540> use<00:02:24.750> the

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
one-handed this is how I mainly use the

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.130 
one-handed this is how I mainly use the
weapon<00:02:25.170> is<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.650> piercing<00:02:26.160> move<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:27.570> range<00:02:27.870> on

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
weapon is a piercing move the range on

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.580 
weapon is a piercing move the range on
this<00:02:28.380> is<00:02:28.700> not<00:02:29.700> too<00:02:29.970> bad<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.510> it'll<00:02:31.170> surprise<00:02:31.380> a

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
this is not too bad and it'll surprise a

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.070 
this is not too bad and it'll surprise a
lot<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:31.980> people<00:02:32.280> when<00:02:32.730> they<00:02:33.420> take<00:02:33.660> full<00:02:33.810> damage

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
lot of people when they take full damage

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.040 
lot of people when they take full damage
and<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:35.370> don't<00:02:36.030> know<00:02:36.090> if<00:02:36.180> it's<00:02:36.300> full<00:02:36.450> damage<00:02:36.840> but

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
and I don't know if it's full damage but

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.840 
and I don't know if it's full damage but
when<00:02:37.410> they<00:02:37.500> take<00:02:37.740> a<00:02:37.980> lot<00:02:38.400> more<00:02:38.430> than<00:02:38.640> normal

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
when they take a lot more than normal

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.060 
when they take a lot more than normal
damage<00:02:39.480> when<00:02:39.990> they<00:02:40.080> have<00:02:40.200> their<00:02:40.350> shield<00:02:40.530> up<00:02:40.740> so

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
damage when they have their shield up so

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.620 
damage when they have their shield up so
that's<00:02:41.280> kind<00:02:41.550> of<00:02:41.610> something<00:02:41.850> that<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.360> can

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
that's kind of something that you can

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.560 
that's kind of something that you can
pull<00:02:42.810> out<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:43.250> surprise<00:02:44.250> somebody<00:02:44.460> with<00:02:44.850> but

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
pull out and surprise somebody with but

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.060 
pull out and surprise somebody with but
now<00:02:45.960> we're<00:02:46.110> gonna<00:02:46.170> go<00:02:46.380> ahead<00:02:46.410> into<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.770> stats

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
now we're gonna go ahead into the stats

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.410 
now we're gonna go ahead into the stats
and<00:02:47.250> I'm<00:02:47.340> actually<00:02:47.490> gonna<00:02:47.730> transition<00:02:48.150> to

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
and I'm actually gonna transition to

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.750 
and I'm actually gonna transition to
some<00:02:48.570> PvP<00:02:49.020> these<00:02:49.830> starter<00:02:50.220> stats<00:02:50.490> on<00:02:50.640> this

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
some PvP these starter stats on this

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.530 
some PvP these starter stats on this
weapon<00:02:51.000> are<00:02:51.380> 115<00:02:52.380> based<00:02:52.650> attack<00:02:53.010> with<00:02:53.640> a<00:02:54.090> C

weapon are 115 based attack with a C
scaling<00:02:54.990> and<00:02:55.110> dexterity<00:02:55.500> now<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.400> reason<00:02:56.970> I

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
scaling and dexterity now the reason I

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.580 
scaling and dexterity now the reason I
say<00:02:57.060> that<00:02:57.240> is<00:02:57.690> because<00:02:57.720> since<00:02:58.230> then<00:02:58.470> I've

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
say that is because since then I've

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.160 
say that is because since then I've
actually<00:02:58.740> upgraded<00:02:59.100> it<00:02:59.600> right<00:03:00.600> now<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:00.750> have<00:03:01.050> it

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
actually upgraded it right now I have it

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.490 
actually upgraded it right now I have it
at<00:03:01.290> +10<00:03:01.830> and<00:03:02.100> these<00:03:02.670> stats<00:03:03.570> for<00:03:03.750> this<00:03:03.900> is<00:03:04.140> at<00:03:04.470> a

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
at +10 and these stats for this is at a

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.850 
at +10 and these stats for this is at a
230<00:03:05.070> with<00:03:05.820> an<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.180> scaling<00:03:06.660> in<00:03:06.750> dexterity<00:03:07.290> you

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
230 with an a scaling in dexterity you

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.000 
230 with an a scaling in dexterity you
need<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.310> 12<00:03:09.150> strength<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.810> 28<00:03:10.320> dexterity<00:03:10.920> in

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
need a 12 strength and 28 dexterity in

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.430 
need a 12 strength and 28 dexterity in
order<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.430> wield<00:03:11.640> it<00:03:11.850> the<00:03:12.690> one<00:03:12.840> negative<00:03:13.080> about

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
order to wield it the one negative about

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.470 
order to wield it the one negative about
this<00:03:13.650> is<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.190> fact<00:03:14.370> that<00:03:14.580> it<00:03:14.820> has<00:03:14.970> very<00:03:15.209> low

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
this is the fact that it has very low

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.460 
this is the fact that it has very low
durability<00:03:16.170> it<00:03:16.350> actually<00:03:16.740> has<00:03:16.920> 20<00:03:17.310> durability

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
durability it actually has 20 durability

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.170 
durability it actually has 20 durability
right<00:03:19.470> next<00:03:19.860> to<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.400> washing<00:03:20.610> pole<00:03:21.000> that's

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
right next to the washing pole that's

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.199 
right next to the washing pole that's
actually<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:22.080> lowest<00:03:22.760> don't<00:03:23.760> think<00:03:24.030> that

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
actually the lowest don't think that

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.000 
actually the lowest don't think that
there<00:03:24.390> are<00:03:24.420> any<00:03:24.660> other<00:03:24.959> katanas<00:03:25.680> out<00:03:25.800> there

dexterity<00:03:55.700> to<00:03:55.820> wield<00:03:56.000> this<00:03:56.210> you<00:03:56.750> could<00:03:56.960> infuse

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
dexterity to wield this you could infuse

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.010 
dexterity to wield this you could infuse
it<00:03:57.710> with<00:03:57.890> lightning<00:03:58.790> or<00:03:59.000> any<00:03:59.510> other<00:03:59.750> type<00:03:59.990> of

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
it with lightning or any other type of

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.570 
it with lightning or any other type of
infusion<00:04:00.470> but<00:04:00.710> you're<00:04:00.830> gonna<00:04:00.920> drop<00:04:01.220> it<00:04:01.400> down<00:04:01.520> I

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
infusion but you're gonna drop it down I

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.850 
infusion but you're gonna drop it down I
think<00:04:02.000> maybe<00:04:02.300> so<00:04:02.600> we'll<00:04:02.720> be<00:04:02.900> even<00:04:03.440> to<00:04:03.560> a<00:04:03.590> see

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
think maybe so we'll be even to a see

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.040 
think maybe so we'll be even to a see
I'm<00:04:04.040> not<00:04:04.220> too<00:04:04.430> sure<00:04:04.730> that's<00:04:05.630> something<00:04:05.900> that<00:04:06.020> I

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
I'm not too sure that's something that I

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.780 
I'm not too sure that's something that I
haven't<00:04:06.320> done<00:04:06.530> because<00:04:06.950> for<00:04:07.220> my<00:04:07.310> character

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
haven't done because for my character

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.850 
haven't done because for my character
the<00:04:07.970> way<00:04:08.090> it<00:04:08.210> is<00:04:08.330> right<00:04:08.510> now<00:04:08.570> is<00:04:09.020> the<00:04:09.440> best<00:04:09.650> is

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
the way it is right now is the best is

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.590 
the way it is right now is the best is
it's<00:04:10.160> the<00:04:10.760> best<00:04:10.940> it<00:04:11.060> can<00:04:11.150> be

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
it's the best it can be

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.660 
it's the best it can be
you<00:04:12.230> could<00:04:12.440> infuse<00:04:12.890> it<00:04:13.100> but<00:04:13.250> like<00:04:13.370> I<00:04:13.460> said

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
you could infuse it but like I said

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.020 
you could infuse it but like I said
depending<00:04:14.630> on<00:04:15.250> what<00:04:16.250> type<00:04:16.430> of<00:04:16.459> player<00:04:16.760> you<00:04:17.000> are

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
familiar with this katana it's kind of

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.330 
familiar with this katana it's kind of
hard<00:05:11.990> for<00:05:12.020> them<00:05:12.200> to<00:05:12.350> gauge<00:05:12.590> the<00:05:12.890> range<00:05:13.130> that

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
hard for them to gauge the range that

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.070 
hard for them to gauge the range that
they<00:05:13.460> need<00:05:13.640> to<00:05:13.760> be<00:05:13.910> at<00:05:14.120> to<00:05:14.360> avoid<00:05:14.810> the

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
they need to be at to avoid the

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.560 
they need to be at to avoid the
thrusting<00:05:15.530> attacks<00:05:15.830> that<00:05:15.950> I<00:05:16.040> do<00:05:16.100> now<00:05:16.910> in<00:05:17.330> all

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
thrusting attacks that I do now in all

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.540 
thrusting attacks that I do now in all
honesty<00:05:18.020> it<00:05:18.169> actually<00:05:18.590> has<00:05:18.740> the<00:05:18.950> same<00:05:19.190> range

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
honesty it actually has the same range

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.730 
honesty it actually has the same range
as<00:05:19.850> like<00:05:20.090> a<00:05:20.120> manslayer<00:05:20.750> and<00:05:21.169> the<00:05:21.350> black<00:05:21.530> steel

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
as like a manslayer and the black steel

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.100 
as like a manslayer and the black steel
katana<00:05:22.070> it's<00:05:22.340> actually<00:05:22.640> the<00:05:22.820> it's<00:05:23.750> actually

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
katana it's actually the it's actually

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.930 
katana it's actually the it's actually
the<00:05:24.230> same<00:05:24.440> size<00:05:24.710> as<00:05:24.890> them<00:05:25.070> but<00:05:25.580> like<00:05:25.669> I<00:05:25.760> said

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
the same size as them but like I said

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.580 
the same size as them but like I said
for<00:05:26.060> people<00:05:26.210> who<00:05:26.450> aren't<00:05:26.750> too<00:05:27.020> familiar<00:05:27.230> with

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
for people who aren't too familiar with

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.220 
for people who aren't too familiar with
the<00:05:27.830> weapon<00:05:28.240> it<00:05:29.240> could<00:05:29.330> be<00:05:29.450> surprising<00:05:30.050> and

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.230 
the weapon it could be surprising and

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.990 
the weapon it could be surprising and
like<00:05:30.560> I<00:05:30.590> said<00:05:30.710> it's<00:05:31.010> really<00:05:31.190> hard<00:05:31.610> for<00:05:31.640> them<00:05:31.880> to

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
like I said it's really hard for them to

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.670 
like I said it's really hard for them to
gauge<00:05:32.180> that<00:05:32.419> and<00:05:32.750> then<00:05:33.169> you<00:05:33.320> pair<00:05:33.500> that<00:05:33.530> up

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
gauge that and then you pair that up

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.170 
gauge that and then you pair that up
with<00:05:33.919> the<00:05:34.010> fact<00:05:34.250> that<00:05:34.490> if<00:05:34.669> you<00:05:34.760> throw<00:05:34.970> in<00:05:35.120> a

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
with the fact that if you throw in a

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.430 
with the fact that if you throw in a
strong<00:05:35.419> attack<00:05:35.690> every<00:05:35.930> now<00:05:36.050> and<00:05:36.229> then<00:05:36.290> if

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
strong attack every now and then if

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.630 
strong attack every now and then if
they're<00:05:36.590> the<00:05:36.740> type<00:05:36.919> of<00:05:36.950> person<00:05:37.310> have<00:05:37.520> their

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640 
they're the type of person have their

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.969 
they're the type of person have their
shield<00:05:37.880> up<00:05:38.090> and<00:05:38.350> be<00:05:39.350> able<00:05:39.590> to<00:05:39.680> do<00:05:39.800> some

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
shield up and be able to do some

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:42.550 
shield up and be able to do some
piercing<00:05:40.340> damage<00:05:40.460> through<00:05:40.760> that<00:05:41.290> like<00:05:42.290> I<00:05:42.380> said

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
piercing damage through that like I said

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.860 
piercing damage through that like I said
it<00:05:42.770> makes<00:05:43.010> it<00:05:43.160> a<00:05:43.250> pretty<00:05:43.520> damn<00:05:43.910> good<00:05:43.940> choice<00:05:44.479> to
