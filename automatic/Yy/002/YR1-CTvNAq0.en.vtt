00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:07.980
 This is gambling flashback in games 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.469
 which we grew crazy taxi 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.660
 was one of those racing games in 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.509
 who played even those who do not like the spirit 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.699

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.640
 players realism or beautiful graphics 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.550
 she let the wheel entertain you 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.680
 watched a hatchless hatchway taxi movie here 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.560
 the essence is about the same passengers need 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.199
 deliver to the place at any cost any 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.270

 only insane speed destruction and 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.200
 ski jumping 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.649
 the more tricks you do along the way 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.690
 a big premium is accrued by passengers and 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.809
 they no accident do not confuse the main 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.370
 so it was fun to be delivered on time 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.399
 later similar kind of entertainment 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.230
 appeared for example in the gta series there if 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.750
 remember, too, could earn some money 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.629
 taxi driver took passengers included 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.940
 timer taken 1 to the timer added 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.940
 few seconds to find and deliver 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.159
 2 only here agate did not dream those 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.530
 insane speed at which is made 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.310
 yellow checkered gigs in crazy 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.860
 taxi 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.890
 yes and ok there was no madness 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.320
 sunny san francisco with famous 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.479
 trams on the slopes are crazy 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.030
 passengers who leave the car in 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.630
 dashing jumping over his head smiling 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.220
 the main characters from breezy hair in punk to 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.380
 Italians on the open cube Gavrik 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.380
 other cars scattered when 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.909
 side collision like skittles 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.400
 environment was partially destructible 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.850
 springboards met on every corner and 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.680
 often allowed not weakly cut the road 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.979
 complemented the impression of a soundtrack in which 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.689
 listed for example offspring group 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.070
 the best music for high speed rides and 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.860
 it's hard to imagine 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.930
 the game is out on all possible platforms 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.939
 from the original slot machines and 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.979
 dreamcast before reissues on 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.829
 from its console now past 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.200
 generations now rumors about 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.490
 development of a new part for x-box one and 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.890
 playstation 4 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.520
 the main thing that the whole process is not spoiled 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.520
 realism
