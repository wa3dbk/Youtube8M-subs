architectural education moving away
progressively<00:00:35.060> from<00:00:35.829> the<00:00:36.829> master<00:00:37.220> builder

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
progressively from the master builder

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.870 
progressively from the master builder
tradition<00:00:38.739> becoming<00:00:39.739> more<00:00:39.920> virtual

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
learning and less hands-on learning and

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.410 
learning and less hands-on learning and
I<00:00:45.950> thought<00:00:46.190> that<00:00:46.370> what<00:00:46.640> went<00:00:46.820> with<00:00:47.030> the<00:00:47.149> change

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
I thought that what went with the change

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.970 
I thought that what went with the change
in<00:00:47.660> media<00:00:48.489> was<00:00:49.489> a<00:00:50.000> loss<00:00:50.360> of<00:00:50.630> content<00:00:51.140> it's

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
in media was a loss of content it's

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.639 
in media was a loss of content it's
always<00:00:52.129> being<00:00:52.430> about<00:00:53.170> making<00:00:54.170> things<00:00:54.350> and

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
always being about making things and

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.700 
always being about making things and
then<00:00:56.050> architecture<00:00:57.050> at<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.260> end<00:00:57.379> of<00:00:57.500> the<00:00:57.559> day

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
then architecture at the end of the day

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.670 
then architecture at the end of the day

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
projects and then got more confident

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.990 
projects and then got more confident

it's also a crash course and you know
timber<00:02:29.200> construction<00:02:29.380> for<00:02:29.890> students<00:02:30.250> that

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
timber construction for students that

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.610 
timber construction for students that
we're<00:02:30.550> very<00:02:30.880> interested<00:02:31.690> in<00:02:32.110> because<00:02:32.440> it's

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
we're very interested in because it's

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.229 
we're very interested in because it's
where<00:02:33.280> we<00:02:33.310> practice<00:02:33.820> a<00:02:33.850> lot<00:02:34.000> of<00:02:34.060> our

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
where we practice a lot of our

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:44.280 
where we practice a lot of our
architectures<00:02:34.810> here

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.980 

it<00:02:45.290> was<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.440> very<00:02:45.530> modest<00:02:46.400> beginning<00:02:47.090> at<00:02:47.270> just

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
it was a very modest beginning at just

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.960 
it was a very modest beginning at just
nine<00:02:48.230> students<00:02:48.920> she<00:02:49.310> said<00:02:49.460> let's<00:02:49.700> get<00:02:49.850> the

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
nine students she said let's get the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.490 
nine students she said let's get the
hell<00:02:50.120> out<00:02:50.240> of<00:02:50.270> the<00:02:50.480> school<00:02:50.750> for<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.320> summer

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
hell out of the school for the summer

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.150 
hell out of the school for the summer
live<00:02:52.310> in<00:02:52.430> tents<00:02:52.930> pretty<00:02:53.930> cool<00:02:54.200> this<00:02:54.950> could<00:02:55.130> be

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
live in tents pretty cool this could be

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.330 
live in tents pretty cool this could be
sustainable<00:02:57.130> sustainability<00:02:58.130> I<00:02:58.160> think

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
sustainable sustainability I think

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.820 
sustainable sustainability I think
applies<00:02:58.580> to<00:02:59.080> institutions<00:03:00.080> cultural<00:03:00.380> things

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
applies to institutions cultural things

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.430 
applies to institutions cultural things
too<00:03:01.100> right<00:03:01.540> so<00:03:02.540> it<00:03:02.660> just<00:03:02.690> kind<00:03:02.960> of<00:03:02.990> grew<00:03:03.110> and

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
too right so it just kind of grew and

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.680 
too right so it just kind of grew and
there's<00:03:04.370> a<00:03:04.490> yearning<00:03:04.730> I<00:03:05.030> think<00:03:05.270> for<00:03:05.480> people

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
there's a yearning I think for people

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.840 
there's a yearning I think for people
getting<00:03:06.050> their<00:03:06.140> hands<00:03:06.320> on<00:03:06.470> stuff<00:03:06.650> again<00:03:07.070> so

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
getting their hands on stuff again so

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.870 
getting their hands on stuff again so
it's<00:03:08.330> very<00:03:08.480> timely<00:03:08.960> you<00:03:09.110> know<00:03:09.730> so<00:03:10.730> it<00:03:10.850> just

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
it's very timely you know so it just

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.580 
it's very timely you know so it just
seems<00:03:11.180> to<00:03:11.270> have<00:03:11.420> a<00:03:11.450> life<00:03:11.660> of<00:03:11.810> its<00:03:11.960> own<00:03:12.080> and<00:03:12.140> it

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
seems to have a life of its own and it

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.100 
seems to have a life of its own and it
just<00:03:12.830> is<00:03:13.520> turned<00:03:13.820> into<00:03:13.940> something<00:03:14.180> it's<00:03:14.780> truly

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
just is turned into something it's truly

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.290 
just is turned into something it's truly
sustainable<00:03:15.350> it's<00:03:16.280> a<00:03:16.370> yearly<00:03:16.670> event<00:03:16.790> that<00:03:17.210> we

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
sustainable it's a yearly event that we

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.600 
sustainable it's a yearly event that we
get<00:03:17.450> to<00:03:17.510> go<00:03:17.660> when<00:03:17.930> we<00:03:18.110> visit<00:03:18.500> these<00:03:18.620> issues<00:03:18.950> so

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
get to go when we visit these issues so

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.190 
get to go when we visit these issues so
it's<00:03:19.760> a<00:03:19.790> real<00:03:19.940> testing<00:03:20.420> ground<00:03:20.660> for<00:03:20.780> a<00:03:20.960> lot<00:03:21.110> of

it's a real testing ground for a lot of

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.230 
it's a real testing ground for a lot of

started laughing and he said you're
looking<00:04:11.819> at<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:12.030> best<00:04:12.060> level<00:04:13.400> the<00:04:14.400> horizon

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
looking at the best level the horizon

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.409 
looking at the best level the horizon
the<00:04:15.209> ocean<00:04:15.480> horizon<00:04:15.959> is<00:04:16.609> the<00:04:17.609> best<00:04:17.850> level<00:04:18.269> and

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
the ocean horizon is the best level and

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.659 
the ocean horizon is the best level and
you<00:04:18.690> got<00:04:18.870> a<00:04:18.900> string<00:04:19.470> that<00:04:19.500> second<00:04:20.220> four<00:04:20.430> feet

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
you got a string that second four feet

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:21.979 
you got a string that second four feet
and<00:04:21.000> all<00:04:21.090> you<00:04:21.180> have<00:04:21.269> to<00:04:21.359> do<00:04:21.449> is<00:04:21.570> stand<00:04:21.660> row

and all you have to do is stand row

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.230 
and all you have to do is stand row
standing<00:04:22.410> you<00:04:22.470> can<00:04:22.620> see<00:04:22.830> exactly<00:04:23.820> where<00:04:24.150> the

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
standing you can see exactly where the

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.330 
standing you can see exactly where the
liver<00:04:24.479> so<00:04:25.139> you<00:04:25.199> know<00:04:25.380> you<00:04:25.500> all<00:04:25.680> feel<00:04:25.889> any<00:04:26.130> dumb

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
liver so you know you all feel any dumb

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.980 
liver so you know you all feel any dumb
which<00:04:26.850> is<00:04:27.000> good<00:04:27.180> okay<00:04:27.960> a<00:04:28.139> little<00:04:28.740> bit<00:04:28.979> humbled

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
which is good okay a little bit humbled

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.330 
which is good okay a little bit humbled
so<00:04:30.990> it's<00:04:31.169> good<00:04:31.350> it's<00:04:31.500> good<00:04:31.560> education<00:04:32.190> good

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340
