00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.610
 a long workout of his hands and fingers has made that in his bark 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.059
 brain in the motor and auditory areas there to a considerable increase in 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.059
 number of neuronal connections and 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.519
 and what happens in your brain when you listen to music 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.060
 since a few years ago, thanks to neuroimaging, you can see how 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.960
 involves the brain when performing a certain activity 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.230
 how can music be listening 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.730
 María has been a professional violinist for many years and since 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.420
 high-tech institute have been proposed to participate in a study of 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.730
 neuroscience of the doctor jesus prison research group 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.830
 the science studies affected 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:54.150
 very interesting different destinations it's usually about seeing how it 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.430
 feel 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.559
 of oxygen 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.130
 musician cc oo 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.930
 when you're listening to the world's most influential united nations within 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.070
 inbursa díez 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.650
 we are not going to this situation 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.650
 with what you have in the brain 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.090
 functional magnetic resonance is a neuroimaging technique based on the 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.810
 analysis of allegations of oxygen consumption by the brain while 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.650
 do some activity 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.710
 allows real-time images in three dimensions to be observed 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.180
 parts of the brain are activated the MRI also 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.860
 the necessary support and we are using it to 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.189
 in alterations of the 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.039
 reads brain l neurological and psychiatric pathologies scientifically despite 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.869
 the operation structures the public chain or is an alteration 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:47.719
 functional 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:48.600
 in both with the network 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.329
 the road saturated as it works we can see 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.329
 try to find the causes of the area attractions 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.740
 let's go back to mariña 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.490
 removed us from his brain activated while listening to the symphony of voice and 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.070
 attitude to the resonance test 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.320
 both in her as the person not music activated the area of ​​perception 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.529
 auditory 

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:14.009
 but in the brain of Maria other related areas were launched 

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:18.169
 with the melody in the frontal lobe as well as areas responsible for the 

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:22.199
 coordination of hand movements is to say that we assume for this 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:23.199
 performance 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:25.979
 the committee mentally you were 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.149
 reducing the musical weight 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:29.349
 with the fingers 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.590
 at the time the two hands without counting the two hands the young 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:37.909
 Maria with a musical trajectory that has shaped her brain and her interaction 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:39.820
 with auditory stimuli 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.629
 listen to the music in a different way involving initial 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.390
 and getting a much more complete feeling than anyone without 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:51.279
 musical training the researchers that we face a temple 

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:55.499
 under the title we are really living a very special moment 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:59.400
 which we have technicians as in spite of working 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.539
 neuroimaging techniques 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:05.629
 that allow us to see third-party brain activation the attention how 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:06.759
 the brain works 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:08.909
 with a person is thinking 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:14.199
 we played getting great unique moment in the history of the negotiation
