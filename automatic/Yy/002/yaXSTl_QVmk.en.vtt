prayer to kill I think 28 fire Giants
managed<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.100> somehow<00:01:44.310> do<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.820> on<00:01:45.030> one<00:01:45.329> prayer

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
managed to somehow do that on one prayer

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.800 
managed to somehow do that on one prayer
point<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.259> had<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.860> pray<00:01:47.040> flick<00:01:47.340> all<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.479> them<00:01:48.570> it

point I had to pray flick all of them it

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.480 
point I had to pray flick all of them it
is<00:01:48.930> possible<00:01:49.140> it's<00:01:49.500> not<00:01:49.619> too<00:01:49.770> difficult<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.340> do

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
is possible it's not too difficult to do

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.940 
is possible it's not too difficult to do
that<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.329> if<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.509> want<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.750> say<00:01:52.110> prayer<00:01:52.470> while
