hey<00:00:01.020> guys<00:00:01.230> today<00:00:01.620> I'm<00:00:01.680> going<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:01.860> be<00:00:01.949> talking<00:00:02.129> a

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
hey guys today I'm going to be talking a

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.610 
hey guys today I'm going to be talking a
little<00:00:02.399> bit<00:00:02.639> about<00:00:02.909> raid<00:00:03.210> where<00:00:03.929> it<00:00:04.020> is<00:00:04.200> is<00:00:04.560> a

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
little bit about raid where it is is a

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.289 
little bit about raid where it is is a
redundant<00:00:05.220> array<00:00:05.310> of<00:00:05.490> independent<00:00:05.819> disks

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
redundant array of independent disks

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.720 
redundant array of independent disks
that's<00:00:06.750> what<00:00:06.899> it<00:00:06.990> stands<00:00:07.200> for<00:00:07.440> we've<00:00:08.400> done<00:00:08.550> it

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
that's what it stands for we've done it

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.459 
that's what it stands for we've done it
in<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:09.000> sense<00:00:09.540> that<00:00:09.780> it<00:00:10.050> backs<00:00:10.260> up<00:00:10.440> your

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
in a sense that it backs up your

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.789 
in a sense that it backs up your
information<00:00:11.070> onto<00:00:11.219> multiple<00:00:12.210> drives<00:00:12.799> that's

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
information onto multiple drives that's

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.350 
information onto multiple drives that's
not<00:00:13.889> always<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.160> case<00:00:14.280> with<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.639> very<00:00:14.820> special

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
not always the case with a very special

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.880 
not always the case with a very special
its<00:00:15.630> braid<00:00:15.750> 0<00:00:16.080> which<00:00:16.260> I<00:00:16.379> will<00:00:16.529> talk<00:00:16.560> about

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
its braid 0 which I will talk about

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.769 
its braid 0 which I will talk about
because<00:00:17.279> raid<00:00:17.609> 0<00:00:17.880> doesn't<00:00:18.090> back<00:00:18.330> up<00:00:18.359> anything

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
because raid 0 doesn't back up anything

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.420 
because raid 0 doesn't back up anything
it<00:00:19.170> just<00:00:19.199> kind<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.770> gives<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.100> performance

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
it just kind of gives you a performance

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.359 
it just kind of gives you a performance
boost<00:00:20.900> but<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.930> rate<00:00:22.410> is<00:00:22.560> really<00:00:22.859> useful<00:00:23.070> these

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
boost but a rate is really useful these

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.630 
boost but a rate is really useful these
days<00:00:24.619> it<00:00:25.619> was<00:00:25.710> more<00:00:25.800> useful<00:00:26.099> back<00:00:26.250> in<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.460> day

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
days it was more useful back in the day

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.589 
days it was more useful back in the day
when<00:00:26.820> SSDs<00:00:27.390> didn't<00:00:27.660> exist<00:00:28.050> but<00:00:29.420> since<00:00:30.420> the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
when SSDs didn't exist but since the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.420 
when SSDs didn't exist but since the
SSDs<00:00:31.019> are<00:00:31.050> still<00:00:31.439> kind<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.650> expensive<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.369> the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
SSDs are still kind of expensive and the

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.979 
SSDs are still kind of expensive and the
time<00:00:32.579> i'm<00:00:32.700> making<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.030> video<00:00:33.210> it's<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.809> great

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
time i'm making this video it's a great

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.620 
time i'm making this video it's a great
way<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.200> go<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:35.070> without<00:00:35.700> further<00:00:35.760> ado<00:00:36.210> let's

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
way to go so without further ado let's

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.220 
way to go so without further ado let's
get<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:38.329> the<00:00:39.329> first<00:00:39.600> type<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.899> rate<00:00:40.140> I'm

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
get to it the first type of rate I'm

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.440 
get to it the first type of rate I'm
going<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.469> talk<00:00:40.620> about<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:41.070> raid<00:00:41.280> 0<00:00:41.610> now<00:00:42.210> what

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
going to talk about is raid 0 now what

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.690 
going to talk about is raid 0 now what
that<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.140> gets<00:00:43.530> two<00:00:43.860> hard<00:00:44.070> drives<00:00:44.309> and

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
that is is it gets two hard drives and

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.240 
that is is it gets two hard drives and
it<00:00:45.149> combines<00:00:45.329> them<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.899> act<00:00:46.079> as<00:00:46.289> one<00:00:46.530> now<00:00:47.100> what

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
it combines them to act as one now what

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.860 
it combines them to act as one now what
that<00:00:47.280> does<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:48.210> data<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.690> right

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
that does is the data that you right

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.450 
that does is the data that you right
onto<00:00:49.079> your<00:00:49.200> hard<00:00:49.320> drive<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.770> split<00:00:50.039> into<00:00:50.160> two

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
onto your hard drive is split into two

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.880 
onto your hard drive is split into two
it's<00:00:50.789> cut<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.059> half<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.989> half<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.260> information

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
it's cut in half so half the information

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.110 
it's cut in half so half the information
is<00:00:52.980> written<00:00:53.129> on<00:00:53.340> one<00:00:53.399> drive<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.000> half<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
is written on one drive and half the

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.750 
is written on one drive and half the
information<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.719> written<00:00:54.809> on<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.110> other<00:00:55.760> to

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
information is written on the other to

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.490 
information is written on the other to
get<00:00:56.940> even<00:00:57.149> deeper<00:00:57.480> into<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.079> if<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.289> have<00:00:58.469> a

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
get even deeper into it if you have a

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.040 
get even deeper into it if you have a
file<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.129> file<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.760> chopped<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.180> half<00:01:00.239> half

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
file that file is chopped in half half

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.660 
file that file is chopped in half half
of<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.500> one<00:01:01.739> drive<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.160> other<00:01:02.250> half<00:01:02.489> is

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
of it is on one drive the other half is

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.289 
of it is on one drive the other half is
on<00:01:02.789> another<00:01:03.059> drive<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.949> since<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.000> file

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
on another drive so this since the file

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.359 
on another drive so this since the file
is<00:01:06.450> cut<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.689> half<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:07.080> smaller<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:08.010> acts<00:01:08.220> as<00:01:08.340> a

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
is cut in half the smaller it acts as a

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.270 
is cut in half the smaller it acts as a
smaller<00:01:08.670> file<00:01:08.939> for<00:01:09.180> each<00:01:09.210> Drive<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.920> therefore

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
smaller file for each Drive so therefore

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.039 
smaller file for each Drive so therefore
is<00:01:11.610> your<00:01:12.000> rights<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.360> quicker<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
is your rights it quicker on to the

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.929 
is your rights it quicker on to the
drive<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.470> that's<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.040> basic<00:01:14.340> idea<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.729> it

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
drive and that's the basic idea of it

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.240 
drive and that's the basic idea of it
and<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:16.020> gives<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.350> huge<00:01:16.560> speed<00:01:16.860> increase

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
and this gives you a huge speed increase

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.520 
and this gives you a huge speed increase
rather<00:01:18.060> than<00:01:18.150> using<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.570> single<00:01:18.930> Drive<00:01:19.170> and

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
rather than using a single Drive and

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.070 
rather than using a single Drive and
writing<00:01:19.860> all<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.070> information<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.640> onedrive

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
writing all the information to onedrive

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.710 
writing all the information to onedrive
but<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.500> cons<00:01:22.799> are<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.340> if<00:01:23.850> one<00:01:24.150> drive<00:01:24.420> does

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
but the cons are that if one drive does

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.820 
but the cons are that if one drive does
fail<00:01:25.049> you're<00:01:25.259> going<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.470> lose<00:01:25.560> all<00:01:25.770> your

fail you're going to lose all your

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.300 
fail you're going to lose all your
information<00:01:26.330> because<00:01:27.330> since<00:01:27.600> only<00:01:27.840> half<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
information because since only half the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.109 
information because since only half the
files<00:01:29.310> are<00:01:29.759> on<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:31.920> first<00:01:32.159> drive<00:01:32.460> if<00:01:32.909> the

second drive fails you're losing half

second drive fails you're losing half
the<00:01:35.100> information<00:01:35.610> which<00:01:35.759> means<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.390> file<00:01:36.630> is

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
the information which means the file is

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
of it and that's really the only

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.740 
of it and that's really the only
downside<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.700> these<00:01:44.700> days<00:01:44.970> if<00:01:45.210> you're<00:01:45.420> not

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
downside to it these days if you're not

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.480

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
you're going to save these days

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.679 
you're going to save these days
depending<00:01:53.549> when<00:01:53.850> you're<00:01:54.000> viewing<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.360> video

but<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:56.009> would<00:01:56.100> be<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.340> good<00:01:56.670> idea<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.969> use<00:01:57.210> raid

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
but it would be a good idea to use raid

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.899 
but it would be a good idea to use raid
I<00:01:57.719> personally<00:01:58.290> use<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.340> really<00:01:59.579> like<00:01:59.729> it

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
I personally use it and I really like it

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.359 
I personally use it and I really like it
next<00:02:02.909> up<00:02:03.060> we<00:02:03.210> have<00:02:03.240> red<00:02:03.600> one<00:02:03.840> red<00:02:04.799> one<00:02:04.860> also

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
next up we have red one red one also

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.280 
next up we have red one red one also
uses<00:02:05.670> two<00:02:05.850> drives<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.360> minimum<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.810> two<00:02:06.990> drives

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.559 
uses two drives a minimum of two drives
and<00:02:07.500> what<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.489> does<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.940> instead<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.330> writing

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
and what it does is instead of writing

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.420 
and what it does is instead of writing
half<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.989> information<00:02:10.500> on<00:02:10.619> each<00:02:10.800> drive<00:02:11.129> it

half the information on each drive it

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.860

five<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:13.770> it<00:02:14.130> does<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.460> complete<00:02:15.390> copy<00:02:15.660> a

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870

you now keep in mind you have to look in

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.210 
you now keep in mind you have to look in

your motherboard manual and set up the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.190 
your motherboard manual and set up the
raid<00:02:29.430> through<00:02:30.060> your<00:02:30.180> BIOS<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:30.570> you<00:02:30.990> have<00:02:31.080> to

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
raid through your BIOS and you have to

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.570 
raid through your BIOS and you have to
figure<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.530> out<00:02:31.590> because<00:02:31.830> every

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
figure that out because every

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.130 
figure that out because every
motherboard<00:02:33.210> is<00:02:33.330> different<00:02:33.720> in<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.870> way<00:02:33.900> they

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
motherboard is different in the way they

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.270 
motherboard is different in the way they
handle<00:02:34.470> this<00:02:36.440> all<00:02:37.440> right<00:02:37.680> next<00:02:37.860> up<00:02:38.070> we<00:02:38.250> have

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
handle this all right next up we have

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.430 
handle this all right next up we have
raid<00:02:38.700> 3<00:02:39.030> now<00:02:39.540> raid<00:02:39.720> 3<00:02:39.930> gets<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:40.140> little<00:02:40.260> bit

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
raid 3 now raid 3 gets a little bit

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.910 
raid 3 now raid 3 gets a little bit
confusing<00:02:41.000> it's<00:02:42.000> similar<00:02:42.270> to<00:02:42.450> raid<00:02:42.810> 0<00:02:43.200> in<00:02:43.470> the

confusing it's similar to raid 0 in the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.280 
confusing it's similar to raid 0 in the
fact<00:02:44.190> that<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:44.850> puts<00:02:45.510> half<00:02:45.720> their<00:02:45.930> information

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
fact that it puts half their information

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.010 
fact that it puts half their information
on<00:02:46.590> each<00:02:46.830> drives<00:02:47.370> one<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:47.850> two<00:02:48.030> but<00:02:48.810> there's

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
on each drives one and two but there's

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.870 
on each drives one and two but there's
also<00:02:49.230> a<00:02:49.350> third<00:02:49.650> Drive<00:02:49.980> which<00:02:50.370> acts<00:02:50.610> as<00:02:50.820> a

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
also a third Drive which acts as a

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.020 
also a third Drive which acts as a
parody<00:02:51.630> drive<00:02:51.870> meaning<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:52.760> holds<00:02:53.760> its<00:02:53.910> own

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
parody drive meaning it holds its own

fails you have a backup drive to take
its<00:03:02.910> place<00:03:03.110> so<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:05.310> performance<00:03:05.820> increase

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
its place so the performance increase

three<00:03:23.790> so<00:03:24.600> if<00:03:25.110> you're<00:03:25.380> going<00:03:25.860> to<00:03:25.920> be<00:03:26.040> working

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
three so if you're going to be working

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.320 
three so if you're going to be working
with<00:03:26.580> the<00:03:27.440> mainly<00:03:28.440> large<00:03:28.709> files<00:03:29.100> then<00:03:30.000> this

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
with the mainly large files then this

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.020 
with the mainly large files then this
would<00:03:30.540> be<00:03:30.660> a<00:03:30.690> better<00:03:30.959> option<00:03:31.490> but<00:03:32.490> nowadays

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
would be a better option but nowadays

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.360 
would be a better option but nowadays
there's<00:03:33.480> so<00:03:33.750> many<00:03:33.840> better<00:03:34.320> options<00:03:34.440> of<00:03:35.070> raid

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
there's so many better options of raid

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.130 
there's so many better options of raid
that<00:03:35.610> you<00:03:35.760> don't<00:03:35.910> even<00:03:36.000> need<00:03:36.330> to<00:03:36.510> use<00:03:36.660> raid<00:03:36.900> 3

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
that you don't even need to use raid 3

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.400 
that you don't even need to use raid 3
it's<00:03:37.320> really<00:03:37.980> not<00:03:38.340> common<00:03:38.820> anymore<00:03:39.060> and

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
it's really not common anymore and

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.530 
it's really not common anymore and
there's<00:03:40.410> just<00:03:40.560> so<00:03:40.620> many<00:03:40.680> better<00:03:40.890> options<00:03:41.540> so

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
there's just so many better options so

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.310 
there's just so many better options so
yeah<00:03:42.660> that's<00:03:42.750> right<00:03:43.020> three<00:03:44.959> next<00:03:45.959> up<00:03:46.080> we<00:03:46.290> have

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
yeah that's right three next up we have

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.280 
yeah that's right three next up we have
raid<00:03:46.739> 5<00:03:47.010> like<00:03:47.760> raid<00:03:48.000> 3<00:03:48.300> it<00:03:48.510> also<00:03:48.810> requires<00:03:49.170> a

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
raid 5 like raid 3 it also requires a

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.800 
raid 5 like raid 3 it also requires a
minimum<00:03:49.530> of<00:03:49.860> three<00:03:50.160> drives<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:50.790> what<00:03:51.480> it<00:03:51.600> does

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
minimum of three drives and what it does

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.860 
minimum of three drives and what it does
is<00:03:52.110> it<00:03:52.250> chops<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.430> information<00:03:53.910> up<00:03:54.060> onto<00:03:54.690> each

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
is it chops the information up onto each

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.640 
is it chops the information up onto each
drive<00:03:55.380> so<00:03:56.040> as<00:03:56.310> you<00:03:56.459> can<00:03:56.550> see<00:03:56.820> there's<00:03:57.270> a

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
drive so as you can see there's a

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.979 
drive so as you can see there's a
there's<00:03:58.650> information<00:03:59.160> written<00:03:59.840> partially<00:04:00.840> on

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
there's information written partially on

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.350 
there's information written partially on
one<00:04:01.500> hard<00:04:01.709> drive<00:04:01.770> partially<00:04:02.760> on<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:02.940> second

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
one hard drive partially on the second

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.110 
one hard drive partially on the second
and<00:04:03.510> partially<00:04:04.470> on<00:04:04.739> the<00:04:04.860> third<00:04:05.070> and<00:04:05.280> there's<00:04:06.060> a

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
and partially on the third and there's a

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.060 
and partially on the third and there's a
there's<00:04:06.630> a<00:04:06.720> pattern<00:04:06.930> as<00:04:07.260> you<00:04:07.440> can<00:04:07.560> see<00:04:07.770> on<00:04:07.800> the

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
there's a pattern as you can see on the

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.580 
there's a pattern as you can see on the
diagram<00:04:08.340> here<00:04:08.880> where<00:04:09.450> it<00:04:09.570> adds<00:04:09.780> a<00:04:09.989> parity<00:04:10.380> bit

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
diagram here where it adds a parity bit

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.790 
diagram here where it adds a parity bit
a<00:04:10.739> redundancy<00:04:11.250> bit<00:04:11.610> on<00:04:11.790> each<00:04:12.360> Drive<00:04:13.140> which

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
a redundancy bit on each Drive which

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.220 
a redundancy bit on each Drive which
means<00:04:14.100> that<00:04:14.190> if<00:04:14.550> one<00:04:14.850> drive<00:04:15.150> fails<00:04:15.510> there's

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
means that if one drive fails there's

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.690 
means that if one drive fails there's
always<00:04:16.380> going<00:04:16.830> to<00:04:16.890> be<00:04:16.950> a<00:04:17.040> backup<00:04:17.310> of<00:04:17.549> that

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
always going to be a backup of that

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.599 
always going to be a backup of that
information<00:04:17.970> now<00:04:18.930> but<00:04:19.620> it<00:04:19.709> with<00:04:20.190> the<00:04:20.310> problem

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
information now but it with the problem

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.120 
information now but it with the problem
with<00:04:20.700> this<00:04:20.880> is<00:04:21.120> a<00:04:21.239> has<00:04:21.900> increased<00:04:22.500> read<00:04:22.770> speeds

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
with this is a has increased read speeds

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.540 
with this is a has increased read speeds
but<00:04:23.729> the<00:04:23.850> writing<00:04:24.210> speeds<00:04:24.600> are

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
but the writing speeds are

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.170 
but the writing speeds are
not<00:04:26.150> as<00:04:26.330> great<00:04:26.720> it's<00:04:27.680> still<00:04:28.009> a<00:04:28.039> good<00:04:28.849> way<00:04:29.120> to

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
not as great it's still a good way to

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.390 
not as great it's still a good way to
have<00:04:29.629> your<00:04:30.139> information<00:04:30.620> backed<00:04:30.800> up<00:04:31.039> and<00:04:31.280> it

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
have your information backed up and it

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.830 
have your information backed up and it
gives<00:04:31.580> you<00:04:31.729> some<00:04:32.060> sort<00:04:32.270> of<00:04:32.479> performance

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
gives you some sort of performance

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.339 
gives you some sort of performance
increase<00:04:33.409> and<00:04:33.620> it<00:04:34.310> gives<00:04:34.430> you<00:04:34.580> a<00:04:34.610> fail-safe

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:35.349 
increase and it gives you a fail-safe

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:38.050 
increase and it gives you a fail-safe
redundancy<00:04:36.349> so<00:04:37.039> that's<00:04:37.250> the<00:04:37.430> positive<00:04:37.610> side

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
redundancy so that's the positive side

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.260 
redundancy so that's the positive side
of<00:04:38.090> raid<00:04:38.389> 5<00:04:38.629> a<00:04:39.530> lot<00:04:39.860> of<00:04:39.949> people<00:04:40.190> choose<00:04:40.639> either

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
of raid 5 a lot of people choose either

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.100 
of raid 5 a lot of people choose either
raid<00:04:41.720> 0<00:04:42.319> or<00:04:42.590> raid<00:04:42.650> 1<00:04:43.220> raid<00:04:44.090> 5<00:04:44.300> can<00:04:44.720> be<00:04:44.870> an<00:04:44.960> option

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
raid 0 or raid 1 raid 5 can be an option

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.330 
raid 0 or raid 1 raid 5 can be an option
if<00:04:45.409> that's<00:04:45.590> the<00:04:45.680> right<00:04:45.800> you're<00:04:45.949> trying<00:04:46.129> to<00:04:46.220> go

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
if that's the right you're trying to go

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.629 
if that's the right you're trying to go
but<00:04:47.169> wait<00:04:48.169> till<00:04:48.349> we<00:04:48.440> get<00:04:48.590> to<00:04:48.650> rate<00:04:48.919> 10<00:04:49.190> and<00:04:49.520> then

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
but wait till we get to rate 10 and then

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.390 
but wait till we get to rate 10 and then
that<00:04:50.120> is<00:04:50.449> probably<00:04:50.870> going<00:04:51.020> to<00:04:51.080> be<00:04:51.169> the<00:04:51.400> best

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
that is probably going to be the best

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.839 
that is probably going to be the best
option<00:04:52.639> for<00:04:52.849> raid<00:04:53.150> in<00:04:53.300> my<00:04:53.419> opinion<00:04:54.669> alright<00:04:55.669> so

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:55.849 
option for raid in my opinion alright so

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:58.779 
option for raid in my opinion alright so
here<00:04:56.030> it<00:04:56.150> is<00:04:56.180> raid<00:04:56.539> 10<00:04:56.870> or<00:04:57.139> also<00:04:57.800> known<00:04:57.830> as<00:04:58.250> raid

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:58.789 
here it is raid 10 or also known as raid

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:03.580 
here it is raid 10 or also known as raid
1+0<00:04:59.800> so<00:05:00.800> what<00:05:01.039> this<00:05:01.219> is<00:05:01.280> is<00:05:01.840> there's<00:05:02.840> a<00:05:03.080> minimum

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
1+0 so what this is is there's a minimum

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.749 
1+0 so what this is is there's a minimum
of<00:05:03.710> four<00:05:03.979> disks<00:05:04.400> and<00:05:04.750> what<00:05:05.750> happens<00:05:06.110> is<00:05:06.759> like

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:07.759 
of four disks and what happens is like

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:11.050 
of four disks and what happens is like
raid<00:05:08.060> 0<00:05:08.389> it<00:05:09.080> will<00:05:09.440> put<00:05:10.129> the<00:05:10.280> partial

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
raid 0 it will put the partial

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.839 
raid 0 it will put the partial
information<00:05:11.270> on<00:05:11.780> each<00:05:12.169> drive<00:05:12.560> and<00:05:12.889> like<00:05:13.639> raid

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:13.849 
information on each drive and like raid

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:17.080 
information on each drive and like raid
1<00:05:14.180> it<00:05:14.900> will<00:05:15.169> make<00:05:15.349> a<00:05:15.379> copy<00:05:16.159> of<00:05:16.460> that<00:05:16.849> on<00:05:17.060> a

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
1 it will make a copy of that on a

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.809 
1 it will make a copy of that on a
separate<00:05:17.479> drive<00:05:17.719> so<00:05:18.379> this<00:05:18.620> is<00:05:18.650> both<00:05:19.039> fail<00:05:19.490> safe

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:19.819 
separate drive so this is both fail safe

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.659 
separate drive so this is both fail safe
and<00:05:20.120> it's<00:05:20.719> a<00:05:20.810> huge<00:05:21.020> performance<00:05:21.349> increase<00:05:21.860> but

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
and it's a huge performance increase but

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:24.129 
and it's a huge performance increase but
the<00:05:22.789> only<00:05:22.969> problem<00:05:23.240> with<00:05:23.449> this<00:05:23.629> is<00:05:23.870> it

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 
the only problem with this is it

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:26.770 
the only problem with this is it
requires<00:05:24.650> four<00:05:25.129> disks<00:05:25.610> and<00:05:25.729> that<00:05:26.569> can<00:05:26.750> be

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
requires four disks and that can be

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.830 
requires four disks and that can be
expensive<00:05:27.289> especially<00:05:28.129> if<00:05:28.610> you<00:05:29.389> have<00:05:29.419> one

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
expensive especially if you have one

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.990 
expensive especially if you have one
failing<00:05:30.400> you're<00:05:31.400> going<00:05:31.610> to<00:05:31.669> know<00:05:31.819> that

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
failing you're going to know that

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.339 
failing you're going to know that
another<00:05:32.240> one<00:05:32.419> is<00:05:32.479> going<00:05:32.599> to<00:05:32.659> fail<00:05:32.870> sometime

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:33.349 
another one is going to fail sometime

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:34.839 
another one is going to fail sometime
soon<00:05:33.650> you're<00:05:34.219> going<00:05:34.340> to<00:05:34.430> have<00:05:34.520> to<00:05:34.639> keep

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:34.849 
soon you're going to have to keep

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:37.209 
soon you're going to have to keep
switching<00:05:35.360> out<00:05:35.479> disks<00:05:36.020> and<00:05:36.139> that<00:05:36.620> can<00:05:37.039> get

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:37.219 
switching out disks and that can get

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:39.879 
switching out disks and that can get
pretty<00:05:37.400> costly<00:05:37.880> this<00:05:38.779> is<00:05:39.080> in<00:05:39.380> my<00:05:39.560> opinion<00:05:39.680> the

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889 
pretty costly this is in my opinion the

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:42.430 
pretty costly this is in my opinion the
best<00:05:40.099> type<00:05:40.430> of<00:05:40.460> rate<00:05:41.330> because<00:05:42.080> you're<00:05:42.349> getting

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
best type of rate because you're getting

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.439 
best type of rate because you're getting
best<00:05:43.009> of<00:05:43.159> both<00:05:43.340> worlds<00:05:43.759> are<00:05:43.819> getting<00:05:44.060> nice

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:44.449 
best of both worlds are getting nice

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:46.659 
best of both worlds are getting nice
redundancy<00:05:45.440> and<00:05:45.590> you're<00:05:46.130> getting<00:05:46.279> a<00:05:46.430> huge

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
redundancy and you're getting a huge

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:48.820 
redundancy and you're getting a huge
speed<00:05:47.000> increase<00:05:47.389> for<00:05:47.870> both<00:05:48.050> reads<00:05:48.349> and<00:05:48.560> writes

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
speed increase for both reads and writes

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.610 
speed increase for both reads and writes
it's<00:05:49.250> not<00:05:49.370> a<00:05:49.400> one-way<00:05:49.699> street<00:05:49.750> so<00:05:50.750> if<00:05:51.289> you<00:05:51.469> do

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
it's not a one-way street so if you do

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.140 
it's not a one-way street so if you do
have<00:05:51.650> the<00:05:51.830> money<00:05:52.130> for<00:05:52.430> it<00:05:52.460> you<00:05:52.819> could<00:05:53.000> go<00:05:53.120> with

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
have the money for it you could go with

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.670 
have the money for it you could go with
raid<00:05:53.569> 10<00:05:54.139> but<00:05:55.039> nowadays<00:05:55.400> you<00:05:56.300> have<00:05:56.379> SSDs<00:05:57.379> and

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
raid 10 but nowadays you have SSDs and

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.089 
raid 10 but nowadays you have SSDs and
it<00:05:58.490> just<00:05:58.699> seems<00:05:58.909> like<00:05:59.770> SSDs<00:06:00.770> are<00:06:00.800> the<00:06:00.979> way<00:06:01.069> to

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:01.099 
it just seems like SSDs are the way to

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:04.749 
it just seems like SSDs are the way to
go<00:06:01.250> they're<00:06:02.150> little<00:06:02.330> costly<00:06:02.740> when<00:06:03.740> I'm<00:06:03.830> at<00:06:04.550> the

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:04.759 
go they're little costly when I'm at the

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:07.510 
go they're little costly when I'm at the
time<00:06:05.000> of<00:06:05.150> this<00:06:05.240> video<00:06:05.419> but<00:06:06.409> I'm<00:06:06.680> sure<00:06:06.949> they

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
time of this video but I'm sure they

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.850 
time of this video but I'm sure they
will<00:06:07.639> go<00:06:07.789> down<00:06:08.000> eventually<00:06:08.389> and<00:06:08.840> we'll<00:06:09.710> see

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
will go down eventually and we'll see

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.589 
will go down eventually and we'll see
huge<00:06:10.159> increases<00:06:10.520> of<00:06:10.789> speed<00:06:11.060> without<00:06:11.180> having

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:11.599 
huge increases of speed without having

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:13.899 
huge increases of speed without having
to<00:06:11.719> use<00:06:11.810> right<00:06:12.050> all<00:06:12.199> the<00:06:12.319> time<00:06:12.520> but<00:06:13.520> yeah<00:06:13.669> there

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:13.909 
to use right all the time but yeah there

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:15.700 
to use right all the time but yeah there
