00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.319 
think the important thing for me was
when<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.649> first<00:02:01.920> made<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.219> record<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:03.000> knew

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
when I first made that record I knew

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.550 
when I first made that record I knew
that<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.689> would<00:02:03.810> be<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> bit<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.259> gamble

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
that it would be a bit of a gamble

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.469 
that it would be a bit of a gamble
because<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.490> wasn't<00:02:05.790> really<00:02:05.939> like<00:02:05.969> my<00:02:06.210> first

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
because it wasn't really like my first

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.749 
because it wasn't really like my first
one<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:06.990> my<00:02:07.530> first<00:02:07.740> one<00:02:07.860> did<00:02:08.009> pretty<00:02:08.160> well<00:02:08.250> so

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
one and my first one did pretty well so

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.180 
one and my first one did pretty well so
it<00:02:09.090> would<00:02:09.479> have<00:02:09.569> been<00:02:09.690> an<00:02:09.810> easy<00:02:09.989> thing<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.679> just

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
it would have been an easy thing to just

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.250 
it would have been an easy thing to just
sort<00:02:11.489> of<00:02:11.550> do<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.819> similar<00:02:12.330> sort<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.840> thing<00:02:12.930> and

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
sort of do a similar sort of thing and

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.520 
sort of do a similar sort of thing and
hope

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
hope

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.610 
hope
best<00:02:13.770> but<00:02:14.400> this<00:02:14.550> one<00:02:14.850> I<00:02:15.480> just<00:02:15.720> stuck<00:02:16.200> with<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.410> I

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
best but this one I just stuck with it I

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.870 
best but this one I just stuck with it I
think<00:02:16.830> that's<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.130> words<00:02:17.280> I<00:02:17.370> keep<00:02:17.520> using<00:02:17.670> as

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
think that's the words I keep using as

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.150 
think that's the words I keep using as
stuck<00:02:18.120> with<00:02:18.240> it<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.470> kept<00:02:19.470> my<00:02:19.560> belief<00:02:19.830> in<00:02:20.010> it

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
stuck with it and kept my belief in it

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.460 
stuck with it and kept my belief in it
and<00:02:20.420> if<00:02:21.420> you<00:02:21.600> keep<00:02:21.870> that<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:22.050> think<00:02:22.350> it

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
and if you keep that I think it

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.199 
and if you keep that I think it
genuinely<00:02:22.890> works<00:02:23.190> like<00:02:23.490> I<00:02:23.610> wasn't<00:02:23.970> going<00:02:24.180> to

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
genuinely works like I wasn't going to

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.090 
genuinely works like I wasn't going to
give<00:02:24.480> up<00:02:24.600> on<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.080> I've<00:02:25.380> been<00:02:25.650> touring<00:02:25.890> it

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
part of the world yeah this time around

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.290 
part of the world yeah this time around
I've<00:03:05.040> just<00:03:05.220> come<00:03:05.400> back<00:03:05.489> off<00:03:05.640> my<00:03:05.790> European<00:03:06.120> tour

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
I've just come back off my European tour

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.600 
I've just come back off my European tour
and<00:03:06.569> it<00:03:07.050> was<00:03:07.110> so<00:03:07.830> different<00:03:08.100> from<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.430> last

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
and it was so different from the last

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.850 
and it was so different from the last
tour<00:03:08.940> because<00:03:09.900> people<00:03:10.200> actually<00:03:10.410> know<00:03:10.709> the

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
tour because people actually know the

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.949 
tour because people actually know the
songs<00:03:11.100> now<00:03:11.370> so<00:03:11.700> that<00:03:11.880> always<00:03:12.090> helps<00:03:12.600> when

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
songs now so that always helps when

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.070 
songs now so that always helps when
you're<00:03:13.140> performing<00:03:13.260> them<00:03:13.709> evil<00:03:15.019> Australia<00:03:16.019> is

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
you're performing them evil Australia is
