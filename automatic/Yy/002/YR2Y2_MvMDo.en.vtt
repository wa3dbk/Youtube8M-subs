because<00:00:49.230> maker<00:00:49.590> studios<00:00:50.010> actually<00:00:50.370> got<00:00:50.520> an

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
because maker studios actually got an

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.670 
because maker studios actually got an
investment<00:00:51.059> not<00:00:51.149> too<00:00:51.300> long<00:00:51.420> ago<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.960> believe<00:00:52.469> in

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
investment not too long ago I believe in

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.040 
investment not too long ago I believe in
the<00:00:52.770> tens<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.070> millions<00:00:53.430> from<00:00:54.000> some<00:00:54.360> VCS<00:00:54.719> over

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
the tens of millions from some VCS over

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.729 
the tens of millions from some VCS over
in<00:00:55.850> Silicon<00:00:56.850> Valley<00:00:57.090> San<00:00:57.480> Francisco<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.440> it's

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
in Silicon Valley San Francisco so it's

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.099 
in Silicon Valley San Francisco so it's
cool<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.010> see<00:00:59.340> how<00:00:59.539> YouTube<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> ball<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
cool to see how YouTube is a ball to the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.900 
cool to see how YouTube is a ball to the
extent<00:01:01.469> where<00:01:01.590> it's<00:01:01.859> being<00:01:02.010> recognized<00:01:02.730> by

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
extent where it's being recognized by

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.370 
extent where it's being recognized by
large<00:01:03.780> investors<00:01:04.350> as<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.860> viable<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:06.260> guess<00:01:07.260> an

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
large investors as a viable I guess an

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.929 
large investors as a viable I guess an
investment<00:01:07.799> opportunity<00:01:07.860> for<00:01:08.460> them<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.729> it's

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
investment opportunity for them so it's

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.250 
investment opportunity for them so it's
kind<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.119> cool<00:01:09.299> because<00:01:09.420> it's<00:01:09.659> just<00:01:09.960> showing

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
kind of cool because it's just showing

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.080 
kind of cool because it's just showing
that<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.770> YouTube<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.189> growing<00:01:11.640> it's<00:01:11.820> it's

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
that that YouTube is growing it's it's

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.510 
that that YouTube is growing it's it's
only<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:13.560> know<00:01:13.680> it's<00:01:13.890> only<00:01:14.010> getting<00:01:14.310> bigger

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
only you know it's only getting bigger

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.039 
only you know it's only getting bigger

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
so there's really if there's no stopping

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.039 
so there's really if there's no stopping
it<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.320> sense<00:01:16.560> but<00:01:17.659> what<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.689> wanted<00:01:18.990> to

the<00:02:35.760> big<00:02:35.970> bang<00:02:36.030> theory<00:02:36.390> what<00:02:36.600> I<00:02:36.630> think<00:02:37.020> that

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
the big bang theory what I think that

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.360 
the big bang theory what I think that
Sheldon<00:02:37.470> from<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.650> big<00:02:37.770> bang<00:02:37.920> theory<00:02:38.160> is<00:02:38.340> a

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
Sheldon from the big bang theory is a

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.040 
Sheldon from the big bang theory is a
complete<00:02:38.670> sellout<00:02:38.850> because<00:02:39.090> he<00:02:39.300> is<00:02:39.720> on<00:02:39.900> the

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
complete sellout because he is on the

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.979 
complete sellout because he is on the
big<00:02:40.170> bang<00:02:40.350> theory<00:02:40.590> it's<00:02:41.130> really<00:02:41.600> not<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.900> very

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
big bang theory it's really not a very

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.560 
big bang theory it's really not a very
the<00:02:43.730> thought<00:02:44.730> process<00:02:45.120> doesn't<00:02:45.300> make<00:02:45.450> any

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
the thought process doesn't make any

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.840 
the thought process doesn't make any
sense<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.840> me<00:02:45.930> because<00:02:46.519> youtubers<00:02:47.519> are<00:02:47.640> really

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
sense to me because youtubers are really

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.390 
sense to me because youtubers are really
just<00:02:47.970> there<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.150> entertaining<00:02:48.600> and<00:02:48.870> if<00:02:49.680> they

are<00:02:50.760> being<00:02:51.030> paid<00:02:51.300> to<00:02:51.330> do<00:02:51.510> so<00:02:51.720> really<00:02:52.019> just<00:02:52.050> who

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
are being paid to do so really just who

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.170
