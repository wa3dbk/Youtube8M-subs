00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.680 
scope in that person is directly on your
crosshairs<00:04:28.400> so<00:04:28.820> you<00:04:28.910> just<00:04:29.120> pull<00:04:29.360> the<00:04:29.450> trigger

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
crosshairs so you just pull the trigger

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.580 
crosshairs so you just pull the trigger
and<00:04:29.780> Ben<00:04:30.170> he's<00:04:30.410> dead<00:04:30.910> second<00:04:31.910> question<00:04:32.200> um<00:04:33.200> and

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
and Ben he's dead second question um and

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.070 
and Ben he's dead second question um and
I<00:04:33.770> think<00:04:34.070> that<00:04:34.220> covers<00:04:34.460> it<00:04:34.610> for<00:04:34.850> the<00:04:35.690> second

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
I think that covers it for the second

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.830 
I think that covers it for the second
