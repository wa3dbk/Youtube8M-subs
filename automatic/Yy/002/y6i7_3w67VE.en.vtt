cook man that I knife aim it just above
the<00:00:31.920> Centurion<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.669> draw<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.710> there<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.770> go

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
it's dead in one throw so it's really

it's dead in one throw so it's really
really<00:00:40.260> easy<00:00:40.320> way<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.649> get<00:00:40.829> rid<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.010> them<00:00:41.160> and

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.440 

throwing<00:00:44.340> knife<00:00:44.489> isn't<00:00:44.730> st.<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.149> often<00:00:45.390> have

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
throwing knife isn't st. you often have

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.440 
throwing knife isn't st. you often have
equipped<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.370> i'd<00:00:47.370> recommend<00:00:47.550> equipping<00:00:48.329> it

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
equipped so i'd recommend equipping it

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.410 
equipped so i'd recommend equipping it
because<00:00:48.930> in<00:00:49.890> more<00:00:50.190> fair<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.700> they<00:00:50.850> can<00:00:51.059> enough

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
because in more fair to they can enough

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.080 
because in more fair to they can enough
the<00:00:52.399> grenades<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.610> they<00:00:53.699> don't<00:00:53.879> have<00:00:53.910> as

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
the grenades that they don't have as

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.029 
the grenades that they don't have as
much<00:00:54.210> damage<00:00:54.480> as<00:00:54.840> they<00:00:55.050> did<00:00:55.199> in<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.980> original

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
much damage as they did in the original

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.790 
much damage as they did in the original
modern<00:00:56.520> warfare<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.480> throwing<00:00:58.170> knife<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.559> a

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
modern warfare so throwing knife is a

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.430 
modern warfare so throwing knife is a
good<00:00:59.160> option<00:00:59.309> still<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.420> i<00:01:00.780> would<00:01:01.020> recommend

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
good option still so i would recommend

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.000 
good option still so i would recommend
try<00:01:02.100> at<00:01:02.340> least<00:01:02.430> trying<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.820> out<00:01:03.080> also<00:01:04.080> before<00:01:04.860> i

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
try at least trying it out also before i

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.240 
try at least trying it out also before i
go<00:01:05.159> montage<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:06.299> sell<00:01:06.600> it's<00:01:06.900> brilliant<00:01:07.500> well<00:01:08.220> i

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
go montage it sell it's brilliant well i

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.120 
go montage it sell it's brilliant well i
think<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.729> modesty<00:01:09.420> but<00:01:09.960> anyway<00:01:10.320> it's<00:01:10.920> out

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
think it is modesty but anyway it's out

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.380 
think it is modesty but anyway it's out
and<00:01:12.200> we've<00:01:13.200> it's<00:01:13.770> got<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.340> many<00:01:14.549> views<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.360> far

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
and we've it's got so many views so far

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.710 
and we've it's got so many views so far
it's<00:01:15.689> got<00:01:15.810> over<00:01:15.990> 300<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:17.060> youtube<00:01:18.060> because

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
it's got over 300 and youtube because

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.510 
it's got over 300 and youtube because
we've<00:01:18.840> got<00:01:18.930> them<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.200> quickly<00:01:19.380> thought<00:01:20.189> was

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
we've got them so quickly thought was

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.609 
we've got them so quickly thought was
somehow<00:01:20.880> bitching<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:21.900> we<00:01:22.020> get<00:01:22.170> views

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
somehow bitching it so we get views

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.090 
somehow bitching it so we get views
quickly<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.340> because<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.680> it's<00:01:25.680> kind<00:01:26.040> of

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
quickly and because of that it's kind of

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.030 
quickly and because of that it's kind of
stopped<00:01:26.580> that's<00:01:27.320> 300<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.439> something<00:01:28.590> so

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
stopped that's 300 and something so

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.370 
stopped that's 300 and something so
apparently<00:01:29.909> if<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.299> gets<00:01:30.509> too<00:01:30.750> like<00:01:30.930> double

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
apparently if it gets too like double

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.999 
apparently if it gets too like double
that<00:01:31.560> 600<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.670> will<00:01:32.880> unblock<00:01:33.600> but<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.500> know

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
that 600 it will unblock but I know
