00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:08.029
 Hi, I'm going to explain to you how 

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:08.029
 change the modem on a samsung galaxy s3 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.530
 the model is a file where they are 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:17.320
 all the configurations so that we 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.320
 we can connect to our mobile network 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.930
 to our data network 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:27.320
 without any inconvenience many times 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:31.640
 it happens that we installed a custom rom and 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:35.890
 we have no signal or the signal comes and goes or 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.890
 3g coverage is not correct 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.989
 in this case what we have to do 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.010
 is to change the model by the mode of 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.010
 our operator 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.300
 for that we are going to 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.630
 to download the stock rom 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.260
 what can they do with samsung mobile or 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.379
 of samsung update 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.790
 download for argentinian personnel 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:10.080
 android 4.3 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.620
 they are going to download a zip file 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.670
 they are going to decompress it 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:19.880
 and they will have a file a total of 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.680
 5 that file they're going to put in their 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.660
 phone anywhere in the 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.660
 internal memory or external memory 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.710
 once this is done 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:36.240
 they are going to unload from the bull place 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.240
 an app 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.350
 that it's called 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.590
 mobile oudÃ­n 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.130
 what is this that is up here 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.090
 in my case I am suitable and download mobile or 

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:00.090
 cleansed 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:13.420
 and here they are going to have to address the 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.420
 selection that says 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.519

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.980

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:26.680

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.780

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.609

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.590
 I downloaded it and put it in memory 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:37.799
 internal phone I choose internal sd 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.799

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.900
 I look for it 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.200
 good 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:56.370
 and the way would be the part the 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:03:00.470
 last part of all this divided into 3 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:05.250

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.750
 model 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:14.840

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.030

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.870
 new model 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.850
 to corroborate that the modem has 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.050
 loaded 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.050

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.010
 of the telephone 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.829
