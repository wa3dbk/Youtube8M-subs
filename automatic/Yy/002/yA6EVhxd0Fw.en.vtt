00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
what's up guys my name is ace and today

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.870 
what's up guys my name is ace and today
we're<00:00:07.529> gonna<00:00:07.589> be<00:00:07.710> looking<00:00:08.069> at<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.340> four<00:00:08.610> grift

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
we're gonna be looking at the four grift

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.910 
we're gonna be looking at the four grift
in<00:00:09.030> black<00:00:09.240> ops<00:00:09.480> 3<00:00:09.630> for<00:00:10.410> those<00:00:10.530> of<00:00:10.679> you<00:00:10.769> that

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
in black ops 3 for those of you that

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.039 
in black ops 3 for those of you that
really<00:00:11.309> remember<00:00:11.670> black<00:00:11.880> ops<00:00:12.090> 2<00:00:12.330> or<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:12.870> we're

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
really remember black ops 2 or and we're

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.629 
really remember black ops 2 or and we're
really<00:00:13.230> into<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.620> stats<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.070> everything<00:00:14.130> and

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
really into the stats and everything and

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.849 
really into the stats and everything and
into<00:00:14.849> YouTube<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.780> probably<00:00:16.289> know<00:00:16.529> that<00:00:16.740> the

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
into YouTube you probably know that the

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.040 
into YouTube you probably know that the
foregrip<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.310> black<00:00:17.609> ops<00:00:17.850> 2<00:00:18.119> did<00:00:18.510> next<00:00:18.840> to

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
foregrip and black ops 2 did next to

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.170 
foregrip and black ops 2 did next to
nothing<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:19.650> think<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:19.949> was<00:00:20.070> like<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.220> 1<00:00:20.550> or<00:00:20.820> 2

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
nothing I think it was like a 1 or 2

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.450 
nothing I think it was like a 1 or 2
percent<00:00:21.410> decrease<00:00:22.410> in<00:00:22.590> recoil<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.279> was

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
percent decrease in recoil it was

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.390 
percent decrease in recoil it was
basically<00:00:24.090> useless<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.590> decided<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.250> would

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
basically useless so I decided I would

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.880 
basically useless so I decided I would
test<00:00:26.609> this<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:27.060> black<00:00:27.420> ops<00:00:27.660> 3<00:00:27.779> keeping<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:28.740> mind

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
test this in black ops 3 keeping in mind

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.009 
test this in black ops 3 keeping in mind
that<00:00:29.039> this<00:00:29.220> isn't<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.760> most<00:00:30.000> exact<00:00:30.539> testing

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
that this isn't the most exact testing

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.810 
that this isn't the most exact testing
out<00:00:31.170> there<00:00:31.380> we<00:00:31.980> don't<00:00:32.130> have<00:00:32.369> access<00:00:32.759> to

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
out there we don't have access to

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.490 
out there we don't have access to
private<00:00:33.239> games<00:00:33.600> or<00:00:33.780> anything<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.290> had<00:00:34.440> to

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
private games or anything so I had to

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.470 
private games or anything so I had to
just<00:00:34.649> quickly<00:00:34.980> test<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:35.370> with<00:00:35.910> in<00:00:36.059> an<00:00:36.210> actual

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
just quickly test this with in an actual

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.250 
just quickly test this with in an actual
public<00:00:36.930> match<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.670> so<00:00:38.670> far<00:00:39.000> my<00:00:39.270> results<00:00:40.020> seem

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
public match and so far my results seem

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.010 
public match and so far my results seem
to<00:00:40.290> suggest<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.820> foregrip<00:00:42.270> does<00:00:42.600> more

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
to suggest that the foregrip does more

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.470 
to suggest that the foregrip does more
than<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.350> did<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:43.620> black<00:00:43.829> ops<00:00:44.070> 2<00:00:44.190> but<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.090> isn't

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
than it did in black ops 2 but it isn't

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.029 
than it did in black ops 2 but it isn't
something<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.020> basically<00:00:46.170> takes<00:00:46.680> away<00:00:47.010> all

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
something that basically takes away all

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.369 
something that basically takes away all
recoil<00:00:47.789> like<00:00:47.940> it's<00:00:48.120> not<00:00:48.270> extremely<00:00:48.809> powerful

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
recoil like it's not extremely powerful

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.549 
recoil like it's not extremely powerful
but<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.950> definitely<00:00:50.579> does<00:00:50.879> help<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:52.230> as<00:00:52.440> you

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
but it definitely does help so as you

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.439 
but it definitely does help so as you
can<00:00:52.649> see<00:00:52.710> I'm<00:00:52.949> using<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.250> BRM<00:00:53.730> because<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.090> find

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
can see I'm using the BRM because I find

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.959 
can see I'm using the BRM because I find
the<00:00:54.539> BRM<00:00:54.930> has<00:00:55.140> quite<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> bit<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.829> recoil<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.760> it

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
the BRM has quite a bit of recoil and it

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.569 
the BRM has quite a bit of recoil and it
also<00:00:57.120> gives<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.510> nice<00:00:57.750> accurate<00:00:58.579> recoil

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
also gives you a nice accurate recoil

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.910 
also gives you a nice accurate recoil
plot<00:00:59.789> because<00:01:00.059> there's<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.510> many<00:01:00.660> rounds<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.770> a

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
plot because there's so many rounds in a

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.380 
plot because there's so many rounds in a
particular<00:01:02.370> magazine<00:01:02.579> whereas<00:01:03.030> if<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.239> use<00:01:03.359> a

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
particular magazine whereas if you use a

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.020 
particular magazine whereas if you use a
really<00:01:03.600> small<00:01:03.750> magazine<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.530> get<00:01:04.680> much<00:01:04.949> more

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
really small magazine you get much more

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.250 
really small magazine you get much more
inconsistent<00:01:06.030> results<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.510> personally<00:01:07.080> find

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
inconsistent results I personally find

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.250 
inconsistent results I personally find
that<00:01:07.530> anyways<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.970> first<00:01:09.180> test<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:10.020> one

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
that anyways so the first test this one

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.770 
that anyways so the first test this one
is<00:01:10.500> without<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.340> foregrip<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.090> as<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.689> can

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
is without the foregrip and as you can

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.870 
is without the foregrip and as you can
see<00:01:12.840> like<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.740> said<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.159> has<00:01:14.280> quite<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.610> bit<00:01:14.790> of

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
see like I said it has quite a bit of

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.310 
see like I said it has quite a bit of
recoil<00:01:15.119> I'm<00:01:15.270> spraying<00:01:15.540> kind<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.110> all<00:01:16.290> over

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
recoil I'm spraying kind of all over

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.410 
recoil I'm spraying kind of all over
that<00:01:16.710> little<00:01:16.860> section<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.460> wall<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.880> this

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
that little section of the wall and this

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.749 
that little section of the wall and this
second<00:01:18.869> test<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.380> going<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.009> be<00:01:20.070> with<00:01:20.490> the

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
second test is going to be with the

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.030 
second test is going to be with the
foregrip<00:01:21.180> standing<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.320> exact<00:01:22.590> same<00:01:22.799> spot

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
foregrip standing on the exact same spot

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.770 
foregrip standing on the exact same spot
shooting<00:01:23.490> at<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.700> exact<00:01:23.970> same<00:01:24.150> spot<00:01:24.479> and

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
shooting at the exact same spot and

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.899 
shooting at the exact same spot and
these<00:01:25.290> are<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.560> two<00:01:25.740> results<00:01:26.220> side<00:01:26.430> by<00:01:26.610> side

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
these are the two results side by side

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.450 
these are the two results side by side
so<00:01:27.630> as<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.140> can<00:01:28.259> see<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:29.040> foregrip

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
so as you can see the foregrip

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.819 
so as you can see the foregrip
definitely<00:01:30.180> did<00:01:30.450> help<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:31.020> little<00:01:31.439> bit<00:01:31.619> I

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
definitely did help a little bit I

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.340 
definitely did help a little bit I
didn't<00:01:32.610> completely<00:01:32.970> remove<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.720> recoil<00:01:34.110> and

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
didn't completely remove that recoil and

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.230 
didn't completely remove that recoil and
tighten<00:01:34.650> up<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.920> spread<00:01:35.250> significantly<00:01:35.850> but

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
tighten up that spread significantly but

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.420 
tighten up that spread significantly but
there<00:01:36.390> were<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.509> lot<00:01:36.900> less<00:01:37.200> Flyers<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.979> lot<00:01:38.189> less

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
there were a lot less Flyers a lot less

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.940 
there were a lot less Flyers a lot less
of<00:01:38.610> those<00:01:38.729> really<00:01:39.060> oddball<00:01:39.810> sort<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.259> rounds

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
of those really oddball sort of rounds

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.679 
of those really oddball sort of rounds
that<00:01:41.100> are<00:01:41.220> just<00:01:41.400> flying<00:01:41.549> up<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.090> top<00:01:42.390> left

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
that are just flying up to the top left

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.289 
that are just flying up to the top left
or<00:01:42.869> top<00:01:43.049> right<00:01:43.369> with<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.490> foregrip<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.090> still

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
or top right with the foregrip you still

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.969 
or top right with the foregrip you still
have<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.450> weird<00:01:45.689> tipet<00:01:46.229> pattern<00:01:46.680> which<00:01:46.829> is

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
have a weird tipet pattern which is

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.560 
have a weird tipet pattern which is
something<00:01:47.100> else<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.460> noticed<00:01:47.759> with<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.090> with

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
something else I noticed with this with

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.850 
something else I noticed with this with
this<00:01:48.689> gun<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:49.170> have<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.320> lot<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.560> horizontal

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
this gun you have a lot of horizontal

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.530 
this gun you have a lot of horizontal
recoil<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.759> little<00:01:50.970> bit<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.180> vertical

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
recoil and a little bit of vertical

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.480 
recoil and a little bit of vertical
recoil<00:01:51.689> as<00:01:52.020> well<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.770> forms<00:01:53.100> almost<00:01:53.250> like

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
recoil as well and it forms almost like

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.280 
recoil as well and it forms almost like
a<00:01:53.520> perfect<00:01:53.790> upside-down<00:01:54.390> tee<00:01:54.840> which<00:01:55.049> I

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
a perfect upside-down tee which I

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.139 
a perfect upside-down tee which I
thought<00:01:55.619> was<00:01:55.710> pretty<00:01:55.860> interesting<00:01:56.430> but<00:01:56.939> as

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
thought was pretty interesting but as

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.910 
thought was pretty interesting but as
you<00:01:57.329> can<00:01:57.420> see<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.810> foregrip<00:01:58.200> definitely

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
you can see the foregrip definitely

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.130 
you can see the foregrip definitely
seems<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.399> do<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.549> lot<00:02:00.000> more<00:02:00.030> than<00:02:00.479> 1<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.990> 2

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
seems to do a lot more than 1 to 2

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.190 
seems to do a lot more than 1 to 2
percent<00:02:01.320> reduction<00:02:02.040> in<00:02:02.189> recoil<00:02:02.640> so<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.899> course

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
percent reduction in recoil so of course

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.959 
percent reduction in recoil so of course
once<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.710> full<00:02:05.009> game<00:02:05.219> launches<00:02:05.640> we're<00:02:05.820> going

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
once the full game launches we're going

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.119 
once the full game launches we're going
to<00:02:06.030> be<00:02:06.119> doing<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.509> lot<00:02:06.810> more<00:02:07.259> testing<00:02:07.590> on<00:02:07.920> this

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
to be doing a lot more testing on this

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.580 
to be doing a lot more testing on this
so<00:02:08.910> we<00:02:09.000> get<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.149> much<00:02:09.390> more<00:02:09.420> scientific<00:02:09.780> result

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
so we get a much more scientific result

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.800 
so we get a much more scientific result
rather<00:02:11.250> than<00:02:11.489> just<00:02:11.700> spraying<00:02:12.000> in<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.450> public

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
rather than just spraying in a public

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.940 
rather than just spraying in a public
match<00:02:12.959> like<00:02:13.200> this

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
match like this

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.470 
match like this
we'll<00:02:14.099> test<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.400> on<00:02:14.489> multiple<00:02:14.790> different<00:02:15.330> guns

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
we'll test it on multiple different guns

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.330 
we'll test it on multiple different guns
and<00:02:15.720> everything<00:02:16.080> but<00:02:16.560> this<00:02:16.800> is<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.010> best<00:02:17.190> that

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
and everything but this is the best that

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.070 
and everything but this is the best that
I<00:02:17.400> can<00:02:17.459> realistically<00:02:17.910> do<00:02:18.300> within<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.870> beta

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
I can realistically do within the beta

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.199 
I can realistically do within the beta
