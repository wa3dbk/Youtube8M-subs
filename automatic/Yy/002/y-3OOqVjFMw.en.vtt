at the back of this gang of people in
very<00:06:57.690> loud<00:06:57.840> voices<00:06:58.110> saying<00:06:58.440> to<00:06:58.650> each<00:06:58.740> other

helicopter<00:07:04.250> that<00:07:05.250> night<00:07:05.550> when<00:07:05.940> we<00:07:06.030> were

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.090 
helicopter that night when we were

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.300 
helicopter that night when we were
walking<00:07:06.240> back<00:07:06.600> we<00:07:07.560> did<00:07:07.740> actually<00:07:07.860> catch<00:07:08.160> up

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:08.310 
walking back we did actually catch up

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.060 
walking back we did actually catch up
with<00:07:08.400> Arthur<00:07:08.670> and<00:07:09.030> we<00:07:09.590> recognizing<00:07:10.590> it<00:07:10.740> matter

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:11.070 
with Arthur and we recognizing it matter

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.640 
with Arthur and we recognizing it matter
we<00:07:11.430> said<00:07:11.640> to<00:07:11.730> look<00:07:12.000> you<00:07:12.300> know<00:07:12.450> what's<00:07:13.290> with<00:07:13.500> the

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:13.650 
we said to look you know what's with the

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.420 
we said to look you know what's with the
UFO<00:07:14.400> but<00:07:14.640> that's<00:07:15.300> a<00:07:15.450> helicopter<00:07:16.190> and<00:07:17.190> he<00:07:17.280> said

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:17.430 
UFO but that's a helicopter and he said

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.280 
UFO but that's a helicopter and he said
oh<00:07:17.520> I've<00:07:17.850> seen<00:07:18.090> many<00:07:18.300> things<00:07:18.540> up<00:07:18.690> here<00:07:18.900> and<00:07:19.020> I'm

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:19.290 
oh I've seen many things up here and I'm

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:22.220 
oh I've seen many things up here and I'm
of<00:07:19.440> them<00:07:19.590> is<00:07:19.800> that<00:07:20.330> UFOs<00:07:21.330> disguise<00:07:21.750> themselves

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:22.230 
of them is that UFOs disguise themselves

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.730 
of them is that UFOs disguise themselves
as<00:07:22.470> terrestrial<00:07:23.360> craft<00:07:24.470> so<00:07:25.470> we<00:07:25.650> don't

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:25.740 
as terrestrial craft so we don't

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:31.340 
as terrestrial craft so we don't
recognize<00:07:26.280> them<00:07:26.660> but<00:07:27.660> I<00:07:27.690> can<00:07:28.340> essentially
