how how can I make it a boo-boo boo-boo
boo-boo<00:00:12.299> that<00:00:12.870> mecha<00:00:13.200> echo<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:14.269> that's<00:00:15.269> got<00:00:15.450> a

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
boo-boo that mecha echo and that's got a

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.720 
boo-boo that mecha echo and that's got a
soken<00:00:16.049> it's<00:00:16.290> not<00:00:16.410> hard<00:00:16.680> just<00:00:17.040> have<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.460> keep

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
soken it's not hard just have to keep

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.850 
soken it's not hard just have to keep
blowing<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.330> little<00:00:18.660> B<00:00:18.900> I<00:00:19.939> like<00:00:20.939> little<00:00:21.779> be<00:00:21.869> soft

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:22.860 
blowing a little B I like little be soft

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:29.350 
blowing a little B I like little be soft
and<00:00:23.130> continue<00:00:23.700> like<00:00:24.239> liberica

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.360 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.840 

like<00:00:30.360> that<00:00:30.829> thinking<00:00:31.829> you<00:00:32.040> can<00:00:32.219> practice<00:00:32.610> it

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
like that thinking you can practice it

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.819 
like that thinking you can practice it
without<00:00:33.030> without<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:34.140> flew<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.559> so<00:00:34.770> she

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
without without you flew that so she

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:42.529 
without without you flew that so she
said<00:00:35.190> if<00:00:40.190> you<00:00:41.190> will<00:00:41.579> blow<00:00:41.789> like<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:41.999> if<00:00:42.390> you

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:42.539 
said if you will blow like that if you

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:46.520 
said if you will blow like that if you
can<00:00:42.749> experiment<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:44.039> echo<00:00:44.519> sound<00:00:45.050> so<00:00:46.050> it

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
can experiment that echo sound so it

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.389 
can experiment that echo sound so it
depends<00:00:47.339> if<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.730> want<00:00:47.999> to<00:00:48.179> do<00:00:48.420> long<00:00:49.079> echo<00:00:49.949> you

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
depends if you want to do long echo you

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.470 
depends if you want to do long echo you
can<00:00:50.429> just<00:00:50.969> do<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:53.839> if<00:00:54.839> you<00:00:55.620> want<00:00:55.859> any<00:00:56.039> more<00:00:56.480> like

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
can just do it if you want any more like

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.950 
can just do it if you want any more like
a<00:00:57.510> very<00:00:57.870> short<00:00:58.230> echo<00:00:58.679> like<00:01:02.089> is<00:01:03.089> there<00:01:03.600> any<00:01:03.809> more

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
a very short echo like is there any more

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.410 
a very short echo like is there any more
now<00:01:04.830> okay<00:01:05.190> let's<00:01:05.370> let's<00:01:05.880> try<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.090> same<00:01:06.360> thing

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
now okay let's let's try the same thing

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.500 
now okay let's let's try the same thing
just<00:01:06.810> cover<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.640> dr.<00:01:08.640> koala<00:01:08.970> from<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.300> top

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
just cover the dr. koala from the top

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.590 
just cover the dr. koala from the top
fish<00:01:09.870> and<00:01:10.200> make<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.590> easy<00:01:10.800> to<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:12.390> get<00:01:12.540> the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
fish and make you easy to to to get the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:39.310 
fish and make you easy to to to get the
sound<00:01:13.220> okay<00:01:14.220> let's<00:01:14.430> try<00:01:14.520> that

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.620 

trying<00:01:40.320> trying<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.890> work<00:01:41.670> from<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.090> for<00:01:42.480> you

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
trying trying to work from you for you

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.560 
trying trying to work from you for you
Tommy<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.440> says<00:01:43.650> trying<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.100> up<00:01:47.240> happy<00:01:48.240> with

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
Tommy it says trying to up happy with

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.350 
Tommy it says trying to up happy with
your<00:01:48.750> with<00:01:49.350> your<00:01:49.380> Mouse's<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:50.490> control<00:01:50.970> that

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
your with your Mouse's to control that

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.630 
your with your Mouse's to control that
the<00:01:51.870> code<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.740> block<00:01:54.530> was<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.650> really<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.130> some

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
the code to block was I really that some

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.540 
the code to block was I really that some
you<00:01:57.210> can<00:01:57.420> practice<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.920> strain<00:01:59.160> to<00:01:59.340> play<00:01:59.520> a

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
you can practice the strain to play a

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:51.690 
you can practice the strain to play a
little<00:01:59.760> bit<00:01:59.970> with<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.479> with<00:02:00.930> echo

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.440 

so<00:02:52.240> you<00:02:52.420> can<00:02:52.599> practice<00:02:52.840> data<00:02:53.500> as<00:02:54.400> many<00:02:55.209> times

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
so you can practice data as many times

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.490 
so you can practice data as many times
as<00:02:55.660> many<00:02:56.260> times<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:56.739> want<00:02:56.800> a<00:02:57.250> looking<00:02:58.060> and<00:02:58.500> and

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
as many times you want a looking and and

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.070 
as many times you want a looking and and
you<00:03:00.190> can<00:03:00.400> little<00:03:01.090> bit<00:03:01.120> later<00:03:01.360> you<00:03:01.510> can<00:03:01.690> come<00:03:01.720> to

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
you can little bit later you can come to

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.710 
you can little bit later you can come to
learn<00:03:02.230> done<00:03:02.680> by<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.310> KO

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.050 

okay<00:03:07.720> let's<00:03:07.959> try
