00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
do so just start off slow and work up

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.500 
do so just start off slow and work up
the<00:03:16.860> first<00:03:17.099> bits<00:03:17.489> bit<00:03:17.640> of<00:03:17.730> odd<00:03:17.849> timing<00:03:18.150> as<00:03:18.330> well

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
the first bits bit of odd timing as well

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.210 
the first bits bit of odd timing as well
there's<00:03:19.260> almost<00:03:19.379> half<00:03:19.680> time

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
there's almost half time

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.399 
there's almost half time
so<00:03:20.970> you<00:03:21.030> bending<00:03:21.360> on<00:03:21.420> that<00:03:21.540> third<00:03:21.810> fret<00:03:22.230> on<00:03:22.260> the

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:22.409 
so you bending on that third fret on the

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:23.809 
so you bending on that third fret on the
e-string<00:03:22.709> straightaway<00:03:23.370> after<00:03:23.610> you've<00:03:23.700> hit

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
e-string straightaway after you've hit

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.500 
e-string straightaway after you've hit
that<00:03:23.879> a<00:03:24.150> power<00:03:24.420> cord<00:03:24.780> Shaco<00:03:25.769> look<00:03:26.340> like<00:03:27.329> the

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
that a power cord Shaco look like the

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:41.570 
that a power cord Shaco look like the
end<00:03:27.690> of<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:27.840> first<00:03:28.079> rib

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.030 

so<00:03:42.510> hopefully<00:03:43.080> by<00:03:43.200> watching<00:03:43.320> that<00:03:43.560> slowly<00:03:43.860> you

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
so hopefully by watching that slowly you

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.440 
so hopefully by watching that slowly you
can<00:03:44.190> work<00:03:44.340> out<00:03:44.490> with<00:03:44.610> Tom<00:03:44.790> your<00:03:44.970> beans<00:03:45.120> keep

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
can work out with Tom your beans keep

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.880 
can work out with Tom your beans keep
pressing<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:46.170> will<00:03:46.290> hopefully<00:03:46.500> become<00:03:46.710> a

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
pressing and it will hopefully become a

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.280 
pressing and it will hopefully become a
bit<00:03:47.010> more<00:03:47.040> natural<00:03:47.490> after<00:03:47.580> time<00:03:47.910> so<00:03:48.200> let's<00:03:49.200> get

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
bit more natural after time so let's get

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.690 
bit more natural after time so let's get
to<00:03:49.380> that<00:03:49.500> second<00:03:49.740> riff<00:03:49.860> now<00:03:50.010> which<00:03:50.130> is<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.460> the

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
to that second riff now which is the the

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.700 
to that second riff now which is the the
riff<00:03:50.880> for<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.120> main<00:03:51.330> part<00:03:52.110> of<00:03:52.230> summary<00:03:52.560> all

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
riff for the main part of summary all

00:03:52.710 --> 00:04:02.420 
riff for the main part of summary all
reverses<00:03:53.330> so<00:03:56.090> something<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.180> eat<00:04:01.130> so<00:04:02.130> it<00:04:02.250> warms

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
reverses so something to eat so it warms

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.640 
reverses so something to eat so it warms

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
come from the so called bend on the 3rd

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:28.070 
come from the so called bend on the 3rd
from<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:19.109> e<00:04:19.260> string<00:04:22.610> B<00:04:23.610> string<00:04:26.780> being<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:27.900> gap

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
from the e string B string being the gap

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:35.000 
from the e string B string being the gap
so<00:04:28.290> you<00:04:28.350> got<00:04:32.060> this<00:04:33.060> then<00:04:33.990> it<00:04:34.230> goes<00:04:34.380> up<00:04:34.530> to<00:04:34.650> a<00:04:34.680> is

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
so you got this then it goes up to a is

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.610 
so you got this then it goes up to a is
from<00:04:35.190> G<00:04:35.430> to<00:04:35.460> A<00:04:35.640> I<00:04:36.360> think<00:04:37.050> in<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:37.170> record<00:04:37.440> at<00:04:37.530> the

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
from G to A I think in the record at the

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:45.170 
from G to A I think in the record at the
Ashley<00:04:37.950> slides<00:04:38.310> I<00:04:41.120> got<00:04:42.120> up<00:04:42.210> bending<00:04:44.180> little

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
Ashley slides I got up bending little

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.270 
Ashley slides I got up bending little
bend<00:04:45.330> I<00:04:45.450> can<00:04:45.570> get<00:04:45.660> the<00:04:45.720> fool<00:04:46.010> eight<00:04:47.010> boys

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
bend I can get the fool eight boys

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.340 
bend I can get the fool eight boys
ratcheting<00:04:47.850> sounds<00:04:48.090> a<00:04:48.120> bit<00:04:48.240> thicker<00:04:48.540> did<00:04:49.260> your

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
ratcheting sounds a bit thicker did your

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.300 
ratcheting sounds a bit thicker did your
uncle<00:04:49.440> at<00:04:49.650> the<00:04:49.710> record<00:04:49.980> just<00:04:50.160> slide<00:04:50.310> up

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.439 

so<00:04:56.300> again<00:04:56.539> we<00:04:56.629> just<00:04:56.660> moving<00:04:57.500> up<00:04:57.650> position<00:04:58.129> now

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
so again we just moving up position now

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:05.830 
so again we just moving up position now
to<00:05:03.580> just<00:05:04.580> on<00:05:04.639> the<00:05:04.729> intro<00:05:05.030> it<00:05:05.150> has<00:05:05.270> a<00:05:05.509> separate

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
to just on the intro it has a separate

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.529 
to just on the intro it has a separate
part<00:05:06.110> for<00:05:06.470> the<00:05:06.680> second<00:05:07.669> row<00:05:07.759> that<00:05:07.970> makes<00:05:08.150> sense

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539 
part for the second row that makes sense

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:19.689 
part for the second row that makes sense
so<00:05:09.110> the<00:05:09.319> second<00:05:09.590> time<00:05:09.710> round<00:05:09.740> we<00:05:10.159> go<00:05:18.699> third

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:19.699 
so the second time round we go third

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:31.779 
so the second time round we go third
business<00:05:20.539> so<00:05:20.780> yeah<00:05:30.009> so<00:05:31.009> this<00:05:31.130> koala<00:05:31.400> crammed

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789
