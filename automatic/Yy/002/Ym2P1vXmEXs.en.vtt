00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:09.170
 in these 40 years of activities in the field 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.480
 glass and art is aimed at 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.629
 excellence in product quality 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.119
 services and care seeking innovation 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.789
 constant and quality control in its 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.849
 production line after the sale 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.760
 by customer love eat receive the request 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:28.099
 faxes or e-mails by entering the 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.500
 image directly from the system 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.710
 program responsible for the control of 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.020
 parts after the orders are designed 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.270
 they go through a conference and are 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.670
 released for optimization in the 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.039
 optimization the parts are indicated 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.899
 according to cutting advantage 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:47.500
 cutting is required through a 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.879
 latest equipment fully 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.579
 automated the charger and the 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.340
 provides cutting speed and quality 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:58.160
 after cutting the pieces go through the 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.920
 Lapidary process that finishes the 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.530
 edges of the glass in case of 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.080
 the parts are marked 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.330
 where templates are used 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.600
 and marked with a stylus 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.820
 iron then the parts are punctured and 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.910
 cut by qualified employees 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.470
 and machines of very high precision 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.440
 passing through this stage the glasses are 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.570
 washed and dried by a washing machine 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.750
 in addition to the pre-inspection in which 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.390
 measures colors and cutouts are checked 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.090
 after all these processes the glass 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.600
 receives the last treatment to temper 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.300
 heating at 750 degrees and 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.760
 abrupt cooling the glass condenses 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.790
 its molecules increasing by five times 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.530
 their resistance making it a 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.010
 safety glass 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.850
 this is love and art glasses and crystals of 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.850
 safety
