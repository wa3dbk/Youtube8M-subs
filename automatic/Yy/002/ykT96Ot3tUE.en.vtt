00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
with too much momentum you'll put your

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.440 
with too much momentum you'll put your
your<00:00:31.679> banana<00:00:32.130> will<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.489> go<00:00:32.610> flying<00:00:33.030> as<00:00:33.329> this

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
your banana will it go flying as this

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.299 
your banana will it go flying as this
has<00:00:33.600> happened<00:00:33.899> before<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:35.040> will<00:00:35.100> most

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
has happened before and it will most

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.250 
has happened before and it will most
likely<00:00:35.399> hit<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.880> floor<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.300> your<00:00:36.630> plan<00:00:36.960> will
