00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:29.190 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.070 

squirting<00:00:30.190> giant<00:00:30.670> plumes<00:00:31.120> of<00:00:31.390> gas<00:00:31.450> into<00:00:32.080> space

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.080 
squirting giant plumes of gas into space

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.690 
squirting giant plumes of gas into space
you<00:00:35.080> just<00:00:35.320> think<00:00:35.530> about<00:00:35.590> the<00:00:35.770> diligence<00:00:36.489> of

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:36.700 
you just think about the diligence of

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.170 
you just think about the diligence of
our<00:00:37.660> ancestors<00:00:38.410> who<00:00:38.830> looked<00:00:39.309> at<00:00:39.460> the<00:00:39.580> sky<00:00:39.820> so

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
our ancestors who looked at the sky so

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.340 
our ancestors who looked at the sky so
very<00:00:40.510> carefully<00:00:41.080> to<00:00:42.070> discover<00:00:42.550> that<00:00:42.970> our<00:00:43.350> Sun

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
very carefully to discover that our Sun

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.790 
very carefully to discover that our Sun
is<00:00:44.500> a<00:00:44.530> star<00:00:44.650> like<00:00:45.250> all<00:00:45.460> the<00:00:45.610> other<00:00:45.760> stars<00:00:46.800> you

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
is a star like all the other stars you

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.670 
is a star like all the other stars you
and<00:00:47.980> I<00:00:48.070> are<00:00:48.250> made<00:00:48.460> of<00:00:48.760> the<00:00:49.239> dust<00:00:49.629> of<00:00:49.960> exploding

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
and I are made of the dust of exploding

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.490 
and I are made of the dust of exploding
stars<00:00:51.040> we<00:00:51.309> are<00:00:51.340> Stardust<00:00:51.989> I'd<00:00:52.989> say<00:00:53.170> that<00:00:53.379> is

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
stars we are Stardust I'd say that is

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:00.090 
stars we are Stardust I'd say that is
the<00:00:53.590> most<00:00:53.770> profound<00:00:54.129> insight

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.799 

and<00:01:00.579> so<00:01:01.060> we<00:01:01.329> are<00:01:02.220> at<00:01:03.220> least<00:01:03.550> one<00:01:03.970> way<00:01:04.300> that<00:01:04.629> the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
and so we are at least one way that the

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.150 
and so we are at least one way that the
universe<00:01:05.290> knows<00:01:05.650> itself<00:01:06.280> and<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.960> that<00:01:08.710> to

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
universe knows itself and that that to

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.010 
universe knows itself and that that to
me<00:01:09.310> it<00:01:09.640> fills<00:01:09.880> me<00:01:10.000> with<00:01:10.030> reverence<00:01:10.510> that<00:01:10.900> is

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
me it fills me with reverence that is

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:21.160 
me it fills me with reverence that is
astonishing

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.180

if your I was at Cornell University I

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.010 
if your I was at Cornell University I
decided<00:01:25.190> to<00:01:25.310> take<00:01:25.430> astronomy<00:01:25.810> from<00:01:26.810> this

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
decided to take astronomy from this

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.410 
decided to take astronomy from this
famous<00:01:27.230> guy<00:01:27.410> Carl<00:01:27.950> Sagan<00:01:28.370> and<00:01:28.550> it<00:01:29.450> was<00:01:29.540> cool

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.140 
resonate and I really embraced that and
when<00:03:03.260> I<00:03:03.290> had<00:03:03.769> my<00:03:03.950> chance<00:03:04.220> to<00:03:04.489> do<00:03:04.610> my<00:03:04.820> science

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
when I had my chance to do my science

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.039 
when I had my chance to do my science
guy<00:03:05.299> show<00:03:05.540> I<00:03:06.070> hope<00:03:07.070> you'll<00:03:07.430> agree<00:03:07.850> that<00:03:08.330> every

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
guy show I hope you'll agree that every

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.140 
guy show I hope you'll agree that every
show<00:03:09.290> is<00:03:09.470> about<00:03:09.590> pure<00:03:10.010> science<00:03:10.549> and<00:03:10.760> like<00:03:10.940> any

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
show is about pure science and like any

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.780 
show is about pure science and like any
structure<00:03:11.690> its<00:03:12.410> shape<00:03:12.830> depends<00:03:13.430> on<00:03:13.549> what<00:03:13.670> it

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
structure its shape depends on what it

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.940 
structure its shape depends on what it
does<00:03:13.970> and<00:03:14.330> its<00:03:14.840> strength<00:03:15.170> depends<00:03:15.709> on<00:03:15.830> what

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
does and its strength depends on what

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.920 
does and its strength depends on what
it's<00:03:16.100> made<00:03:16.280> of<00:03:16.519> and<00:03:16.850> its<00:03:17.120> shape<00:03:17.360> why<00:03:17.630> does<00:03:17.780> it

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
it's made of and its shape why does it

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.310 
it's made of and its shape why does it
look<00:03:18.110> like<00:03:18.260> that<00:03:18.560> form<00:03:19.040> follows<00:03:19.489> function<00:03:20.320> so

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
look like that form follows function so

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.510 
look like that form follows function so
Carl<00:03:21.650> Sagan<00:03:21.950> changed<00:03:22.190> my<00:03:22.280> life

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
Carl Sagan changed my life

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.000 
Carl Sagan changed my life
and<00:03:23.640> he<00:03:24.090> sure<00:03:24.450> had<00:03:24.990> an<00:03:25.140> influence<00:03:25.560> he<00:03:25.620> left<00:03:25.920> the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
and he sure had an influence he left the

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.480 
and he sure had an influence he left the
world<00:03:26.190> a<00:03:26.280> lot<00:03:26.400> better<00:03:26.640> than<00:03:26.820> he<00:03:26.880> found<00:03:27.060> it<00:03:27.240> so<00:03:27.690> I

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
world a lot better than he found it so I

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.810 
world a lot better than he found it so I
am<00:03:29.490> honored<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:30.180> be<00:03:30.990> the<00:03:31.140> CEO<00:03:31.350> of<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:32.190> society

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.990 
that he started the Planetary Society
let's<00:03:36.300> change<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.780> world
