00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
my name is amazement and I was the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.190 
my name is amazement and I was the

so<00:00:22.590> I

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.940 

wee<00:00:29.660> bit<00:00:29.840> yesterday

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
wee bit yesterday

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.580 
wee bit yesterday
and<00:00:32.040> have<00:00:32.190> the<00:00:32.369> record

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
and have the record

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.650 
and have the record
it's<00:00:35.040> very<00:00:35.190> horizontal<00:00:35.610> everything<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.540> very

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
it's very horizontal everything is very

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.200 
it's very horizontal everything is very
horizontal<00:00:37.020> emphasize<00:00:37.830> the<00:00:38.370> length<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.880> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
horizontal emphasize the length of the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.600 
horizontal emphasize the length of the
car<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.990> to<00:00:40.050> make<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.410> look<00:00:40.530> big<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.370> same

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
car so to make it look big the same

car so to make it look big the same
thing<00:00:41.850> we<00:00:42.030> did<00:00:42.150> in<00:00:42.330> the<00:00:42.360> front<00:00:42.750> front<00:00:43.290> end<00:00:43.530> is

thing we did in the front front end is

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.830 
thing we did in the front front end is
very<00:00:43.800> wide<00:00:44.220> and<00:00:44.550> everything<00:00:45.300> everyone<00:00:45.690> is

very wide and everything everyone is
running<00:00:46.050> slow<00:00:46.470> should<00:00:47.309> be<00:00:47.489> logic<00:00:48.059> and

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
running slow should be logic and

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.920 
running slow should be logic and

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.020 

to<00:01:14.630> do<00:01:14.750> like<00:01:15.340> shoulder<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:16.610> length<00:01:16.760> of<00:01:16.910> the

car and really simple but
dimensional<00:01:21.729> surfaces<00:01:22.150> that's<00:01:22.659> why<00:01:22.810> we<00:01:22.990> did

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
dimensional surfaces that's why we did

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:32.260 
dimensional surfaces that's why we did
the<00:01:23.229> big<00:01:23.380> Delta<00:01:23.770> so<00:01:24.610> that's<00:01:24.760> why<00:01:24.909> the<00:01:25.140> will

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.240 

it<00:01:32.630> makes<00:01:32.930> a<00:01:33.049> really<00:01:33.079> good<00:01:33.350> stance<00:01:33.770> well<00:01:34.130> it's

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
it makes a really good stance well it's

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.720 
it makes a really good stance well it's
the<00:01:34.310> second<00:01:34.640> rule

the second rule
everything<00:01:37.540> is<00:01:37.660> kind<00:01:37.870> of<00:01:38.020> logic<00:01:38.470> and<00:01:38.650> running

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
everything is kind of logic and running

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.860 
everything is kind of logic and running
off<00:01:39.520> together<00:01:39.730> when<00:01:40.390> you<00:01:40.420> look<00:01:40.600> at<00:01:40.720> the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
off together when you look at the

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.660 
off together when you look at the
marathon<00:01:41.230> since<00:01:41.740> this<00:01:42.010> line<00:01:42.280> and<00:01:42.550> that's

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
marathon since this line and that's

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.730 
marathon since this line and that's
running<00:01:43.090> together<00:01:43.330> you<00:01:44.080> know<00:01:44.200> all<00:01:44.440> the<00:01:44.590> lines

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
running together you know all the lines

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.600 
running together you know all the lines
have<00:01:45.130> picked<00:01:45.340> up

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
have picked up

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.149 
have picked up
everything<00:01:47.390> is<00:01:47.480> launching

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
everything is launching

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.770 
everything is launching
and<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:49.820> interesting<00:01:49.939> thing<00:01:50.359> to<00:01:50.390> me<00:01:50.509> is<00:01:50.689> that

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
and the interesting thing to me is that

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.399 
and the interesting thing to me is that
this<00:01:50.960> cars<00:01:51.229> on<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.560> MQB<00:01:52.249> platform<00:01:52.990> and<00:01:53.990> can

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
this cars on the MQB platform and can

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:55.870 
this cars on the MQB platform and can
you<00:01:54.439> tell<00:01:54.740> us<00:01:54.770> a<00:01:54.859> little<00:01:54.979> about<00:01:55.249> that<00:01:55.700> and<00:01:55.850> how

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
you tell us a little about that and how

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.480 
you tell us a little about that and how
this<00:01:56.270> helped<00:01:56.569> you<00:01:56.659> design<00:01:57.079> this<00:01:57.500> kind<00:01:57.740> of<00:01:57.859> this

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
this helped you design this kind of this

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.050 
this helped you design this kind of this
SUV<00:01:58.990> m<00:01:59.990> to<00:02:00.259> be<00:02:00.439> as<00:02:00.710> a<00:02:00.770> very<00:02:01.310> efficient<00:02:01.729> engine

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
SUV m to be as a very efficient engine

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.849 
SUV m to be as a very efficient engine
so<00:02:02.539> it<00:02:02.750> is<00:02:02.840> a<00:02:02.869> gasoline<00:02:03.350> engine<00:02:03.469> in<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:03.829> front

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:03.859 
so it is a gasoline engine in the front

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:07.270 
so it is a gasoline engine in the front
and<00:02:04.630> electric<00:02:05.630> engineering<00:02:06.229> there's<00:02:07.100> no

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
and electric engineering there's no

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.800 
and electric engineering there's no
drivetrain<00:02:07.579> in<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.149> middle<00:02:08.390> so<00:02:08.509> you<00:02:08.539> have<00:02:08.780> a

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
drivetrain in the middle so you have a

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.650 
drivetrain in the middle so you have a
very<00:02:09.049> efficient<00:02:09.590> in<00:02:09.799> two<00:02:10.190> very<00:02:11.120> big<00:02:11.269> from<00:02:11.450> the

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
very efficient in two very big from the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
very efficient in two very big from the
inside<00:02:11.959> because<00:02:12.260> of<00:02:12.410> this

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.559 

and<00:02:15.129> it<00:02:15.280> shows<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.459> little<00:02:15.819> bit<00:02:15.909> of<00:02:16.090> flexible

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
and it shows a little bit of flexible

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.430 
and it shows a little bit of flexible
and<00:02:16.780> to<00:02:17.079> be<00:02:17.230> perfect

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
and to be perfect

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.230 
and to be perfect
and<00:02:18.980> also<00:02:19.100> how<00:02:19.310> does<00:02:19.490> this<00:02:19.610> fit<00:02:19.820> I<00:02:19.880> mean<00:02:20.120> you

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
and also how does this fit I mean you

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.360 
and also how does this fit I mean you
have<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.570> you<00:02:20.900> mentioned<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.320> datura<00:02:21.860> in<00:02:22.280> the

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
have the you mentioned the datura in the

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.280 
have the you mentioned the datura in the
Ranger<00:02:22.700> already<00:02:22.910> how<00:02:23.630> does<00:02:23.840> this<00:02:23.960> fit<00:02:24.230> into

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
Ranger already how does this fit into

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.030 
Ranger already how does this fit into
the<00:02:24.650> Volkswagen<00:02:25.130> range<00:02:25.370> in<00:02:25.550> that<00:02:25.700> sense<00:02:25.960> the

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
the Volkswagen range in that sense the

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.010 
the Volkswagen range in that sense the
thing<00:02:28.040> is<00:02:28.220> not<00:02:28.550> as<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.790> la<00:02:28.910> tika<00:02:29.090> and<00:02:29.630> this<00:02:29.900> is

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
thing is not as a la tika and this is

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.309 
thing is not as a la tika and this is
more<00:02:30.200> less<00:02:30.440> efficient<00:02:31.100> car

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
more less efficient car

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.490 
more less efficient car

they also examine a really interesting
elements<00:03:16.189> are

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
elements are

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.410 
elements are
on<00:03:17.280> it<00:03:17.430> or<00:03:17.700> a<00:03:17.730> front<00:03:18.180> that<00:03:18.900> would<00:03:19.079> it<00:03:19.200> like

on it or a front that would it like
from<00:03:20.599> the<00:03:20.690> phone<00:03:20.870> view<00:03:21.080> it's<00:03:21.260> everything

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
from the phone view it's everything

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.309 
from the phone view it's everything
really<00:03:21.800> horizontal<00:03:22.459> but<00:03:23.360> report<00:03:23.780> them<00:03:23.900> it's

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
really horizontal but report them it's

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.190 
really horizontal but report them it's
getting<00:03:24.709> three<00:03:24.980> dimensional<00:03:25.580> fillings

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
getting three dimensional fillings

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.680 
getting three dimensional fillings
elements<00:03:27.890> we<00:03:27.980> want<00:03:28.160> to<00:03:28.250> work

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
elements we want to work

working with four-dimensional

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.670 
working with four-dimensional
it<00:03:36.450> would<00:03:36.630> take<00:03:36.780> a<00:03:36.840> closer<00:03:37.110> look<00:03:37.320> to<00:03:37.620> the

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
it would take a closer look to the

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.190 
it would take a closer look to the
frontal<00:03:38.220> you<00:03:38.340> can<00:03:38.580> also<00:03:38.760> see<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.240> vertical

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
frontal you can also see the vertical

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.520 
frontal you can also see the vertical
line<00:03:40.230> that<00:03:41.100> runs<00:03:41.280> down<00:03:41.610> from<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.030> bonnet<00:03:42.530> down

line that runs down from the bonnet down
into<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:44.010> grave<00:03:44.250> down<00:03:44.610> into<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.030> bunker<00:03:45.420> so

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
into the grave down into the bunker so

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.360 
into the grave down into the bunker so
this<00:03:46.320> vertical<00:03:47.220> line<00:03:47.250> running<00:03:48.210> down<00:03:48.710> but<00:03:49.710> to

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
this vertical line running down but to

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.100 
this vertical line running down but to
make<00:03:50.520> the<00:03:50.700> car<00:03:50.910> really<00:03:51.180> white<00:03:51.450> in<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.810> front

we extend it to grey much further out as

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.130 
we extend it to grey much further out as
you<00:03:55.410> can<00:03:55.590> see<00:03:55.860> here<00:03:56.100> this<00:03:56.420> logically<00:03:57.420> lines<00:03:57.840> up

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.370 
you can see here this logically lines up
into<00:03:58.830> the<00:03:58.920> bonnet<00:03:59.280> this<00:04:00.210> air<00:04:00.510> out<00:04:00.780> to<00:04:00.960> take<00:04:01.140> the

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
into the bonnet this air out to take the

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.200 
into the bonnet this air out to take the
top<00:04:01.860> of<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.130> bonnet<00:04:03.380> okay

two dimensional effect and we have

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:13.650 
two dimensional effect and we have
written<00:05:05.580> elephants<00:05:06.239> far<00:05:06.739> simpler<00:05:07.739> for<00:05:08.519> people

and the these columns are actually quite

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.300 
and the these columns are actually quite
put<00:05:16.390> a<00:05:16.470> different<00:05:17.470> take<00:05:17.830> on<00:05:17.860> they're<00:05:18.130> going<00:05:18.250> to

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
put a different take on they're going to

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.590 
put a different take on they're going to
Volkswagen<00:05:18.880> theme<00:05:19.090> you<00:05:19.240> wouldn't<00:05:19.480> usually

Volkswagen theme you wouldn't usually

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.080 
Volkswagen theme you wouldn't usually
have<00:05:20.010> something<00:05:21.010> quite<00:05:21.250> as<00:05:21.340> complex<00:05:21.760> of<00:05:21.940> that

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
have something quite as complex of that

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.550 
have something quite as complex of that
with<00:05:22.240> the<00:05:22.420> with<00:05:22.660> the<00:05:22.690> body<00:05:22.960> color<00:05:23.230> running

with the with the body color running

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.710 
with the with the body color running
around<00:05:23.860> it<00:05:24.010> what<00:05:24.700> was<00:05:24.820> the<00:05:24.970> kind<00:05:25.210> of<00:05:25.330> the<00:05:25.690> idea

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
around it what was the kind of the idea

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.500 
around it what was the kind of the idea
behind<00:05:26.230> these<00:05:26.530> I<00:05:26.830> would<00:05:27.670> just<00:05:27.850> I<00:05:28.030> mean<00:05:28.150> wave

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
behind these I would just I mean wave

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.030 
behind these I would just I mean wave
like<00:05:28.840> we
