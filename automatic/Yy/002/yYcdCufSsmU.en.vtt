00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
to split them over different programs so

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.060 
to split them over different programs so
now<00:03:38.110> we'll<00:03:38.260> move<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.500> dial<00:03:38.709> down<00:03:38.799> to<00:03:38.980> the

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
now we'll move the dial down to the

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.880 
now we'll move the dial down to the
start<00:03:39.340> time<00:03:39.579> position<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.560> under<00:03:41.560> start

this<00:03:51.760> is<00:03:51.910> the<00:03:52.000> controller<00:03:52.570> start<00:03:53.230> time<00:03:53.470> so

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
this is the controller start time so

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.770 
this is the controller start time so
it's<00:03:54.280> the<00:03:54.370> first<00:03:54.609> time<00:03:54.880> that<00:03:55.090> programming<00:03:55.690> is

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
it's the first time that programming is

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.780 
it's the first time that programming is
going<00:03:55.930> to<00:03:55.989> start<00:03:56.230> cycling<00:03:56.709> and<00:03:56.890> we're<00:03:57.670> going

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
going to start cycling and we're going

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.699 
going to start cycling and we're going
to<00:03:57.880> use<00:03:58.680> 10:30<00:03:59.680> for<00:04:00.989> program<00:04:01.989> a<00:04:02.200> to<00:04:02.290> start

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
to use 10:30 for program a to start

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.470 
to use 10:30 for program a to start
cycling<00:04:03.190> so<00:04:03.790> I'm<00:04:03.850> going<00:04:03.970> to<00:04:04.030> use<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.209> minus

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
cycling so I'm going to use the minus

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.900 
cycling so I'm going to use the minus
button<00:04:04.660> and<00:04:04.840> go<00:04:04.900> backwards<00:04:05.380> to<00:04:05.440> 10:30<00:04:05.950> p.m.<00:04:06.070> in

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
these are give you the water days for

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.350 
these are give you the water days for
programming<00:05:46.440> you'll<00:05:47.370> notice<00:05:47.670> that<00:05:47.790> it<00:05:48.030> starts

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
programming you'll notice that it starts

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.690 
programming you'll notice that it starts
out<00:05:48.510> with<00:05:48.570> a<00:05:48.720> blinking<00:05:49.590> water<00:05:50.040> drop<00:05:50.400> a<00:05:50.610> little

days a week for water day selection plus

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.910 
days a week for water day selection plus
means<00:05:59.220> yes<00:05:59.550> and<00:05:59.760> minus<00:06:00.270> means<00:06:00.510> no<00:06:00.750> if<00:06:01.440> we<00:06:01.650> want

hit plus the cursor jumps till Wednesday

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.660 
hit plus the cursor jumps till Wednesday
we'll<00:06:15.150> use<00:06:15.330> the<00:06:15.480> minus<00:06:15.780> to<00:06:15.930> say<00:06:16.110> no<00:06:16.320> on

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:16.670

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.940 
we'll use the minus to say no on
Thursday<00:06:17.670> we<00:06:17.790> say<00:06:18.000> plus<00:06:18.510> for<00:06:18.810> yes<00:06:19.020> and<00:06:19.290> then
