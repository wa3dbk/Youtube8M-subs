dead<00:00:17.689> 2<00:00:17.720> scales<00:00:18.230> nicely<00:00:18.500> so<00:00:18.920> it<00:00:19.039> runs<00:00:19.189> on<00:00:19.460> lower

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
dead 2 scales nicely so it runs on lower

pretty decent settings and you'll see
that<00:00:43.789> we<00:00:43.879> get<00:00:44.000> some<00:00:44.180> pretty<00:00:44.300> nice<00:00:44.480> pics<00:00:44.809> out<00:00:44.960> of

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
that we get some pretty nice pics out of

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.650 
that we get some pretty nice pics out of
this<00:00:45.170> is<00:00:45.320> very<00:00:45.500> playable<00:00:46.329> now<00:00:47.329> we're<00:00:47.510> right

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
this is very playable now we're right

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:59.529 
this is very playable now we're right
for<00:00:47.840> a<00:00:47.870> little<00:00:47.930> action<00:00:48.320> here<00:00:58.030> then<00:00:59.030> even<00:00:59.480> a

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
for a little action here then even a

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:01.299 
for a little action here then even a
full<00:00:59.780> native<00:01:00.050> resolution<00:01:00.590> we<00:01:00.710> get<00:01:00.859> busier<00:01:01.219> we

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
full native resolution we get busier we

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.099 
full native resolution we get busier we
sometimes<00:01:01.520> drop<00:01:01.879> down<00:01:02.090> to<00:01:02.329> the<00:01:02.390> 30s<00:01:02.780> but<00:01:02.930> we're

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:03.109 
sometimes drop down to the 30s but we're

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:04.779 
sometimes drop down to the 30s but we're
often<00:01:03.320> in<00:01:03.410> the<00:01:03.500> 40s<00:01:03.829> and<00:01:03.949> 50s<00:01:04.039> for<00:01:04.399> frame<00:01:04.610> rate

00:01:04.779 --> 00:01:04.789 
often in the 40s and 50s for frame rate

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:16.990 
often in the 40s and 50s for frame rate
so<00:01:04.970> certainly<00:01:05.360> assorted<00:01:05.899> playable<00:01:06.289> now

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.970 

and<00:01:17.510> here<00:01:17.690> we<00:01:17.780> got<00:01:17.900> a<00:01:17.960> holding<00:01:18.290> police<00:01:18.830> to

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
and here we got a holding police to

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.620 
and here we got a holding police to
shoot<00:01:19.190> at<00:01:19.340> and<00:01:19.640> at<00:01:19.730> least<00:01:19.940> something<00:01:20.450> we're

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
shoot at and at least something we're

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.660 
shoot at and at least something we're
dropping<00:01:20.810> down<00:01:20.990> to<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:21.620> mid<00:01:21.860> 20s<00:01:22.310> here<00:01:22.580> at

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
dropping down to the mid 20s here at

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.150 
dropping down to the mid 20s here at
this<00:01:22.790> point<00:01:23.590> then<00:01:24.590> you<00:01:24.680> could<00:01:24.830> lower<00:01:24.980> the

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
this point then you could lower the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.070 
this point then you could lower the
resolution<00:01:25.700> but<00:01:25.970> if<00:01:26.090> that<00:01:26.240> bothers<00:01:26.630> you<00:01:26.750> I<00:01:26.780> got

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
resolution but if that bothers you I got

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.700 
resolution but if that bothers you I got
down<00:01:27.260> to<00:01:27.290> say<00:01:27.620> maybe<00:01:27.830> twelve<00:01:28.130> eighty<00:01:28.310> by<00:01:28.400> seven

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
down to say maybe twelve eighty by seven

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:41.190 
down to say maybe twelve eighty by seven
my<00:01:30.710> nerves<00:01:30.920> out<00:01:34.540> but<00:01:35.540> really<00:01:35.860> very<00:01:36.860> playable<00:01:37.690> I

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.330 

can't<00:01:42.200> be<00:01:42.290> a<00:01:42.320> bottle<00:01:42.620> up<00:01:42.740> cubic<00:01:43.040> is<00:01:43.160> it

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
can't be a bottle up cubic is it

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.790 
can't be a bottle up cubic is it
speakers<00:01:44.330> on<00:01:44.480> this<00:01:44.630> are<00:01:44.810> really<00:01:44.840> nice<00:01:45.260> sounds

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
speakers on this are really nice sounds

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:58.610 
speakers on this are really nice sounds
great<00:01:45.980> for<00:01:46.190> gaming

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.810 

screen<00:01:59.370> is<00:01:59.490> nice<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.850> sharp<00:02:00.030> polyculture

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
again it's playable but you might want

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.920 
again it's playable but you might want
to<00:04:02.190> drop<00:04:02.370> that<00:04:02.580> resolution<00:04:02.910> from<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.510> maximum

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
to drop that resolution from the maximum

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.380 
to drop that resolution from the maximum
that<00:04:04.110> we've<00:04:04.260> got<00:04:04.410> it<00:04:04.500> set<00:04:04.709> to<00:04:04.860> right<00:04:05.070> now<00:04:05.390> looks

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
that we've got it set to right now looks

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.650 
that we've got it set to right now looks
pretty<00:04:06.450> good<00:04:06.690> to<00:04:06.810> me<00:04:06.840> though<00:04:07.080> honestly

the<00:05:04.460> resolution<00:05:04.760> even<00:05:05.090> further<00:05:05.360> it's<00:05:05.630> really

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
the resolution even further it's really

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.870 
the resolution even further it's really
not<00:05:06.320> playable<00:05:06.770> you're<00:05:07.040> talking<00:05:07.460> about<00:05:07.670> tips
