I'll<00:00:35.700> interesting<00:00:36.210> for<00:00:36.329> adding<00:00:36.630> features

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
I'll interesting for adding features

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.569 
I'll interesting for adding features
penalize<00:00:37.710> online<00:00:38.040> drivers<00:00:38.430> that

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
penalize online drivers that

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.639 
penalize online drivers that
consistently<00:00:39.210> forget<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:40.020> press<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.379> left

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
consistently forget to press the left

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.770 
consistently forget to press the left
trigger<00:00:41.129> which<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:42.030> don't<00:00:42.120> know<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.629> the

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
trigger which you don't know that is the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.470 
trigger which you don't know that is the
break<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.550> interesting<00:00:44.550> things<00:00:44.760> there<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.270> I

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
break so interesting things there so I

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.069 
break so interesting things there so I
think<00:00:45.800> the<00:00:46.800> big<00:00:47.010> thing<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.430> know<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:48.210> Leon<00:00:48.870> said

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
think the big thing I know it Leon said

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.170 
think the big thing I know it Leon said
it<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.320> bit<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.559> weird<00:00:49.739> way<00:00:49.920> but<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.399> think

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
it in a bit of a weird way but I think

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.970 
it in a bit of a weird way but I think
they<00:00:51.270> do<00:00:51.329> need<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.690> penalize<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.440> drivers

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
they do need to penalize the drivers

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.119 
they do need to penalize the drivers
that<00:00:53.280> just<00:00:53.550> cause<00:00:53.850> accidents<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:55.129> purposely

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
that just cause accidents and purposely

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.430 
that just cause accidents and purposely
ruin<00:00:56.489> people's<00:00:56.879> races<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.660> mean<00:00:57.870> sure<00:00:58.109> you

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
ruin people's races and mean sure you

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.990 
ruin people's races and mean sure you
can<00:00:58.530> get<00:00:58.680> penalties<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.489> all<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.699> sort<00:00:59.879> of

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
can get penalties and all that sort of

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.090 
can get penalties and all that sort of
stuff<00:01:00.059> but<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.809> doesn't<00:01:01.350> really<00:01:01.469> teach<00:01:01.829> the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
stuff but it doesn't really teach the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.280 
stuff but it doesn't really teach the
people<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.940> keep<00:01:03.180> constantly<00:01:03.870> crashing

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
people that keep constantly crashing

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.200 
people that keep constantly crashing
into<00:01:04.470> people<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.369> can't<00:01:05.700> do<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.150> you

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
into people that you can't do this you

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.990 
into people that you can't do this you
can't<00:01:06.390> just<00:01:06.900> keep<00:01:07.080> crashing<00:01:07.619> into<00:01:07.979> people<00:01:08.159> so

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
can't just keep crashing into people so

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.060 
can't just keep crashing into people so
I<00:01:09.030> think<00:01:09.150> there<00:01:09.510> needs<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:10.020> be<00:01:10.049> an<00:01:10.409> option<00:01:10.590> as

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
I think there needs to be an option as

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.060 
I think there needs to be an option as
Leon<00:01:11.640> says<00:01:11.990> penalizing<00:01:12.990> people<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.830> just

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780

the time but generally the penalty

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.730 
the time but generally the penalty
system<00:01:41.430> isn't<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.299> terrible<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.649> you

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
system isn't that terrible and so you

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.859 
system isn't that terrible and so you
get<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.159> 10-second<00:01:44.880> penalties<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.450> one<00:01:45.659> race

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
get to 10-second penalties in one race

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.219 
get to 10-second penalties in one race
maybe<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.799> race<00:01:47.070> ban<00:01:47.430> or<00:01:47.759> maybe<00:01:48.090> like<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.390> 30

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
maybe a race ban or maybe like a 30

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.980 
maybe a race ban or maybe like a 30
minute<00:01:49.530> cooldown<00:01:49.890> would<00:01:50.759> be<00:01:50.970> probably<00:01:51.840> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
minute cooldown would be probably the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.149 
minute cooldown would be probably the
best<00:01:52.200> thing<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.380> do<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.590> mean<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.829> can't<00:01:53.040> really

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
best thing to do I mean you can't really

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.920 
best thing to do I mean you can't really
do<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> race<00:01:53.640> band<00:01:54.000> because<00:01:54.299> it's<00:01:54.450> rude<00:01:54.720> mode

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
do a race band because it's rude mode

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.870 
do a race band because it's rude mode
but<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.500> think<00:01:55.560> maybe<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.979> 30<00:01:56.219> minute<00:01:56.579> cooldown

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
but I think maybe a 30 minute cooldown

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.340 
but I think maybe a 30 minute cooldown
is<00:01:57.119> probably<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.659> sort<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.869> thing<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.049> need<00:01:58.229> to

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
is probably the sort of thing I need to

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.289 
is probably the sort of thing I need to
air<00:01:58.469> into<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.710> game<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.700> just<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.180> know

air into the game that you just you know

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.480 
air into the game that you just you know

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
maybe certain amount of accidents over a

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.859 
maybe certain amount of accidents over a

certain amount of races that you have a

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.320 
certain amount of races that you have a
cool<00:02:04.530> down<00:02:04.770> maybe<00:02:05.310> you're<00:02:05.549> banned<00:02:05.790> for

word to dedicated servers so yep that's

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.860 
word to dedicated servers so yep that's
pretty<00:02:44.160> pretty<00:02:44.700> cut<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.030> clear<00:02:45.480> what<00:02:45.750> he

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
pretty pretty cut and clear what he

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.570 
pretty pretty cut and clear what he
wants<00:02:46.140> dedicated<00:02:46.620> serves<00:02:46.890> in<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.070> game<00:02:47.340> I

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
wants dedicated serves in the game I

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.850 
wants dedicated serves in the game I
think<00:02:48.209> battlefield<00:02:49.140> two<00:02:49.350> game<00:02:49.500> that's<00:02:49.740> got

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
think battlefield two game that's got

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.530 
think battlefield two game that's got
dedicated<00:02:50.370> servers<00:02:50.640> correct<00:02:51.090> me<00:02:51.300> if<00:02:51.390> I'm

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
dedicated servers correct me if I'm

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.440 
dedicated servers correct me if I'm
wrong<00:02:51.630> but<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:52.820> dedicated<00:02:53.820> servers<00:02:54.180> I<00:02:54.240> think

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
wrong but a dedicated servers I think

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.570 
wrong but a dedicated servers I think
yeah<00:02:54.959> in<00:02:55.170> every<00:02:55.500> game<00:02:55.650> that<00:02:55.890> has<00:02:55.980> got<00:02:56.220> them<00:02:56.430> i

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
yeah in every game that has got them i

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.150 
yeah in every game that has got them i
think<00:02:56.610> is<00:02:57.030> generally<00:02:57.540> seen<00:02:58.140> as<00:02:58.200> pretty<00:02:58.890> good

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
think is generally seen as pretty good

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.310 
think is generally seen as pretty good
but<00:02:59.580> i<00:02:59.820> can't<00:03:00.480> actually<00:03:00.690> remember<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.140> last

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
but i can't actually remember the last

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.380 
but i can't actually remember the last
game<00:03:01.530> i<00:03:01.620> played<00:03:01.890> that<00:03:02.310> I<00:03:02.459> know<00:03:02.610> has<00:03:03.180> dedicated

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
game i played that I know has dedicated

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.560 
game i played that I know has dedicated
servers<00:03:03.990> but<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:05.250> inner<00:03:05.640> I<00:03:05.910> think<00:03:06.240> pretty

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
servers but that inner I think pretty

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:07.880 
servers but that inner I think pretty
much<00:03:06.660> what<00:03:06.900> he's<00:03:06.990> saying<00:03:07.200> is<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:07.380> needs<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.800> be

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
much what he's saying is I needs to be

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.010 
much what he's saying is I needs to be
some<00:03:08.160> sort<00:03:08.280> of<00:03:08.370> fix<00:03:08.670> for<00:03:08.910> this<00:03:09.030> so<00:03:09.600> black<00:03:09.990> that

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
some sort of fix for this so black that

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.440 
some sort of fix for this so black that
we've<00:03:10.380> had<00:03:10.590> ever<00:03:10.830> since<00:03:11.010> 2010<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.760> online<00:03:12.239> has

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
we've had ever since 2010 the online has

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.570 
we've had ever since 2010 the online has
never<00:03:13.050> been<00:03:13.290> really<00:03:13.680> perfect<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.310> netcode

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
never been really perfect the netcode

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.110 
never been really perfect the netcode
has<00:03:15.450> never<00:03:15.750> really<00:03:15.989> worked<00:03:16.350> so<00:03:16.910> yeah<00:03:17.910> that

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
has never really worked so yeah that

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.190 
has never really worked so yeah that
definitely<00:03:18.330> does<00:03:18.630> need<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:18.840> be<00:03:18.930> something

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
definitely does need to be something

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.370 
definitely does need to be something

for<00:03:42.000> example<00:03:42.060> on<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:42.540> left<00:03:42.570> side<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.050> track

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
for example on the left side the track

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.960 
for example on the left side the track
but<00:03:43.950> on<00:03:44.070> someone<00:03:44.310> else<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.519> screen<00:03:44.760> he<00:03:44.850> was

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
but on someone else the screen he was

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:45.979 
but on someone else the screen he was
like<00:03:45.090> on<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.269> right<00:03:45.390> side<00:03:45.630> of<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.750> track

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
like on the right side of the track

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.500 
like on the right side of the track
that's<00:03:46.350> the<00:03:46.470> sort<00:03:46.680> of<00:03:46.709> thing<00:03:46.920> that<00:03:47.510> happened

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
that's the sort of thing that happened

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.850 
that's the sort of thing that happened
in<00:03:48.720> that<00:03:48.840> game<00:03:48.959> it<00:03:49.320> was<00:03:49.380> just<00:03:49.590> sort<00:03:49.680> of<00:03:49.769> a

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
in that game it was just sort of a

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.040 
in that game it was just sort of a
little<00:03:50.190> bit<00:03:50.400> wrong<00:03:50.670> and<00:03:50.940> I<00:03:51.660> think<00:03:51.900> you<00:03:52.019> know

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
little bit wrong and I think you know

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.360 
little bit wrong and I think you know
obviously<00:03:52.380> because<00:03:52.800> everyone<00:03:53.280> in<00:03:53.340> that

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
obviously because everyone in that

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.009 
obviously because everyone in that
league<00:03:53.640> was<00:03:53.850> pretty<00:03:54.060> much<00:03:54.180> from<00:03:54.510> England

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
league was pretty much from England

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.630 
league was pretty much from England
except<00:03:55.380> from<00:03:55.530> Ben<00:03:55.769> who<00:03:56.190> was<00:03:56.310> over<00:03:56.519> in

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
except from Ben who was over in

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.180 
except from Ben who was over in
Australia<00:03:57.150> so<00:03:57.420> I<00:03:57.450> think<00:03:58.350> yeah<00:03:58.830> they<00:03:58.950> need<00:03:59.130> to

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
Australia so I think yeah they need to

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.920 
Australia so I think yeah they need to
do<00:03:59.280> something<00:03:59.489> they<00:03:59.760> see<00:03:59.820> I<00:04:00.209> don't<00:04:00.660> know<00:04:00.720> how

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
do something they see I don't know how

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.020 
do something they see I don't know how
they<00:04:01.110> do<00:04:01.170> it<00:04:01.530> but<00:04:01.680> some<00:04:02.310> games<00:04:02.519> get<00:04:02.730> it<00:04:02.820> right

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
they do it but some games get it right

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.260 
they do it but some games get it right
makula<00:04:03.420> duty<00:04:03.810> generally<00:04:04.200> gets<00:04:04.350> it<00:04:04.500> right

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
makula duty generally gets it right

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.500 
makula duty generally gets it right
but<00:04:06.160> make<00:04:07.160> it<00:04:07.190> so<00:04:07.610> that<00:04:07.820> we<00:04:07.910> can<00:04:08.060> play<00:04:08.180> against

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
but make it so that we can play against

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:09.700 
but make it so that we can play against
people<00:04:08.810> with<00:04:08.840> in<00:04:09.200> different<00:04:09.560> countries

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 
people with in different countries

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.640 
people with in different countries
because<00:04:10.510> you<00:04:11.510> know<00:04:11.630> f1<00:04:11.930> fans<00:04:12.170> all<00:04:12.380> around<00:04:12.470> the

be fixed on the online that makes the
lag<00:04:19.790> just<00:04:20.270> disappear<00:04:20.840> it's<00:04:21.620> an<00:04:21.860> impossible

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
lag just disappear it's an impossible

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.200 
task on their own to get it perfect but
there<00:04:24.740> must<00:04:24.920> be<00:04:25.070> some<00:04:25.310> way<00:04:25.340> to<00:04:25.520> make<00:04:25.790> it<00:04:25.850> just<00:04:26.000> a

there must be some way to make it just a

there must be some way to make it just a
little<00:04:26.240> bit<00:04:26.630> better<00:04:27.010> last<00:04:28.010> comment<00:04:28.340> coming<00:04:28.640> in

little bit better last comment coming in

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.240 
little bit better last comment coming in
from<00:04:29.180> San<00:04:29.450> teary<00:04:29.750> and<00:04:30.020> he<00:04:30.680> says<00:04:30.950> there<00:04:31.130> should

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
be a two player online career mode where

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.380 
be a two player online career mode where
both<00:04:33.200> that<00:04:33.410> you<00:04:33.440> can<00:04:34.040> be<00:04:34.790> in<00:04:34.850> a<00:04:34.940> different<00:04:35.060> team

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.230 
both that you can be in a different team
and<00:04:35.570> also<00:04:35.810> get<00:04:36.020> contracts<00:04:36.680> etc<00:04:37.240> very

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
and also get contracts etc very

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.790 
and also get contracts etc very
interesting<00:04:38.750> I<00:04:38.870> can't<00:04:39.200> remember<00:04:39.230> that's<00:04:39.590> what

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
interesting I can't remember that's what

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.500 
interesting I can't remember that's what
I<00:04:39.860> mentioned<00:04:40.370> in<00:04:40.520> that<00:04:40.640> video<00:04:40.880> but<00:04:41.360> it's

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
I mentioned in that video but it's

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.210 
I mentioned in that video but it's
definitely<00:04:41.720> an<00:04:41.990> idea<00:04:42.350> which<00:04:42.920> they<00:04:43.160> could

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
definitely an idea which they could

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.970 
definitely an idea which they could
implement<00:04:43.670> probably<00:04:44.150> not<00:04:44.270> into<00:04:44.450> f1<00:04:44.570> 2014<00:04:45.500> but

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
implement probably not into f1 2014 but

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.140 
implement probably not into f1 2014 but
something<00:04:46.340> in<00:04:46.430> the<00:04:46.520> future<00:04:46.910> which<00:04:47.030> I

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
something in the future which I

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.790 
something in the future which I
definitely<00:04:47.510> think<00:04:47.750> would<00:04:47.990> be<00:04:48.140> interesting

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
definitely think would be interesting

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.100 
definitely think would be interesting
the<00:04:49.220> fact<00:04:49.490> you<00:04:49.820> know<00:04:50.120> I'm<00:04:50.210> not<00:04:50.240> a<00:04:50.390> cop<00:04:50.690> career

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
the fact you know I'm not a cop career

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.600 
the fact you know I'm not a cop career
because<00:04:51.470> he<00:04:51.560> maybe<00:04:51.950> doesn't<00:04:52.220> wanna<00:04:52.340> be<00:04:52.430> on<00:04:52.520> the

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
because he maybe doesn't wanna be on the

and being different teams alongside an

and being different teams alongside an
AI<00:04:59.930> teammate<00:05:00.620> and<00:05:00.910> I'm<00:05:01.910> sure<00:05:02.180> there's<00:05:02.450> a<00:05:02.510> way

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
AI teammate and I'm sure there's a way

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.450 
AI teammate and I'm sure there's a way
to<00:05:02.750> do<00:05:03.080> it<00:05:03.200> in<00:05:03.290> the<00:05:03.410> current<00:05:03.770> game<00:05:03.950> but<00:05:04.190> having

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
to do it in the current game but having

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.160 
to do it in the current game but having
it<00:05:04.550> as<00:05:04.640> a<00:05:04.670> game<00:05:04.940> mode<00:05:05.180> would<00:05:05.480> be<00:05:05.660> quite<00:05:05.900> cool

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
it as a game mode would be quite cool

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.650 
it as a game mode would be quite cool
maybe<00:05:06.710> it<00:05:06.860> could<00:05:07.010> even<00:05:07.130> be<00:05:07.250> a<00:05:07.580> you<00:05:07.820> know<00:05:08.120> sort

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
maybe it could even be a you know sort

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.990 
maybe it could even be a you know sort
of<00:05:08.750> section<00:05:09.290> of<00:05:09.500> the<00:05:09.770> cop<00:05:10.010> career<00:05:10.400> tour<00:05:10.670> but<00:05:10.850> a

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
of section of the cop career tour but a

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.450 
of section of the cop career tour but a
different<00:05:11.480> version<00:05:11.720> of<00:05:11.990> co-op<00:05:12.260> career<00:05:12.650> it

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
different version of co-op career it

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.920 
different version of co-op career it
surely<00:05:13.700> wouldn't<00:05:14.030> take<00:05:14.180> that<00:05:14.210> much<00:05:14.390> we

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
surely wouldn't take that much we

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.240 
surely wouldn't take that much we
probably<00:05:15.170> won't<00:05:15.320> be<00:05:15.440> hardly<00:05:15.770> any<00:05:15.950> different

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
probably won't be hardly any different

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.370 
probably won't be hardly any different
at<00:05:16.310> all<00:05:16.460> to<00:05:16.670> code<00:05:16.910> so<00:05:17.300> definitely<00:05:18.050> something<00:05:18.320> I

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
at all to code so definitely something I

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.420 
at all to code so definitely something I
think<00:05:18.530> they<00:05:18.590> should<00:05:18.740> think<00:05:18.890> about<00:05:19.010> but<00:05:19.340> the

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
think they should think about but the

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.890 
think they should think about but the
