00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
make our paper the first step is to take

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.240 
make our paper the first step is to take
your<00:00:52.130> small<00:00:52.370> pieces<00:00:52.640> of<00:00:52.790> paper<00:00:54.010> put<00:00:55.010> them<00:00:55.160> in

the container add water and let it soak
overnight<00:00:59.740> now<00:01:00.740> I<00:01:00.770> have<00:01:00.950> some<00:01:01.220> already<00:01:01.490> made

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700 
overnight now I have some already made

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.580 
overnight now I have some already made
up<00:01:01.850> here<00:01:02.120> you<00:01:02.990> can<00:01:03.140> see<00:01:03.410> small<00:01:04.070> pieces<00:01:05.590> they're

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
up here you can see small pieces they're

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.760 
up here you can see small pieces they're
well<00:01:06.800> soaked

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
well soaked

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.470 
well soaked
we<00:01:09.770> need<00:01:09.920> to<00:01:10.040> grind<00:01:10.250> these<00:01:10.550> up<00:01:10.610> using<00:01:11.270> our

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:11.480 
we need to grind these up using our

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.190 
we need to grind these up using our
blender<00:01:11.900> into<00:01:12.380> what<00:01:12.530> is<00:01:12.680> called<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:13.010> pulp<00:01:13.310> and

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
blender into what is called the pulp and

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.290 
blender into what is called the pulp and
you<00:01:15.200> can<00:01:15.350> do<00:01:15.470> this<00:01:15.680> simply<00:01:16.670> by<00:01:16.850> taking<00:01:17.060> a

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
you can do this simply by taking a

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.190 
you can do this simply by taking a
handful<00:01:17.690> of<00:01:18.070> your<00:01:19.070> paper

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.630 

bring<00:01:23.740> it<00:01:23.860> in<00:01:23.950> the<00:01:24.070> blender<00:01:24.280> and<00:01:29.580> filling<00:01:30.580> your

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
bring it in the blender and filling your

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:41.640 
bring it in the blender and filling your
blender<00:01:31.000> about<00:01:31.240> half<00:01:31.450> full<00:01:32.010> with<00:01:33.010> water<00:01:40.650> now

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
blender about half full with water now

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.310 
blender about half full with water now
need<00:01:41.860> to<00:01:41.890> make<00:01:42.100> your<00:01:42.250> pulp<00:01:42.840> by<00:01:43.840> grinding<00:01:44.080> the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
need to make your pulp by grinding the

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.790 
need to make your pulp by grinding the
paper<00:01:44.560> up<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.810> start<00:01:47.110> with<00:01:47.229> a<00:01:47.350> low<00:01:47.500> setting

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:56.580 
paper up and start with a low setting
first<00:01:48.190> such<00:01:48.880> as<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.090> grind<00:01:49.659> city<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:56.470> then

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
first such as the grind city and then

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.930 
first such as the grind city and then
you<00:01:56.619> can<00:01:56.920> move<00:01:57.070> to<00:01:57.270> maybe<00:01:58.270> a<00:01:58.360> quicker<00:01:58.690> setting

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.400 

make<00:02:03.940> sure<00:02:04.090> that<00:02:04.300> your<00:02:04.479> paper<00:02:04.630> is<00:02:04.840> well<00:02:05.080> ground
