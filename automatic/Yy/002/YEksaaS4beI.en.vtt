00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 yes my people you know the raico 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.810
 I have been relatively frequent 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.540
 here on this channel ricoh products 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.309
 because I like her and me 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.130
 would like to continue this tradition with 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.719
 my audiophile enthusiasm I 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.730
 bring in the last time to the day 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.529
 but I promise you will not come 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.060
 more so many audio products and it 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.920
 also come many reviews I have to 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.449
 example, the degree lumia 10 20 here 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.119
 I've got that to me before four-five 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.859
 ordered weeks finally arrived 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.869
 and that's what you're going to come up with soon 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.270
 Review but today is only once again 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:41.820
 a few reiko box namely the evolution 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:44.040
 speaker of the bluetooth evolution speaker 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.379
 reminds me a bit of beats and 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.520
 that actually has three reasons number 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.710
 One is the design 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.960
 we all know that beats look good 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.550
 that is no question how 10 just awesome 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.980
 when you see them as they are built 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.930
 they look good and they do too 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.239
 this speaker here in red now 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.469
 and black with the curves and corners 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.690
 in the right places it sees 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.880
 simply cool out of system and really 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.799
 cool with this flat cable and everything 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.260
 what belongs to it just looks good 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.689
 Number two is the sound and that is too 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.810
 very similar to that of beats it is 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.430
 namely, so that beats medium is missing 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.110
 the son of beat it not bad though 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.000
 not really that good 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.650
 and the box is the same for you 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.150
 sounds good in the first moment so if 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.830
 is the first time that you amazed at how 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.750
 strong above all the bassist the 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.820
 heights are very clear but I am missing 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.799
 in the middle so i can not do it now as 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.229
 Replacement for mine for my speakers 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.400
 take here because I like it 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.170
 just not good enough but if i did 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.689
 times when on the move'm then the 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.280
 sounded great as I said I'm missing 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.689
 In the middle I can not do that with music forever 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.220
 because then I just do not hear that 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.200
 may someday but if you go now 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.000
 mobile musicians would I care when 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.079
 camping or you do go on 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.119
 grandparents or something 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.950
 then the speakers are just beautiful 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.600
 the sound is very loud very loud 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.369
 but if he gets too loud then over 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.020
 control the speakers but sometimes 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.430
 the bass is really stunning so 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.960
 if you hear a lot of electronic music 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.490
 then he resisted this sound and loved it too 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.880
 if you can give the beats he is very 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.039
 similar to beats and their value 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.379
 If your song number three is the price 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.460
 and that 's another thing 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.610
 he is not very cheap 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.900
 It costs about 82 euros on amazon de 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.890
 found a link times and a 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.780
 I could also describe the description 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.030
 richie customer and look at there but etc 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.600
 82 euro is not very little like this 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.520
 speaker 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.560
 but there is still a small one 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.960
 particularity is in this 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.420
 speakers an integrated additional battery 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.100
 integrated with 5000 milliamp hours 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.690
 that means you can be iphone at that time 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.790
 charge about four times 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.080
 that I can so about two here 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.700
 recharge approximately 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.470
 but there are also a lot 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.720
 adapters at steam is not a cable 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.850
 take away from peas lightning cable 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.010
 then that is unfortunately not in but for 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.390
 all older iphone models with the 30th 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.400
 bin dock connector for all sorts 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.440
 Android Phones for Windows Phone Phones 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.380
 are adapters and you can do that 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.200
 whole then via bluetooth or over 3.5 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.150
 mm jack so connect via cable and 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.100
 could enjoy music with it as well 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.080
 was very cool with the addition of battery 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.720
 together could be your ipad or 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.150
 iphone all sorts of devices load and 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.800
 The spades still have a very long time themselves 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.140
 Akkulaufzeit because he also with with 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.060
 this big battery lives and it is 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.790
 not too hard 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.620
 I think 330 grams are indicated so 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.880
 it's okay portabel and is one 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.500
 additional battery and that's really 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.650
 fantastic so i can do that 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.620
 Overall, you recommend speakers 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.020
 Answer is no, and if you are now 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.640
 not so much music when you listen 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.370
 if you are not into studio headphones 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.160
 used to be like me or a studio hear 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.660
 as it already in the kk previews 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.290
 I've seen the uploaded here 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.350
 the video 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.360
 if i put you in the end card then 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.000
 I'll love the sound first 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.620
 loud bass many heights are not quite so 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.600
 Many medium for me so not so much 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.520
 but if we MÃ¶gt the fence of beats 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.900
 then you can buy that confidently 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.090
 if the four has electronic music 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.040
 will hardly bother by that though how 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.870
 said to me as an audiophile guy 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.580
 So someone who really loves audio 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.290
 Not quite my thing but if you 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.090
 that does that for you as well 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.860
 made my question to you how do you hear 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.210
 mobile music is just over here 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.650
 headphones or do you already have one? 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.270
 little speaker or thinking about it 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.410
 you will buy such a speaker 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.520
 that's interesting, writes 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.980
 minutes in the comments 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.750
 take a look at Amazon's his 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.070
 box 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.900
 can you still decide if 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.370
 he wants one or not and then see 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.240
 I'll be back in the next video 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.240
 I'm looking forward to you doing well
