 where the album is present kept with the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.470
 most minute precaution by michael bay

 new daft punk record company 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.060

 a lot of people because it is not 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.110

 that they are too much we find a box 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.510
 black with the album is so there is 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.050
 all the titles of the strokes of the song 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.970
 absolutely 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.220

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.590
 listen separately at home at xo de 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.120

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.660
 for all artists or his clans 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.970
 vampire only joins the cult of 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.380
 secret is the mark of daft punk 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.940
 even the musicians who worked 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.190
 with on the album as chilly gonzales 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.970
 have been instructed to say the 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.489
 less possible 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:48.510
 you thought of it so that they are 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.730
 not in time the robots there I have not the 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.760
 right to talk about the album actually neither 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.700
 my impressions I can talk about them 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.560
 daft punk i can talk about the piano game 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.760
 by classical influences in everything 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.910
 our work but if we slow down the 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.850
 radio silence 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.260
 to create the buzz the group exel there is to 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.940
 barely a month the canvas ignites 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.040
 when the daft punk aired in 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.230

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.720
 their single the campaign promoting 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.030
 this album started two months before his 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.680
 exit which is completely unpublished 1 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.000
 million euros in France alone 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.580
 fashion jet marketing and campaign 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.140
 display in 24 hours the daft punk 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.660
 become the most tweeted topic at 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.710
 world on the internet comments seals 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.520
 the parodies the fans go wild 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.740
 today it's true that 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.600
 Internet users seize these 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.520
 information to create new 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.840
 that is, he lets loose loose punk punk 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.300
 After a fifteen second 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.130
 a user makes a piece that 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.630
 lasts 10 minutes the breasts of dastum on 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.310
 the best fans in the world because they 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.160
 do everything themselves the group does not know 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.660
 nothing and the rooms are all fans 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.710
 acquired to their cause since that day of 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:00.410
 1997 where this tube is this clip from 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.850
 director michel gondry the catapults 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.850
 at the top of a world glory 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.939
 big banks the world propels them 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:14.859
 a young of the world brothers and then that 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:17.049
 the next album with one more time was 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:18.690
 really a big planetary tube where he 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.949
 really acquires this stature of 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.669
 superstars like finally the music 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:26.860
 popular in France has never known the 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:29.500
 pop loves this stuff anymore has these 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.139
 new b a mystery who are these tee 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.400
 and but even a mystery to the point 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.960
 that we can ask ourselves even sometimes 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.580
 in their concerts and what they are there 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.129
 is it him 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.210
 behind the mask two Parisians from 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:43.759
 of the montmartre district 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.159
 thomas bangalter right and guy manual 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:49.699
 from homem christo snapshots to face 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:51.770
 discovered are rare predestined or not 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:53.240
 the work of the duo paid they have 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.629
 today managed to impose their 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.280
 robotic universe and their crazy clip 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:00.139
 if after seven years of absence the tent 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.150
 around the daft punk is impressive 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:04.759
 it is also because they have resisted 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.319
 yet in the mid-2000s after 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:09.819
 the immense success of discovery 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:09.819
 it fails to fall into oblivion 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.080
 Oh 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.710
 try a kind of drying out your 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.110
 felt the machines maybe arrive 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:23.950
 so limit that line you is a bit like that 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.780
 went round in search of inspiration they 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.880
 will put nearly five years before 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.130
 succeed in composing their album they go 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.010
 try for a name to do the following 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:36.790
 two of the first three albums all 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:39.460
 electronics in the studio and then it does not 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.120
 did not work they threw everything for 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.490
 bounce 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.810
 they will revolutionize their kind allies 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.169
 to their electronic sounds of real 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.169
 instruments 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:53.860
 for now we have space was really 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:55.480
 thomas eggimann of robots and then a 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.560
 single shot they stop they summon 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.320
 nile rodgers 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.870
 but he summons everything a real 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.550
 a rather formidable range of guests 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.680
 the idea is a take people who 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.900
 impressed them with offering them 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.520
 to make a music of the future because that 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.680
 remains a daft punk disk is still 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.600
 a lot of synthesizers and there is a real 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.970
 drummer and a real bassist and two 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.350
 guitarists totally hunt 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.740
 improbable in their casting of 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.690
 luxury 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.780
 they call again on the very sought 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:24.550
 musicians chilly gonzales and asks him 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.680
 to adapt with a traditional piano 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.760
 their futuristic sounds and that gives that 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:33.000
 m 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.780
 here the song something about rise of 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.780
 the discovery album 

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:47.650
 chilly gonzales tells us how he 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:51.099
 was contacted by daft punk we got it 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:54.159
 all had iphone at the time and we wait 

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:57.759
 that it sounds the bell sounds ring 

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:59.590
 you see the killer daf cicada is what 

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:02.110
 you are doing and you believe yourself 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:04.389
 los angeles like me i did it ago 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:07.330
 more than two years daaf as long as he 

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:09.400
 knew that I was rather a vehicle 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:12.340
 in the sense that I'm a pianist before 

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.940
 everything and asked me to actually do 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:18.430
 a kind of committee taken upside down 

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:19.050
 as if the whole lol piece of the album 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:22.210
 discovery 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:24.819
 as if their version was there remix 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:28.150

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:29.770

 atypical a new mystery that will hover 

00:07:47.229 --> 00:07:50.039
 until the last moment
