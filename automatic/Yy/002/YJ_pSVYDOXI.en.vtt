 let's start with this and let's 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.059
 This therefore enter my garage not here

 in case you want to see what the new 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.830
 masks like here would be the one of the zorrito 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.950
 so I'll go to the previous video there 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.890
 we have it and here is what would be the 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.590
 6 x 6 2 also in the small cart 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.750
 big cart I think he does not beat him 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.430
 to what would be the sam has the santina 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.320

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.630
 I wanted to see my garay there is the skewer 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.710
 cool we are going to tune the already I want 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.320
 have let's see how 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.759
 there was a truck there, which is the same 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.440
 to this nothing else that is like type 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.119
 normal truck I think it's called dub 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.670
 knows the same but this is the bird's 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.470
 artist effect 6 x 6 the other than what 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.960
 it's normal, nothing else, the name is good 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.729
 we like it, I think it's sweet 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.770
 I do not remember how it is but we're going to 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:48.539

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.539
 blue look others 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.750

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.700
 dlc of hipster dacca that I have person 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.399

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.149
 truck that takes out of males and pros 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.950
 that walk in the mud is not a little 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.200
 Like the machete ironic that they 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.060
 it puts if they are hipster they do not know and 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.890
 use a spoon with them they will put a 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.599
 machete not but but it is appreciated not that 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.060
 put these things here in people so 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.810
 we're going to crashed, we're going to have 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.069
 the maximum removes said of the truth already you 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.930

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.670
 thank you thank you thank you ok we're going to 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.670
 tune the maximum they also added what 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.620
 that would be new this new things for 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.090
 the saints custom is that this time it 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.250
 I'm going to show you everything they added 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.870
 because I'm going to have it full shielding 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.909
 we're going to put it one hundred percent 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.409
 brakes equal to 100% look are going to go 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:39.269
 all my money I have two million we go 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:43.370
 to see how much the defenses ended 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.370
 let's see what defenses are there 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.670
 it beat me this beat me and we're going to 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.980
 under 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.480
 is therefore the last one or that would be 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.760
 the defenses the engine we are going to put 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.550
 the eco level 4 explosives not for the 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.280
 we want to exploit exploit to exploit this 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:03.870
 then let's see the this take me the 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.850
 grills we are going to put the chest not 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.110
 I do not feel that this one I do not know why 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.370
 they put that gray the tires of betxÃ­ 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.680
 no but I do not like to continue and we're going to 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.819
 put the black horn not in the 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.600
 new horn this would be one of the 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.600
 things that they added 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.360
 to see another 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.360
 other 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.360
 other 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.550
 style and would be the new horn 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.980
 they added that they are four we are going to put 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.050
 the endless we do not go to the lights 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.310
 we see that they did not add I do not know what 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.989
 better he is in guarded for one of the 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.209
 that next because there are no lights up 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.620
 now the plate we are going to put on it I do not know 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.780
 what plate are you going to put the yellow for 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.390
 it looks pro the repainted here value 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.599
 by the repainted to put you added two 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.370
 new colors in the metals section 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:51.470
 we eat we already have the pure gold we have 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.810
 whatever the pure gold and the polished gold 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.580
 well that sounds to me like very indirect 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.260
 so that they stop being 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.180
 making their exotic combinations of 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.190
 gold because they already put us what would be the 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.450
 gold why there was nothing since we 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.250
 they put whatever gold paintings are 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.720
 in this case I'm not going to wear it because 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.489
 I like them but here they are if you 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.319
 they want to put are free good and the 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.090
 have this element is what in the 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.160
 level 100 have to do level 100 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.450
 to buy what these golds would be 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.890
 these are the ones that unlock with the 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.810
 level 100 once you have fun 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.700
 they will be able to have no if they can not 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.010
 keep using what would be the color that 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.260
 that we already have two poor kids that 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.970
 na more we can make combinations this 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.090
 Well, we're just going to put a color 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.220
 well tile 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.620
 let's put this white or in this 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.240
 silver and high school let's put 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.130
 he and the crew the speech always goes 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.750
 first china to gabriel and the kid 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.490
 emblem of the club where you put in 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.870
 perfect and urges the emblem of the 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:45.220
 crew let's see everything that 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.650
 we can put ok this beats me sell not 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.210
 we want to sell it when they give us 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.639
 250,000 fine suspension we will lower it 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.139
 all the transmission will be 2 to put to 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.870
 full on the turn we are going to put a super 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:57.940
 turbo wheels we are going to put wheels of the 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.889
 sports here the beast 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.139
 waters with the blin blin non sports 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.300
 let's put in is that I think rim that 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.880
 is off - road what yours in what 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.610
 little added more more rims me 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.320
 they added more wheels I think not because I 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.690
 the little stars appear there I go to 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.550
 put these on you now we are not going to put you 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.430
 colors re alive to put the roses not 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.289
 rositas rositas rositas to see what it looks like 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.729
 with the roses 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:24.069
 is 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:26.259
 You see a pinche tank appears 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:27.550
 truth the rositas to viewers of 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.680
 tires we are going to put the tires 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.479
 Custom bulletproof is believed to 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.689
 Here I think they added new fumes 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:38.469
 what would be the coffee the pink and the red I think 

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:39.699
 well the red was already the green I do not think 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:40.930
 that add a base to the rose and in the 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:44.319
 coffee I think so let's put the 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.789
 rosal del cru has already gone back and forth girls 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:47.289
 they also added what would be the black 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:49.059
 pure to that now black chairs and they look 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:50.800
 as the two differences like that the 

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:53.379
 outline of this black as it looks 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.759
 more transparent and here is not here 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:57.280
 you also see the different contour not 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:59.539
 I know what will change the blacks 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.150
 but hey, he gets in the most expensive one because 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:05.000
 we are pros and that would practically be 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.789
 all of the tune we see here there are wey 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.169
 ay dude for those who do not know is me 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:11.240
 I had forgotten where they can get 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:12.650
 this truck is the first car that 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.020
 we are going to be able to have in our garage 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.400
 that is in the guard to be able 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.560
 buy that truck we 're going to travel 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.909
 and transports we go to the hours or that 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.470
 is where all the cars are here 

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:23.300
 next because there would be a car here of 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.310
 hipster and well here we are going to find it 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.259
 in order to unlock what we are going to have 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.639
 that having level 100 is the only bad thing 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:29.900
 that we are going to be able to have that we are going to 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:30.650
 have to have level 100 to 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.740
 can you buy it 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:35.479
 we see that it has a price of 249 thousand and 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.580
 ready we could not buy it now we eat 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:39.800
 is super super chingÃ³n this truck 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.830
 the truth be compare side by side 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.659
 new car is very big no 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:50.110
 surpasses it I tried it and it surpasses us what 

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:50.110
 that would be the sun kim bps or did not clarify 

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:57.080
 but well that would practically be everything 

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:59.659
 from what would this new tuning be to 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:03.020
 full of this new car that is called 

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:05.389
 vent effector dust a 6 x 6 off-road 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.770
 for not hipster ok so so good if 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:08.779
 they want it they already know that they have to have
