00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.890 

I'll<00:03:22.710> just<00:03:23.040> cover<00:03:23.220> it<00:03:23.340> up<00:03:23.400> like<00:03:23.970> half<00:03:24.150> my<00:03:24.330> face

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:33.960 

so<00:03:27.900> I'm<00:03:28.080> just<00:03:28.200> going<00:03:28.409> to<00:03:28.500> finish<00:03:28.769> that

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.760 

and<00:03:34.970> this<00:03:35.599> actually<00:03:36.080> seems<00:03:36.290> like<00:03:36.380> a<00:03:36.560> really

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
and this actually seems like a really

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.140 
and this actually seems like a really
good<00:03:36.890> match<00:03:37.069> for<00:03:37.310> my<00:03:37.400> skin<00:03:37.459> which<00:03:37.970> is<00:03:38.000> really

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
good match for my skin which is really

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.080 
good match for my skin which is really
good<00:03:38.599> so<00:03:38.840> I<00:03:38.870> have<00:03:39.230> it<00:03:39.410> on<00:03:39.640> this<00:03:40.640> half<00:03:40.880> of<00:03:40.910> my

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
good so I have it on this half of my

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.730 
good so I have it on this half of my
face

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.530 

so<00:03:44.740> it<00:03:44.950> looks<00:03:45.130> really<00:03:45.970> natural<00:03:46.170> so<00:03:47.170> it's<00:03:47.290> about

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
so it looks really natural so it's about

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.590 
so it looks really natural so it's about
one<00:03:49.540> and<00:03:49.630> a<00:03:49.690> half<00:03:49.720> pumps<00:03:50.400> you<00:03:51.400> need<00:03:51.670> to<00:03:52.360> do<00:03:52.480> the

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
one and a half pumps you need to do the

00:03:52.600 --> 00:04:02.369 
one and a half pumps you need to do the
full<00:03:52.810> face

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.089 

so<00:04:02.980> I<00:04:03.010> would<00:04:03.189> say<00:04:03.310> this<00:04:03.519> is<00:04:03.730> more<00:04:03.999> of<00:04:04.180> like<00:04:04.239> a

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
so I would say this is more of like a

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.819 
so I would say this is more of like a
light<00:04:06.180> Tim<00:04:07.180> well<00:04:07.659> I<00:04:07.870> think<00:04:07.989> medium<00:04:08.560> to

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
light Tim well I think medium to

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:11.729 
light Tim well I think medium to
buildable<00:04:09.249> coverage<00:04:10.290> honestly<00:04:11.290> like<00:04:11.590> a

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
buildable coverage honestly like a

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.989 
buildable coverage honestly like a
perfect<00:04:12.310> match<00:04:12.370> for<00:04:12.700> my<00:04:12.819> skin<00:04:14.549> yay

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:15.999
