00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:18.720
 the remix here told the nottie bringing 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:24.359
 another video for you guys bringing 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:26.910
 here the buzz does not run Sun Twal exams 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.220
 This is what you have recommended. 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.640
 or perhaps writing using an account 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.960
 of the damha ruler 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.760
 then I have an idea but I recommend it 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.670
 This game I was playing with a little bit 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:46.350
 and she said that it's very strange 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.750
 only he is not strange that game he 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.660
 its addicting 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:56.550
 You'll see why I'm going to give you 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:01:00.570
 now the controls are basic little 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:04.280
 down slides up skips space 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:09.360
 attacks the hubs that goal is to run 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:12.150
 get a record out there 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.520
 How many meters can you run right? 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:19.500
 and it's the marching get tired of getting away from the zombies 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.750
 So play this game, listen to this song. 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.950
 What 's going on now I did not put it on? 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:31.380
 It's for the guys, it's the same thinking game. 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:36.299
 face imagine you in an apocalypse to a 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:39.360
 Zombie Apocalypse This Zombie Apocalypse 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.540
 this type your only goal is to get out of the 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.550
 home you are 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:51.020
 I went running down the street, types beans and 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:53.570
 type you do not like what I do 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.840
 I'm going to run because the biggest of the giant that 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:00.710
 It's coming because it likes sewers unb. 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.560
 old man getting over face 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:07.550
 This game has been here since life but it is 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:11.090
 It's a nice game, you have blood too. 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:16.850
 the galley is to go through the first 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:19.700
 barrier is ours a. 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.459
 It's getting difficult and it projects the 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.370
 reasoning of what you are talking about 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:29.630
 You have blood if you are successful by 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.890
 a zombie is logically to your 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.720
 Fatima on foot 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.720
 logically the following will decrease 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.550
 but its only goal here is through 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.870
 a record 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.020
 This game that is making me miss 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:49.690
 have played since longing to play since 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:54.470
 even not wait to launch it 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.840
 then released with great longing to play 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.430
 said 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.430
 This guy is running really funny, huh? 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:11.670
 This song reminds me of the movie is e e 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:14.010
 I do not remember infestation I remember it was 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.630
 the movie was practically zombie era 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:21.000
 people infected with the virus that 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.910
 made zombies like that to bite the 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.740
 people was if you had contact with 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:31.470
 blood in the eye in any corner of the 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:36.500
 body the person who stays the age type 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:39.120
 anger in the case that if now that seven days 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.020
 I did not remember the guys anything 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:46.830
 station 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:48.290
 the poster leave the runner movies or 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.780
 releases 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:57.380
 but I will not give up man I'll go 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.380
 give up because 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.060
 I'll play this game for a while. 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.189
 good weather here 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.610
 after the video is over and you know 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:09.370
 I'm going to play, I know you're going to play. 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:12.159
 because the game is good people do not watch the 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:16.049
 video and speaking this game is bad not 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:18.729
 I liked playing it before I had these 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.609
 peace impressions if you play at home in 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:24.010
 street and after the next day 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.960
 I was buying him a game playing 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:31.510
 example 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:33.550
 I never did it again when I already 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.110
 I played the game I already know that it is bad 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:42.580
 so like I know what to say 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:44.440
 I said I played such a difficult game, I 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.820
 I understand about why she spoke 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.440
 which is strange I think maybe because 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:54.690
 of the affection running he that this backpack 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.690
 sports run funny run 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.510
 but I found the game addictive but I go 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.860
 put in the e3 game series 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.600
 I do not know if I said that I put the 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:09.220
 addictive games 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:11.160
 but I 'm not going to put it really like this 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:15.850
 it's not strange 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.780
 analyzing well and it's hard guys are 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.980
 easy not 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:22.750
 I was already playing a little bit and that 's where it is. 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:26.560
 hard, for fuck I'm just going to play 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:31.600
 a game here I'm going to try to beat the 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:37.930
 Remember , I'm going to try to run a lot. 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:41.200
 now I'm going to focus a lot but this song 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:45.720
 face that making me depressed 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.720
 music is strange 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.930
 I 'm reflecting on stress things 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:04.430
 Our world is pulverized in this song. 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:14.600
 york drug ez 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:18.650
 foot the power look you kick that 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.720
 time to see debated with the kaka poop 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:25.150
 How's the cue to break that box? 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.150
 It's ours as you turbo and I think 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.820

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.080
 the river chute 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:54.300
 How I told you that I was going to 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:56.970
 focus more on the foot brake Bhatia had 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:00.570
 that jumping and kicking but that's it guys I 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:02.220
 I managed to beat all the records 

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:04.620
