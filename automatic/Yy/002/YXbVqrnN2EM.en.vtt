00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:15.599
 watching ubisoft tv raymond legions 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.920
 is at the door and we were allowed 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.779
 the game in advance in the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.609
 look at beautiful moet 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.439
 on one of the most beautiful beaches in europe 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.720
 became a unique player 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.430
 kick off party presents before it 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.650
 however, to this a little more relaxed 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.630
 Part of the event came in advance 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.759
 a visit to the villa ubisoft where the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.890
 new raymond legions was developed 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.719
 We were able to help the designers with the work 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.340
 look over the shoulder and got 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.350
 some extraordinarily interesting 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.090
 insights into the engine being under 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.469
 demonstrated how fast 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.870
 and just yourself during production 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.410
 modify things within the game 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.140
 to let 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.239
 with our well-known michelle sl the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.039
 father of raymond we talked a little bit 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.809
 later on all the crazy ones 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.079
 Ideas in the game and where the actually 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.670
 always come here 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.680
 Of course I do not do it alone 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.449
 First of all it is important to have a team 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.320
 lots of crazy people around 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.390
 build 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.830
 the musician artists even the 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.840
 Programmers all have to be a bit 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.060
 to be crazy about a game like that 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.320
 to be able to leave 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.420
 these are all these people 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.130
 crazy things sign or the music 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.110
 you can create quite logically 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.020
 build up with the help of the whole material 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.659
 that everyone delivered here we wanted 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.040
 something that will surprise everyone 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.110
 was not that easy because you can 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.070
 yes not always everything with surprise 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.840
 cram 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.729
 You have to balance those things 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.810
 people are giving something away 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.060
 expect another 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.380
 we took the fundamentals of control 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.880
 from the last part you have 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.740
 improved and then along with the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.380
 artists a new world is created 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.880
 it was not about something we did before 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.070
 had already revived 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.320
 but to start again at zero 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.860
 Just do something on a white sheet of paper 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.329
 new basta 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.259
 why are there so many new worlds and 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:01.640
 play modes such as kastrati play that 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.640
 you can really play for hours 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.140
 if you are working on a game it is 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.110
 important that all these things combined 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.530
 in the end, something naturally results 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.540
 it feels like that in the music level 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.120
 mix of visual art music and 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.830
 gameplay at the same time and these things 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.420
 be over and over again 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:34.500
 really, everything is right 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:36.840
 fits together, everything is new and 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.090
 but familiar with the new raymond legends 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.010
 next to the singleplayer mode and the 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.240
 known co- op mode certain brand new 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.950
 multiplayer games and of course 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:50.250
 expect the same again 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:52.500
 well-known raymond humor revelations 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.290
 will be released on august 29 for the wii the 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.190

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.190
