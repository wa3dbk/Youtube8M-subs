people<00:01:50.610> would<00:01:51.060> expect<00:01:52.850> but<00:01:53.850> what<00:01:54.030> will<00:01:54.149> happen

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
people would expect but what will happen

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.359 
people would expect but what will happen
if<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.689> keep<00:01:54.899> heating<00:01:55.470> up<00:01:55.680> in<00:01:55.829> temperatures

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
if you keep heating up in temperatures

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.389 
if you keep heating up in temperatures
it'll<00:01:56.700> start<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.360> evaporate<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:58.170> THC<00:01:58.469> now

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
it'll start to evaporate the THC now

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.340 
it'll start to evaporate the THC now
converted<00:02:00.030> will<00:02:00.149> start<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.509> go<00:02:00.630> skyward<00:02:01.110> it'll

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
converted will start to go skyward it'll

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.410 
converted will start to go skyward it'll
to<00:02:01.439> evaporate<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.790> want<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.119> hit<00:02:03.270> this

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
to evaporate so you want to hit this

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.999 
to evaporate so you want to hit this
optimum<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.399> then<00:02:05.399> prevent<00:02:05.909> evaporation<00:02:07.009> so

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
optimum and then prevent evaporation so

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.080
