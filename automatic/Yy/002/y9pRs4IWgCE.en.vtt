00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.010
 very good Balearic thing and I hope and 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.720
 commenting as we already manufacture in 5 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.069
 online and well do not have a pretty trick 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.630
 good but I'll be saying furis that 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.010
 cone makes good morning 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.200
 they have already put them on 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.250
 many of you know it many with 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.199
 the other players that's why it does not matter 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.119
 because I'm using two accounts worth 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.440
 one that had it in divergent 30 that 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.600
 made and another that is starting will 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.160
 level up but the color does not matter 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.570
 of more players as they put it because 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.939
 I had I do not know why rice is next 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.529
 he simply wins but does not come to 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.990
 because I'm going to explain a trick 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.840
 that pretty good how to get in here 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.850
 inside the cinema, it's like entering inside 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.410
 I'm going to show you on the map 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.210
 ok and once you show it on the map 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.590
 I could arrive by your 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.540
 own foot or with your own 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.430
 vehicles it does not matter if it comes and 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.960
 here goes a vehicle but once you already 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.000
 we have said what was already taught on the map 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.559
 let's go in as we enter good is 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.920
 very easy to do and everything if not 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.940
 You know, he puts himself at the door and you say 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.710
 you need to pay 20 dollars 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.539
 well we will pay 20 dollars and we will see a 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.610
 movie is ok but here inside we do not 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.930
 can rowing because because I do not know 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.730
 can you handle simply because you 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.079
 you pay at the cinema but you can come 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.480
 inside what are we going to do let's open 

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:09.100
 the phone we call yesterday 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.080
 once we call to cry not what 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.730
 lame we ask for an activity worth 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.230
 we request an activity when 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.820
 we request the activity we open the 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.140
 mobile and in said activities we 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.520
 will have to come now an activity 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.550
 ok you know I do not have it yet 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.470
 the theme that one of martÃ­n tell me where 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.480
 arrive now that it has arrived to me we accept 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.800
 the invitation we accept the invitation to 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.390
 the activity when we are inside the 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.220
 movies once you're inside it 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.380
 we have to do is very easy 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.500
 download the game we confirm buzzi 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.720
 and the most play if we give here here 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.160
 yes sure you want to play worth as 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.510
 you are seeing we have accepted the 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.190
 activity and once we accept it that 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.190
 what we do we enter the activity 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.840
 inside the cinema once we enter the 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.550
 activity as you are seeing are 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.350
 inside the cinema is already worth it and here we can 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.300
 do whatever you want, it's worth 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.280
 example, we can go around the 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.720
 worthy chair we can investigate what is it 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.100
 what's inside and the truth that is 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.890
 pretty good because we can investigate 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.450
 all the cinema completely we look at the 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.580
 walls I do not know we look at projects where 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.470
 they project the movies well this would be 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.630
 as a curiosity is worth a trick 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.399
 to enter the cinema but how 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.270
 can I go in, I'm going to show you how 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.180
 handle inside how to walk how 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.440
 curious curiosity but now what 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.850
 we're going to do is give it a little spin 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.430
 waffle we teach that look if 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.430
 let's go for the exit to the would be the 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.170
 emergency exit is worth the exit goes up 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.260
 the stairs as if it were a whole 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.790
 staircase worth it would be like a map and 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.280
 burgados here as having in the 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.920
 speakers the cameras where the 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.560
 movie everything pretty pretty the truth 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.480
 is very real is very real to everything and as 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.570
 you see now if we look down there 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.400
 we have people are worth we have people 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.920
 but if we shoot one the others do not 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.930
 they get up they 're so excited about the 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.730
 movie that do not get up we can 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.980
 to kill, and now, as you will see, 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.810
 raise the good person did not get up 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.790
 the people so what can we do and 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.950
 steal him take the little money 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.240
 we can catch the crime here at the 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.010
 person is holding me all 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.270
 little money that they release we take it off and do not 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.980
 We will have no type of level of 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.200
 search because because we cast inside 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.390
 a mission here we take little money 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.550
 the police may come to stop us 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.780
 may come not to take away our 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.160
 money because he's going to take it away 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.240
 we 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.840
 man who are watching the movies 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.950
 200 women because this can not be 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.560
 do with women but it 's a game 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.880
 it's a guitar money game and I'm sorry 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.520
 by thomas burgess writing but there 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.870
 an egg is worth good nothing is worth saying or 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.090
 what 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.280
 that is pretty good the trick is worth a 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.440
 trick to be able to enter the cinema 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.730
 once we are inside the cinema as 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.510
 we left here and it 's very easy 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.709
 for maybe we are the splinters we look 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.060
 everything we have to look at is worth 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.620
 when we get bored what it is that 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.750
 we made it out that we went out 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.819
 reality that will put exit is worth down there 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.340
 how is living a door puts exit 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.989
 and once we go out it will be all very 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.640
 it's easy because it looks to go out 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.530
 you still have to leave the broadcast 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.090
 you can leave but what I do is 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.340
 exit through the emergency door and put 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.829
 exit and here we will fall we will stay 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.810
 but if we open it parachute it's worth 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.099
 we will kill ourselves or nothing will appear much 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.240
 next to our vehicle where 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.370
 we have left now you will see 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.440
 as we appear next to our 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.520
 vehicle and nothing we can go now what 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.140
 what we have to do ends the 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.239
 activity we open the mobile list 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.220
 activities we finished the activity and not 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.420
 there will be no problem whatsoever I hope that 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.500

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.910
