enough<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.460> don't<00:01:44.640> think<00:01:44.700> as<00:01:44.970> he's<00:01:45.090> got<00:01:45.240> very

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
enough I don't think as he's got very

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.139 
enough I don't think as he's got very
good<00:01:45.479> potential<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:47.070> feel<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.670> that

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
good potential and I feel that that

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.550 
good potential and I feel that that
could<00:01:48.450> be<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.780> end<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.960> his<00:01:49.079> line<00:01:49.259> spell

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.810 
could be the end of his line spell

you see me acquiring about a lot of
these<00:03:02.340> players<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:03.269> then<00:03:03.360> per<00:03:03.540> bit<00:03:03.720> as<00:03:03.810> it

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
these players and then per bit as it

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.780 
these players and then per bit as it
bids<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.230> eventually<00:03:04.739> but<00:03:05.190> I<00:03:05.250> don't<00:03:05.700> know

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
bids and eventually but I don't know

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.729 
bids and eventually but I don't know
whether<00:03:06.300> the<00:03:06.780> inquiring<00:03:07.260> does<00:03:07.530> make<00:03:07.680> a

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
whether the inquiring does make a

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:08.660 
whether the inquiring does make a
difference<00:03:07.890> or<00:03:08.129> not<00:03:08.159> whether<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:08.489> get<00:03:08.610> a

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
difference or not whether you get a

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.250 
difference or not whether you get a
lower<00:03:08.849> price<00:03:09.150> or<00:03:09.450> whether<00:03:09.780> it's<00:03:09.900> just<00:03:10.050> a<00:03:10.110> waste

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
lower price or whether it's just a waste

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.170 
lower price or whether it's just a waste
of<00:03:10.409> time<00:03:10.560> I<00:03:10.620> might<00:03:10.860> just<00:03:11.010> stick<00:03:11.190> bids<00:03:11.459> in<00:03:11.610> and

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
of time I might just stick bids in and

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.640 
of time I might just stick bids in and
see<00:03:12.390> where<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.629> goes<00:03:12.750> from<00:03:12.810> there<00:03:12.989> but<00:03:13.560> this

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
see where it goes from there but this

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.710 
see where it goes from there but this
game<00:03:13.860> is<00:03:14.099> the<00:03:14.190> last<00:03:14.849> game<00:03:15.030> of<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.180> episode<00:03:15.510> but

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
game is the last game of the episode but

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.000 
game is the last game of the episode but
there<00:03:15.870> was<00:03:15.959> a<00:03:16.019> lot<00:03:16.050> more<00:03:16.170> after<00:03:16.560> this<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:16.980> I

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
there was a lot more after this and I

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.740 
there was a lot more after this and I
think<00:03:17.340> it's<00:03:17.430> Manchester<00:03:17.879> City<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.209> first<00:03:18.510> leg

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
think it's Manchester City the first leg

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.110 
think it's Manchester City the first leg
of<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.319> capital<00:03:19.709> one<00:03:19.860> cup<00:03:20.069> semi-finals<00:03:20.879> if<00:03:21.000> I

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
of the capital one cup semi-finals if I

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.089 
of the capital one cup semi-finals if I
win<00:03:21.300> this<00:03:21.480> gives<00:03:22.140> me<00:03:22.170> a<00:03:22.290> big<00:03:22.590> big<00:03:22.860> home

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
win this gives me a big big home

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.089 
win this gives me a big big home
advantage<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:23.790> for<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.480> next<00:03:24.780> game<00:03:25.230> as<00:03:25.470> if<00:03:26.010> I

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
advantage and for the next game as if I

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.070 
advantage and for the next game as if I
get<00:03:26.280> away<00:03:26.519> goal<00:03:26.760> I<00:03:26.940> think<00:03:27.390> at<00:03:27.510> they<00:03:27.690> counting

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
get away goal I think at they counting

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.930 
get away goal I think at they counting
this<00:03:28.140> one<00:03:28.200> I'm<00:03:28.500> not<00:03:28.620> too<00:03:28.920> certain<00:03:29.220> though<00:03:29.459> but

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
this one I'm not too certain though but

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.570 
this one I'm not too certain though but
see<00:03:30.390> they<00:03:30.930> did<00:03:31.200> they<00:03:31.470> did<00:03:31.650> set<00:03:31.860> up<00:03:31.980> as<00:03:32.129> I<00:03:32.250> how<00:03:32.549> I

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580

thought they would be very very strong
at<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.650> back<00:03:34.830> a<00:03:35.040> very<00:03:35.340> very<00:03:35.580> hidden<00:03:35.849> attack

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
at the back a very very hidden attack

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.929 
think rating might have had they been
