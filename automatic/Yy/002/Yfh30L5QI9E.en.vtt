00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.590
 hello today we are going to learn how to make a 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.230
 piñata for a children's party that 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:13.290
 We will need need cardboard 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.900
 that will be the basis of our piñata 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.890
 also some folios and paper in 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.260
 different colors of silk or chris paul 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:26.039
 we will also need a pencil and a 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.900
 felt pen color ribbon you want 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.930
 I have chosen some feathers to decorate 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.760
 the strips but it is not necessary and in addition 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:38.329
 scissors one tape cutter and 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.329
 glue 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:49.019
 we have cut a star in a 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.019
 cardboard and we are going to capture the same figure 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:56.570
 and we cut it because it's going to be both 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.570
 sides of the piñata 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.650
 we mark 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.650
 in the carton 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.989
 so that we stay the same 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.480
 and we remember it 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.620
 we have the two cardboard stars 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.700
 trimmed the same and we need to 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:23.430
 cut out the cardboard boxes of 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.560
 12 cm wide the length of the same because 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.800
 then we are going to adjust these 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.330
 cardboard strips will be made the 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.810
 star wall to give the 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.730
 depth and we'll have to put cardboard 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.680
 in if this is the part above and this 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.230
 is the one on the bottom on all sides 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.880
 except in the part here below that 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.550
 we will put the paper so that it can be 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.580
 break and that the candies fall is very 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.490
 simple we have to go taking in the 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.690
 cardboard boxes the length of the 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.130
 sides of the star 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.130
 here we mark it 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.560
 and we are going to cut it 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.660
 let's start on my side 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.360
 short that is the rectangle that we have 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.540
 cut 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.520
 Lopez set 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.069
 with adhesive tape 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.850
 and we put 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.069
 the other side to finish 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:40.250
 the peak of the fairs 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:43.090
 and the same thing we can cut another piece 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.800
 and put it right here 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.269
 so that it does not move does not matter that 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.600
 get ugly because then everything is going to 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.840
 cover 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.840
 and we're creating the whole melted door 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.150
 the star we already have a peak we have 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.130
 to do the rest except the part of 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.120
 below we will do it with folio as 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.120
 we have said so 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:07.700
 we have already put all the sides and down 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:09.740
 same but with important folio in the 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.240
 part of top we have to leave a 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:15.130
 space without putting because over here 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.130
 we will introduce the sweets 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.180
 let's give a little color to our 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.130
 piñata with the silk papers we have 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.400
 than to cut fringe strips like that in 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.890
 colors that we are going to make very simple 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.960
 and then we have to stick them 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:34.360
 one on top of the other, we are superimposing 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.360
 so we throw glue 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.130
 we are hitting it over 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:44.010
 and so we will be doing different 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.010
 layers to cover all the piñata 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.440
 We have already finished our piñata we 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.140
 coated all with with tissue paper 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.269
 and we have added some strips that with the 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.480
 tape as we explained before what 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.769
 we have stuck directly to the paper that 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.870
 was on the bottom so that the 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.519
 children have breaks and fall 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.739
 trinkets that we have stuck in the hole 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.870
 of the river and we have covered it and this is the 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.819
 result if you liked this idea not 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.209
