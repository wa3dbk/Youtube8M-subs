something just put on a really low

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.560 
something just put on a really low
sticker<00:01:10.950> on<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.100> or<00:01:11.610> somebody<00:01:11.939> try<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.450> do

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
sticker on it or somebody try and do

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.030

them<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:13.260> know<00:01:13.380> trying<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.680> get<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.920> for

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
them you know trying to get it for

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.289 
them you know trying to get it for
cheaper<00:01:14.369> so<00:01:14.549> they<00:01:14.670> took<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.000> sticker<00:01:15.180> off

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
cheaper so they took the sticker off

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.580 
cheaper so they took the sticker off
some<00:01:15.540> peanuts<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.840> put<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.229> there<00:01:16.439> and

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
some peanuts and put it on there and

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.859 
some peanuts and put it on there and
then<00:01:16.740> just<00:01:16.770> left<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.909> pack<00:01:18.119> for<00:01:18.360> some<00:01:18.540> reason

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
then just left the pack for some reason

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.630 
then just left the pack for some reason
so<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.200> was<00:01:19.500> very<00:01:19.710> skeptical<00:01:20.250> when<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.400> saw<00:01:20.580> it

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
so I was very skeptical when I saw it

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.300 
so I was very skeptical when I saw it
went<00:01:21.420> up<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.750> UM<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.320> person<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:23.220> was

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
went up to UM the person that was

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.920 
went up to UM the person that was
working<00:01:23.670> at<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.970> electronics<00:01:24.570> which<00:01:24.780> is

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
working at the electronics which is

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.800 
working at the electronics which is
right<00:01:25.049> next<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.380> toys<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:26.299> he<00:01:27.299> said<00:01:27.600> that

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
right next to the toys and he said that

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.260 
right next to the toys and he said that
yeah<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.159> actual<00:01:29.340> price<00:01:29.820> that

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
yeah that this is the actual price that

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.120 
yeah that this is the actual price that
and<00:01:30.450> apparently<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.439> wasn't<00:01:31.710> from<00:01:31.950> their

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
and apparently this wasn't from their

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.310 
and apparently this wasn't from their
store<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:32.790> they<00:01:32.909> crossed<00:01:33.210> out<00:01:33.540> with<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.900> and

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
store so they crossed out with that and

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.770 
store so they crossed out with that and
put<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.610> sticker<00:01:35.970> on<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.210> with<00:01:36.360> its<00:01:36.570> own

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780

these two it's actually slick at the end
so<00:02:43.960> yeah<00:02:44.140> so<00:02:44.470> I'm<00:02:44.620> it's<00:02:44.860> pretty<00:02:45.100> obvious

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
so yeah so I'm it's pretty obvious

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.060 
so yeah so I'm it's pretty obvious
unfortunately<00:02:46.270> typically<00:02:47.170> with<00:02:47.350> them<00:02:47.560> kids

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
unfortunately typically with them kids

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.890 
unfortunately typically with them kids
shows<00:02:48.340> they<00:02:48.580> try<00:02:48.910> to<00:02:48.970> make<00:02:49.120> it<00:02:49.209> obvious<00:02:49.300> but<00:02:49.870> uh

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
shows they try to make it obvious but uh

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.780 
shows they try to make it obvious but uh

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
illegal or something I can barely

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:22.669 
Captain Rex by them typically if you

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:24.820 
Captain Rex by them typically if you

when<00:06:36.949> you<00:06:37.070> move<00:06:37.250> the<00:06:37.520> helmet<00:06:37.820> you<00:06:37.849> will<00:06:38.120> also

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:38.300 
when you move the helmet you will also

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.230 
when you move the helmet you will also
move<00:06:38.630> the<00:06:38.839> head

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 
move the head

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.480 
move the head
at<00:06:39.479> the<00:06:39.660> same<00:06:39.870> time<00:06:40.050> except<00:06:40.830> Captain<00:06:41.250> Rex

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:41.490 
at the same time except Captain Rex

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:42.980 
at the same time except Captain Rex
captain<00:06:41.880> Rex's<00:06:42.180> helmet<00:06:42.509> is<00:06:42.630> very<00:06:42.810> loose

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990 
captain Rex's helmet is very loose

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.590 
captain Rex's helmet is very loose
online<00:06:43.460> so<00:06:44.460> when<00:06:44.669> you<00:06:44.789> move<00:06:45.000> the<00:06:45.240> helmet

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 
online so when you move the helmet

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.180 
online so when you move the helmet
typically<00:06:45.960> the<00:06:46.110> head<00:06:46.259> won't<00:06:46.440> go<00:06:46.590> with<00:06:46.800> it<00:06:46.949> so

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:47.190 
typically the head won't go with it so

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.700 
typically the head won't go with it so
