00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.749 
play it but then you get to measure
seven<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.140> go<00:01:25.259> holy<00:01:26.040> crap<00:01:26.340> that's<00:01:26.520> really

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
seven and you go holy crap that's really

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.090 
seven and you go holy crap that's really
hard<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.000> do<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.020> have<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.350> take<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.770> that

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
hard to do so you have to take that that

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.590 
hard to do so you have to take that that
that<00:01:29.430> problem<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.060> you've<00:01:30.210> got<00:01:30.390> there

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
that problem that you've got there

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.179 
that problem that you've got there
you've<00:01:30.750> got<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.960> isolate<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.740> problem<00:01:32.070> and

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
you've got to isolate the problem and

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.120 
you've got to isolate the problem and
you've<00:01:32.310> got<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.610> build<00:01:32.970> your<00:01:33.630> technique<00:01:34.229> build

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
you've got to build your technique build

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.440 
you've got to build your technique build
your<00:01:35.310> physicality<00:01:35.729> build<00:01:36.270> your

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
your physicality build your

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.450 
your physicality build your
understanding<00:01:37.020> whatever<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.979> then

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
understanding whatever it is and then

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.980 
understanding whatever it is and then
you<00:01:38.549> jump<00:01:38.790> back<00:01:39.000> into<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.329> song<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.930> you

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
you jump back into that song and you

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.380 
you jump back into that song and you
start<00:01:40.229> trying<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.500> build<00:01:40.590> even<00:01:40.979> further

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
start trying to build even further

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.649 
start trying to build even further
project<00:01:42.390> songs<00:01:42.630> take<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:43.140> lot<00:01:43.649> longer<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.820> get

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
project songs take a lot longer to get

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.639 
project songs take a lot longer to get
they<00:01:46.619> take<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.860> lot<00:01:47.130> longer<00:01:47.340> for<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.850> study

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
they take a lot longer for you to study

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.660 
they take a lot longer for you to study
but<00:01:49.649> by<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.890> time<00:01:50.130> you're<00:01:50.310> done<00:01:50.460> with<00:01:50.520> that

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
but by the time you're done with that

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.460 
but by the time you're done with that
project<00:01:50.970> song<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.540> are<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.750> better<00:01:52.110> player

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
your time on the project song side you

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.889 
your time on the project song side you
tend<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.130> feel<00:01:59.399> bummed<00:02:00.000> like<00:02:00.329> I've<00:02:00.570> had<00:02:00.689> lots
