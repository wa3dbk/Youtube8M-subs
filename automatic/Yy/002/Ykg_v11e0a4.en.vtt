he<00:01:18.840> had<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> no<00:01:19.830> limit<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.729> amount<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.370 
length of the album
III<00:01:23.460> don't<00:01:24.119> know<00:01:24.270> if<00:01:24.420> that's<00:01:24.570> like<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.750> maximum

III don't know if that's like a maximum

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.440 
III don't know if that's like a maximum
on<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.710> think<00:01:25.920> it's<00:01:26.040> more<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.490> minimum<00:01:27.299> or

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
on it I think it's more of a minimum or

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.060 
on it I think it's more of a minimum or
just<00:01:27.659> kind<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.840> an<00:01:27.960> average<00:01:28.140> as<00:01:28.680> they<00:01:28.890> want

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
just kind of an average as they want

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.100 
just kind of an average as they want
around<00:01:29.610> then<00:01:29.880> yeah<00:01:30.150> obviously<00:01:30.570> with<00:01:31.020> this

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
around then yeah obviously with this

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.330 
around then yeah obviously with this
shorter<00:01:31.470> time<00:01:31.710> limit<00:01:31.950> you're<00:01:32.040> not<00:01:32.159> gonna<00:01:32.250> be

four to five minute range which is a
good<00:01:49.890> range<00:01:50.130> if<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.520> know<00:01:50.729> what<00:01:50.939> you're<00:01:51.060> doing

just being pumped up that's exactly how

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.770 
just being pumped up that's exactly how
this<00:02:17.220> sounds

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
this sounds

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.780

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
you just have this this huge mix of a

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.619 
you just have this this huge mix of a
real<00:02:21.480> instrument<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:22.370> orchestral

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
real instrument of orchestral

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.899 
real instrument of orchestral
instruments<00:02:24.629> you<00:02:24.780> know<00:02:24.810> in<00:02:25.439> strings<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.670> and

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
instruments you know in strings and and

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.059 
instruments you know in strings and and
then<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.150> also<00:02:27.329> have<00:02:27.659> these<00:02:28.069> electronic

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
then you also have these electronic

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.770 
then you also have these electronic
elements<00:02:29.459> that<00:02:29.549> come<00:02:29.760> in<00:02:29.909> too<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.299> and<00:02:30.720> I

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
elements that come in too and and I

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.420 
elements that come in too and and I
really<00:02:31.170> think<00:02:31.379> that<00:02:31.530> he<00:02:31.680> does<00:02:31.829> a<00:02:31.860> very<00:02:32.190> nice

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
really think that he does a very nice

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.300 
really think that he does a very nice
job<00:02:32.489> of<00:02:32.790> blending<00:02:33.480> them<00:02:33.629> together<00:02:34.069> and<00:02:35.069> and

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
job of blending them together and and

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.339 
job of blending them together and and
like<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.879> first<00:02:36.150> few<00:02:36.450> tracks<00:02:36.750> are<00:02:37.049> just

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
like the first few tracks are just

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.490 
like the first few tracks are just
pretty<00:02:37.829> darn<00:02:38.129> incredible<00:02:38.959> and<00:02:39.959> then<00:02:40.170> the

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
pretty darn incredible and then the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.440 
pretty darn incredible and then the
album<00:02:40.650> kind<00:02:41.340> of<00:02:41.489> goes<00:02:41.640> into<00:02:41.849> this<00:02:42.030> lull<00:02:42.420> where

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
album kind of goes into this lull where

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.649 
album kind of goes into this lull where
tracks<00:02:43.049> five<00:02:43.349> six<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:43.920> seven<00:02:44.480> kind<00:02:45.480> of<00:02:45.569> go

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
tracks five six and seven kind of go

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.259 
tracks five six and seven kind of go
into<00:02:45.870> this<00:02:46.459> ambient<00:02:47.459> stage<00:02:47.760> there's<00:02:48.060> still

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
into this ambient stage there's still

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.599 
into this ambient stage there's still
some<00:02:48.450> cool<00:02:49.010> aspects<00:02:50.010> of<00:02:50.190> them<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:50.430> know<00:02:50.549> and

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
some cool aspects of them you know and

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.520 
some cool aspects of them you know and
they<00:02:50.700> kind<00:02:50.879> of<00:02:50.940> go<00:02:51.090> in<00:02:51.239> and<00:02:51.359> out<00:02:51.450> of<00:02:51.659> these<00:02:51.780> more

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
they kind of go in and out of these more

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.839 
they kind of go in and out of these more
melodic<00:02:53.040> parts<00:02:53.310> but<00:02:53.430> there's<00:02:53.519> a<00:02:53.609> lot<00:02:53.760> of

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
melodic parts but there's a lot of

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.520 
melodic parts but there's a lot of
ambience<00:02:54.329> to<00:02:54.569> them<00:02:54.690> but<00:02:54.840> then<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.109> last<00:02:55.230> two

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
ambience to them but then the last two

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.750 
ambience to them but then the last two
tracks<00:02:55.769> on<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.010> album<00:02:56.099> I<00:02:56.280> feel<00:02:56.459> like<00:02:56.609> are

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
tracks on the album I feel like are

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.160 
tracks on the album I feel like are
stronger<00:02:57.090> so<00:02:57.420> I<00:02:57.450> feel<00:02:57.599> like<00:02:57.629> the<00:02:57.840> album<00:02:58.019> kind

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
stronger so I feel like the album kind

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.569 
stronger so I feel like the album kind
of<00:02:58.319> goes<00:02:58.440> like<00:02:58.620> this<00:02:58.799> and<00:02:59.129> then<00:02:59.280> goes<00:02:59.459> like

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
of goes like this and then goes like

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.819 
of goes like this and then goes like
this<00:02:59.849> and<00:03:00.239> then<00:03:00.359> comes<00:03:00.540> like<00:03:00.690> that<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.650> to

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
this and then comes like that and and to

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.949 
this and then comes like that and and to
me<00:03:01.950> that<00:03:02.159> sag<00:03:02.549> in<00:03:02.849> the<00:03:02.940> middle<00:03:03.180> is<00:03:03.359> really<00:03:03.780> my

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
me that sag in the middle is really my

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.690 
me that sag in the middle is really my
main<00:03:04.230> criticism<00:03:04.920> of<00:03:05.069> what's<00:03:05.280> holding<00:03:05.609> this

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
main criticism of what's holding this

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.009 
main criticism of what's holding this
back<00:03:05.879> because<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.150> think<00:03:06.209> it<00:03:06.389> loses<00:03:06.659> a<00:03:06.690> lot<00:03:06.870> of

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
back because I think it loses a lot of

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.300 
back because I think it loses a lot of
momentum<00:03:07.230> Tom<00:03:07.590> would<00:03:07.769> you<00:03:07.799> over<00:03:08.129> although

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
momentum Tom would you over although

momentum Tom would you over although

into<00:03:52.829> that<00:03:52.949> kind<00:03:53.159> of<00:03:53.310> mystery<00:03:53.760> of<00:03:54.030> songs<00:03:54.329> and

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
into that kind of mystery of songs and

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.809 
into that kind of mystery of songs and
that's<00:03:55.109> all<00:03:55.409> over<00:03:55.829> this<00:03:55.949> album<00:03:56.370> and<00:03:56.519> I<00:03:56.579> love

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
that's all over this album and I love

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.849 
that's all over this album and I love
the<00:03:56.970> just<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.299> complex<00:03:58.019> arrangements<00:03:58.739> and

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
the just the complex arrangements and

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.809 
the just the complex arrangements and
production<00:04:00.560> but<00:04:01.560> at<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:01.889> same<00:04:02.099> time<00:04:02.370> and<00:04:02.639> this

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
production but at the same time and this

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.699 
production but at the same time and this
probably<00:04:03.150> comes<00:04:03.329> back<00:04:03.659> to<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:03.959> nature<00:04:04.379> of<00:04:04.409> the

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
probably comes back to the nature of the

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.710 
probably comes back to the nature of the
challenge<00:04:05.310> and<00:04:05.519> the<00:04:05.639> context<00:04:06.209> under<00:04:06.389> which<00:04:06.540> he

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
challenge and the context under which he

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.069 
challenge and the context under which he
did<00:04:06.930> this<00:04:07.109> album<00:04:07.590> but<00:04:08.250> it<00:04:08.579> feels<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.569> does<00:04:09.780> feel

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079

what makes songs really emotional really
powerful<00:05:15.960> is<00:05:16.080> when<00:05:16.319> you're<00:05:16.680> able<00:05:16.830> to<00:05:17.009> do<00:05:17.219> that

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
powerful is when you're able to do that

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.709 
powerful is when you're able to do that
we're<00:05:17.610> distinguished<00:05:18.120> between<00:05:18.240> the<00:05:18.449> highs

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:18.719 
we're distinguished between the highs

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:20.689 
we're distinguished between the highs
and<00:05:18.750> the<00:05:19.050> lows<00:05:19.110> and<00:05:19.529> your<00:05:19.620> sound<00:05:19.860> and<00:05:20.250> all<00:05:20.490> of<00:05:20.610> a

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 
and the lows and your sound and all of a

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:21.649 
and the lows and your sound and all of a
sudden<00:05:20.969> you<00:05:21.060> have<00:05:21.180> a<00:05:21.210> really<00:05:21.509> engaging

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:21.659 
sudden you have a really engaging

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:24.740 
sudden you have a really engaging
intense<00:05:22.469> listen<00:05:22.949> and<00:05:23.639> and<00:05:24.000> most<00:05:24.479> of<00:05:24.659> these

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
intense listen and and most of these

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.080 
intense listen and and most of these
tracks<00:05:25.139> do<00:05:25.740> that<00:05:25.979> even<00:05:26.580> even<00:05:26.849> the<00:05:26.939> more

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
tracks do that even even the more

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.730 
tracks do that even even the more
ambient<00:05:27.509> tracks<00:05:27.840> focus<00:05:28.289> a<00:05:28.319> little<00:05:28.500> bit<00:05:28.680> on

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
ambient tracks focus a little bit on

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.920 
ambient tracks focus a little bit on
dynamics<00:05:29.340> and<00:05:29.789> and<00:05:30.300> that's<00:05:30.509> something<00:05:30.779> that<00:05:30.900> I

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
dynamics and and that's something that I

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.869 
dynamics and and that's something that I
think<00:05:30.990> is<00:05:31.259> kind<00:05:31.770> of<00:05:31.919> lost<00:05:32.129> on<00:05:32.340> music<00:05:32.610> today<00:05:32.819> you
