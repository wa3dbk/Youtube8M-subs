00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.700 
this up when you get it a little bit of
an<00:01:08.250> angle<00:01:08.450> enough<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.840> clears<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.470> back

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
an angle enough so it clears the back

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.020 
an angle enough so it clears the back
plate<00:01:11.040> back<00:01:11.340> there<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.670> then<00:01:11.790> we're<00:01:11.880> going<00:01:12.000> to

okay here's our door switch assembly

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.780 
okay here's our door switch assembly
with<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.080> wires<00:03:02.320> and<00:03:03.190> this<00:03:03.370> is<00:03:03.519> your<00:03:03.640> main

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
with the wires and this is your main

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.880 
with the wires and this is your main
power<00:03:04.090> wire<00:03:04.269> coming<00:03:04.959> right<00:03:05.200> into<00:03:05.410> your<00:03:05.680> door

switch<00:03:06.220> so<00:03:06.910> we<00:03:07.000> want<00:03:07.209> to<00:03:07.300> get<00:03:07.390> access<00:03:07.630> to<00:03:07.900> that

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
switch so we want to get access to that

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.440 
switch so we want to get access to that
now<00:03:10.630> there's<00:03:10.900> a<00:03:11.170> few<00:03:12.010> wires<00:03:12.310> on<00:03:12.880> that<00:03:13.660> switch

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
now there's a few wires on that switch

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.820 
now there's a few wires on that switch
two<00:03:16.450> of<00:03:16.600> them<00:03:16.750> are<00:03:16.870> going<00:03:17.019> up<00:03:17.290> to<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:17.590> light

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
two of them are going up to the light

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.850 
two of them are going up to the light
they<00:03:18.459> run<00:03:18.670> up<00:03:18.820> here<00:03:19.060> to<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.450> light<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:20.739> other

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
they run up here to the light the other

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.800 
they run up here to the light the other
to<00:03:21.130> feed<00:03:21.459> in<00:03:21.700> so<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.030> first<00:03:22.269> thing<00:03:22.450> we<00:03:22.540> want<00:03:22.750> to

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
to feed in so the first thing we want to

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.949 
to feed in so the first thing we want to
do<00:03:22.930> is<00:03:23.049> we<00:03:23.140> want<00:03:23.290> to<00:03:23.380> disconnect<00:03:23.920> this

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
do is we want to disconnect this

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:31.770 
do is we want to disconnect this
connector<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:29.610> then<00:03:30.610> always<00:03:30.910> use<00:03:31.299> needlenose

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
connector and then always use needlenose

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.410 
connector and then always use needlenose
to<00:03:32.260> pull<00:03:32.470> these<00:03:32.709> terminals<00:03:33.370> off

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:46.420 

don't<00:03:38.420> pull<00:03:39.350> that<00:03:39.380> wire<00:03:39.830> around<00:03:45.250> okay<00:03:46.250> we've

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
don't pull that wire around okay we've

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.780 
don't pull that wire around okay we've
got<00:03:46.700> that<00:03:46.850> disconnected<00:03:48.130> if<00:03:49.130> you<00:03:49.370> look<00:03:49.610> at

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
got that disconnected if you look at

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.260 
got that disconnected if you look at
that<00:03:50.290> blower<00:03:51.290> hole<00:03:51.710> here<00:03:52.070> how<00:03:52.280> dirty<00:03:52.610> that<00:03:52.790> is
