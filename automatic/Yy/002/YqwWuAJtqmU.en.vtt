00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.839
 Hello you, I show you today 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.660
 someone from an ordinary blouse or 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:13.350
 a charming strapless shirt 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.350
 can make top 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.369
 the only thing he needs is one 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.919
 shirt and a blouse of your choice with 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.300
 long sleeves 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:24.429
 depending on what you mean for a bust 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.960
 have worked well with three quarters 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.369
 I'm still working on my sleeves 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.880
 but I think with a greater will 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.880
 it a bit critical 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.610
 otherwise to pay attention is actually the 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.680
 only thing I recommend you 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.230
 if not you have now 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.630
 to buy a strapless ph because that 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.970
 simply beautiful looks a lot of fun 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.030
 to show you how to do it 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:51.310
 nice to leave my dress on 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:56.350
 you need the second blouse and fold 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:01:01.720
 then put the collar inside 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:07.799
 this part of your back he goes 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:10.479
 along the button bar and find 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.999
 matching did not fit the pass mine 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.560
 button and the matching hole and at the 

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:17.740
 put it where it is not too tight but also 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.729
 not so loose sits knits here 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.189
 that's easy for me, for example 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.499
 it does not matter if it 's just boring below 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:28.240
 or not 

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:30.039
 but what to decide for myself after 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.749
 which hole in which button can it 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.759
 its that different and long 

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:34.439
 is it should pay attention what 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.929
 important is 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:41.710
 Now I do that so that the 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:49.860
 button strip umknickte further not so 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:54.590
 nice to find you know on your side like that 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:57.390
 the next step is that we 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.340
 Heads and holes have button together 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:04.200
 tie 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:07.850
 just finished or how you think so 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.760
 The first step is now thanks 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:16.860
 Thereafter, the carrier assumes the sleeve by 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:20.730
 front that it is smooth here and here 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:25.520
 also in front and just makes one 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:30.540
 knot in the middle one more 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:34.260
 then the whole looks like this in the 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:37.170
 is coming towards you so that equal the beautiful 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.680
 side is outside so here it is around 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.920
 with the other sleeves and stuck 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.680
 the whole thing down 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.110
 Under button bar could be from others 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:54.120
 Side pull with that we do not 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:57.750
 so cringing on it greets him like already 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.860
 you want the knot then you can 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.810
 the whole still cope I bucking the 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.989
 I have no feeling unfortunately now 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:11.600
 mirror super time more still switzerland 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.600
 looks like that 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:23.340
 so that's it 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.470
 I still think in the mirror check 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.570
 how the whole looks from behind and whether 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.890
 somewhere else you are 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:34.160
 not like I could just completely 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.160
 good by putting in it 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.090
 So you see the top is ready 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.630
 Kinked and laced and what also 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.940
 So you always have an optical one 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.770
 loop st 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.800
 and that may not be that now 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:55.890
 Best color for me for a strapless 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.860
 top that with other flowers 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.810
 I tried and it is easy for me 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.000
 noticed that it just depends 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.910
 which in Budapest too completely 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.100
 can wear different occasions 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.600
 I once photographed and put the 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.870
 then go in and you can do it yourself 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.540
 I look at you has this 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.690
 if you still have tips, please like tutorial 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.160
 or suggestions have against it 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.490
 I have constructive criticism at all 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.070
 nothing on the contrary you can 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.420
 Try to look like it 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.420
