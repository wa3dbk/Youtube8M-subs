controller<00:02:49.760> as<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:51.750> can<00:02:51.870> see<00:02:52.050> it<00:02:52.260> looks

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
controller as you can see it looks

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.120 
controller as you can see it looks
exactly<00:02:52.620> like<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.989> real<00:02:54.989> one<00:02:55.050> it<00:02:55.739> looks<00:02:55.950> exactly

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
exactly like a real one it looks exactly

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.610 
exactly like a real one it looks exactly
like<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:57.540> real<00:02:57.750> one<00:02:58.670> except<00:02:59.670> for<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:00.620> few

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
like the real one except for a few

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.740 
like the real one except for a few
things<00:03:01.860> like<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.310> edges<00:03:03.260> aren't<00:03:04.260> is<00:03:05.360> smooth

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
things like the edges aren't is smooth

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.630 
things like the edges aren't is smooth
that's<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.350> edges<00:03:07.620> on<00:03:07.800> here<00:03:09.170> and<00:03:10.640> another

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
that's the edges on here and another

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.340 
that's the edges on here and another
thing<00:03:11.880> I<00:03:12.000> notice<00:03:12.330> is<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:12.510> trigger<00:03:12.959> when<00:03:13.260> you

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
thing I notice is to trigger when you

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.560 
thing I notice is to trigger when you
push<00:03:13.590> down<00:03:13.620> on<00:03:13.830> a<00:03:13.950> trigger<00:03:16.640> it<00:03:17.640> definitely

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
push down on a trigger it definitely

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:19.850 
push down on a trigger it definitely
isn't<00:03:18.690> as<00:03:18.930> smooth<00:03:19.170> as<00:03:19.380> pushing<00:03:19.709> down<00:03:19.830> on

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
isn't as smooth as pushing down on

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.910 
isn't as smooth as pushing down on
trigger<00:03:20.250> on<00:03:20.400> this<00:03:21.080> you<00:03:22.080> can<00:03:22.230> actually<00:03:22.410> feel

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
trigger on this you can actually feel

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.640 
trigger on this you can actually feel
the<00:03:23.070> button<00:03:23.430> inside<00:03:23.640> this<00:03:24.150> trigger<00:03:27.470> then<00:03:28.470> on

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
the button inside this trigger then on

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.030 
the button inside this trigger then on
this<00:03:28.830> one

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
this one

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.349 
this one
the<00:03:32.040> way<00:03:32.189> I<00:03:32.219> figured<00:03:32.609> out<00:03:32.730> that<00:03:32.879> it<00:03:33.030> was<00:03:33.060> it

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
the way I figured out that it was it

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.149 
the way I figured out that it was it
didn't<00:03:33.719> work<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.319> reason<00:03:34.530> I<00:03:34.680> say<00:03:34.859> it<00:03:34.950> doesn't

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.159 
didn't work the reason I say it doesn't

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:38.660 
didn't work the reason I say it doesn't
work<00:03:35.310> is<00:03:35.579> because<00:03:35.939> when<00:03:36.689> you<00:03:36.780> look<00:03:36.989> at<00:03:37.200> it<00:03:37.670> like

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
work is because when you look at it like

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.879 
work is because when you look at it like
