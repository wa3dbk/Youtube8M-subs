 will leave this box close 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.010
 and I already started playing so if it 's the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.170
 the first time you enter you will not leave a 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.480
 picture on the screen where you put the 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.840
 name that I will give to your 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.840
 Park 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.100
 a little 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.210
 while you charge, I'm going to explain 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.250
 these two buttons here the first time 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.789
 to put it in the language that you want 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:01.649
 we click and in Spanish is the one from Spain 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.649
 and whoever is there those languages 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:13.270
 and will load again 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:17.810
 the novelty of talking about notifications 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:20.460
 of facebook I do not want you 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.049
 invite friends we invite you to invite friends and 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.479
 we get the box to invite all 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.750
 grams friends I'm not going to take away and now 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.750
 same 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.619
 and now we wait for him to load 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.880
 it's almost charging 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.930
 when we start playing he will jump in 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:45.560
 the tutorial so you can see the concepts 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.500
 basic not how to create a habitat and how 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.619
 feed the bugs these to the 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.300
 dinosaurs and explains more or less the 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.700
 I'm going to explain this 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:00.130
 here is the full screen 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.130
 we give it to you and we already have full screen 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.710
 good to say he likes it now 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.530
 have it down here we get friends 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.950
 so to invite him to the roads that already 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.420
 we have 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.930
 this is the mission of this button here 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.240
 in these missions and we give you 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.090
 live in the missions that he sends us here 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.560
 chuck norris this weird this from the 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.200
 movie 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.670
 and why of the first movie and this is 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.670
 the mission touches the egg and press the 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.670
 button accelerates to speak this 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.600
 we will pick you up with the mission 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.600
 share rewards 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.470
 and we have here 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.240
 let's go to the buttons we have here the 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.830
 level 2 level and this is the bar is what 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.940
 what we need to get to the next 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.900
 This level is for food to 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.030
 the herbivores 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.190
 this is the food for carnivores 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.260
 this is the gold that we have the gold not 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.260
 place the habitats of this already generator 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.900
 These are tickets that can be purchased 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:19.500
 with real money 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.020
 if you want to move faster 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.700
 they are giving us I think two for each 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.000
 level each time they rise in level 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.930
 questioning well this is the volume of the 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.840
 game then we remove or we put this 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.330
 is the full screen button these 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.930
 are the magnifying glass to zoom in and the magnifying glass 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.930
 Ward off 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:48.160
 these are the missions this is the 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:51.400
 market can buy with money can 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.900
 buy tickets with real money 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.940
 here in the directories that you created 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.930
 that he has created and this is unknown 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.180
 because we have not discovered it yet 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.830
 you have to investigate is difficult but there 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.220
 than buying it with tickets and I do not have 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.220
 so much 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:10.150
 yellow flower bancal we can buy 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.720
 many things that we will see in the 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.720
 following chapters 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.170
 how can 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:24.100
 well what can we do here for example 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.500
 we can select your fact this 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.780
 forest land we select it 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.030
 baker that will come out of this for 800 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.430
 we can remove it to expand 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.220
 our construction territory then 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.530
 Now it's already like that if we select it 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.830
 we can accelerate it but if we are going to 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.000
 accelerate will cost us a little bit 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.310
 but it's not worth it because two 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.880
 minutes it takes names worth 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.060
 all right 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.220
 what else here we have the messages that 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.400
 he sent us the system and also the 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:00.090
 friends also of the right two messages 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.690
 they send you when they start playing 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:06.510
 we do not have this option yet 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:09.139
 available and this action will leave 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:12.110
 change the server 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:14.629
 and if from North America in Europe or in the 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:21.729
 rest of the world when it lets you play 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:21.729
 and the server that you want but in Europe 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.560
 and this button 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.380
 You must have 5 carnivores in the classroom 2 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.330
 as videos to speed up the mode 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.160
 access the red tonic mill when 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.310
 have placed books not to touch what 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.900
 we will see well I am at all level 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:45.230
 then there are few things I can do 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:47.240
 I still collected money 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.760
 good if we want to feed the 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:53.020
 illustrators we select the habitat of 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:55.569
 this nursery committee 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.660
 we can feed him not for nowhere 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:06:01.160
 because he eats 36 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.160
 and I have 13 nothing else 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:11.190
 300 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.120
 Here goes right level 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.120
 dinosaur there 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.150
 one 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.689
 think what the money that generates 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:30.069
 generates every 15 minutes 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:30.069
 and this song 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:35.560
 this building the king is for 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:37.630
 investigate eliminate the element of the 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.960
 celebrated discovered ambertÃ­n stretch 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:43.580
 new species of dinosaur and it's worth that 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:47.300
 we are removing 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.300
 we can not move it 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:53.550
 we removed this is another little thing for 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.190
 take away ugly people the same 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:58.890
 selected we give to remove removing 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:02.550
 removing these things we can discover 

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:05.420
 the amber that will tell us will give us 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:08.900
 walk to new research again 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:11.760
 new dinosaur 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:14.520
 well this has been 

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:17.700
 a little tutorial for you to start 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:20.930
 to play knowing we'll see each other in the second 

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.930
 chapter to another
