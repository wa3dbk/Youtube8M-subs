00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.460 
you buy a card this one all of the
monsters<00:02:20.940> lose<00:02:21.210> by<00:02:21.570> a<00:02:21.600> victory<00:02:21.990> point<00:02:22.230> let's

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
monsters lose by a victory point let's

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.600 
monsters lose by a victory point let's
discard<00:02:23.280> it

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
discard it

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.430 
discard it
this<00:02:23.880> one<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.210> you<00:02:24.600> spend<00:02:24.870> two<00:02:24.990> energy<00:02:25.320> to

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
this one is you spend two energy to

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.500 
this one is you spend two energy to
negate<00:02:25.830> damage<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:26.520> you<00:02:26.670> for<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.000> turn<00:02:27.270> that's

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
negate damage to you for a turn that's

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.090 
negate damage to you for a turn that's
pretty<00:02:27.690> expensive<00:02:27.960> though<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.590> have<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:28.980> have

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
pretty expensive though you have to have

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.650 
pretty expensive though you have to have
a<00:02:29.130> good<00:02:29.400> source<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:29.940> energy<00:02:30.090> this<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:30.510> my

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
a good source of energy this is my

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.500 
a good source of energy this is my
secondary<00:02:31.050> role<00:02:31.290> by<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.440> way<00:02:31.650> all<00:02:32.520> right<00:02:32.700> so

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
secondary role by the way all right so

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.980 
secondary role by the way all right so
those<00:02:33.780> are<00:02:34.250> but<00:02:35.250> I'm<00:02:36.240> gonna<00:02:36.450> gain<00:02:36.660> three

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
those are but I'm gonna gain three

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.840 
those are but I'm gonna gain three
energy<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:37.710> then<00:02:38.670> I'm<00:02:39.030> gonna<00:02:39.590> in<00:02:40.590> take<00:02:41.490> over

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
energy and then I'm gonna in take over

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.650 
energy and then I'm gonna in take over
Tokyo<00:02:42.390> you<00:02:43.080> can<00:02:43.200> only<00:02:43.320> choose<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.860> leave<00:02:44.660> when

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
Tokyo you can only choose to leave when

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.450 
Tokyo you can only choose to leave when
he<00:02:45.840> is<00:02:45.960> actually<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.440> town<00:02:46.710> I<00:02:46.980> like<00:02:47.160> that<00:02:47.340> one

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
yeah one victory point whenever I buy a

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.320 
yeah one victory point whenever I buy a
card<00:02:53.130> that<00:02:53.160> might<00:02:53.580> come<00:02:53.790> back<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:53.940> buy<00:02:54.150> because

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
card that might come back to buy because

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.150 
card that might come back to buy because
you<00:02:54.750> know<00:02:55.110> you<00:02:55.200> have<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.530> spend<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:56.010> lot<00:02:56.130> of

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
you know you have to spend a lot of

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.880 
you know you have to spend a lot of

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
energy but we'll see with shrink-ray

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.310 
energy but we'll see with shrink-ray
when<00:02:59.760> you<00:02:59.880> deal<00:03:00.150> damage<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.660> monsters<00:03:00.840> give

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
energy I was wrecking things in the in

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.560 
energy I was wrecking things in the in
the<00:03:31.470> town<00:03:33.410> you<00:03:34.410> guys<00:03:34.970> probably<00:03:35.970> not<00:03:36.240> see<00:03:36.480> it

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
the town you guys probably not see it

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:48.400 
the town you guys probably not see it
anyway<00:03:46.190> that's<00:03:47.190> poor<00:03:47.400> energy<00:03:47.730> that's<00:03:47.880> great

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
anyway that's poor energy that's great

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.760 
anyway that's poor energy that's great
three<00:03:49.410> okay<00:03:50.130> three<00:03:50.820> yeah<00:03:51.120> that's<00:03:51.630> okay<00:03:51.840> well

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
three okay three yeah that's okay well

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.730 
three okay three yeah that's okay well
I'm<00:03:52.980> sitting<00:03:53.490> pretty<00:03:53.820> right<00:03:53.910> now<00:03:54.240> cuz<00:03:55.200> yeah

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
I'm sitting pretty right now cuz yeah

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.400 
I'm sitting pretty right now cuz yeah
it's<00:03:56.700> my<00:03:56.880> turn<00:03:57.120> and<00:03:57.150> I<00:03:57.420> just<00:03:57.630> start<00:03:58.050> the<00:03:58.140> tomb

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
it's my turn and I just start the tomb

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.590 
it's my turn and I just start the tomb
in<00:03:58.560> Tokyo<00:03:59.010> so<00:03:59.070> I<00:03:59.250> get<00:03:59.400> to<00:03:59.550> victory<00:03:59.910> points<00:04:00.300> yes

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
in Tokyo so I get to victory points yes

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.940 
in Tokyo so I get to victory points yes
joy<00:04:01.050> yonk

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
joy yonk

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.500 
joy yonk
yeah<00:04:02.280> I<00:04:02.310> think<00:04:02.430> he<00:04:02.670> shoveled<00:04:03.090> us<00:04:03.180> on<00:04:03.330> purpose

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
yeah I think he shoveled us on purpose

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.060 
yeah I think he shoveled us on purpose
so<00:04:03.840> that<00:04:03.870> it<00:04:04.080> would<00:04:04.170> be<00:04:04.260> really<00:04:04.500> expensive<00:04:04.740> now

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
so that it would be really expensive now

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.720 
so that it would be really expensive now
yeah<00:04:05.730> that<00:04:06.060> was<00:04:06.270> my<00:04:06.480> plan

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
yeah that was my plan

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:14.300 
yeah that was my plan
alright<00:04:10.100> let's<00:04:11.100> see<00:04:11.310> a<00:04:11.610> more<00:04:12.360> energies<00:04:13.310> that's

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
alright let's see a more energies that's

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.159 
alright let's see a more energies that's
cool

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
cool

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.289 
cool
tapped<00:04:16.379> into<00:04:16.680> some<00:04:17.009> sort<00:04:17.249> of<00:04:17.370> power<00:04:17.669> plant<00:04:18.060> it

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
tapped into some sort of power plant it

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.729 
tapped into some sort of power plant it
just<00:04:18.509> like<00:04:18.659> burning<00:04:19.319> energy

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
just like burning energy

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.589 
just like burning energy
I<00:04:19.829> brought<00:04:20.069> a<00:04:20.310> mysterious<00:04:21.120> tylosaurus

I brought a mysterious tylosaurus

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:24.260 
I brought a mysterious tylosaurus
unobtainium<00:04:22.439> from<00:04:23.159> my<00:04:23.280> home<00:04:23.460> planet<00:04:23.490> I'm

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
unobtainium from my home planet I'm

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:31.959 
unobtainium from my home planet I'm
confused<00:04:25.340> right<00:04:26.749> no<00:04:27.749> Pandora<00:04:29.090> alright<00:04:30.090> for<00:04:30.990> oh

00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:31.969 
confused right no Pandora alright for oh

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:40.999 
confused right no Pandora alright for oh
I<00:04:32.969> should<00:04:33.210> have<00:04:33.270> kept<00:04:33.449> that<00:04:33.539> fist<00:04:39.770> so<00:04:40.770> I'll

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
I should have kept that fist so I'll

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:55.820 
I should have kept that fist so I'll
