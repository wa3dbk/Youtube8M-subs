00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:08.449 
never force you into being lethal or
non-lethal<00:02:06.530> now<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.740> he's<00:02:07.979> out<00:02:08.130> of<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.340> way

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
non-lethal now that he's out of the way

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.070 
non-lethal now that he's out of the way
let's<00:02:08.670> see<00:02:09.119> what<00:02:09.269> speaking<00:02:09.690> around<00:02:09.869> that

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
let's see what speaking around that

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.670 
let's see what speaking around that
corner<00:02:14.870> obviously<00:02:15.870> we<00:02:16.019> have<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.140> few<00:02:16.410> enemies

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
corner obviously we have a few enemies

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.830 
corner obviously we have a few enemies
to<00:02:17.069> get<00:02:17.220> rid<00:02:17.400> of<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.790> we<00:02:18.330> might<00:02:18.480> need<00:02:18.630> a<00:02:18.690> bit

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
to get rid of and we might need a bit

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.800 
to get rid of and we might need a bit
more<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:19.050> more<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.530> do<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.830> so<00:02:20.010> let's<00:02:20.220> get<00:02:20.459> some

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
more a more to do it so let's get some

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
more a more to do it so let's get some
all<00:02:21.810> right<00:02:21.989> I<00:02:22.019> think<00:02:22.140> we're<00:02:22.410> good<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.620> start

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
all right I think we're good to start

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:34.000 
all right I think we're good to start
our<00:02:22.980> assault

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:47.229 

huh

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.149 

so<00:02:48.239> this<00:02:48.480> was<00:02:48.629> a<00:02:48.659> purely<00:02:48.989> combat<00:02:49.650> of<00:02:49.830> approach

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
so this was a purely combat of approach

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:51.860 
so this was a purely combat of approach
something<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:50.879> can<00:02:51.030> employ<00:02:51.239> throughout<00:02:51.659> the

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
something you can employ throughout the

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.720 
something you can employ throughout the
game<00:02:52.049> you<00:02:52.590> can<00:02:52.709> also<00:02:52.830> mix<00:02:53.129> it<00:02:53.280> with<00:02:53.400> stealth

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
game you can also mix it with stealth

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.509 
game you can also mix it with stealth
which<00:02:54.060> we'll<00:02:54.269> see<00:02:54.299> in<00:02:54.480> this<00:02:54.720> next<00:02:54.959> playthrough

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
which we'll see in this next playthrough

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:02.360 
which we'll see in this next playthrough
preacher<00:02:56.519> I'm<00:02:56.940> in<00:03:00.470> since<00:03:01.470> this<00:03:01.680> is<00:03:01.920> a<00:03:01.950> stealth

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
preacher I'm in since this is a stealth

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.580 
preacher I'm in since this is a stealth
approach<00:03:02.549> will<00:03:03.480> use<00:03:03.629> a<00:03:03.660> non-lethal<00:03:04.260> takedown

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
approach will use a non-lethal takedown

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:14.740 
approach will use a non-lethal takedown
on<00:03:04.830> this<00:03:05.129> first<00:03:05.400> enemy

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.240 

we<00:03:15.750> want<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:16.080> be<00:03:16.170> stealthy<00:03:16.650> so<00:03:16.860> let's<00:03:17.040> also

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
we want to be stealthy so let's also

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:29.220 
we want to be stealthy so let's also
hide<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:17.700> body<00:03:17.909> and<00:03:18.239> loot<00:03:19.110> it<00:03:19.260> just<00:03:19.620> for<00:03:19.799> fun

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.450 

now<00:03:30.230> we<00:03:30.290> have<00:03:30.500> to<00:03:30.650> find<00:03:30.860> a<00:03:30.950> way<00:03:31.100> to<00:03:31.160> get<00:03:31.370> around

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:31.460 
now we have to find a way to get around

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.000 
now we have to find a way to get around
these<00:03:31.910> enemies<00:03:32.240> without<00:03:32.510> being<00:03:32.960> seen<00:03:33.230> the

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
these enemies without being seen the

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.830 
these enemies without being seen the
best<00:03:34.220> way<00:03:34.370> to<00:03:34.430> go<00:03:34.610> about<00:03:34.640> this<00:03:34.880> is<00:03:35.270> to<00:03:35.300> explore

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
best way to go about this is to explore

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.690 
best way to go about this is to explore
so<00:03:36.320> let's<00:03:36.530> backtrack<00:03:36.770> and<00:03:37.190> see<00:03:37.400> what<00:03:37.580> was

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
so let's backtrack and see what was

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.960 
so let's backtrack and see what was
hiding<00:03:38.060> in<00:03:38.150> that<00:03:38.270> room<00:03:39.010> when<00:03:40.010> you<00:03:40.190> explore<00:03:40.610> you

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
hiding in that room when you explore you

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.820 
hiding in that room when you explore you
can<00:03:41.180> discover<00:03:41.510> alternate<00:03:42.200> paths<00:03:42.410> that<00:03:42.620> help

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
can discover alternate paths that help

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.370 
can discover alternate paths that help
you<00:03:42.950> go<00:03:43.130> around<00:03:43.220> major<00:03:43.670> obstacles<00:03:44.330> since<00:03:45.080> the

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
you go around major obstacles since the

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.960 
you go around major obstacles since the
level<00:03:45.650> design<00:03:45.770> in<00:03:46.160> Deus<00:03:46.400> Ex<00:03:46.640> Human<00:03:46.820> Revolution

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
level design in Deus Ex Human Revolution

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:56.619 
level design in Deus Ex Human Revolution
supports<00:03:47.840> many<00:03:48.080> different<00:03:48.470> approaches

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:59.270 

now<00:03:57.629> let's<00:03:57.900> use<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.290> cover<00:03:58.530> system<00:03:58.799> to<00:03:59.069> hide

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
now let's use the cover system to hide

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.399 
now let's use the cover system to hide
from<00:03:59.489> these<00:03:59.730> guys<00:03:59.940> we'll<00:04:00.810> wait<00:04:00.959> until<00:04:01.290> they

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
from these guys we'll wait until they

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:03.140 
from these guys we'll wait until they
finish<00:04:01.680> their<00:04:01.830> patrol<00:04:02.250> and<00:04:02.489> we<00:04:02.819> can<00:04:03.000> gain

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
finish their patrol and we can gain

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.789 
finish their patrol and we can gain
access<00:04:03.360> to<00:04:03.629> the<00:04:03.810> warehouse<00:04:04.019> without<00:04:04.560> being

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
access to the warehouse without being

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:12.559 
access to the warehouse without being
seen

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.839 

notice<00:04:13.379> that<00:04:13.409> the<00:04:13.590> coverage<00:04:14.010> system<00:04:14.430> is<00:04:14.609> used

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
notice that the coverage system is used

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.210 
notice that the coverage system is used
in<00:04:15.060> two<00:04:15.269> ways<00:04:15.510> first<00:04:16.259> to<00:04:16.680> survey<00:04:17.039> your

in two ways first to survey your
surroundings<00:04:17.759> a<00:04:17.880> plan<00:04:18.150> your<00:04:18.329> approach<00:04:18.690> then

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
surroundings a plan your approach then

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.050 
surroundings a plan your approach then
second<00:04:19.799> to<00:04:19.889> physically<00:04:20.340> hide<00:04:20.579> yourself<00:04:21.000> from

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
second to physically hide yourself from

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.029 
second to physically hide yourself from
your<00:04:21.329> enemies<00:04:21.509> this<00:04:22.289> is<00:04:22.470> entirely<00:04:22.800> optional

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
your enemies this is entirely optional

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:40.040 
your enemies this is entirely optional
but<00:04:23.759> very<00:04:24.060> useful

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.520

revolution also rewards you for taking
the<00:04:50.590> time<00:04:50.620> to<00:04:50.950> explore<00:04:51.310> and<00:04:51.580> discover

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
the time to explore and discover

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.270 
the time to explore and discover
alternate<00:04:52.570> paths<00:04:52.830> Pritchard<00:04:53.830> mentioned<00:04:54.220> a

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
alternate paths Pritchard mentioned a

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.670 
alternate paths Pritchard mentioned a
roof<00:04:54.490> access<00:04:54.700> in<00:04:55.120> his<00:04:55.270> briefing<00:04:55.720> let's<00:04:56.380> try<00:04:56.560> to

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
roof access in his briefing let's try to

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:04.550 
roof access in his briefing let's try to
get<00:04:56.860> insight<00:04:57.310> using<00:04:57.760> it

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.750 

again<00:05:05.560> we'll<00:05:05.800> need<00:05:05.950> to<00:05:06.100> take<00:05:06.250> care<00:05:06.520> of<00:05:06.610> that

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
again we'll need to take care of that

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:18.860 
again we'll need to take care of that
century<00:05:07.060> so<00:05:07.690> we'll<00:05:07.840> use<00:05:07.870> another<00:05:08.320> takedown

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.210 

let's<00:05:19.870> hide<00:05:20.080> it<00:05:20.230> more<00:05:20.410> carefully<00:05:20.650> this<00:05:21.160> time

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
let's hide it more carefully this time

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:46.999 
let's hide it more carefully this time
just<00:05:21.820> for<00:05:22.030> fun

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:47.009 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:49.609 

the<00:05:47.610> layout<00:05:47.939> is<00:05:47.969> the<00:05:48.270> same<00:05:48.449> as<00:05:48.599> before<00:05:49.020> but<00:05:49.469> if

00:05:49.609 --> 00:05:49.619 
the layout is the same as before but if
