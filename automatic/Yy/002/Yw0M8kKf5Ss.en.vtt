00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 the apple watch is now well over three 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.190
 weeks in the market and meanwhile 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.470
 There are already some applications 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.900
 for the smart watch in this video 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:19.890
 I'll show you my top 3 of the apple 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:21.390
 watches a lot of fun to me on my home 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.740
 screen I can already see 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.420
 Of course, more than just three 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.400
 Applications on my apple watch 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.250
 but today we take care of it 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.320
 I would like to start with three special ones at the beginning 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.570
 the application delivery resp 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.399
 now also called deliveries 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.200
 As the name suggests, you can 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.200
 with this application various 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.420
 Delivery is from dhl ubs 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.280
 hermes or many more 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.079
 I have one here for the first time 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.149
 delivery of apple itself because of her 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.550
 You can also order with this 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.559
 app dragon if we are in this delivery 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.120
 We can do a forestry 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.140
 file or they individually 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.090
 To update 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.920
 furthermore you see in the individual 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.780
 deliveries still in detail how many 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.820
 Days still pass until the delivery 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.470
 you arrive and what status the 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.479
 delivery in the moment possesses 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.400
 Furthermore, you also get one 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.770
 small map where you can see where 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.990
 because your package is currently in case 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.760
 the forwarder specified 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.619
 amazon delivery which with dhl 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.960
 Usually this works out 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.119
 best the last function which 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.950
 you delivery it on the apple watch 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.990
 offers is in the overview of 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.630
 delivery here you can with a forest 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.040
 Update all shipments at once 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.470
 and that was it again 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.060
 with the scope of leverage 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.680
 for the apple watch and now i would 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.909
 let's continue with the next one 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.560
 application 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.840
 this is the case 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.850
 taskmanager klier this I have you 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.799
 already like the dear ries in 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.020
 shown my word for lunch videos 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.299
 of course you will find the link below 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.950
 in the video description klier has it 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.750
 but now also on the apple watch 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.790
 and you can all list 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.570
 Now display tasks on the screen 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.000
 to let 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.770
 the scope of functions on the apple watch 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.930
 does not really differ 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.969
 strong of the iphones you can with 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.520
 a forestry has new tasks added 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.680
 add the lists or sort all 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.080
 tasks in a list as done 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.569
 mark the addition of new ones 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.819
 your tasks just work 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.069
 Just click add task and you know 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.209
 appears that here the interface and 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.400
 Here you can then simply per 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.360
 input a new task 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.670
 Add 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.150
 I'll just test and test 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.190
 Then we have the task test as new 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.140
 task in this list and if we 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.019
 We just want to tick them off 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.660
 on the red circle and the task is 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.430
 as done marks the next and 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.140
 also last application which I today 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.420
 want to show in this video is still 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.340
 the scope of this app is whole 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.290
 simple but at the same time awesome 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.060
 you can use your mac per apple watch 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.950
 lock and unlock again 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.540
 the imac is not with me right now 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.730
 locked and if I open it now 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.400
 the imac clique is the imac as of 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.959
 magic hand locked the opposite 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.790
 direction works almost better 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.530
 because here you get a message 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.209
 on the apple watch even though the app 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.040
 is closed and you can the mac 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.140
 by pressing a button on or apple watch 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.030
 Unlock ingeniously not true 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.010
 your sport through so a lot of time 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.989
 for password entry and could that 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.250
 Whole comfortable about the apple will control 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.080
 really awesome 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.970
 and yes it should already be 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.459
 again been with this video too 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.349
 my top 3 of the apple jacks this 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.390
 was only the first issue and as soon as 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.159
 I once again three noteworthy apps 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.840
 on my apple watch which have the 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.519
 of course, I will topp actual tops 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.470
 make a new video again 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.180
 now I would be interested in what 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.890
 Do you have apps for or apple 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.450
 watch me down in the 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.760
 Comments may well manage it 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.580
 yes one or the other app in the next 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.470
 video about feedback in the form of a thumb 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.150
 up or an abo I would be me 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.099
 Of course they are happy too 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.340
 see you next time 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.340
 then
