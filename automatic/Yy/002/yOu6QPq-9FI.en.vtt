spirits with the season kicking off this
week<00:00:07.259> yeah<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:07.890> think<00:00:08.069> they're<00:00:08.340> looking

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
week yeah I think they're looking

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.030 
week yeah I think they're looking
forward<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.910> it<00:00:09.000> now<00:00:09.150> I<00:00:09.179> think<00:00:09.450> that

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.040 
forward to it now I think that

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.620 
forward to it now I think that
pre-seasons<00:00:11.040> been<00:00:11.400> been<00:00:11.940> long<00:00:12.120> enough<00:00:12.240> when

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
pre-seasons been been long enough when

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.169 
pre-seasons been been long enough when
you're<00:00:12.780> up<00:00:13.200> every<00:00:13.590> day<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.130> working<00:00:14.880> hard

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
you're up every day and working hard

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.779 
you're up every day and working hard
every<00:00:15.389> day<00:00:15.540> double<00:00:16.080> sessions<00:00:16.529> lot<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.460> running

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
every day double sessions lot of running

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.700 
every day double sessions lot of running
I<00:00:17.970> think<00:00:18.330> they'll<00:00:18.449> be<00:00:18.510> pleased<00:00:18.810> when<00:00:19.050> when<00:00:19.619> the

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
I think they'll be pleased when when the

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.250 
I think they'll be pleased when when the
season<00:00:20.039> starts<00:00:20.430> so<00:00:20.670> this<00:00:21.660> would<00:00:21.840> probably<00:00:21.960> be

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
season starts so this would probably be

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.410 
season starts so this would probably be
a<00:00:22.289> week<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:23.029> bringing<00:00:24.029> them<00:00:24.119> down<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.330> little

I think the vibe seems to be good around
a<00:01:21.630> place<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.960> think<00:01:22.229> what<00:01:22.350> happens<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.950> vibe

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
a place I think what happens is the vibe

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.160 
a place I think what happens is the vibe
tends<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.970> come<00:01:24.150> from<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.390> supporters<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.080> I

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
tends to come from the supporters and I

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.499 
tends to come from the supporters and I
think<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.590> they're<00:01:25.970> quite<00:01:26.970> Boyd<00:01:27.210> at<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
think that they're quite Boyd at the

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.020 
think that they're quite Boyd at the
moment<00:01:27.869> by<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.049> season<00:01:28.500> ahead<00:01:28.640> are<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> big

moment by the season ahead are you a big

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.090

believer<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.509> carrying<00:01:31.140> on<00:01:31.259> momentum<00:01:31.710> from

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
believer in carrying on momentum from

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.620 
believer in carrying on momentum from
the<00:01:32.250> previous<00:01:32.640> year<00:01:32.670> was<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.180> very<00:01:33.390> much<00:01:33.600> a

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
the previous year was this very much a

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.210 
the previous year was this very much a
blank<00:01:33.780> canvas<00:01:33.960> as<00:01:34.439> far<00:01:34.619> as<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.829> think

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.149 
you're almost starting again I mean it'd
be<00:01:36.630> nice<00:01:36.780> if<00:01:36.810> we<00:01:37.020> could<00:01:37.079> say<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.470> because<00:01:37.890> our

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
be nice if we could say that because our

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.429 
be nice if we could say that because our
form<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.659> second<00:01:39.990> half<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.290> season

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
form to the second half of the season

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.260 
form to the second half of the season
was<00:01:40.740> very<00:01:40.950> good<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.850> would<00:01:42.060> therefore

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
was very good and that would therefore

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.210 
was very good and that would therefore
guarantee<00:01:42.899> us<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.200> place<00:01:43.409> higher<00:01:43.619> up<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.890> table

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
guarantee us a place higher up the table

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.730 
guarantee us a place higher up the table
however<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.299> doesn't<00:01:45.840> because<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.200> all<00:01:46.380> starts

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
however it doesn't because it all starts

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.370 
however it doesn't because it all starts
again<00:01:46.799> players<00:01:47.430> change<00:01:47.780> it's<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.840> transitional

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
again players change it's a transitional

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.410 
again players change it's a transitional
sport<00:01:49.680> isn't<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.220> teams<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.210> were<00:01:51.270> good

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
sport isn't it so teams that were good

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.580 
sport isn't it so teams that were good
last<00:01:51.600> year<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.840> won<00:01:51.960> not<00:01:52.049> be<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.259> good<00:01:52.439> this

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
last year and won not be so good this

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.810 
last year and won not be so good this
year<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.979> teams<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.369> weren't<00:01:53.579> very<00:01:53.729> good

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
year and teams that weren't very good

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.819 
year and teams that weren't very good
last<00:01:54.119> year<00:01:54.240> might<00:01:54.479> be<00:01:54.509> good<00:01:54.750> this<00:01:54.869> year<00:01:54.930> we're

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
last year might be good this year we're

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.969 
last year might be good this year we're
hoping<00:01:56.009> perhaps<00:01:56.340> with<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.329> latter<00:01:57.600> yeah<00:01:58.229> course

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
hoping perhaps with a latter yeah course

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.530 
hoping perhaps with a latter yeah course
and<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.460> remember<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.000> saying<00:02:00.030> when<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.329> fixed

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
and I remember you saying when the fixed

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.639 
and I remember you saying when the fixed
just<00:02:00.719> came<00:02:00.840> out<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.079> had<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.229> sneaky<00:02:01.619> feeling

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
just came out you had a sneaky feeling

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.490 
just came out you had a sneaky feeling
it<00:02:02.040> might<00:02:02.189> be<00:02:02.369> shuffled<00:02:03.180> United<00:02:03.600> yeah<00:02:03.899> away<00:02:04.259> is

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
it might be shuffled United yeah away is

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.959 
it might be shuffled United yeah away is
this<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.950> toughest<00:02:05.340> start<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.700> could<00:02:05.880> have

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
this the toughest start you could have

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.419 
this the toughest start you could have
had<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.930> don't<00:02:07.439> know<00:02:07.560> i'll<00:02:07.710> know<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.220> lot

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
had and I don't know i'll know a lot

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.650 
had and I don't know i'll know a lot
more<00:02:08.459> about<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:09.000> after<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.390> game<00:02:09.539> on

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
more about that after the game on

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.840 
more about that after the game on
saturday<00:02:10.140> but<00:02:10.670> you<00:02:11.670> know

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
saturday but you know

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.640 
saturday but you know
if<00:02:12.360> we<00:02:12.570> go<00:02:12.720> out<00:02:12.810> there<00:02:12.960> and<00:02:13.080> we<00:02:13.230> play<00:02:13.440> well<00:02:13.590> I

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
if we go out there and we play well I

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.050 
if we go out there and we play well I
might<00:02:13.920> be<00:02:14.040> one<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.340> toughest<00:02:14.670> start<00:02:14.910> say

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
might be one of the toughest start say

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.990 
might be one of the toughest start say
that<00:02:15.270> so<00:02:15.960> the<00:02:16.920> only<00:02:17.040> thing<00:02:17.130> we<00:02:17.370> can<00:02:17.490> focus<00:02:17.700> on

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
that so the only thing we can focus on

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.460 
that so the only thing we can focus on
is<00:02:18.120> playing<00:02:18.330> well<00:02:18.480> ourselves<00:02:18.930> we<00:02:19.050> can't<00:02:19.260> focus

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
is playing well ourselves we can't focus

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.920 
is playing well ourselves we can't focus
on<00:02:19.800> what<00:02:19.950> Shepherd<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:20.400> know<00:02:20.490> it<00:02:20.640> can<00:02:21.060> do<00:02:21.210> what

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
on what Shepherd you know it can do what

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.960 
on what Shepherd you know it can do what
they're<00:02:22.080> going<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.350> do<00:02:22.590> it's<00:02:23.460> just<00:02:23.640> it's

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
they're going to do it's just it's

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.430 
they're going to do it's just it's
ourselves<00:02:24.480> really<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:24.930> that's<00:02:25.020> what<00:02:25.290> we're

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
ourselves really and that's what we're

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.490 
ourselves really and that's what we're
all<00:02:25.590> focusing<00:02:26.010> on<00:02:26.190> just<00:02:26.490> how<00:02:27.000> we<00:02:27.060> can<00:02:27.360> play<00:02:27.540> if

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
all focusing on just how we can play if

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.140 
all focusing on just how we can play if
you're<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.710> player<00:02:29.010> if<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:29.310> go<00:02:29.580> up<00:02:29.730> there<00:02:29.970> and

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
you're a player if you go up there and

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.360 
you're a player if you go up there and
you<00:02:30.570> get<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.750> victory<00:02:30.930> away<00:02:31.710> at<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.920> favorites

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
you get a victory away at the favorites

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.920 
you get a victory away at the favorites
on<00:02:32.490> the<00:02:32.670> opening<00:02:32.970> day<00:02:33.150> would<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.480> give<00:02:33.780> them

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
on the opening day would that give them

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.200 
on the opening day would that give them
even<00:02:34.230> more<00:02:34.440> of<00:02:34.770> a<00:02:34.860> boost<00:02:35.100> than<00:02:35.490> perhaps<00:02:35.970> any

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
even more of a boost than perhaps any

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.060 
even more of a boost than perhaps any
other<00:02:36.480> game<00:02:36.690> probably<00:02:37.250> probably<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:39.710> think<00:02:40.710> so

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
other game probably probably I think so

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.380 
other game probably probably I think so
i<00:02:41.100> think<00:02:41.220> i<00:02:41.460> think<00:02:41.490> it's<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.880> great<00:02:42.000> opening

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
i think i think it's a great opening

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.740 
i think i think it's a great opening
game<00:02:42.600> for<00:02:42.810> us<00:02:42.930> given<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.380> given<00:02:43.500> the

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
game for us given that given the

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.450 
game for us given that given the
fixtures<00:02:45.750> I<00:02:45.930> think<00:02:46.740> it's<00:02:46.860> a<00:02:46.920> great<00:02:47.040> opening

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
fixtures I think it's a great opening

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.370 
fixtures I think it's a great opening
game<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:47.910> if<00:02:48.210> it<00:02:48.420> was<00:02:48.510> at<00:02:48.630> home<00:02:48.780> or<00:02:49.020> away<00:02:49.110> I'd

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
game and if it was at home or away I'd

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.680 
game and if it was at home or away I'd
rather<00:02:49.590> it<00:02:49.740> be<00:02:49.830> away<00:02:50.130> as<00:02:50.280> well<00:02:50.430> you're<00:02:51.390> taking

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
rather it be away as well you're taking

00:02:51.690 --> 00:03:00.260 
rather it be away as well you're taking
a<00:02:51.810> fully<00:02:52.140> fit<00:02:52.290> squad<00:02:55.700> yes<00:02:57.200> yes<00:02:58.370> sort<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.520> just<00:02:59.550> a

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
probably like three more players but one

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.240 
probably like three more players but one
one<00:03:27.630> could<00:03:27.930> come<00:03:28.140> in<00:03:28.350> and<00:03:30.860> could<00:03:31.860> add<00:03:31.980> to<00:03:32.160> the

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
one could come in and could add to the

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.180 
one could come in and could add to the
squad<00:03:33.350> the<00:03:34.350> other<00:03:34.500> two<00:03:34.740> positions

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
squad the other two positions

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.830 
squad the other two positions
potentially<00:03:35.820> might<00:03:36.300> need<00:03:36.540> trade<00:03:36.810> in<00:03:37.020> so<00:03:38.840> maybe

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
potentially might need trade in so maybe

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.230 
potentially might need trade in so maybe
there<00:03:40.230> could<00:03:40.380> be<00:03:40.440> one<00:03:40.800> edition<00:03:41.310> but<00:03:42.000> I'm<00:03:42.090> not

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
there could be one edition but I'm not

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.930 
there could be one edition but I'm not
sure<00:03:42.270> about<00:03:42.450> that<00:03:42.840> at<00:03:42.990> this<00:03:43.050> moment<00:03:43.110> I'm<00:03:43.940> two

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
sure about that at this moment I'm two

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.400 
sure about that at this moment I'm two
would<00:03:45.210> be<00:03:45.390> maybe<00:03:46.200> trade<00:03:46.650> in<00:03:46.830> but<00:03:47.640> but<00:03:48.210> then<00:03:48.420> you

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
would be maybe trade in but but then you

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.170 
would be maybe trade in but but then you
know<00:03:49.530> to<00:03:49.590> do<00:03:49.890> what<00:03:50.160> we've<00:03:50.310> done<00:03:50.520> really<00:03:50.820> in<00:03:51.000> the

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
know to do what we've done really in the

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.300 
know to do what we've done really in the
one<00:03:51.360> window<00:03:51.750> is<00:03:51.960> is<00:03:52.260> unbelievable<00:03:53.010> really<00:03:53.280> i

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
one window is is unbelievable really i

one window is is unbelievable really i
mean<00:03:53.400> i<00:03:53.610> think<00:03:53.670> that<00:03:54.060> you<00:03:54.300> know<00:03:55.230> i<00:03:55.530> don't<00:03:56.490> think

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
mean i think that you know i don't think

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.770 
mean i think that you know i don't think
we'd<00:03:56.880> have<00:03:56.970> been<00:03:57.060> out<00:03:57.120> to<00:03:57.270> do<00:03:57.390> that<00:03:57.570> really

without Steve lansdowne you know I think

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.300 
without Steve lansdowne you know I think

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
with his injection of cash we would be

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.060 
with his injection of cash we would be

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.950 
we've been able to bring in a few
players<00:04:11.010> that<00:04:11.220> we<00:04:11.310> wanted<00:04:11.640> from<00:04:11.760> last<00:04:12.000> year<00:04:13.640> so

we're<00:04:15.960> a<00:04:15.990> little<00:04:16.109> bit<00:04:16.350> of<00:04:16.440> ahead<00:04:16.620> of<00:04:16.680> ourselves

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
we're a little bit of ahead of ourselves

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.030 
we're a little bit of ahead of ourselves
as<00:04:17.549> regards<00:04:18.000> that<00:04:18.150> because<00:04:19.140> he's<00:04:19.320> financially

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
as regards that because he's financially

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.950 
as regards that because he's financially
allowed<00:04:21.000> us<00:04:21.180> to<00:04:21.210> be<00:04:21.450> if<00:04:21.540> you<00:04:21.660> know<00:04:21.780> what<00:04:21.900> I<00:04:21.930> mean

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
allowed us to be if you know what I mean

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.280 
allowed us to be if you know what I mean
but<00:04:23.240> it<00:04:24.240> still<00:04:24.570> might<00:04:24.750> take<00:04:24.990> a<00:04:25.020> little<00:04:25.200> bit

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
but it still might take a little bit

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.700 
but it still might take a little bit
it's<00:04:25.470> on

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
it's on

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.499 
it's on
but<00:04:25.919> for<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.370> business<00:04:26.729> we've<00:04:27.000> done<00:04:27.180> in<00:04:27.300> one

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:27.509 
but for the business we've done in one

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:31.309 
but for the business we've done in one
window<00:04:27.720> because<00:04:28.169> the<00:04:28.530> first<00:04:29.160> window<00:04:30.259> that<00:04:31.259> I

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:31.319 
window because the first window that I

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:33.680 
window because the first window that I
had<00:04:31.500> really<00:04:31.860> wasn't<00:04:32.220> it<00:04:33.180> was<00:04:33.330> more<00:04:33.509> or<00:04:33.539> less<00:04:33.600> a

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
had really wasn't it was more or less a

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.240 
had really wasn't it was more or less a
long<00:04:33.930> window<00:04:34.319> that's<00:04:34.800> what<00:04:34.979> that<00:04:35.099> was<00:04:35.130> about

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
long window that's what that was about

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.670 
long window that's what that was about
there<00:04:35.910> was<00:04:36.000> no<00:04:36.120> point<00:04:36.330> in<00:04:36.509> purchasing<00:04:37.410> players

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
there was no point in purchasing players

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.080 
there was no point in purchasing players
then<00:04:37.919> because<00:04:38.250> we<00:04:38.460> wouldn't<00:04:38.699> have<00:04:38.789> got<00:04:38.940> them

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
then because we wouldn't have got them

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.430 
then because we wouldn't have got them
at<00:04:39.240> the<00:04:39.300> prices<00:04:39.539> we've<00:04:39.810> got<00:04:39.990> them<00:04:40.139> in<00:04:40.410> the

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
at the prices we've got them in the

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.879 
at the prices we've got them in the
summer<00:04:40.789> so<00:04:41.789> all<00:04:42.539> in<00:04:42.780> all<00:04:42.870> we're<00:04:43.199> we're<00:04:43.650> pleased

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
summer so all in all we're we're pleased

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.589 
summer so all in all we're we're pleased
with<00:04:44.069> what<00:04:44.190> business<00:04:44.580> we've<00:04:44.729> done<00:04:44.940> but<00:04:45.569> I

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599 
with what business we've done but I

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:48.010 
with what business we've done but I
think<00:04:45.870> it<00:04:46.020> might<00:04:46.229> it<00:04:46.530> might<00:04:46.590> take<00:04:47.190> another

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
think it might it might take another

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.490 
think it might it might take another
window<00:04:49.020> or<00:04:49.370> two<00:04:50.370> maybe<00:04:50.669> to<00:04:51.599> get<00:04:51.780> quite<00:04:52.349> where

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
window or two maybe to get quite where

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.659 
window or two maybe to get quite where
we<00:04:52.620> won<00:04:52.800> and<00:04:53.009> then<00:04:53.220> boy<00:04:53.400> then<00:04:54.710> if<00:04:55.710> you<00:04:56.520> get

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
we won and then boy then if you get

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.279 
we won and then boy then if you get
promoted<00:04:56.819> you<00:04:57.509> might<00:04:57.690> want<00:04:57.870> an<00:04:57.960> over<00:04:58.110> to<00:04:58.259> a

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289

promoted you might want an over to a
free<00:04:58.530> windows<00:04:58.889> yeah<00:04:59.130> so<00:04:59.639> hopefully<00:04:59.970> it's<00:05:00.449> an

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
free windows yeah so hopefully it's an
