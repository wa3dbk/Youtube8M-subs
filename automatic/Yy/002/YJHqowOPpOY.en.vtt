00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
watching here i'm not sure if i'm going

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.410 
watching here i'm not sure if i'm going
to<00:00:23.160> be<00:00:23.220> doing<00:00:23.340> another<00:00:23.640> one<00:00:23.939> we're<00:00:24.150> going<00:00:24.359> to

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
to be doing another one we're going to

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.820 
to be doing another one we're going to
look<00:00:24.630> over<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.990> facts<00:00:25.230> because<00:00:25.680> that's

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
look over the facts because that's

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.320 
look over the facts because that's
really<00:00:26.039> boring<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.699> can<00:00:26.880> probably<00:00:27.180> read

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
really boring and you can probably read

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.300 
really boring and you can probably read
it<00:00:27.449> yourself<00:00:27.570> but<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:28.680> is<00:00:28.859> something<00:00:29.039> that

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
it yourself but this is something that

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.049 
it yourself but this is something that
will<00:00:30.210> be<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.470> precursor<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:32.399> think<00:00:32.790> that's<00:00:32.910> the

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
will be the precursor I think that's the

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.060 
will be the precursor I think that's the
word<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.870> what<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.230> going<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.440> come<00:00:34.500> up<00:00:34.710> later

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
word to what is going to come up later

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.709 
word to what is going to come up later
so<00:00:35.880> just<00:00:36.390> giving<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.050> out<00:00:37.200> now<00:00:37.680> um<00:00:38.510> this<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.690> a

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
so just giving that out now um this is a

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.049 
so just giving that out now um this is a
little<00:00:40.020> bit<00:00:40.290> old<00:00:40.500> about<00:00:40.950> three<00:00:41.460> days<00:00:41.640> but

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
little bit old about three days but

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.959 
little bit old about three days but
still<00:00:42.120> kind<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.660> new<00:00:42.840> um<00:00:43.280> this<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.460> not<00:00:44.640> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
still kind of new um this is not the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.209 
still kind of new um this is not the
tempest<00:00:45.539> patch<00:00:45.809> or<00:00:46.170> what<00:00:46.440> whatever<00:00:47.070> it's

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
tempest patch or what whatever it's

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.069 
tempest patch or what whatever it's
called<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.180> rise<00:00:48.390> against<00:00:48.780> patch

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
called this is the rise against patch

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.590 
called this is the rise against patch
this<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.710> on<00:00:50.160> something<00:00:50.789> for<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.090> resistance

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
this is on something for the resistance

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.040 
this is on something for the resistance
class<00:00:51.840> meaning<00:00:52.500> Wild<00:00:52.800> Hunter<00:00:53.840> mechanic<00:00:54.840> and

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
class meaning Wild Hunter mechanic and

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.279 
class meaning Wild Hunter mechanic and
battle<00:00:55.559> mage<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.670> one<00:00:57.390> thing<00:00:57.600> that's<00:00:57.840> really

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
battle mage so one thing that's really

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.470 
battle mage so one thing that's really
new<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.980> something<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.670> lot<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.879> people<00:00:59.969> were

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
new and something a lot of people were

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.330 
new and something a lot of people were
curious<00:01:00.809> why<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.230> wasn't<00:01:01.620> here<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.129> first

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
curious why it wasn't here in the first

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.520 
curious why it wasn't here in the first
place<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.789> why<00:01:03.270> mechanics<00:01:03.840> wasn't<00:01:04.110> weren't

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
place is why mechanics wasn't weren't

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.370 
place is why mechanics wasn't weren't
able<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.860> change<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.400> robot<00:01:05.850> color<00:01:06.299> or<00:01:06.900> robot

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
able to change the robot color or robot

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.890 
able to change the robot color or robot
design<00:01:08.000> because<00:01:09.000> everyone<00:01:09.390> had<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.659> exact

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
design because everyone had the exact

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.600 
design because everyone had the exact
same<00:01:09.930> one<00:01:10.290> while<00:01:10.500> Wild<00:01:11.040> Hunter<00:01:11.310> has<00:01:11.430> had<00:01:11.460> a

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
same one while Wild Hunter has had a

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.940 
same one while Wild Hunter has had a
series<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.180> different<00:01:12.420> Panthers<00:01:13.229> for<00:01:13.500> example

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
series of different Panthers for example

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.670 
series of different Panthers for example
so<00:01:14.850> mechanics<00:01:15.630> can<00:01:15.780> now<00:01:15.930> change<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.320> color

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
so mechanics can now change the color

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.649 
so mechanics can now change the color
I'm<00:01:17.100> not<00:01:17.460> sure<00:01:17.520> if<00:01:17.729> it's<00:01:17.850> just<00:01:18.090> these<00:01:18.270> three<00:01:18.330> as

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
I'm not sure if it's just these three as

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.810 
I'm not sure if it's just these three as
you<00:01:18.689> see<00:01:18.900> on<00:01:18.930> screen<00:01:19.170> red<00:01:19.680> blue<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.159> purple

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
you see on screen red blue and purple

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.450 
you see on screen red blue and purple
there<00:01:21.509> may<00:01:21.689> be<00:01:21.720> more<00:01:22.110> i<00:01:22.170> am<00:01:22.439> not<00:01:22.590> possible<00:01:23.070> i<00:01:23.130> am

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
there may be more i am not possible i am

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.850 
there may be more i am not possible i am
not<00:01:23.640> sure<00:01:23.700> there's<00:01:24.659> also<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:25.080> new<00:01:25.350> secondary

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
not sure there's also a new secondary

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.520 
not sure there's also a new secondary
weapon<00:01:26.400> kind<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.790> like<00:01:27.000> how<00:01:27.320> mercedes<00:01:28.320> have

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
weapon kind of like how mercedes have

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.429 
weapon kind of like how mercedes have
that<00:01:28.850> arrow<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.270> i'm<00:01:31.020> pretty<00:01:31.259> sure<00:01:31.380> is

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
that arrow and i'm pretty sure is

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.050 
that arrow and i'm pretty sure is
another<00:01:31.740> class<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.130> mean<00:01:32.369> how<00:01:32.460> phantoms<00:01:32.909> have

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
another class I mean how phantoms have

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.560 
another class I mean how phantoms have
the<00:01:33.240> Phantom<00:01:33.600> card<00:01:34.460> those<00:01:35.460> are<00:01:35.640> examples<00:01:36.060> and

the Phantom card those are examples and

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.929 
the Phantom card those are examples and

bad to them battle mages have a new arm
basically<00:01:45.899> some<00:01:46.229> new<00:01:46.380> skills<00:01:46.619> that's<00:01:46.920> really

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
basically some new skills that's really

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.789
