00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.040
 hello friends of the night vélez we are in 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.080
 the festival sails though in berlin and 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.699
 we have one of the best bands of 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.500
 Colombia at the moment they are 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.500
 monsieur periné we go with them 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.120
 berlin right now is the center of some 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.710
 way of the arts or at least of the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.670
 vanguard what is going on with 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.870
 art music design is what one hears and 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.660
 he finds out let's say at least in colombia 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.790
 I think it's amazing to have the 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.350
 opportunity to play already in Berlin because 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.040
 is is the epicenter of what is 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.040
 happening in the world 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.960
 we do not have many expectations because 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.420
 our first time and although it was very 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.340
 to noise like this is for there with that 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.190
 we were the same as we are not a band 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.780
 that you can know here and the answer 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.370
 It was very nice the connector people of 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.370
 they danced very well 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.439
 the basic work is a promoter of 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.790
 germany that organized much of the 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.159
 our chancellery also rotates 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:32.840
 our country and the embassies of Colombia 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.580
 in austria germany switzerland and belgium we 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.140
 they helped to come is also a tour 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.990
 big spain also the embassy of 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.280
 Spain of almost 30 concerts and we're 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.220
 very happy caracas first time 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.380
 we play in Europe and the main course or 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.000
 first impression that he was German and 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.090
 berlin was amazing we are very 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.090
 happy 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.300
 and so much 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.759
 the format is like the years swing 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.770
 30 and it's called French jazz manouche 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.469
 so then we mix that with 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.590
 Latin American pinu and obviously 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.580
 genre rhythms of Colombia then 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.580
 we mix both 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.690
 the rhythm is not well known in 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.060
 Latin America was not very well known but 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.250
 because these guitarists knew the 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.349
 gender they developed very well and 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.870
 the vein inevitably came out 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:30.130
 latina mix the two things and came up 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.130
 this in the end the Colombian 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:47.030
 I believe that folklore and music 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:50.060
 tropical in latin america the music 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:54.260
 popular is part of the DNA of all 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.000
 that we were born there and although now we live 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.760
 in a globalized world that allows us 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.850
 listen to all kinds of music in 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.860
 many languages tropical music and 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.720
 music from our roots is what 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.700
 is always present in our 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.230
 families from very young we are 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.150
 accustomed to celebrate all 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.490
 parties to share with people 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.200
 through music Latinos think that 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.110
 we define ourselves by music and by 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.140
 how we relate to her by 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.000
 the dance and as per the way of 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.330
 share that music and it's very natural 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.040
 that every time we try to express ourselves 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.300
 artistically through music 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.300
 come out in our roots 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.409
 We are proud to be here and 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.870
 represent Latin America through 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:45.840
 what we do and welcome to all
