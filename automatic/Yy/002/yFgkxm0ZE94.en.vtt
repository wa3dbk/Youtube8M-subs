00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello here adsl or down and I'm doing a 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.740
 little tutorial on energetics and 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.599
 mainly on the creation of the money 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.030
 what stalls then the freaks 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.680
 crystal he was born it's in full of 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:21.449
 applied energy revenues and we have 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:24.029
 a little all the recipes that besides 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.820
 we can turn into powder that knows 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.949
 if other recipes always enough 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.960
 important and thanks to this powder one 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.450
 can also achieve 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.219
 we will see in another video the pure who 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.600
 a few episodes is the reverse of a 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.239
 recipes but we also see that 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.629
 the pure replaces the barrel what it is 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.710
 normal 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.780
 Besides, it's you who is not 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.450
 really useful if only influential 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.719
 crystal allows to get two pure so 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.570
 so it multiplies the 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.289
 amount of fustal who is one who has a 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.219
 little hassle to have because in fact the 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.530
 for the first ones it will take a lot 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.309
 to lead what we go in the nature found 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.430
 two types of rocks 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.060
 we will find virtues this strong quartz 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.080
 and loads is certainly far gold 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.409
 knowing that the loads they are 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.780
 really rare compared to those who do not 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.590
 are not it's like for the diamond 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:25.020
 when we go digging we will get more 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:30.030
 of elements if we have a pickaxe 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.649
 with fortune so we have some certus 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.860
 endless of certain charges and 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:37.469
 some crystal squats and so for 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:43.979
 get the feeds he'll have to send 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:48.030
 in the water at once our charge of 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.319
 certus of red stone and quartz 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.490
 desert so why are you saying he 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:52.500
 supports as its name says in 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.909
 the hours and the rest of the mali that you 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:01.860
 know so you throw the whole 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:02.310
 in the water that's a doubt I'm full 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.259
 fast enough 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.849
 here I am too fat I have the game of 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.920
 see which members needs to be activated and 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:14.610
 suddenly I get too easily to 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.569
 time for me 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:21.299
 So here I sent what is it worth 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:26.390
 the red stone up and there the three are 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:35.730
 loaded up not I got directly 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:37.980
 my successor could I have if you 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.519
 see there I never know the pressure 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.389
 and I have a bug I have a bug with them 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.920
 and so I can not want big 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:45.690
 packages at once but actually more 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.280
 of envied one by one the age helping to because 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.530
 that I have a little bug but you can 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.920
 send a whole package 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:58.280
 if they fall into the water it would be better 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.739
 that's it with a package is actually it's going 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.659
 produce as much as you see 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:07.250
 so that's double the amount bag 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:09.799
 for chargede a loaded Sercus 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.769
 half crystal quartz in the water you 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:15.440
 come from flux 'crystal so here you go 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.310
 how do we get them later 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.489
 we realize that it's a bit 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.480
 difficult to hold a lot of charges 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.280
 and so we'll be able to charge and 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.090
 ourselves by hand through these 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.760
 machinery 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.730
 the chargers that kraft like this 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.739
 So we need 2 iron and inflammation 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.250
 he must already have got loads 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.500
 and for for then charged with crystals 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.609
 our charges and I get confused a little 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.200
 in the way explain but basically 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:42.920
 thanks to this machine we will be able to 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.450
 get through certu square this crystal 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.420
 we will get in larger quantities 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.280
 in the nature of the charges is at all 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.540
 stuck for that in fact just 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.799
 put above or below 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.859
 energy so there for example with a 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:57.620
 severe industrial 2 or with the vibration 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:04:01.010
 chambers directly from america but that 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:04.720
 can it be anywhere all 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:08.049
 I transmitted and that under ayo 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.449
 the energy that I generated with others 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:12.919
 blocks and each time it worked so much 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:13.160
 that we would have energy by 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:20.220
 below 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:23.400
 and then we put the crystal m 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:29.720
 I do not have energy anymore 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:32.040
 here we manage but we put energy and 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.720
 sailboats after a while that it 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.640
 becomes blue we see the difference between 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.020
 the two i'm here be charged too 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.750
 tac who is responsible for taking or ci 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.180
 on it we get loads and that's it 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:47.940
 how does it work you can very well 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:53.480
 thanks to ayo or the ex door to the baptized 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:55.110
 putting the finish on one side and 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.470
 the inversion exports on one of the 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.940
 sides it works very well 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:03.450
 so we need energy from below and 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.670
 give the crystals overworked so here 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.560
 that's how we get flows and 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.920
 after you can do all the kraft 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.530
 whose cables investigations that are 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:16.730
 combined that need two streams 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.730
 crystal is the main 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.030
 sincerely normally they make sure 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:25.590
 so baldÃ© klux it's to get the 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:26.190
 pme ice cable that then come 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.310
 with wool 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.410
 dm Kuwait cable but that we'll see that in 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.180
 another sooner I hope I've been 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.560
 clear enough you can ask 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.180
 questions in salary commentary 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.300
 to answer it and if you want others 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.830
 tutoring about other modes that I use 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:44.030
 do not hesitate I will make other videos 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.030
 goodbye
