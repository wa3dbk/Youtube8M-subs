potted plant for that matter these need

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.620 
potted plant for that matter these need
to<00:00:10.290> be<00:00:10.410> reported<00:00:10.889> every<00:00:11.340> two<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.389> three<00:00:12.420> years

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
to be reported every two to three years

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.539 
to be reported every two to three years
this<00:00:13.170> one's<00:00:13.410> been<00:00:13.590> in<00:00:13.710> this<00:00:13.830> pot<00:00:14.070> for<00:00:14.099> years

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
this one's been in this pot for years

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.779 
this one's been in this pot for years
and<00:00:14.700> as<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:14.880> can<00:00:15.030> see<00:00:15.269> it's<00:00:15.450> showing<00:00:15.690> signs<00:00:16.109> of

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789 
and as you can see it's showing signs of

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.029 
and as you can see it's showing signs of
deficiencies<00:00:18.050> particularly<00:00:19.050> in<00:00:19.230> nitrogen

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
deficiencies particularly in nitrogen

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.060 
deficiencies particularly in nitrogen
and<00:00:20.310> magnesium<00:00:21.380> what<00:00:22.380> we're<00:00:22.529> going<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.769> do<00:00:22.920> is

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
and magnesium what we're going to do is

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.560 
and magnesium what we're going to do is
gather<00:00:23.279> everything<00:00:23.789> first<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.269> we've<00:00:24.449> got

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
gather everything first so we've got

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:33.170 
gather everything first so we've got
some<00:00:27.570> good<00:00:28.080> quality<00:00:28.529> potting<00:00:28.740> mix<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:32.180> mulch

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
some good quality potting mix and mulch

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.060 
some good quality potting mix and mulch
as<00:00:33.480> well<00:00:33.780> as<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:34.079> saw<00:00:34.350> which<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.620> going<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.950> we're

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
as well as a saw which is going to we're

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.400 
as well as a saw which is going to we're
going<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.280> use<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.790> cut<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.870> roots<00:00:37.050> around<00:00:37.320> the

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
going to use to cut the roots around the

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.110 
going to use to cut the roots around the
edge<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.829> pot<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.250> ensure<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.670> comes<00:00:38.910> out

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
edge of the pot to ensure it comes out

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.959 
edge of the pot to ensure it comes out
properly<00:00:40.110> we<00:00:40.739> also<00:00:40.890> have<00:00:41.370> I'm<00:00:41.550> going<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.879> be

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
properly we also have I'm going to be

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.250 
properly we also have I'm going to be
reporting<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.629> into<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.820> barrel<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:45.030> half<00:00:45.989> barrel

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
reporting it into a barrel a half barrel

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.650 
reporting it into a barrel a half barrel
which<00:00:46.950> we've<00:00:47.219> modified<00:00:47.789> slightly<00:00:48.510> by

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
which we've modified slightly by

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.619 
which we've modified slightly by
drilling<00:00:49.170> 4<00:00:49.530> holes<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.250> bottom<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.850> also

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
drilling 4 holes in the bottom and also

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.380 
drilling 4 holes in the bottom and also
by<00:00:53.690> placing<00:00:54.690> four<00:00:55.379> casters<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:57.090> bottom

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
by placing four casters on the bottom

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.150 
by placing four casters on the bottom
that<00:00:57.539> allows<00:00:57.930> us<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.260> move<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.739> around<00:00:58.980> because

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
that allows us to move it around because

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.880 
that allows us to move it around because
once<00:00:59.550> these<00:00:59.789> are<00:00:59.969> full<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.390> soil<00:01:00.710> they<00:01:01.710> are

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
once these are full of soil they are

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.609 
once these are full of soil they are
extremely<00:01:02.579> heavy<00:01:03.019> ok<00:01:04.019> first<00:01:04.350> thing<00:01:04.500> we're

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
extremely heavy ok first thing we're

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.109 
extremely heavy ok first thing we're
going<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.769> do<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.129> get<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.460> plant<00:01:05.729> out<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
going to do is get the plant out of the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.990 
going to do is get the plant out of the
pot<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.750> as<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.049> can<00:01:07.140> see<00:01:07.439> from<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:08.549> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
pot and as you can see from this the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.880 
pot and as you can see from this the
actual<00:01:09.330> pot<00:01:09.540> bows<00:01:09.780> out<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.110> bit<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.560> area

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
actual pot bows out a bit in this area

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.530 
actual pot bows out a bit in this area
so<00:01:11.040> we<00:01:11.159> actually<00:01:11.310> have<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.729> cut<00:01:11.939> around<00:01:12.210> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
so we actually have to cut around the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.690 
so we actually have to cut around the
edge<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.049> pot<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.950> ensure<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.520> that's

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
edge of the pot to ensure that that's

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.270 
edge of the pot to ensure that that's
going<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.030> slip<00:01:15.840> out<00:01:16.020> nice<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.650> easily

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
going to slip out nice and easily

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.149 
going to slip out nice and easily
that's<00:01:18.210> just<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.600> matter<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.259> these<00:01:19.409> an<00:01:19.650> old

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
that's just a matter and these an old

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.910 
that's just a matter and these an old
saw<00:01:20.490> like<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:21.030> with<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.900> serrated<00:01:22.290> edge<00:01:22.590> makes

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
saw like this with a serrated edge makes

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.880 
saw like this with a serrated edge makes
it<00:01:23.130> very<00:01:23.250> easy<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.820> do<00:01:24.350> cut<00:01:25.350> around<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.740> edge

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
it very easy to do cut around the edge

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.969 
it very easy to do cut around the edge
there<00:01:28.040> now<00:01:29.040> what<00:01:29.280> we<00:01:29.430> do<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.610> just<00:01:29.759> slowly<00:01:30.979> onto

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
there now what we do is just slowly onto

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.530 
there now what we do is just slowly onto
its<00:01:32.100> side<00:01:32.340> I'm<00:01:32.579> going<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.759> place<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.270> onto

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
its side I'm going to place this onto

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.160 
its side I'm going to place this onto
the<00:01:33.780> soil<00:01:35.990> roll<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.229> few<00:01:37.500> times<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.100> then

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
the soil roll it a few times and then

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.950 
the soil roll it a few times and then
gently<00:01:40.170> pull<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.590> out

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.580 

okay<00:01:47.119> now<00:01:48.119> that's<00:01:48.270> nowhere<00:01:48.659> near<00:01:48.869> as<00:01:49.109> pop<00:01:49.380> down

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
okay now that's nowhere near as pop down

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.410 
okay now that's nowhere near as pop down
as<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.890> thought<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.249> would<00:01:50.399> be<00:01:50.579> which<00:01:50.999> is<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.179> good

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
as I thought it would be which is a good

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.779 
as I thought it would be which is a good
thing<00:01:51.659> if<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.590> was<00:01:52.740> particularly<00:01:53.189> pop<00:01:53.549> down

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
thing if it was particularly pop down

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.029 
thing if it was particularly pop down
you<00:01:54.420> can<00:01:54.569> actually<00:01:54.689> shave<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.439> sides<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.979> the

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
you can actually shave the sides and the

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:57.859 
you can actually shave the sides and the
bottom<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.579> relieve<00:01:56.880> any<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.390> mattered

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
bottom to relieve any of that mattered

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:06.410 
bottom to relieve any of that mattered
root<00:01:58.649> system<00:01:59.479> so<00:02:04.429> obviously<00:02:05.429> there's<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.390> lot

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
root system so obviously there's a lot

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.619 
root system so obviously there's a lot
the<00:02:07.409> volume<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:08.099> plant<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.759> system<00:02:09.539> is

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
the volume of that plant that system is

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.969 
the volume of that plant that system is
going<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.929> be<00:02:10.019> a<00:02:10.049> lot<00:02:10.259> less<00:02:10.440> than<00:02:10.679> what<00:02:10.830> we've

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
going to be a lot less than what we've

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:20.150 
going to be a lot less than what we've

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
can you leads and then it's just a

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.039 
can you leads and then it's just a
matter<00:02:44.519> of<00:02:44.819> back<00:02:45.120> feeling<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:45.629> I<00:02:45.660> make<00:02:45.870> sure

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
matter of back feeling so I make sure

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.539 
matter of back feeling so I make sure
it's<00:02:46.170> all<00:02:46.290> centered<00:02:46.769> it's<00:02:46.920> always<00:02:47.250> looks<00:02:47.430> a

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
it's all centered it's always looks a

00:02:47.549 --> 00:03:09.180 
it's all centered it's always looks a
lot<00:02:47.700> better<00:02:47.910> than<00:02:47.970> standard

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.370 

now<00:03:10.000> your<00:03:10.180> modern<00:03:10.480> potting<00:03:10.840> mixes<00:03:11.170> have

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
now your modern potting mixes have

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.190 
now your modern potting mixes have
wetting<00:03:12.190> agent<00:03:12.640> as<00:03:13.270> well<00:03:13.330> as<00:03:13.660> slow<00:03:13.900> release

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
wetting agent as well as slow release

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.530 
wetting agent as well as slow release
fertilizer<00:03:14.770> so<00:03:15.100> there's<00:03:15.310> no<00:03:15.490> need<00:03:15.550> to<00:03:15.940> have

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
fertilizer so there's no need to have

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.290 
fertilizer so there's no need to have
any<00:03:16.810> of<00:03:16.990> that<00:03:17.020> kind<00:03:17.470> of<00:03:17.560> stuff<00:03:17.730> okay<00:03:18.730> so<00:03:19.030> you

firm that need to take it only needs to

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.750 
firm that need to take it only needs to
be<00:03:26.410> at<00:03:26.560> that<00:03:26.650> level<00:03:26.710> that<00:03:27.130> it<00:03:27.220> was<00:03:27.250> in<00:03:27.640> the

be at that level that it was in the
other<00:03:27.880> pot<00:03:28.620> it's<00:03:29.620> too<00:03:29.830> hard

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
other pot it's too hard

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.200 
other pot it's too hard
the<00:03:30.550> root<00:03:30.730> system<00:03:30.760> will<00:03:31.150> dry<00:03:31.360> out<00:03:31.390> if<00:03:31.750> it's<00:03:31.900> too

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210 
the root system will dry out if it's too

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.050 
the root system will dry out if it's too
lower<00:03:34.210> than<00:03:34.510> the<00:03:34.720> you're<00:03:35.680> going<00:03:35.830> to<00:03:36.060> be

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
lower than the you're going to be

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.660 
lower than the you're going to be
causing<00:03:37.300> root<00:03:37.600> problems<00:03:38.020> or<00:03:38.670> renovating

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
causing root problems or renovating

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.280 
causing root problems or renovating
problems<00:03:40.000> on<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.270> stem<00:03:40.980> okay<00:03:42.960> now<00:03:43.960> I<00:03:43.990> always

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
problems on the stem okay now I always

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.480 
problems on the stem okay now I always
like<00:03:44.470> to<00:03:45.540> put<00:03:46.540> a<00:03:46.600> layer<00:03:46.930> of<00:03:47.230> mulch<00:03:47.650> over<00:03:48.400> the

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
like to put a layer of mulch over the

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:49.890 
like to put a layer of mulch over the
top<00:03:48.700> of<00:03:48.850> that<00:03:48.880> there's<00:03:49.210> a<00:03:49.330> couple<00:03:49.570> of<00:03:49.750> reasons

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
top of that there's a couple of reasons

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.700 
top of that there's a couple of reasons
for<00:03:50.170> doing<00:03:50.530> that

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:50.710 
for doing that

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.500 
for doing that
it<00:03:51.370> obviously<00:03:52.680> stops<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:54.790> soil<00:03:55.060> from<00:03:55.240> drying

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
it obviously stops the soil from drying

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.800 
it obviously stops the soil from drying
out<00:03:55.810> as<00:03:55.990> quickly<00:03:56.280> but<00:03:57.280> it<00:03:57.430> also<00:03:57.610> stops<00:03:58.600> any

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
out as quickly but it also stops any

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.080 
out as quickly but it also stops any
weeds<00:03:59.110> from<00:03:59.290> germinating<00:03:59.380> and<00:04:00.010> that<00:04:00.190> that

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
weeds from germinating and that that

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.390 
weeds from germinating and that that

it into it that edge and then it needs

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:53.140 
it into it that edge and then it needs
to<00:04:44.000> be<00:04:44.180> watered<00:04:44.360> in<00:04:44.660> well<00:04:50.199> and<00:04:51.699> that<00:04:52.699> plant
