00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.849

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:09.290
 yes obviously very grateful to God 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.690
 obviously because of the great opportunity that 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.889
 has given me author brand since all my 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.209
 family that has always supported me in my 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.730
 nice people from costa rica who knows that 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.440
 I love heaps of all Latinos 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.480
 my group after work that always 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.400
 he was with me there really supporting me 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.680
 but it was a great real fight from 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.060
 very good boy obviously of and very 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.010
 grateful to God very happy for the 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.810
 victory and thus emphasizing costa rica in 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.220
 the map that bryant and you come 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.780
 coming out of the fight does not help 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.520
 or to change to the room we saw 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.740
 the face the face of joseph felix 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.480
 juniors hit and you seem like that 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.180
 if he came to eat an ice cream 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.040
 Well yes obviously a little hit but 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.410
 thank god and without a very good 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.780
 preparation we had better as the 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.520
 best team the best nutritionist 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.290
 he did a good job I did not dehydrate 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.100
 as we were talking to him the bride 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:57.380
 everything went super well thanks to god 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.380
 boy very fast but he did not hit so 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.550
 strong as I thought and then I 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.720
 I imagine he thinks I have more 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.179
 strong than he thought 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.220
 bryant consolidated t victory in the 

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:09.050
 last assaults because at the beginning like 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.360
 some time when the cards 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.220
 were couples what do you think was due 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.710
 you took confidence that you lost fear 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.650
 to that supposed stuck obviously in 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.210
 actually I always carry as I know how 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.120
 a calculator took the points in the 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.740
 head and I was going to fan the cards the 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.330
 second grade is a bit even but the 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.070
 first and always I got a hit 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.110
 I put two or his entered the 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.730
 glove and the same went well then 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.470
 I already like adding truth I thought that 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.910
 It was good to get to the corner they told me 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.610
 that was going well when suddenly they told me or 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.080
 that we're going draw you have to pull of there 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.510
 to throw and that's what we did 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.490
 true because not unfortunately 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.920
 obviously you thank me with god and 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.810
 it was the fight is very good very technical 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.840
 but he does not have the opportunity to knock out 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.400
 trains you a lot for that but so 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.050
 less was a good very good fight is 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.729
 well it was worth the separation of your 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.979
 daughter of your wife hanna gabriels 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.110
 obviously I would say no 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.650
 true but but that is the future of 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.840
 she 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.390
 I mean, I do it for my family, I do it 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.890
 for me for my country then I think that 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.720
 It is a good need and expendios that 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.040

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.660

 historical fact for boxing and we believe
