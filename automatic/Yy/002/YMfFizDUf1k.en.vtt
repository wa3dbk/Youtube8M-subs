 They tell me I changed a little and say that I lost my innocence if only you knew the way I went to find a moment of perfection 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:01:05.417
 And before me stands a man who watches him and looks for the change that has taken place on him and finds nothing strange that has changed except for the color you returned to his cheeks 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:33.417
 And I have the urge sometimes, to shout loudly to the world about who you are for me, and what you give and you have the power of an entire army, one against everyone and that makes you what you are fighting 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:02:12.417
 So they tell me that I changed a bit and it is true that the smile returned to my face a quiet corner I found you in my everything I chose my love 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:40.417
 And I have a desire sometimes, to shout loud to the deceived in what I won who sent you to me the reason why my life is no longer the same life from the moment you penetrated into my life
