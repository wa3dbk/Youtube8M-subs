00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:10.290
 so we were taught the second mission I do not remember 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:17.640
 name unfortunately okay then on 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:20.579
 marker and skip the cut scenes as we 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.599
 everyone watched and to save time we 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:26.310
 we will pass them at first 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:28.560
 Messina is still interesting and cool in 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:34.790
 This mission gives us to shoot from 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.790
 firearms all fine series 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:45.510
 I will consider it as an escape on a very 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.940
 business guy we okay we will 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.449
 listen to him for the time being 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.949
 there is no way out for you but also not for us 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.320
 these weapons are taken away from us and we stay 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:01.559
 unarmed okay next missions 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:06.570
 there will still be weapons and there is no reason for 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:09.720
 frustration mission yes I like i told 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.120
 quite funny and interesting and like me 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.480
 said in the review you need to look at 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:19.890
 mini map more often and don't skip these 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:23.870
 monsters and everything will be fine so here we are 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.870
 already almost arrived like 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:38.399
 people so everything arrived 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:41.670
 follow me as you say boss yes where 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:45.659
 this switch but here it goes down 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:49.890
 on the elevator for a moment soot found 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:54.689
 will break but than we will fix it later 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:58.970
 and where there is the spirit of my arms that it has a 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:04.409
 on a fig but you here as meat 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:08.729
 not funny about hell the elevator got stuck 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:13.340
 repair and you're holding a gun termoochki not 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.340
 leave the platform yes look both ways 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:33.790
 5 minutes left kayuk 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:37.610
 honestly that type is very nasty 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.070
 arrogantly so poor cj in role 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:51.860
 the meat put out okay then we can handle 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:58.070
 this and this is exactly what we do doublekill and and 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:59.840
 In general, I read a lot of enemies 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:10.959
 I'm already afraid that someone missed 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:14.450
 no i have to wet as i said by 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:18.830
 I was burning in the review at the expiration of the timer 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:23.709
 stop us and stop responding 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.709
 and we can already all the beach 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:37.519
 so it is necessary in those even sometimes 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:41.269
 sometimes but i think a couple of zombies can 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:47.080
 miss will then finish them somehow 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:47.080
 ok now we shoot them 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.439
 ok 20 seconds left on timer 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.620
 I know the truth why wear thermal glasses 

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:06.670
 although there is some kind of light turned off here 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:10.000
 because of which is already very close 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:13.079
 some got close but nothing 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.810
 continue to shoot them and while all 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:21.970
 very good 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:25.419
 good weapons is a fact which the 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:28.289
 shotgun incomprehensible okay since thats 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:33.250
 all the weapons in the game are fictional 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:36.759
 futuristic such we all went through this 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:40.509
 the mission of the state that carried 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:44.520
 so that I carried you so little into my pants 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:44.520
 called valim from here 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.440
 what a stink shut up bitch 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:05:01.120
 and this mission also you passed it 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:01.120
 just great
