00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
absolutely massive there's the option of

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.229

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:38.239 
grabbing onto the front lip of the

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:41.050 
grabbing onto the front lip of the
bouncy<00:01:38.690> castle<00:01:38.720> and<00:01:39.259> then<00:01:40.009> kicking<00:01:40.580> with<00:01:40.910> our

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
bouncy castle and then kicking with our

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
bouncy castle and then kicking with our
legs<00:01:41.300> but<00:01:41.869> I<00:01:42.220> want<00:01:43.220> an<00:01:44.000> attack<00:01:44.270> I<00:01:44.420> don't<00:01:44.720> really

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
legs but I want an attack I don't really

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.719 
legs but I want an attack I don't really
want<00:01:45.259> to<00:01:45.380> do<00:01:45.500> that<00:01:45.530> because<00:01:45.830> I'll<00:01:46.039> get<00:01:46.220> wet<00:01:46.429> and

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
want to do that because I'll get wet and

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.029 
want to do that because I'll get wet and
I<00:01:47.119> think<00:01:47.390> we<00:01:47.630> might<00:01:47.750> get<00:01:47.959> tired<00:01:48.170> all<00:01:48.709> of<00:01:48.860> us<00:01:48.979> a

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
I think we might get tired all of us a

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:50.830 
I think we might get tired all of us a
bad<00:01:49.160> knee<00:01:49.429> surgery<00:01:49.910> in<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.179> past<00:01:50.239> two<00:01:50.599> years

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
bad knee surgery in the past two years

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.290

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
donate s like a fish tail motor if we

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.440 
donate s like a fish tail motor if we
can<00:01:56.539> just<00:01:57.050> like<00:01:57.649> hold<00:01:57.950> it<00:01:58.069> in<00:01:58.190> place<00:01:58.369> and<00:01:58.789> get<00:01:59.420> a
