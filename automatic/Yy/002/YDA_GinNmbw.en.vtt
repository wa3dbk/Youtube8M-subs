like the gameboy SP and other portable

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.040 
like the gameboy SP and other portable

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
devices that I've had in the past but

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.440 
devices that I've had in the past but
I've<00:00:31.320> never<00:00:31.560> really<00:00:32.009> seen<00:00:32.279> anything<00:00:32.450> quite

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
I've never really seen anything quite

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.010 
I've never really seen anything quite
this<00:00:33.809> bad<00:00:34.380> as<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:35.370> can<00:00:35.550> see<00:00:35.790> on<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.300> ipad<00:00:36.750> 2

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
this bad as you can see on the ipad 2

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.560 
this bad as you can see on the ipad 2
right<00:00:37.290> here<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.620> have<00:00:37.980> these<00:00:38.160> yellow<00:00:38.850> bleeding

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
right here I have these yellow bleeding

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.930 
right here I have these yellow bleeding
marks<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.530> backlight<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.700> i'm<00:00:41.820> guessing

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
marks of the backlight so i'm guessing

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.970 
marks of the backlight so i'm guessing
the<00:00:42.180> backlight<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.899> leaking<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.559> little<00:00:43.739> bit

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
the backlight is leaking a little bit

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.450 
the backlight is leaking a little bit
onto<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.700> display<00:00:44.930> so<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.890> could<00:00:47.070> see<00:00:47.280> these

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
onto the display so you could see these

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.630 
onto the display so you could see these
yellow<00:00:48.030> pieces<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.960> light<00:00:49.260> just<00:00:49.590> coming<00:00:50.399> in

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
yellow pieces of light just coming in

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.279 
yellow pieces of light just coming in
through<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.210> sides<00:00:51.629> which<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.050> quite

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
through the sides which is quite

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.200 
through the sides which is quite
annoying<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.219> ipad<00:00:53.610> 2<00:00:53.910> right<00:00:54.180> here

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
annoying on the ipad 2 right here

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.720 
annoying on the ipad 2 right here
because<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:54.989> can<00:00:55.140> kind<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.590> see<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.920> when<00:00:56.520> you

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
because you can kind of see it when you

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.910 
because you can kind of see it when you
are<00:00:56.940> just<00:00:57.300> at<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.840> home<00:00:58.020> screen<00:00:58.410> or<00:00:58.620> whatever

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
are just at the home screen or whatever

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.560 
are just at the home screen or whatever
you<00:00:59.219> can<00:00:59.340> kind<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.730> see<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.030> on<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.329> sides

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
you can kind of see it on the sides

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.770 
you can kind of see it on the sides
there<00:01:00.960> maybe<00:01:01.469> not<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.100> much<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.520> on<00:01:02.820> camera<00:01:03.420> but

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
there maybe not so much in on camera but

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.590 
there maybe not so much in on camera but
in<00:01:04.080> real<00:01:04.949> life<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.489> can<00:01:05.700> totally<00:01:06.180> see<00:01:06.420> this

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
in real life you can totally see this

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.310 
in real life you can totally see this
and<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.979> just<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.610> little<00:01:08.939> bit<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.720> thing

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
and it is just a little bit of a thing

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.649 
and it is just a little bit of a thing
that<00:01:10.530> grinds<00:01:10.950> my<00:01:11.100> gears<00:01:11.150> so<00:01:12.150> I'm<00:01:12.330> not<00:01:12.510> really

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
that grinds my gears so I'm not really

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.719 
that grinds my gears so I'm not really
sure<00:01:12.780> if<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.439> going<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.619> get<00:01:13.830> worse<00:01:14.159> or<00:01:14.549> if

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
sure if this is going to get worse or if

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.690 
sure if this is going to get worse or if
it's<00:01:14.909> going<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.090> get<00:01:15.270> better<00:01:15.600> now<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.740> didn't

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
it's going to get better now I didn't

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.580 
it's going to get better now I didn't
really<00:01:17.880> notice<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:18.630> when<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.869> first<00:01:19.229> got<00:01:19.439> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
really notice this when I first got the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.350 
really notice this when I first got the
ipad<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.250> I'm<00:01:20.369> not<00:01:20.520> really<00:01:20.700> sure<00:01:20.820> if<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.240> got

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
ipad so I'm not really sure if it got

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.570 
ipad so I'm not really sure if it got
worse<00:01:21.689> or<00:01:21.990> not<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.380> remember<00:01:23.040> seeing<00:01:23.189> one<00:01:23.549> of

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
worse or not I remember seeing one of

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.940 
worse or not I remember seeing one of
these<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.150> didn't<00:01:24.600> remember<00:01:24.750> seeing<00:01:25.229> like<00:01:25.530> six

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
these I didn't remember seeing like six

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.580 
these I didn't remember seeing like six
of<00:01:26.130> these<00:01:26.250> little<00:01:26.580> dots<00:01:26.820> around<00:01:27.119> here<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:28.229> if

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
of these little dots around here so if

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.859 
of these little dots around here so if
this<00:01:29.040> does<00:01:29.340> get<00:01:29.610> worse<00:01:29.850> for<00:01:30.180> any<00:01:30.329> reason<00:01:30.780> I

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
this does get worse for any reason I

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.929 
this does get worse for any reason I
might<00:01:31.110> have<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.439> make<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.770> trip<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.640> apple

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
might have to make a trip to the apple

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.210 
might have to make a trip to the apple
store<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.630> return<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.350> or<00:01:34.560> exchange<00:01:35.040> it

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
store and return this or exchange it

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.580 
store and return this or exchange it
