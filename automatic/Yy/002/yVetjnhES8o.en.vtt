can't<00:02:34.560> so<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:36.000> then<00:02:36.150> this<00:02:36.420> is<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.660> best<00:02:36.810> part

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
can't so and then this is the best part

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:44.810 
can't so and then this is the best part
I<00:02:37.170> like<00:02:37.350> about<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.770> hey<00:02:40.670> angle<00:02:43.610> it's<00:02:44.610> really

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
I like about it hey angle it's really

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.050 
I like about it hey angle it's really
fragile<00:02:45.090> that's<00:02:45.510> why<00:02:45.720> it's<00:02:46.400> kind<00:02:47.400> of<00:02:47.580> delicate

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
fragile that's why it's kind of delicate

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.820 
fragile that's why it's kind of delicate
but<00:02:50.209> it<00:02:51.209> folds<00:02:51.780> down<00:02:51.959> this<00:02:52.140> is<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.440> platform

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
but it folds down this is the platform

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.320 
but it folds down this is the platform
that<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:53.989> put<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.230> grate<00:02:55.920> onto<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.580> this<00:02:57.120> is

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
that you put the grate onto and this is

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.690 
that you put the grate onto and this is
just<00:02:57.480> like<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.720> little<00:02:57.870> carrier<00:02:58.470> when<00:02:59.370> it<00:02:59.459> folds

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
just like a little carrier when it folds

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.229 
just like a little carrier when it folds
up<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.269> just<00:03:00.450> goes<00:03:00.690> up<00:03:00.870> there<00:03:01.019> like<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.170> I

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
up it just goes up there like that I

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:08.860 
up it just goes up there like that I
will<00:03:03.239> bring<00:03:03.360> this<00:03:03.480> over<00:03:03.720> there<00:03:04.110> looks<00:03:05.070> like

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.440 

ours<00:03:09.870> already<00:03:10.110> having<00:03:10.470> this<00:03:10.590> on<00:03:11.269> and<00:03:12.269> this

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
ours already having this on and this

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.770 
ours already having this on and this
just<00:03:12.720> goes<00:03:13.110> right<00:03:13.260> in<00:03:13.470> there<00:03:13.620> like<00:03:13.829> this<00:03:14.780> so

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
just goes right in there like this so

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.729 
just goes right in there like this so
the<00:03:15.870> PTO<00:03:16.200> on<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.440> tractor<00:03:18.170> yeah<00:03:19.170> and<00:03:19.470> I<00:03:19.500> just

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
the PTO on the tractor yeah and I just

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.880 
the PTO on the tractor yeah and I just
take<00:03:19.860> a<00:03:19.890> little<00:03:20.070> bit<00:03:20.310> of<00:03:22.160> corn<00:03:24.440> and<00:03:25.440> put<00:03:25.709> on<00:03:25.860> it

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
take a little bit of corn and put on it

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.979 
take a little bit of corn and put on it
it's<00:03:26.370> just<00:03:26.519> really<00:03:26.820> spilling<00:03:27.420> a<00:03:27.510> lot<00:03:27.750> I'd

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
it's just really spilling a lot I'd

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.400 
it's just really spilling a lot I'd
probably<00:03:28.590> clean<00:03:29.010> that<00:03:29.190> up<00:03:30.140> but<00:03:31.140> it<00:03:31.260> looks

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
probably clean that up but it looks

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:38.000 
probably clean that up but it looks
pretty<00:03:31.530> cool<00:03:31.650> okay<00:03:33.860> okay<00:03:35.269> now<00:03:36.680> I'll<00:03:37.680> do<00:03:37.890> the

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
pretty cool okay okay now I'll do the

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.490 
pretty cool okay okay now I'll do the
dealership<00:03:38.549> that's<00:03:39.450> just<00:03:39.630> a<00:03:39.720> scope<00:03:40.019> so<00:03:40.290> I

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
dealership that's just a scope so I

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.319 
dealership that's just a scope so I
should<00:03:40.769> probably<00:03:40.860> get<00:03:41.100> that<00:03:41.160> off<00:03:41.400> there<00:03:41.610> but

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
should probably get that off there but

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.560 
should probably get that off there but
like<00:03:43.040> here's<00:03:44.040> another<00:03:44.310> little<00:03:44.610> axle<00:03:45.329> from

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
like here's another little axle from

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.990 
like here's another little axle from
another<00:03:45.840> car<00:03:46.170> and<00:03:46.530> then<00:03:46.739> I<00:03:47.010> got<00:03:47.579> to<00:03:47.700> still<00:03:47.880> have

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
another car and then I got to still have

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.080 
another car and then I got to still have
the<00:03:48.090> axle<00:03:48.540> or<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:49.190> lift<00:03:50.190> kit<00:03:50.400> want<00:03:50.670> just<00:03:50.940> the

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
the axle or the lift kit want just the

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.210 
the axle or the lift kit want just the
one<00:03:51.269> really<00:03:52.110> want<00:03:52.350> to<00:03:52.410> find<00:03:52.560> another<00:03:52.680> one<00:03:53.010> and

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
one really want to find another one and

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.670 
one really want to find another one and
then<00:03:53.880> just<00:03:54.660> got<00:03:54.780> some<00:03:54.989> other<00:03:55.140> ones<00:03:55.230> I<00:03:55.500> could

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
then just got some other ones I could

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.850 
then just got some other ones I could
have<00:03:55.769> used<00:03:55.920> these<00:03:56.160> for<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.989> for<00:03:57.989> that<00:03:58.110> auger

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
have used these for the for that auger

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.920 
have used these for the for that auger
instead<00:03:59.400> they<00:03:59.579> just<00:03:59.760> think<00:03:59.880> like<00:04:00.359> Tech<00:04:00.660> Deck

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
instead they just think like Tech Deck

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.160 
instead they just think like Tech Deck
little<00:04:01.320> wheels<00:04:02.870> toys<00:04:04.130> nothing<00:04:05.130> else<00:04:06.170> not

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
little wheels toys nothing else not

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.780 
little wheels toys nothing else not
quite<00:04:07.350> sure<00:04:07.380> I<00:04:07.530> think<00:04:07.650> I<00:04:07.859> was<00:04:08.010> harming<00:04:08.489> around

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
quite sure I think I was harming around

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.940 
quite sure I think I was harming around
that<00:04:08.970> and<00:04:09.540> I<00:04:09.660> just<00:04:09.870> kind<00:04:10.230> of<00:04:10.290> leveled<00:04:10.620> this<00:04:10.709> off

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
that and I just kind of leveled this off

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.930 
that and I just kind of leveled this off
a<00:04:11.370> little<00:04:12.120> bit<00:04:12.330> but

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.750 

nothing<00:04:15.810> changed<00:04:16.140> in<00:04:16.200> here<00:04:16.380> yet<00:04:16.620> I<00:04:16.860> want<00:04:17.610> to

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
nothing changed in here yet I want to

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.360 
nothing changed in here yet I want to
like<00:04:18.300> take<00:04:18.600> some<00:04:18.989> wood<00:04:19.440> and<00:04:19.470> just<00:04:19.860> like<00:04:20.040> layer

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
like take some wood and just like layer

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.660 
like take some wood and just like layer
it<00:04:20.670> down<00:04:20.970> up<00:04:21.270> and<00:04:21.450> down<00:04:21.510> like<00:04:21.810> that

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
it down up and down like that

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.640 
it down up and down like that
so<00:04:23.670> then<00:04:23.880> it<00:04:23.970> looks<00:04:24.090> cool<00:04:24.360> and<00:04:24.660> then<00:04:24.780> Stewart

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
so then it looks cool and then Stewart

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.470 
so then it looks cool and then Stewart
right<00:04:25.770> there<00:04:25.980> too<00:04:26.160> and<00:04:26.280> then<00:04:26.370> I<00:04:26.490> was<00:04:26.670> like<00:04:26.850> even

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
right there too and then I was like even

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.050 
right there too and then I was like even
though<00:04:27.660> it's<00:04:27.690> like<00:04:27.810> a<00:04:27.900> little<00:04:28.140> dump<00:04:28.830> bed<00:04:29.070> like

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
though it's like a little dump bed like

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.770 
though it's like a little dump bed like
sometimes<00:04:30.480> it<00:04:31.470> for<00:04:32.430> like<00:04:33.030> the<00:04:33.210> dump<00:04:33.420> but<00:04:33.570> might

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
sometimes it for like the dump but might

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:34.940 
sometimes it for like the dump but might
be<00:04:33.930> broken<00:04:34.200> so<00:04:34.440> you<00:04:34.470> getting<00:04:34.710> like<00:04:34.860> a<00:04:34.890> little

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
be broken so you getting like a little

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.260 
be broken so you getting like a little
weird<00:04:35.940> that<00:04:36.090> fold<00:04:36.450> down<00:04:36.510> that<00:04:36.870> type<00:04:37.200> of<00:04:37.410> people

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
weird that fold down that type of people

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.070 
weird that fold down that type of people
but<00:04:39.270> nothing<00:04:40.050> else<00:04:40.200> change<00:04:40.530> over<00:04:40.740> here<00:04:40.770> but<00:04:41.550> I

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
but nothing else change over here but I

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.280 
but nothing else change over here but I
really<00:04:43.080> don't<00:04:43.410> remember<00:04:43.560> if<00:04:44.100> I<00:04:44.460> put<00:04:45.420> said<00:04:45.870> put

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
really don't remember if I put said put

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.770 
really don't remember if I put said put
these<00:04:46.470> things<00:04:46.740> on<00:04:46.890> there<00:04:47.270> they're<00:04:48.270> just<00:04:48.540> um

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
these things on there they're just um

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.430 
these things on there they're just um
think<00:04:49.700> converters<00:04:50.700> like<00:04:50.940> a<00:04:51.300> couple<00:04:52.140> of<00:04:52.200> videos

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
think converters like a couple of videos

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.750 
think converters like a couple of videos
ago<00:04:52.560> I<00:04:52.650> said<00:04:52.890> think<00:04:53.100> my<00:04:53.250> mom<00:04:53.460> said<00:04:53.730> that

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
ago I said think my mom said that

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.460 
ago I said think my mom said that
wouldn't<00:04:54.240> be<00:04:54.360> possible<00:04:54.570> otherwise<00:04:55.020> you<00:04:55.350> get

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
wouldn't be possible otherwise you get

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.810 
wouldn't be possible otherwise you get
too<00:04:55.680> much<00:04:55.770> voltage<00:04:55.980> or<00:04:56.430> something<00:04:56.700> like<00:04:56.760> that

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
too much voltage or something like that
