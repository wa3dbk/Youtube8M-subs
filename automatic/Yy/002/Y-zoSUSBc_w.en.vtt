00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hannah is now welcome to 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:09.900
 herald trail of dead and this time 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.639
 show you the spot on the docks and yes 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.549
 so come right so broda behind 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.990
 we have the m 19 27 here in the house too 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:21.119
 still the mp5 but where with the m9 27 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.560
 So with this tommy gun you can feel yourself 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.730
 I'm already satisfied 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.519
 really really good 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.519
 so separate times completely before zombies here 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.520
 of course, the table also needs something else 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.930
 So the workbench and there you can 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.930
 just shake it if it does not 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.739
 has already built a different way 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:46.620
 because one is the workbench and yes 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.270
 Other pro one actually has one 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.660
 good place for training if I am now 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.719
 again running back can I again 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.020
 run over and again all behind me 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.699
 You can as well at the beginning or if 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.199
 you already have everyone behind you can 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.640
 also here so smaller rounds run 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.339
 maybe one or the other 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.060
 bring zombie with you and then 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:12.119
 go down the other way 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.729
 every case is enough when you go down 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.960
 is what happens here sometimes 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.210
 Can be combination of contor side window 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.100
 Landlords can sometimes be full in the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.100
 Cross come and mess up everything a 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:34.049
 So the shareholders is really good 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:36.659
 and yes to contra this is sometimes 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.260
 stupid so a front from up here 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.760
 somewhere 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.530
 out there but that 's the problem 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.990
 that he would consider a problem 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.650
 the whole sports up for example or 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.180
 here left behind really recommend from 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.370
 palettes to go here and ever so 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.500
 and to the left behind to look and 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.990
 watch if there is a zombie now 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.580
 if so , he runs or goes 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.990
 and then decide how to walk 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.130
 So now if around the corner 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.310
 I would come immediately I already 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.500
 turn around and run back 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:15.540
 you would still run normally now 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:17.460
 I can also show it and it 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.870
 was not again to who the so 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.950
 Slowly they are also considering if 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.540
 would run more now I would here 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.300
 still a bit in the middle 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.150
 pull in and then leak 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.500
 and yes the next window zombie it 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.600
 also point depends whether it fast or 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.180
 slow is when he is fast there 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:37.170
 you still between him and the window 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:40.310
 walk past again briefly here as 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.290
 small demonstration 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.730
 so if build now would jump 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.130
 Almost why in higher places lay to me 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.010
 nice just so could pass 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.209
 on how fast he is over it 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.420
 if he's just skip the 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.739
 Of course, do not try between him 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.980
 to walk long because it is on everyone 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:00.290
 case would be wrong and another would be pro 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.000
 also electro box if now here 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.830
 from the left a lot of born and vom 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.410
 window of his camera already go in 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.300
 go to the electric box and get into the 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.910
 After eight mode introduce introduce 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.720
 of course this is as already in 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.610
 other videos says that you go down 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.569
 but his purcell if you look again 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.190
 himself is surprised and he has like 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:27.049
 said going from zombies sound 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:29.030
 you keep the talk is not always 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.580
 the zombies again, they can once again 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.360
 quickly spawn where the nyt I want 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:38.450
 Now I have to come back 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.549
 No one is not going too fast 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.750
 slowly over it 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.430
 and you have to watch the slow for 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.910
 so far you usually only ever have to 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.209
 Trainer 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.859
 because if not if the whole 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.049
 family are not close to each other 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:53.810
 then you pull all of them here for a long time 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.670
 like a bubble gum and that can 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.600
 then you 'd have a quick one 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.569
 no fatal ending 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.400
 So here at this spot always has to 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.200
 run by running so not normal 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.019
 you can do that here you can be beautiful 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.560
 slow running here, too 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.170
 back again 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.440
 Here we come slowly to watch 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.359
 comes the one compact and from here then 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.359
 I would definitely recommend 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:19.850
 run 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.410
 jankos by pro is gives two weapons 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.870
 where actually the tomic to the herders 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.100
 would be enough 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.450
 one had electro boxster 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.260
 you actually have a good spot here 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:33.040
 Round back near and that lasts 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:37.160
 In any case, I would not recommend 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:39.020
 if you go for it then you are like that 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.920
 good as down because the place back there 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.750
 is so close 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.270
 I would definitely not recommend 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.830
 So you can see how Anderson is and 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.910
 you just can not go left again 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.570
 pass him by 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.640
 it just will not work , but I would 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.410
 I do not recommend the synonymous now 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.180
 not like the other strike 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.620
 That's why I would be easy here 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:03.700
 let go out here at the round 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:07.510
 this position and contras as I said 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:10.940
 The pons could sometimes be really annoying 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:13.490
 and yes , otherwise I have actually 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:16.040
 nothing but it can get tight here sometimes 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:20.840
 can also be a bit lies then 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:23.240
 Stop it how many times that's it 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.590
 actually already from the docks me 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.790
 I 'll have the next sport now 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.350
 also in the reason is easy to do 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.970
 just way too long 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.840
 century at the beginning when I am here 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.580
 just so few zombies 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.920
 so here's one from the left I have to enter 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.750
 a little faster turn me around and 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.710
 but it does not run back either 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.590
 real problem 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.360
 and as I said the shield is up there 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.950
 Definitely also a pro if you have it 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.960
 not already built somewhere else 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.910
 so that's been want of 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.370
 this spot I liked it 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.700
 and you always see each other in the next 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.700
 Video
