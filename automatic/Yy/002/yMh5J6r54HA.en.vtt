quite simple SCS software is having a

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.640 
quite simple SCS software is having a
very<00:01:19.920> small<00:01:20.610> team<00:01:20.939> there<00:01:21.720> are<00:01:21.840> about<00:01:21.869> 30

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
very small team there are about 30

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.859 
very small team there are about 30
people<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.430> s<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.840> SES<00:01:25.290> sub<00:01:25.560> 30<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.869> they

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
people in s in the SES sub 30 and they

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.840 
people in s in the SES sub 30 and they

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
simulator 2 because they must release

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.810 
simulator 2 because they must release
updates<00:01:32.790> they<00:01:33.630> must<00:01:33.869> work<00:01:34.110> on<00:01:34.439> dlcs<00:01:35.250> for<00:01:35.280> your

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
lot of stuff to do and in the same time

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.819 
lot of stuff to do and in the same time
they<00:01:42.119> have<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.299> work<00:01:42.720> at<00:01:42.990> American<00:01:43.590> Truck

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
Simulator and for them for such a small

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.149 
Simulator and for them for such a small
team<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.640> would<00:01:47.970> be<00:01:48.149> impossible<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:49.159> release

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
team it would be impossible to release

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.109 
team it would be impossible to release
the<00:01:50.729> game<00:01:50.970> with<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.990> full<00:01:52.229> map<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.770> us<00:01:53.670> in<00:01:53.970> a

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
the game with the full map of us in a

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.999 
the game with the full map of us in a
reasonable<00:01:54.720> time<00:01:54.750> because<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.799> would

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
reasonable time because it would

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.670 
reasonable time because it would
probably<00:01:56.430> take<00:01:56.759> like<00:01:57.450> two<00:01:57.899> years<00:01:58.229> three<00:01:58.590> years

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
probably take like two years three years

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.090 
probably take like two years three years
four<00:01:59.100> years<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.689> course<00:02:01.020> no<00:02:01.290> one<00:02:01.469> wants<00:02:01.920> to

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
four years and of course no one wants to

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.429 
four years and of course no one wants to
wait<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.460> much<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:03.210> what<00:02:03.600> I'm<00:02:03.750> gonna<00:02:03.869> do<00:02:04.229> is

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
wait that much so what I'm gonna do is

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.310

pay<00:02:57.520> for<00:02:57.850> these<00:02:58.000> ones<00:02:58.330> as<00:02:58.660> far<00:02:59.080> as<00:02:59.230> i<00:02:59.380> know<00:02:59.500> of

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
pay for these ones as far as i know of

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.790 
pay for these ones as far as i know of
course<00:03:00.760> i'm<00:03:01.060> not<00:03:01.210> sure<00:03:01.420> because<00:03:01.630> there's<00:03:02.560> no

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
course i'm not sure because there's no

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.820 
course i'm not sure because there's no
there's<00:03:03.700> no<00:03:03.790> official<00:03:04.380> informations<00:03:05.380> about

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
there's no official informations about

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.020 
there's no official informations about
this<00:03:06.300> at<00:03:07.300> this<00:03:07.660> point<00:03:08.110> but<00:03:08.440> this<00:03:08.740> is<00:03:09.030> probably

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
this at this point but this is probably

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.450 
this at this point but this is probably
what<00:03:10.570> it's<00:03:10.780> going<00:03:11.110> to<00:03:11.260> happen<00:03:11.530> of<00:03:11.890> course<00:03:12.190> you

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
what it's going to happen of course you

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.960 
what it's going to happen of course you
you<00:03:12.940> don't<00:03:13.150> have<00:03:13.180> to<00:03:13.300> expect<00:03:14.250> at<00:03:15.250> a<00:03:15.310> big<00:03:15.580> price

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
you don't have to expect at a big price

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.350 
you don't have to expect at a big price
for<00:03:16.000> the<00:03:16.540> food<00:03:16.990> the<00:03:17.620> next<00:03:17.920> DLCs<00:03:18.489> they<00:03:19.209> will

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
for the food the next DLCs they will

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.229 
for the food the next DLCs they will
probably<00:03:19.840> have<00:03:20.080> a<00:03:20.680> very<00:03:21.310> small<00:03:21.430> price<00:03:21.940> so<00:03:22.209> that

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
probably have a very small price so that

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.060 
probably have a very small price so that
everyone<00:03:22.870> can<00:03:23.500> buy<00:03:23.770> them<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.760> DLCs<00:03:25.270> I<00:03:25.390> mean

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
everyone can buy them the DLCs I mean

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.720 
everyone can buy them the DLCs I mean

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
now another thing I know is that the

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.600 
now another thing I know is that the
game<00:03:30.970> will<00:03:31.150> have<00:03:31.480> more<00:03:32.080> simulation<00:03:32.950> options

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
game will have more simulation options
