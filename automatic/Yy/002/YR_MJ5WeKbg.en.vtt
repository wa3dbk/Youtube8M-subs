00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:08.210
 hi friends today we are going to learn how to make 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:13.330
 a decorative wire and washi sign 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:17.900
 tape materials are a folio scissors 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:20.400
 wire satin ribbon or any string 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.210
 to hang the sign 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.880
 tongs 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:30.009
 wsi for those of us who want pencil and folio 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.920
 first of all what we are going to do is 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.899
 the mold of the sign we are going to write a 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.610
 name or a word we want 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:41.260
 molding with the wire 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.260
 the word no 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.640
 Well, we start with help 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.050
 of the pliers or with the fingers we can more 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.050
 or less 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.469
 like the tongs that we are going to cut 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.469
 I move sideways 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.439
 and it cuts itself 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.630
 let's go now molding 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.750
 how we want 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.530
 Now what we are going to do is decorate and 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:58.080
 wrap 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.080
 around all the wire the wow 7 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.350
 we finish the ele and let's start with 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.350
 other color 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:33.260
 and returning well 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:36.189
 let's start now with the green 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.189
 and we do the same 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.000
 let's see if we go turning 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:54.290
 we already have the sign wrapped in webs and 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.830
 different colors is a way of 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.830
 make a poster 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:04.450
 to hang you can choose rope tape 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:08.050
 and whatever you want in this case I have chosen 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.050
 black satin ribbon 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:17.910
 and you do it in the extreme parts that 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.910
 you want from the sides 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.950
 if you want you can cut 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.950
 excess 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.950
 and we will also live 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.920
 I hope you liked it if it's like that
