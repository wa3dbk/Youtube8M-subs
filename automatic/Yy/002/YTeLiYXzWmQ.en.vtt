00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.300
 Welcome. 

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.910
 My name is Theo de Kleijn and I help entrepreneurs with video marketing 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.269
 to apply in a good way. 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.549
 In this video I will explain how the recorded footage 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:15.739
 can cut with the Windows Moviemaker. 

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:18.710
 To start, start your windows moviemaker. 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.460
 Then you go to the Add video or photo button. 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.429
 According to you select the recorded footage. 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:28.560
 Click on "open". 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.149
 Now you see the recorded footage 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:33.680
 and a graph below. 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.950
 That graph 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.600
 gives 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.830
 the text. 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.130
 So in this case I'm talking here and I'm stopping here, then it falls 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.560
 graph down. 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.840
 With this button you can 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.990
 and you can find out where to cut. 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.110
 You then move to a certain moment. 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.860
 Being common 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.830
 moments where it is quiet for a moment, moments where you can cut. 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.170
 Coincidentally, I know that 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.760
 this material what this is all material is what I do not need. 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.010
 So here I have to cut somewhere. Then I can go with that line 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.370
 scroll to determine when I'm going to talk. 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.030
 That is 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.800
 this moment. 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.270
 Then you put the line where you want to cut. 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.700
 Then go to the "edit" button and go to "split". 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.640
 You press that "split" button and at that moment your clip is split. 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.000
 This material does not need it. I select it and I press the delete 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.660
 button on the keyboard. 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.880
 Then I also know, 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.370
 Of course I can also listen to the video but I also know that 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.310
 at the moment that I am done with the video, 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.290
 so this material, 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.870
 where I turn off the video, turn off the video camera. 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.400
 That is not interesting. 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.020
 Here i can, 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.860
 after my last word, 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.850
 video, 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.550
 cut again. 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.279
 I do this again by pressing the "spire" button 

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:12.809
 and and I select this again and press the "delete" button 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:18.869
 on your keyboard. We can then save the file. 

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:21.879
 To file and then to "save movie" 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.129
 suit "high defintion" 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.009
 and use 

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:31.400
 mpeg4. That is actually the best upload 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.109
 format for youtube. 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:35.979
 Give your movie a name 

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:38.659
 slam the movie. Thanks for looking. 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:43.379
