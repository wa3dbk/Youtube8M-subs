00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 hello to all we find ourselves 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.490
 today for a new video on 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.859
 my youtube channel was born on september 19th 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.380
 it's 9:41 am and I'm coming from 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.870
 receive the new iphone 6 which I'm going 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.540
 you do the unpacking and a small 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.740
 presentation of the new design then the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.750
 first thing we notice quickly 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.789
 on the packaging is the absence of 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.850
 numbering since it is simply 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.449
 registered iphone with the little logo of the 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.039
 mark on the side for the rest it's 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.779
 really very sober maybe even too much 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.930
 since the box she is all white 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.730
 it ensures the top a reflection in fact 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.440
 in fact the silhouette of the phone on 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.300
 looks like an embossing effect that 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.829
 apply on this box to me for 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.230
 my part i do not like it i do not know 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.640
 why did they do that in 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.700
 any case do not hesitate to give me your 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.309
 notice in comments 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.530
 good however it is not very important 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.930
 it's gone we run the product then 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:02.730
 I remove the blister that covers the 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:05.460
 iphone box the model I have 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.740
 chosen is the 64 gigas like you 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.900
 could see it then it's actually the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.700
 only model that has gone down in price one can 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.430
 we can see it like that since it loses 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.450
 100 euros compared to the iphone 5 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.350
 64 giga pieces from last year 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.950
 here I also wanted to make a 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.320
 quick comparison between the old 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.900
 iphone 5s box and the box 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.070
 current iphone 6 to see a small 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.220
 little difference in 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.220
 dimensions 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.250
 so let's go we open the little one 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.250
 box 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:47.120
 hop there quintin went so the iphone 6 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.220
 here in the gray color model 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.140
 sidereal 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:55.760
 in other words black color a little 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:59.840
 slate it very pretty at first sight 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.660
 despite these rounded edges the little 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:07.760
 tongue to pull them really very 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:12.350
 light in addition adacore so the back of 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.730
 the iphone in fact makes the color 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.910
 varies depending on the exposure 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.440
 I think and we will start with the 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.170
 presentation of this new design 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.140
 to start with the edges of this iphone 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.690
 which are now rounded before the summer 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.520
 highlights and rights in the four 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.700
 previous last generation iphone 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.770
 there the rounded edges it is surely for 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.709
 better handling because the 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.420
 two sizes of two new iphone 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.459
 are now bigger that allows 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.860
 a better grip 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:49.280
 so here really is very very fine end 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:51.769
 6.9 mm thick but wider this 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.840
 this allows him to have a more 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.940
 big battery and so a better 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.560
 autonomy 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.170
 so here we remove the plastic film 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.500
 who surround him and really he is very 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.410
 very successful this very pretty iphone 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:10.010
 really beautiful so here we find 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.079
 the home of key for standby 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.739
 also housing for sim card 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:17.959
 so a nano sim on his back finally on 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.180
 the back on the bottom of the phone on 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.390
 find the 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:25.629
 3.5 port jack or earphones the 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:29.739
 micro the lightning to recharge and the 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:33.760
 very pretty speakers really very 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:35.230
 pretty the rate of chailly that makes it the 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.150
 fingerprint reader on the 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:42.579
 down the phone here and then who are we going 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.040
 started it here by letting go of 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:48.129
 seconds on the on off button that's getting 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.680
 now on the side for a 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:54.650
 better ease by size 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.200
 screen size or screen size 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.640
 so here for the future I will 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.200
 present the new functions of 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.900
 this new iphone 6 in a new 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.099
 ten point video with ios more 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.890
 the new system is now 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:09.590
 available I invite you to subscribe

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.790
 this is the case I tell you very quickly 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.390
