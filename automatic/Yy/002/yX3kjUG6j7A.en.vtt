 care and maintenance of the marine world 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.640
 Today we have to thank Carlos 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.529
 morals by sending your aquarium lives 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.939
 in the state of veracruz and currently 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.580
 is studying for technical in 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.829
 aquaculture in high school and subsequently 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.180
 for aquaculture engineer and we 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.130
 says that it is the study of 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.410
 aquatic organisms in an environment 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.000
 controlled as for fish tanks ponds 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.219
 for the purpose of reproduction and others 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.930
 objectives tells us that since 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.540
 has memory has always had fish tanks 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.460
 of freshwater recently started with 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.800
 marine aquariums did it with the foot 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.620
 left since it started with a fish tank 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.750
 of 14 liters and a tomato clown those who 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.940
 we have aquariums we know in the problem 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.920
 in which he got my recommendation for 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.620
 marine aquariums has always been 100 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.539
 liters onwards 100 liters for 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.360
 small and resistant species like 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:09.610
 they can be damsels clown fish 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.250
 dartfish or cardinals for species 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.230
 big and delicate I recommend aquariums 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.750
 from 200 liters as they can 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.210
 be surgeons crossbows angels 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.130
 butterflies etc. currently counts 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.530
 with a 180-liter tank with a 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.270
 filtering equipment more complete its 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.550
 filtering system is composed of 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.280
 the zoom containing 200 sock 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.050
 micron biospheres and a skimmer there 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.840
 number of questions that we get the 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.600
 social networks referring to whether the 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.369
 zoom and the skimmer are indispensable my 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.810
 answer has to be blunt to 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:45.070
 that there is no doubt they are absolutely 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.619
 indispensable in terms of lighting 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.750
 has t5 tubes with white light and blue light 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.850
 as for the inhabitants he has six 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.310
 different species of fish has a 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.860
 couple of clown fish tells us that 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.990
 they are very calm and that only makes 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.119
 some time one of them sick will be 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.770
 inflamed one eye and had to take out and 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.080
 medicate in a quarantine tank 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.030
 has a butterfly that is very fickle and 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.070
 the leader of the fish tank is believed to 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.050
 It bothered others but 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.510
 Now she is calmer and with him she is 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.380
 very playful has a crossbow niger 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.020
 that is very fast 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.330
 to the degree of fighting for food battle 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.880
 by feeding the anemone since the 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.740
 crossbow removes the shrimp even the 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.710
 crossbow is able to snatch the 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.140
 shrimp from the hands of Carlos also 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.210
 has a facebook tells us that it is one 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.950
 of their spoiled the most peaceful not 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.980
 he assaults no one and leads a life 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.990
 quiet without any problem just one 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.820
 once when he put the magnet for the first time 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.190
 to clean the fish tank got scared a lot 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.020
 It stuck in the side with a stone and 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.300
 some scales were raised 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.310
 shortly after healthy French angel and 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.020
 yellow surgeon to them acquired them 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.900
 not long ago in a expo called 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.640
 aquamar that was made in the port in 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.700
 which had the honor to participate as 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.690
 exhibitor in the pelagic area 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.460
 talking about the biology of 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.170
 Sardines acquired them at a very good price 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.270
 although at the beginning he had some 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.760
 problems with feeding since not 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.280
 they had appetite suffered a bit with this 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.350
 he stimulated them with artemia algae lettuce and 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.390
 thank god 'they both eat now very 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.130
 well the anemone is a with the ctc 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.170
 island feeds twice a week with 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.240
 camera a raw crystal has a color 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.650
 pink almost with the green tips of 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.689
 feeding gives them appearance 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.939
 in pellets flakes of two color tetra 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:26.860
 times per day nori seaweed or lettuce each 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:28.170
 third day something that happened to him was 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.310
 that the screamer's bomb slipped 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.890
 emptying the water from your filter and 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.780
 flooding your room now imagine this 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.640
 at four in the morning, well, I think 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.349
 this to several people that we have 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.150
 time in this we may sound familiar 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.189
 Of course I have also seen in 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.620
 early morning mopping my room and the 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:46.810
 reasons can be infinite that start 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.790
 from the breaking of a glass the leak 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.099
 of a pipe or in the case of carlos 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.290
 a badly placed bomb my question is 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:55.120
 why the fuck does this have to happen to 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.549
 midnight and good despite the 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.049
