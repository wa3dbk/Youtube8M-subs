very very careful about the leakages
that<00:01:06.420> they<00:01:06.570> use<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.250> never<00:01:08.250> recommend<00:01:08.700> to

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030

clarinet<00:01:09.510> plays<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.560> double<00:01:10.920> screw<00:01:11.840> leakages

clarinet plays the double screw leakages

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.499 
clarinet plays the double screw leakages
because<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.409> puts<00:01:13.650> too<00:01:13.860> much<00:01:13.890> pressure<00:01:14.100> on<00:01:14.820> the

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
because it puts too much pressure on the

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.760 
because it puts too much pressure on the
reed<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:16.590> Benny<00:01:17.100> Goodman<00:01:17.720> is<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:19.640> delightful

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
reed this Benny Goodman is a delightful

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.280 
reed this Benny Goodman is a delightful
piece<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.979> machinery<00:01:23.610> because<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.689> takes<00:01:25.020> the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
piece of machinery because it takes the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.440 
piece of machinery because it takes the
pressure<00:01:25.470> off<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.159> tip<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.610> reed<00:01:26.790> you

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
pressure off the tip of the reed you

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.510 
pressure off the tip of the reed you
only<00:01:27.630> have<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.049> one<00:01:28.229> screw<00:01:28.590> here<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.220> that's

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
only have the one screw here and that's

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.499 
only have the one screw here and that's
why<00:01:29.700> Benny<00:01:29.970> Goodman<00:01:30.360> liked<00:01:30.540> this<00:01:30.720> particular

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
why Benny Goodman liked this particular

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.210 
why Benny Goodman liked this particular
ligature<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.500> when<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.770> put<00:01:34.979> the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
ligature and so when you put the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.520 
ligature and so when you put the
mouthpiece<00:01:35.850> together<00:01:36.840> with<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.290> reed

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
mouthpiece together with the reed

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.789 
mouthpiece together with the reed
there's<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.640> lot<00:01:38.970> less<00:01:39.240> pressure<00:01:39.479> pushed<00:01:40.049> on<00:01:40.409> to

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
there's a lot less pressure pushed on to

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.160 
there's a lot less pressure pushed on to
this<00:01:41.430> part<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.119> linkages<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:43.020> the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
this part of the linkages so that the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.069 
this part of the linkages so that the
reed<00:01:43.409> tip<00:01:43.770> will<00:01:44.430> vibrate<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.299> one<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
reed tip will vibrate and one of the

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.100

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
secrets of good clarinet sound is to

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.899 
secrets of good clarinet sound is to
make<00:01:49.290> sure<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:50.130> have<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.490> tip<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.820> the

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
make sure that you have the tip of the

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.109 
make sure that you have the tip of the
reed<00:01:51.060> vibrating<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.439> with<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:52.890> particular

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
reed vibrating and with this particular

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.719 
reed vibrating and with this particular
excellent<00:01:54.119> ligature<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:55.049> will<00:01:55.290> do<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.549> if

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
excellent ligature it will do so so if

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.310 
excellent ligature it will do so so if
you're<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:56.969> clarinetist<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.810> you're<00:01:57.990> looking
