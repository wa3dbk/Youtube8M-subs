macros<00:00:16.289> from<00:00:16.440> this<00:00:16.650> video<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.220> put<00:00:17.580> them<00:00:17.730> to

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
macros from this video and put them to

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.240 
macros from this video and put them to
good<00:00:17.940> use

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
good use

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.650 
good use
so<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.340> first<00:00:20.550> set<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.760> macros<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.449> use

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
so the first set of macros that I use

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.859 
so the first set of macros that I use
our<00:00:21.900> arena<00:00:22.410> focus<00:00:22.949> macros<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.760> very<00:00:24.240> basic<00:00:24.480> but

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
our arena focus macros a very basic but

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.080 
our arena focus macros a very basic but
efficient<00:00:25.380> macros<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.340> next<00:00:26.609> macro<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.060> I

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
efficient macros the next macro that I

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.679 
efficient macros the next macro that I
use<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.630> my<00:00:28.050> gargoyle<00:00:28.560> macro<00:00:29.039> this<00:00:29.939> uses<00:00:30.480> my

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
use is my gargoyle macro this uses my

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.170 
use is my gargoyle macro this uses my
own<00:00:30.869> huge<00:00:31.199> trinket<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.859> then<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.640> summons<00:00:33.030> my

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
own huge trinket and then it summons my

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.770 
own huge trinket and then it summons my
gargoyle

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
gargoyle

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.069 
gargoyle
I<00:00:34.010> also<00:00:35.010> incorporated<00:00:35.760> pet<00:00:36.030> follow<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.780> pet

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
I also incorporated pet follow and pet

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.680 
I also incorporated pet follow and pet
attack<00:00:37.469> into<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.640> basically<00:00:39.059> allows<00:00:39.239> me

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
attack into it this basically allows me

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.569 
attack into it this basically allows me
to<00:00:39.809> control<00:00:40.200> my<00:00:40.379> pet<00:00:40.710> with<00:00:40.950> this<00:00:41.160> single

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
to control my pet with this single

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.720 
to control my pet with this single
button<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.570> when<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:42.840> have<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> target<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.430> will

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
button so when I have a target it will

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.540 
button so when I have a target it will
tell<00:00:45.239> my<00:00:45.390> pet<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.809> attack<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.320> when<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.160> when<00:00:47.520> I

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
tell my pet to attack it when and when I

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.520 
tell my pet to attack it when and when I
don't<00:00:47.879> have<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.090> target<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.750> will<00:00:48.960> command<00:00:49.379> my

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
don't have a target it will command my

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.220 
don't have a target it will command my
pet<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:50.070> follow<00:00:50.309> me<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:51.629> works<00:00:51.870> for<00:00:52.170> both

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
pet to follow me and this works for both

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.439 
pet to follow me and this works for both
my<00:00:52.620> gargoyle<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.340> my<00:00:53.520> ghoul<00:00:53.820> next<00:00:54.329> you're

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
my gargoyle and my ghoul next you're

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.119 
my gargoyle and my ghoul next you're
gonna<00:00:54.539> need<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.780> macro<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.199> turn<00:00:55.440> your<00:00:55.590> claw<00:00:55.860> off

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
gonna need a macro to turn your claw off

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.670 
gonna need a macro to turn your claw off
and<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:57.000> reason<00:00:57.300> for<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.930> your<00:00:58.469> pet

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
and the reason for this is your pet

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.069 
and the reason for this is your pet
works<00:00:58.859> off<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.100> energy<00:00:59.670> since<00:01:00.300> your<00:01:00.480> pet<00:01:00.780> has

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
works off of energy since your pet has

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.500 
works off of energy since your pet has
cloth<00:01:01.500> auto<00:01:01.890> cast<00:01:02.280> on<00:01:02.550> its<00:01:02.969> gonna<00:01:03.090> be<00:01:03.300> using

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
cloth auto cast on its gonna be using

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.890 
cloth auto cast on its gonna be using
every<00:01:03.809> 40<00:01:04.290> energy<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:05.159> cloth<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.630> what<00:01:06.780> you

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
every 40 energy on cloth so what you

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.840 
every 40 energy on cloth so what you
need<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.140> do<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.770> need<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.950> turn<00:01:08.220> cloth<00:01:08.640> off

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
need to do is you need to turn cloth off

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.090 
need to do is you need to turn cloth off
when<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.360> want<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.630> stun<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.680> basically

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
when you want to stun this basically

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.950 
when you want to stun this basically
ensures<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.909> stun<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.240> gonna<00:01:12.390> go<00:01:12.600> off<00:01:12.780> on

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
ensures that the stun is gonna go off on

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.390 
ensures that the stun is gonna go off on
command<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.770> you're<00:01:13.890> not<00:01:14.010> gonna<00:01:14.130> have<00:01:14.310> to

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
command and you're not gonna have to

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.070 
command and you're not gonna have to
wait<00:01:14.580> for<00:01:14.790> your<00:01:14.909> pets<00:01:15.119> dirty<00:01:15.390> energy<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.930> come

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
wait for your pets dirty energy to come

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.020 
wait for your pets dirty energy to come
back<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.860> when<00:01:17.009> turning<00:01:17.220> cloth<00:01:17.490> off<00:01:17.700> you're

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
back so when turning cloth off you're

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.880 
back so when turning cloth off you're
gonna<00:01:18.150> need<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.570> way<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.869> turn<00:01:19.110> claw<00:01:19.409> back<00:01:19.650> on

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
gonna need a way to turn claw back on

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.710 
gonna need a way to turn claw back on
because<00:01:20.280> if<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.490> have<00:01:20.610> claw<00:01:20.880> permanently<00:01:21.509> off

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
because if you have claw permanently off

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.020 
because if you have claw permanently off
your<00:01:22.380> pet<00:01:22.619> damage<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.220> going<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.460> be<00:01:23.580> extremely

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
your pet damage is going to be extremely

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.390 
your pet damage is going to be extremely
weak<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:24.930> into<00:01:25.259> my<00:01:25.380> dark<00:01:25.650> transformation

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
weak so into my dark transformation

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.270 
weak so into my dark transformation
macro<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.060> incorporated<00:01:27.840> claw<00:01:28.259> on<00:01:28.530> your<00:01:29.070> dark

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
macro I incorporated claw on your dark

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.060 
macro I incorporated claw on your dark
transformation<00:01:30.180> button<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.990> often<00:01:31.470> dead<00:01:31.770> and

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
transformation button is often dead and

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.190 
transformation button is often dead and
what<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.280> mean<00:01:32.520> by<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:33.150> when<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.750> click<00:01:34.049> it

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
what I mean by that is when you click it

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.710 
what I mean by that is when you click it
nothing's<00:01:34.619> gonna<00:01:34.799> happen<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.880> it's<00:01:36.299> basically

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
nothing's gonna happen so it's basically

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.870 
nothing's gonna happen so it's basically
a<00:01:36.810> free<00:01:37.200> button<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.770> macro<00:01:38.130> things<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.640> and

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
a free button to macro things to and

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.060 
a free button to macro things to and
that<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.360> why<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.540> also<00:01:39.930> have<00:01:40.439> canceled<00:01:40.950> our

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
that is why I also have canceled our

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.280 
that is why I also have canceled our
hand<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.579> protection<00:01:41.810> incorporated<00:01:42.810> into<00:01:42.990> it

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
hand of protection incorporated into it

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.340 
hand of protection incorporated into it
I<00:01:43.439> then<00:01:43.920> have<00:01:44.159> target<00:01:44.939> arena<00:01:45.299> for<00:01:45.869> chains<00:01:46.170> of

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
I then have target arena for chains of

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.770 
I then have target arena for chains of
ice<00:01:46.500> this<00:01:47.070> just<00:01:47.340> allows<00:01:47.579> me<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.909> quickly<00:01:48.060> slow

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
ice this just allows me to quickly slow
