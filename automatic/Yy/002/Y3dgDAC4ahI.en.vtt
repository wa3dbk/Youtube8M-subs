00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
promotions will go crazy I think during

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.060

the<00:01:11.820> promotion<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:13.049> greatest<00:01:13.770> thing<00:01:13.950> is

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
the promotion the greatest thing is

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.740 
the promotion the greatest thing is
roaming<00:01:14.400> around<00:01:14.460> like<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:14.759> is<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.540> city

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.950 
roaming around like this is in the city
I<00:01:16.560> thought<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.640> gonna<00:01:17.790> be<00:01:17.909> only<00:01:18.030> for<00:01:18.810> one

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
I thought this is gonna be only for one

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.780 
I thought this is gonna be only for one
day<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.140> shooting<00:01:19.439> but<00:01:19.710> eventually<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.640> kind

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
day of shooting but eventually it kind

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.969 
day of shooting but eventually it kind
of<00:01:20.970> lingered<00:01:21.390> on<00:01:21.509> I've<00:01:22.170> traveled<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:22.650> local

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.090 
trains in this looking like a freak in
the<00:01:25.380> film<00:01:25.649> but<00:01:26.340> what<00:01:26.990> everyone<00:01:27.990> has<00:01:28.259> seen<00:01:29.009> me

the film but what everyone has seen me
bad<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.460> think<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.790> laziest<00:01:30.120> thing<00:01:30.479> I

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
bad this I think the laziest thing I

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.510 
bad this I think the laziest thing I
think<00:01:31.020> they'll<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.229> lot<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:31.950> lazy<00:01:32.130> things<00:01:32.430> that

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
think they'll a lot of lazy things that

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.670 
think they'll a lot of lazy things that
I<00:01:32.580> do<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.940> think<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:33.960> song<00:01:34.260> is<00:01:34.440> a<00:01:34.470> tribute

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
I do I think this this song is a tribute

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.790 
I do I think this this song is a tribute
to<00:01:35.450> practically<00:01:36.450> all<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.630> men<00:01:36.870> you<00:01:37.680> know

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
after a hard day's work

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.039 
after a hard day's work
we<00:01:39.630> like<00:01:39.810> back<00:01:40.200> home<00:01:40.440> and<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:41.540> act<00:01:42.540> back<00:01:42.780> home

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
around

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.300 
around
I<00:01:48.840> didn't<00:01:49.380> men<00:01:49.500> are<00:01:49.620> very<00:01:49.770> good<00:01:49.920> at<00:01:50.010> doing<00:01:50.190> that

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
I didn't men are very good at doing that

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.590 
I didn't men are very good at doing that
so<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.090> think<00:01:51.150> it's<00:01:51.390> tribute<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.870> all<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.080> us

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
so I think it's tribute to all of us

00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:13.120 
so I think it's tribute to all of us
