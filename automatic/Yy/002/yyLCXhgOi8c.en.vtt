00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.710
 celebrating on% and that of alstom 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:11.279
 so this spot in celebration is a submarine 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:17.070
 tone is mounted between this source 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.220

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.159

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.550
 these two buildings 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:33.660
 then to put to taste 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.940
 alas not to have jumped to specific fact 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.570

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.180

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.400
 so that jumped about promised and this to go 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.400

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.830
 then because if we remember 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.740

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.080

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.450
 fixity on am here 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.510

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.570
 10 inches 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.850
 by the way 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.130
 you really do not have to hurry to london 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.690
 so once take your weapons 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.800
 in this sense the right spot 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.800
 it was all here 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.780
 through the windows 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.780
