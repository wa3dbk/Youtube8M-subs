this is my new weather station the

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.470 
this is my new weather station the
ambient<00:00:03.000> weather<00:00:03.240> WS<00:00:04.160> 2080<00:00:05.160> it<00:00:06.029> took<00:00:06.240> me<00:00:06.359> about

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
the wind direction all these things you

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.959 
the wind direction all these things you
just<00:00:12.660> put<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.049> little<00:00:13.139> bolt<00:00:14.009> on<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.519> bottom<00:00:14.849> of

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
just put a little bolt on the bottom of

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.210 
just put a little bolt on the bottom of
it<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.540> connected<00:00:16.320> here<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.590> put<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.949> bolt

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
it and and connected here and put a bolt

it and and connected here and put a bolt
on<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.550> wind<00:00:17.960> speed<00:00:18.960> thing<00:00:19.470> here<00:00:19.770> this<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.460> the

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
on the wind speed thing here this is the

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.970 
on the wind speed thing here this is the
the<00:00:21.150> rain<00:00:21.359> gauge<00:00:21.689> right<00:00:21.960> here<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:22.650> rain

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
the rain gauge right here this rain

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.519 
the rain gauge right here this rain
gauge<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.460> so<00:00:23.760> accurate<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.630> was<00:00:24.930> shocked<00:00:25.350> at

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
gauge is so accurate I was shocked at

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.470 
gauge is so accurate I was shocked at
how<00:00:25.560> accurate<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.189> was<00:00:26.340> it's<00:00:26.970> got<00:00:27.150> like<00:00:27.330> a

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
how accurate it was it's got like a

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.980 
how accurate it was it's got like a
little<00:00:27.510> scale<00:00:28.500> he's<00:00:29.160> got<00:00:29.340> like<00:00:29.490> two<00:00:29.760> little

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
little scale he's got like two little

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.630 
little scale he's got like two little
things<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.170> collect<00:00:31.320> water<00:00:31.679> well<00:00:32.070> it's<00:00:32.489> got

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
things to collect water well it's got

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.970 
things to collect water well it's got
one<00:00:32.820> big<00:00:33.030> collection<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.750> water<00:00:33.960> here<00:00:34.260> but<00:00:34.860> it

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
one big collection of water here but it

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.520 
one big collection of water here but it
fills<00:00:35.430> up<00:00:35.579> one<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.120> them<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.989> clicks<00:00:37.350> when

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
fills up one of them and it clicks when

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.990 
fills up one of them and it clicks when
it<00:00:37.649> does<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.129> then<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.460> fills<00:00:38.640> up<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.879> other

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
it does and then it fills up the other

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.459 
it does and then it fills up the other
one<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.329> clicks<00:00:39.600> well<00:00:39.780> going<00:00:39.989> like<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:40.320> so

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
one it clicks well going like this so

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.530 
one it clicks well going like this so
each<00:00:40.649> time<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:41.010> clicks<00:00:41.280> its<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:42.030> adds<00:00:42.270> one

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
each time it clicks its it adds one

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.229 
each time it clicks its it adds one
hundredth<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:42.989> an<00:00:43.110> inch<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.440> rain<00:00:44.090> and<00:00:45.090> then

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
hundredth of an inch of rain and then

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.200 
hundredth of an inch of rain and then
everything<00:00:45.660> just<00:00:45.960> plugs<00:00:46.260> right<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:47.210> this

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
everything just plugs right in to this

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.520 
everything just plugs right in to this
is<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:49.370> kind<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.520> brains<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.149> there

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
is the kind of the brains of it there

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.850 
is the kind of the brains of it there
the<00:00:53.510> broadcasting<00:00:54.510> radio<00:00:54.989> broadcasting<00:00:55.710> this

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
the broadcasting radio broadcasting this

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.549 
the broadcasting radio broadcasting this
is<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.160> thermometer<00:00:56.809> hygrometer<00:00:57.809> combo<00:00:58.350> and

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
is the thermometer hygrometer combo and

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.139 
is the thermometer hygrometer combo and
everything<00:00:59.100> just<00:00:59.219> kind<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.460> plugs<00:00:59.699> into<00:00:59.969> this

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
everything just kind of plugs into this

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.810 
everything just kind of plugs into this
this<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.930> like<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.140> weather<00:01:01.469> shield<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:02.640> keep

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
this is like a weather shield to keep

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.609 
this is like a weather shield to keep
the<00:01:02.969> Sun<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:05.689> use<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.810> Sun<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.229> stuff<00:01:07.380> off<00:01:07.590> of

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
the Sun and use the Sun and stuff off of

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.560 
the Sun and use the Sun and stuff off of
everything<00:01:08.400> keeps<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.420> right

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
everything keeps it the right

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.300 
everything keeps it the right
temperature<00:01:10.049> although<00:01:10.470> they<00:01:10.740> do<00:01:10.799> sell<00:01:11.130> an

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
temperature although they do sell an

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.580 
temperature although they do sell an
upgrade<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.060> which<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.049> bigger<00:01:13.320> one

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
upgrade to this which is a bigger one

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.859 
upgrade to this which is a bigger one
that<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.159> have<00:01:14.580> noticed<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:14.970> when<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.360> Sun<00:01:15.659> in

that I have noticed that when the Sun in
the<00:01:15.960> afternoon<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:17.009> does<00:01:17.280> read<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.549> little

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
the afternoon this does read a little

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.450 
the afternoon this does read a little
higher<00:01:18.119> in<00:01:18.509> temperature<00:01:19.340> everything<00:01:20.340> is

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
higher in temperature everything is

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.539 
higher in temperature everything is

this<00:01:38.640> has<00:01:38.790> got<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.150> barometer<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.200> shows

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
this has got the barometer and it shows

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.410 
this has got the barometer and it shows
you<00:01:40.500> either<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.890> last<00:01:41.250> 12<00:01:41.610> hours<00:01:41.759> or<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.240> last

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
you either the last 12 hours or the last

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.690 
you either the last 12 hours or the last
24<00:01:42.930> hours<00:01:42.960> whichever<00:01:43.530> however<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.460> want<00:01:44.640> it

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
24 hours whichever however you want it

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.429 
24 hours whichever however you want it
to<00:01:44.880> look<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.329> then<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:45.930> tells<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.259> it's

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
to look and then this tells you it's

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.800 
to look and then this tells you it's
getting<00:01:46.649> cloudy<00:01:46.920> because<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:48.090> barometer<00:01:48.750> is

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
getting cloudy because the barometer is

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.080 
getting cloudy because the barometer is
going<00:01:49.049> down<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.409> gives<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.680> like<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.860> little

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
going down it gives you like a little

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.639 
going down it gives you like a little
weather<00:01:51.090> prediction<00:01:51.810> which<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.439> pretty

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
weather prediction which is pretty

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.560 
weather prediction which is pretty
