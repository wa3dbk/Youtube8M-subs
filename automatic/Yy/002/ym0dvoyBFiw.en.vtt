before<00:01:52.810> you<00:01:52.990> buy<00:01:53.259> them<00:01:53.499> and<00:01:53.679> how<00:01:54.099> you<00:01:54.130> can

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
before you buy them and how you can

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.489 
before you buy them and how you can
distinguish<00:01:54.880> between<00:01:54.999> the<00:01:55.749> fake<00:01:55.929> one<00:01:56.139> and<00:01:56.349> the

00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:56.499 
distinguish between the fake one and the

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:58.800 
distinguish between the fake one and the
gen<00:01:56.649> one<00:01:56.829> so<00:01:57.369> we<00:01:57.520> have<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:57.909> genuine<00:01:58.419> one<00:01:58.569> over

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
gen one so we have the genuine one over

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.419 
gen one so we have the genuine one over
here<00:01:58.990> which<00:01:59.289> looks<00:01:59.529> like<00:01:59.679> this<00:02:00.009> and<00:02:00.249> we<00:02:00.399> have

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
here which looks like this and we have

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:02.669 
here which looks like this and we have
the<00:02:00.700> fake<00:02:00.880> one<00:02:01.119> over<00:02:01.329> here<00:02:01.509> which<00:02:02.020> also<00:02:02.439> looks

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
the fake one over here which also looks

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.649 
the fake one over here which also looks
like<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:03.039> same<00:02:03.249> so<00:02:03.759> in<00:02:03.880> terms<00:02:04.119> of<00:02:04.209> the<00:02:04.270> kind<00:02:04.509> of

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
like the same so in terms of the kind of

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.089 
like the same so in terms of the kind of
duplication<00:02:05.139> they<00:02:05.439> have<00:02:05.649> done<00:02:05.829> they<00:02:06.069> have

00:02:06.089 --> 00:02:06.099 
duplication they have done they have

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:08.279 
duplication they have done they have
made<00:02:06.429> sure<00:02:06.609> that<00:02:06.819> both<00:02:07.329> of<00:02:07.389> these<00:02:07.659> cables<00:02:08.080> will

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
made sure that both of these cables will

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.650 
made sure that both of these cables will
look<00:02:08.590> good<00:02:08.830> but<00:02:09.310> you<00:02:09.340> can<00:02:09.729> easily<00:02:10.179> notice<00:02:10.390> the

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
look good but you can easily notice the

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.530 
look good but you can easily notice the
difference<00:02:11.020> if<00:02:11.170> you<00:02:11.319> actually<00:02:11.709> keep<00:02:11.980> them

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
difference if you actually keep them

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.699 
difference if you actually keep them
side-by-side<00:02:13.540> you<00:02:13.780> can<00:02:14.319> notice<00:02:14.680> the

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
side-by-side you can notice the

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.290 
side-by-side you can notice the
difference<00:02:14.830> in<00:02:15.280> between<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.730> metals<00:02:16.060> which

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
difference in between the metals which

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.050 
difference in between the metals which
have<00:02:16.330> been<00:02:16.690> used<00:02:16.930> on<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.800> fake<00:02:18.160> one<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.580> the

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
have been used on the fake one and the

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.550 
have been used on the fake one and the
material<00:02:19.390> which<00:02:19.510> has<00:02:19.720> been<00:02:19.750> used<00:02:19.930> over<00:02:20.230> here

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
material which has been used over here

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.410 
material which has been used over here
as<00:02:20.709> far<00:02:21.280> as<00:02:21.370> metal<00:02:21.700> is<00:02:21.790> concerned<00:02:22.180> on<00:02:22.360> the

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
as far as metal is concerned on the

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.420 
as far as metal is concerned on the
genuine<00:02:22.840> one<00:02:23.020> and<00:02:23.260> if<00:02:23.680> you<00:02:23.800> actually<00:02:24.130> hold

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
genuine one and if you actually hold

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.490 
genuine one and if you actually hold
them<00:02:24.610> side-by-side<00:02:24.910> you<00:02:25.360> can<00:02:25.570> easily<00:02:25.960> notice

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
them side-by-side you can easily notice

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.430 
them side-by-side you can easily notice
that<00:02:26.950> the

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
that the

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.640 
that the
which<00:02:28.040> is<00:02:28.250> there<00:02:28.720> which<00:02:29.720> supports<00:02:30.170> this<00:02:30.350> part

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
which is there which supports this part

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.180 
which is there which supports this part
and<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.070> cable<00:02:31.460> is<00:02:31.610> actually<00:02:32.390> much<00:02:32.980> high<00:02:33.980> in

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
and the cable is actually much high in

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.880 
and the cable is actually much high in
terms<00:02:34.370> of<00:02:34.550> the<00:02:34.610> weight<00:02:34.730> much<00:02:35.360> much<00:02:36.230> material<00:02:36.770> a

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
terms of the weight much much material a

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.500 
terms of the weight much much material a
rigid<00:02:37.310> material<00:02:37.790> a<00:02:37.910> stronger<00:02:38.360> material

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
rigid material a stronger material

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.290 
rigid material a stronger material
whether<00:02:39.230> this<00:02:39.530> one<00:02:39.710> is<00:02:39.830> kind<00:02:40.130> of<00:02:40.220> light<00:02:40.610> thin

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
whether this one is kind of light thin

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.910 
whether this one is kind of light thin
material<00:02:41.750> which<00:02:41.900> they<00:02:42.140> have<00:02:42.290> actually<00:02:42.680> used

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
material which they have actually used

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.860 
material which they have actually used
and<00:02:43.130> this<00:02:43.640> thing<00:02:43.820> this<00:02:44.120> thing<00:02:44.180> you<00:02:44.450> can<00:02:44.600> feel

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
and this thing this thing you can feel

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.690 
and this thing this thing you can feel
once<00:02:45.140> you<00:02:45.200> press<00:02:45.530> it<00:02:45.680> with<00:02:45.890> your<00:02:46.040> nail<00:02:46.250> or<00:02:46.490> with

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
once you press it with your nail or with

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.250 
once you press it with your nail or with
your<00:02:46.820> finger<00:02:47.150> you<00:02:47.300> can<00:02:47.450> actually<00:02:47.570> find<00:02:47.960> it<00:02:48.110> out

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
your finger you can actually find it out

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.200 
your finger you can actually find it out
and<00:02:48.470> again<00:02:48.980> this<00:02:49.130> is<00:02:49.280> always<00:02:49.490> going<00:02:49.820> to<00:02:49.910> be<00:02:50.090> the

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
and again this is always going to be the

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.780 
and again this is always going to be the
longer<00:02:50.540> so<00:02:50.990> if<00:02:51.860> it<00:02:52.100> is<00:02:52.220> going<00:02:52.430> to<00:02:52.610> be<00:02:52.700> the

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
longer so if it is going to be the

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.210 
longer so if it is going to be the
longer<00:02:53.060> that<00:02:53.240> we<00:02:53.390> use<00:02:53.510> it<00:02:53.660> is<00:02:53.690> also<00:02:53.990> a<00:02:54.500> genuine

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
longer that we use it is also a genuine

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.070 
longer that we use it is also a genuine
one<00:02:55.370> but<00:02:55.580> again<00:02:55.850> it<00:02:56.000> does<00:02:56.240> not<00:02:56.390> apply<00:02:56.690> all<00:02:56.960> the

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
one but again it does not apply all the

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.020 
one but again it does not apply all the
time<00:02:57.290> you<00:02:57.740> might<00:02:57.950> have<00:02:58.220> this<00:02:58.430> part<00:02:58.700> is<00:02:58.880> for

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
time you might have this part is for

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.300 
time you might have this part is for
longer<00:02:59.420> so<00:02:59.900> again<00:03:00.350> this<00:03:00.680> part<00:03:00.980> is<00:03:01.100> something

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
longer so again this part is something

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.690 
longer so again this part is something
with<00:03:01.850> which<00:03:01.880> you<00:03:02.240> cannot<00:03:02.860> identify<00:03:03.860> most<00:03:04.520> of

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
with which you cannot identify most of

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.390 
with which you cannot identify most of
the<00:03:04.760> time<00:03:05.000> whether<00:03:05.630> the<00:03:06.020> fake<00:03:06.830> one<00:03:07.070> is<00:03:07.220> this

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
the time whether the fake one is this

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.730 
the time whether the fake one is this
one<00:03:07.640> or<00:03:07.880> this<00:03:08.030> one<00:03:08.090> is<00:03:08.630> this<00:03:08.780> one<00:03:08.840> you<00:03:09.470> cannot

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
one or this one is this one you cannot

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.650 
one or this one is this one you cannot
actually<00:03:09.950> make<00:03:10.340> out<00:03:10.490> the<00:03:10.640> difference<00:03:10.730> but<00:03:11.450> the

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
actually make out the difference but the

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.120 
actually make out the difference but the
major<00:03:11.840> difference<00:03:11.990> is<00:03:12.530> actually<00:03:12.920> being

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
major difference is actually being

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.310 
major difference is actually being
noticed<00:03:13.550> on<00:03:13.730> this<00:03:14.360> end<00:03:14.570> which<00:03:15.020> is<00:03:15.170> the

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
noticed on this end which is the

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.830 
noticed on this end which is the
lightening<00:03:15.740> in<00:03:15.860> so<00:03:16.430> over<00:03:16.640> here<00:03:16.880> we<00:03:17.360> have<00:03:17.600> both

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
lightening in so over here we have both

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.110 
lightening in so over here we have both
of<00:03:17.870> these<00:03:18.110> cables<00:03:18.560> and<00:03:18.740> as<00:03:19.010> if<00:03:19.190> now<00:03:19.340> I<00:03:19.370> can<00:03:19.670> show

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
of these cables and as if now I can show

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.030 
of these cables and as if now I can show
you<00:03:20.180> that<00:03:20.780> this<00:03:20.990> is<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.320> genuine<00:03:21.620> one<00:03:21.830> and

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
you that this is the genuine one and

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.850 
you that this is the genuine one and
this<00:03:22.190> is<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.430> fake<00:03:22.610> one<00:03:22.640> and<00:03:23.240> if<00:03:23.360> I<00:03:23.570> move<00:03:24.500> them

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
this is the fake one and if I move them

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.760 
this is the fake one and if I move them
very<00:03:24.890> closer<00:03:25.580> to<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:25.880> camera<00:03:26.120> lens<00:03:26.510> and<00:03:26.770> let

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
very closer to the camera lens and let

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.030 
very closer to the camera lens and let
me<00:03:27.920> just<00:03:27.950> focus<00:03:28.220> them<00:03:29.470> so<00:03:30.470> now<00:03:30.620> they<00:03:30.860> are<00:03:30.920> in

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
me just focus them so now they are in

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.100 
me just focus them so now they are in
focus<00:03:31.220> and<00:03:31.670> now<00:03:31.970> as<00:03:32.240> you<00:03:32.390> can<00:03:32.570> see<00:03:32.810> if<00:03:32.990> you

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
focus and now as you can see if you

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.830 
focus and now as you can see if you
notice<00:03:33.590> both<00:03:34.400> of<00:03:34.459> these<00:03:34.640> lightning<00:03:35.480> cable

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
notice both of these lightning cable

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.980 
notice both of these lightning cable
this<00:03:36.470> cable<00:03:36.800> over<00:03:37.580> here<00:03:37.850> which<00:03:38.209> has<00:03:38.240> the<00:03:38.690> metal

whereas<00:03:51.950> on<00:03:52.160> this<00:03:52.550> cable<00:03:53.000> which<00:03:53.180> is<00:03:53.209> the<00:03:53.450> fake

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
whereas on this cable which is the fake

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.180 
whereas on this cable which is the fake
one<00:03:53.930> you<00:03:54.140> can<00:03:54.709> easily<00:03:55.370> notice<00:03:55.580> the<00:03:56.209> joint

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
one you can easily notice the joint

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.160 
one you can easily notice the joint
which<00:03:58.190> is<00:03:58.220> there<00:03:58.750> indicated<00:03:59.750> with<00:03:59.900> the<00:03:59.959> line

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
which is there indicated with the line

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.199 
which is there indicated with the line
that<00:04:00.860> you<00:04:01.010> have<00:04:01.040> a<00:04:01.220> different<00:04:01.640> material<00:04:01.790> over

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
that you have a different material over

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.640 
that you have a different material over
here<00:04:02.390> and<00:04:02.570> you<00:04:02.900> have<00:04:03.080> a<00:04:03.110> different<00:04:03.290> material

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
here and you have a different material

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.979 
here and you have a different material
on<00:04:04.040> the<00:04:04.190> edges<00:04:04.520> and<00:04:04.700> this<00:04:05.239> is<00:04:05.420> something<00:04:05.780> which

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
on the edges and this is something which

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.780 
on the edges and this is something which
will<00:04:06.230> help<00:04:06.380> you<00:04:06.590> identify<00:04:06.709> that<00:04:07.400> this<00:04:07.610> is<00:04:07.760> a

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
will help you identify that this is a

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.420 
will help you identify that this is a
fake<00:04:08.120> one<00:04:08.360> and<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:09.110> genuine<00:04:09.470> genuine<00:04:10.190> one

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
fake one and the genuine genuine one

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.760 
fake one and the genuine genuine one
will<00:04:10.640> always<00:04:11.120> look<00:04:11.330> like<00:04:11.360> this<00:04:11.750> there<00:04:12.590> is<00:04:12.739> a

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
will always look like this there is a

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.370 
will always look like this there is a
page<00:04:13.190> on<00:04:13.459> the<00:04:13.640> Apple<00:04:13.880> website<00:04:14.060> as<00:04:14.510> well<00:04:14.750> and<00:04:14.930> I

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
page on the Apple website as well and I

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.620 
page on the Apple website as well and I
we<00:04:15.800> are<00:04:15.920> going<00:04:16.160> to<00:04:16.340> write<00:04:16.489> a<00:04:16.520> post<00:04:16.940> as<00:04:17.150> well<00:04:17.209> on

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
we are going to write a post as well on

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.349 
we are going to write a post as well on
this<00:04:17.810> so<00:04:18.470> there<00:04:19.310> are<00:04:19.340> some<00:04:19.609> images<00:04:20.090> of<00:04:20.120> the

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
this so there are some images of the

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.540 
this so there are some images of the
fake<00:04:20.630> lightning<00:04:21.109> cable<00:04:21.470> and<00:04:21.620> the<00:04:22.190> kind<00:04:22.430> of

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
fake lightning cable and the kind of

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.310 
fake lightning cable and the kind of
shape<00:04:22.820> they<00:04:23.030> have<00:04:23.180> the<00:04:23.390> kind<00:04:23.630> of<00:04:23.750> design<00:04:24.080> they

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
shape they have the kind of design they

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.990 
shape they have the kind of design they
have<00:04:24.350> with<00:04:25.130> which<00:04:25.340> you<00:04:25.520> can<00:04:25.669> actually

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
have with which you can actually

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.850 
have with which you can actually
identify<00:04:26.120> which<00:04:26.750> one<00:04:26.930> is<00:04:27.110> fake<00:04:27.290> and<00:04:27.560> which<00:04:27.680> one

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
identify which one is fake and which one

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.820 
identify which one is fake and which one
is<00:04:28.010> genuine<00:04:28.400> so<00:04:28.970> on<00:04:29.300> as<00:04:29.750> of<00:04:30.020> now<00:04:30.230> the<00:04:30.290> current

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
is genuine so on as of now the current

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.250 
is genuine so on as of now the current
fake<00:04:31.340> lightning<00:04:31.850> cable<00:04:32.150> which<00:04:32.300> we<00:04:32.480> have<00:04:32.690> you

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
fake lightning cable which we have you

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.810 
fake lightning cable which we have you
can<00:04:33.470> easily<00:04:33.950> notice<00:04:34.130> the<00:04:34.400> differences<00:04:34.970> in

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
can easily notice the differences in

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.810 
can easily notice the differences in
between<00:04:35.970> these<00:04:36.210> two<00:04:36.540> with<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.530> help<00:04:37.740> of<00:04:37.920> this

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
between these two with the help of this

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.910 
between these two with the help of this
part<00:04:39.270> over<00:04:39.450> here<00:04:39.570> which<00:04:40.080> is<00:04:40.230> actually<00:04:40.590> in<00:04:40.710> two

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
part over here which is actually in two

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.520 
part over here which is actually in two
parts<00:04:41.360> this<00:04:42.360> metal<00:04:42.720> and<00:04:42.870> this<00:04:43.080> part<00:04:43.350> is

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
parts this metal and this part is

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.890 
parts this metal and this part is
actually<00:04:43.680> two<00:04:44.280> parts<00:04:44.700> whereas<00:04:45.390> on<00:04:45.510> this<00:04:45.690> one

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
actually two parts whereas on this one

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.870 
actually two parts whereas on this one
if<00:04:46.050> you<00:04:46.170> actually<00:04:46.530> take<00:04:46.710> a<00:04:46.740> closer<00:04:47.100> look<00:04:47.220> this

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
if you actually take a closer look this

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.700 
if you actually take a closer look this
is<00:04:48.030> one<00:04:48.390> single<00:04:48.660> piece<00:04:48.960> of<00:04:49.020> metal<00:04:49.320> which<00:04:49.680> is

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
is one single piece of metal which is

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.570 
is one single piece of metal which is
being<00:04:50.040> made<00:04:50.340> to<00:04:50.610> work<00:04:51.600> and<00:04:51.840> this<00:04:52.740> is<00:04:52.890> a<00:04:53.070> much

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
being made to work and this is a much

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.400 
being made to work and this is a much
better<00:04:53.790> build<00:04:54.120> quality<00:04:54.330> as<00:04:54.630> well<00:04:54.810> if<00:04:54.990> you<00:04:55.200> take

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
better build quality as well if you take

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.500 
better build quality as well if you take
a<00:04:55.470> look<00:04:55.770> on<00:04:55.980> these<00:04:56.490> cables<00:04:56.910> from<00:04:57.000> this<00:04:57.240> and<00:04:57.420> you

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
a look on these cables from this and you

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.660 
a look on these cables from this and you
can<00:04:57.690> notice<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:58.260> difference<00:04:58.290> that<00:04:58.710> the<00:04:59.430> kind

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
can notice the difference that the kind

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:00.920 
can notice the difference that the kind
of<00:04:59.790> material<00:05:00.150> which<00:05:00.270> has<00:05:00.450> been<00:05:00.600> used<00:05:00.750> over

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
of material which has been used over

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.050 
of material which has been used over
here<00:05:01.050> and<00:05:01.410> over<00:05:01.710> here<00:05:01.740> is<00:05:02.190> kind<00:05:02.670> of<00:05:02.790> different

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
here and over here is kind of different

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.120 
here and over here is kind of different
but<00:05:03.750> again<00:05:03.870> that<00:05:04.350> is<00:05:04.530> something<00:05:04.860> which<00:05:05.100> you

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
but again that is something which you

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.070 
but again that is something which you
may<00:05:05.490> not<00:05:05.670> be<00:05:05.850> able<00:05:05.910> to<00:05:06.090> notice<00:05:06.540> all<00:05:06.750> the<00:05:06.900> time

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
may not be able to notice all the time

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.500 
may not be able to notice all the time
very<00:05:07.830> precisely<00:05:08.280> but<00:05:08.700> the<00:05:08.850> difference<00:05:09.240> over

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
very precisely but the difference over

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.600 
very precisely but the difference over
here<00:05:09.540> which<00:05:09.900> we<00:05:10.080> highlighted<00:05:10.650> before<00:05:10.800> that

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
here which we highlighted before that

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.670 
here which we highlighted before that
this<00:05:11.850> is<00:05:11.910> a<00:05:12.030> single<00:05:12.300> piece<00:05:12.600> of<00:05:12.630> metal<00:05:13.080> and<00:05:13.230> this

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
this is a single piece of metal and this

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.710 
this is a single piece of metal and this
is<00:05:13.860> not<00:05:14.100> a<00:05:14.130> single<00:05:14.490> piece<00:05:14.640> of<00:05:14.820> metal<00:05:15.150> it<00:05:15.510> is<00:05:15.690> a

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
is not a single piece of metal it is a

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.840 
is not a single piece of metal it is a
joint<00:05:16.050> metal<00:05:16.380> which<00:05:16.530> is<00:05:16.680> being<00:05:16.860> made<00:05:17.100> and<00:05:17.370> the

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
joint metal which is being made and the

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.640 
joint metal which is being made and the
connected<00:05:18.300> design<00:05:18.600> is<00:05:18.750> also<00:05:18.960> something<00:05:19.470> with

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
connected design is also something with

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.590 
connected design is also something with
which<00:05:19.830> you<00:05:19.950> can<00:05:20.130> actually<00:05:20.250> identify<00:05:20.600> the

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
which you can actually identify the

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.690 
which you can actually identify the
connector<00:05:21.990> lines<00:05:22.230> are<00:05:22.470> kind<00:05:22.800> of<00:05:22.980> wider<00:05:23.340> over

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
connector lines are kind of wider over

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.190 
connector lines are kind of wider over
here<00:05:23.880> on<00:05:24.000> this<00:05:24.180> one<00:05:24.390> on<00:05:24.570> the<00:05:24.720> genuine<00:05:25.050> one

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
here on this one on the genuine one

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.140 
here on this one on the genuine one
whereas<00:05:25.800> they<00:05:25.950> are<00:05:25.980> very<00:05:26.250> thin<00:05:26.520> on<00:05:26.700> this<00:05:26.940> one

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
whereas they are very thin on this one

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.300 
whereas they are very thin on this one
and<00:05:27.360> they<00:05:28.110> have<00:05:28.320> a<00:05:28.350> small<00:05:28.710> lines<00:05:28.980> over<00:05:29.280> here

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
and they have a small lines over here

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.830 
and they have a small lines over here
which<00:05:29.640> is<00:05:29.760> something<00:05:30.000> which<00:05:30.270> you<00:05:30.450> will<00:05:30.660> not

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
which is something which you will not

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.600 
which is something which you will not
see<00:05:31.140> over<00:05:31.230> here<00:05:31.350> so<00:05:32.130> these<00:05:32.340> are<00:05:32.520> the

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
see over here so these are the

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:33.920 
see over here so these are the
differences<00:05:33.090> with<00:05:33.300> which<00:05:33.510> you<00:05:33.660> can<00:05:33.780> actually

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
differences with which you can actually

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.150 
differences with which you can actually
identify<00:05:34.340> whether<00:05:35.340> you<00:05:35.880> have<00:05:36.180> a<00:05:36.210> fake

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
identify whether you have a fake

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.100 
identify whether you have a fake
lightning<00:05:38.160> cable<00:05:38.490> or<00:05:38.670> a<00:05:38.730> genuine<00:05:39.270> one<00:05:39.450> from

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
lightning cable or a genuine one from

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.840 
lightning cable or a genuine one from
this<00:05:40.380> point<00:05:40.710> as<00:05:40.950> well<00:05:41.160> as<00:05:41.190> from<00:05:41.430> this<00:05:41.610> point

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
this point as well as from this point

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.120 
this point as well as from this point
you<00:05:42.390> do<00:05:42.540> have<00:05:42.570> a<00:05:42.810> special<00:05:43.140> printing<00:05:43.770> is<00:05:43.920> will

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
you do have a special printing is will

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.370 
you do have a special printing is will
which<00:05:44.340> Apple<00:05:44.700> do<00:05:45.000> for<00:05:45.630> their<00:05:45.840> cables<00:05:46.260> and

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
which Apple do for their cables and

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.710 
which Apple do for their cables and
again<00:05:47.010> that<00:05:47.250> is<00:05:47.400> not<00:05:47.580> going<00:05:47.790> to<00:05:47.880> help<00:05:48.090> you<00:05:48.450> and

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
again that is not going to help you and

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.110 
again that is not going to help you and
I<00:05:49.080> tell<00:05:49.290> you<00:05:49.440> the<00:05:49.590> reason<00:05:49.680> so<00:05:50.460> for<00:05:50.640> example<00:05:51.030> you

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
I tell you the reason so for example you

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.820 
I tell you the reason so for example you
have<00:05:51.300> a<00:05:51.330> cable<00:05:51.570> like<00:05:51.840> this<00:05:51.870> and<00:05:52.290> you<00:05:52.470> go<00:05:52.770> to

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
have a cable like this and you go to

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.400 
have a cable like this and you go to
this<00:05:53.250> end<00:05:53.490> and<00:05:53.670> if<00:05:54.270> you<00:05:54.390> try<00:05:54.690> to<00:05:54.750> find<00:05:55.110> out<00:05:55.380> the

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 
this end and if you try to find out the

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.740 
this end and if you try to find out the
printing<00:05:56.070> thing<00:05:56.310> which<00:05:57.090> you<00:05:57.270> will<00:05:57.420> see<00:05:57.630> on

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
printing thing which you will see on

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.210 
printing thing which you will see on
both<00:05:57.930> of<00:05:58.140> these<00:05:58.290> cables<00:05:58.710> let<00:05:58.920> me<00:05:59.070> just

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
both of these cables let me just

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.310 
both of these cables let me just
separate<00:05:59.550> them<00:05:59.730> let<00:06:00.450> me<00:06:00.480> just<00:06:00.630> show<00:06:00.930> you<00:06:00.960> this

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
separate them let me just show you this

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.650 
separate them let me just show you this
part<00:06:01.590> so<00:06:02.100> if<00:06:02.160> you<00:06:02.280> go<00:06:02.490> over<00:06:02.520> here<00:06:02.910> you<00:06:02.970> can<00:06:03.360> see

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
part so if you go over here you can see

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.110 
part so if you go over here you can see
a<00:06:03.690> section<00:06:04.260> which<00:06:04.440> is<00:06:04.620> being<00:06:04.830> printed<00:06:05.160> on<00:06:05.670> the

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
a section which is being printed on the

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.340 
a section which is being printed on the
cable<00:06:06.540> okay

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.350 
cable okay

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.920 
cable okay
over<00:06:07.770> here<00:06:07.950> as<00:06:08.100> you<00:06:08.700> can<00:06:08.850> see<00:06:09.030> so<00:06:09.570> you<00:06:09.600> have<00:06:09.900> a

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
over here as you can see so you have a

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.290 
over here as you can see so you have a
print<00:06:10.290> over<00:06:10.440> here<00:06:10.740> which<00:06:10.950> is<00:06:11.160> saying<00:06:11.460> designed

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
print over here which is saying designed

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.630 
print over here which is saying designed
by<00:06:12.540> Apple<00:06:12.870> in<00:06:13.230> California<00:06:13.280> sample<00:06:14.280> in<00:06:14.370> China

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:14.640 
by Apple in California sample in China

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.820 
by Apple in California sample in China
and<00:06:14.850> then<00:06:14.970> you<00:06:15.090> have<00:06:15.270> a<00:06:15.300> code<00:06:15.630> same<00:06:16.380> thing<00:06:16.650> you

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
and then you have a code same thing you

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.010 
and then you have a code same thing you
will<00:06:16.950> get<00:06:17.160> on<00:06:17.280> the<00:06:17.400> genuine<00:06:17.760> one<00:06:17.970> as<00:06:18.150> well<00:06:18.420> so

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 
will get on the genuine one as well so

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.600 
will get on the genuine one as well so
this<00:06:19.170> is<00:06:19.230> not<00:06:19.590> something<00:06:19.980> with<00:06:20.160> which<00:06:20.340> you<00:06:20.490> can

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
this is not something with which you can

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.390 
this is not something with which you can
actually<00:06:21.000> identify<00:06:21.210> a<00:06:21.720> fake<00:06:22.170> or<00:06:22.410> the<00:06:23.070> genuine

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 
actually identify a fake or the genuine

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.700 
actually identify a fake or the genuine
one<00:06:23.610> because<00:06:24.450> the<00:06:24.600> printing<00:06:24.990> is<00:06:25.200> there<00:06:25.500> on

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
one because the printing is there on

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.320 
one because the printing is there on
both<00:06:25.920> of<00:06:26.130> them<00:06:26.280> I<00:06:26.490> don't<00:06:26.550> know<00:06:26.760> whether<00:06:27.000> the

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
both of them I don't know whether the

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.570 
both of them I don't know whether the
camera<00:06:27.720> is<00:06:27.810> focusing<00:06:28.350> or<00:06:28.470> not<00:06:28.620> but<00:06:29.220> there<00:06:29.430> is<00:06:29.550> a

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
camera is focusing or not but there is a

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.330 
camera is focusing or not but there is a
print<00:06:30.030> thing<00:06:30.900> which<00:06:31.170> is<00:06:31.350> there<00:06:31.620> on<00:06:31.800> the<00:06:31.950> cable

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
print thing which is there on the cable

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.880 
print thing which is there on the cable
over<00:06:33.060> here<00:06:33.270> on<00:06:33.360> the<00:06:33.480> genuine<00:06:33.780> one<00:06:33.960> and<00:06:34.140> they

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:34.890 
over here on the genuine one and they

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:36.850 
over here on the genuine one and they
have<00:06:35.100> a<00:06:35.130> code<00:06:35.490> as<00:06:35.670> well<00:06:35.850> I<00:06:35.880> don't<00:06:36.210> know

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:36.860 
have a code as well I don't know

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.559 
have a code as well I don't know
it<00:06:36.919> with<00:06:37.460> the<00:06:37.550> help<00:06:37.699> of<00:06:37.819> this<00:06:38.000> code<00:06:38.270> you<00:06:38.419> can

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:38.569 
it with the help of this code you can

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:40.360 
it with the help of this code you can
actually<00:06:38.659> identify<00:06:39.409> the<00:06:39.439> cable<00:06:39.979> whether<00:06:40.189> it

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.370 
actually identify the cable whether it

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.450 
actually identify the cable whether it
is<00:06:40.490> genuine<00:06:40.849> or<00:06:40.969> not<00:06:41.030> but<00:06:41.810> as<00:06:42.020> of<00:06:42.259> now<00:06:42.289> we<00:06:42.860> are

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:43.460 
is genuine or not but as of now we are

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.369 
is genuine or not but as of now we are
not<00:06:43.789> able<00:06:43.969> to<00:06:44.060> find<00:06:44.419> out<00:06:44.599> any<00:06:44.810> difference<00:06:45.259> in

00:06:45.369 --> 00:06:45.379 
not able to find out any difference in

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:47.080 
not able to find out any difference in
between<00:06:45.680> these<00:06:46.009> two<00:06:46.219> as<00:06:46.370> far<00:06:46.550> as<00:06:46.669> the<00:06:46.759> printing

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.090 
between these two as far as the printing
