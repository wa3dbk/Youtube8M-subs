those of you that don't understand and

those of you that don't understand and
in<00:00:22.340> layman's<00:00:22.789> terms<00:00:22.940> this<00:00:23.449> essentially<00:00:24.050> takes

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.290 
in layman's terms this essentially takes

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.130 
in layman's terms this essentially takes
any<00:00:24.500> microphone<00:00:25.070> and<00:00:25.280> makes<00:00:26.090> it<00:00:26.270> a<00:00:26.420> USB<00:00:26.930> mic

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
any microphone and makes it a USB mic

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.140 
any microphone and makes it a USB mic
now<00:00:27.590> I'm<00:00:27.770> careful<00:00:28.190> to<00:00:28.250> say<00:00:28.430> any<00:00:28.640> microphone

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
now I'm careful to say any microphone

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.090 
now I'm careful to say any microphone
because<00:00:29.300> it<00:00:29.510> does<00:00:29.690> need<00:00:29.900> to<00:00:29.930> be<00:00:30.050> an<00:00:30.260> XLR<00:00:30.830> mic

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:31.100 
because it does need to be an XLR mic

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.080 
because it does need to be an XLR mic
but<00:00:32.200> 98%<00:00:33.200> of<00:00:33.290> microphones<00:00:33.710> out<00:00:33.890> there<00:00:34.129> are<00:00:34.340> XLR

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
but 98% of microphones out there are XLR

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.389 
but 98% of microphones out there are XLR
so<00:00:35.379> it's<00:00:36.379> a<00:00:36.500> pretty<00:00:36.710> cool<00:00:36.890> little<00:00:37.010> device<00:00:37.250> and

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
so it's a pretty cool little device and

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:39.279 
so it's a pretty cool little device and
it's<00:00:37.789> significantly<00:00:38.390> less<00:00:38.510> than<00:00:38.780> its

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:39.289 
it's significantly less than its

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:42.520 
it's significantly less than its
competitors<00:00:39.860> before<00:00:40.700> we<00:00:40.940> get<00:00:41.030> into<00:00:41.240> that<00:00:41.530> I'd

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
competitors before we get into that I'd

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
microphones into USB microphones I went

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.160 
microphones into USB microphones I went
through<00:01:12.890> this<00:01:12.979> mixer<00:01:13.400> and<00:01:13.549> it<00:01:14.330> has<00:01:14.510> a<00:01:14.540> preamp

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
through this mixer and it has a preamp

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.070 
through this mixer and it has a preamp
in<00:01:15.350> there<00:01:15.500> and<00:01:15.620> it<00:01:15.710> essentially<00:01:16.070> allows<00:01:16.190> you

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
in there and it essentially allows you

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.430 
in there and it essentially allows you
to<00:01:18.080> take<00:01:18.320> these<00:01:18.500> mics<00:01:18.770> and<00:01:19.010> make<00:01:19.729> them<00:01:20.440> USB

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
to take these mics and make them USB

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.950 
to take these mics and make them USB
mics<00:01:21.680> now<00:01:21.950> the<00:01:22.700> great<00:01:22.970> thing<00:01:23.210> about<00:01:23.240> this<00:01:23.630> is

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
mics now the great thing about this is

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.340 
mics now the great thing about this is
USB<00:01:24.680> mics<00:01:24.950> are<00:01:25.850> not<00:01:26.119> really<00:01:26.659> the<00:01:26.780> best<00:01:26.960> I<00:01:27.320> mean

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
USB mics are not really the best I mean

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.230 
USB mics are not really the best I mean
I'm<00:01:27.710> careful<00:01:28.520> to<00:01:28.580> say<00:01:28.729> that<00:01:28.760> because<00:01:29.119> there

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
I'm careful to say that because there

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.430 
I'm careful to say that because there
are<00:01:29.390> some<00:01:29.570> good<00:01:29.720> ones<00:01:29.869> out<00:01:30.049> there<00:01:30.229> but

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
are some good ones out there but

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.590 
are some good ones out there but
historically<00:01:31.040> USB<00:01:31.610> mics<00:01:31.820> are<00:01:32.000> pretty<00:01:32.180> crappy

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
historically USB mics are pretty crappy

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.859 
historically USB mics are pretty crappy
and<00:01:32.780> until<00:01:33.619> now<00:01:33.979> there<00:01:34.670> hasn't<00:01:35.000> really<00:01:35.180> been<00:01:35.570> a

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
and until now there hasn't really been a

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.590 
and until now there hasn't really been a
cheap<00:01:36.229> way<00:01:36.500> to<00:01:36.530> convert<00:01:36.979> an<00:01:37.159> XLR<00:01:37.549> mic<00:01:37.880> to<00:01:38.090> a<00:01:38.119> USB

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
cheap way to convert an XLR mic to a USB

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.719 
cheap way to convert an XLR mic to a USB
one<00:01:38.780> this<00:01:38.990> was<00:01:39.200> pretty<00:01:39.650> much<00:01:39.830> the<00:01:40.100> best<00:01:40.130> value

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
one this was pretty much the best value

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.340 
one this was pretty much the best value
when<00:01:40.820> I<00:01:40.909> got<00:01:41.090> this<00:01:41.240> about<00:01:41.510> two<00:01:41.689> years<00:01:41.869> ago<00:01:41.990> and

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
when I got this about two years ago and

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.700 
when I got this about two years ago and
this<00:01:42.979> was<00:01:43.280> and<00:01:43.580> still<00:01:43.790> is<00:01:44.049> $200<00:01:45.049> so<00:01:45.350> it<00:01:45.470> isn't

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
this was and still is $200 so it isn't

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.950 
this was and still is $200 so it isn't
cheap<00:01:45.890> what<00:01:46.520> this<00:01:46.670> does<00:01:46.880> is<00:01:47.090> it<00:01:47.270> takes<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:47.570> XLR

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
cheap what this does is it takes the XLR

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.380 
cheap what this does is it takes the XLR
mic<00:01:48.320> and<00:01:48.560> it<00:01:48.680> outputs<00:01:48.920> it<00:01:49.340> via<00:01:49.520> USB<00:01:49.939> to<00:01:50.119> your

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
mic and it outputs it via USB to your

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.929 
mic and it outputs it via USB to your
computer<00:01:50.590> now<00:01:51.590> there's<00:01:52.070> a<00:01:52.130> bunch<00:01:52.490> of<00:01:52.580> great

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.440 
and it's a 48 volt mic it's a phantom
powered<00:03:37.220> which<00:03:37.400> is<00:03:37.610> great<00:03:37.880> because<00:03:38.270> this

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
powered which is great because this

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.540 
powered which is great because this
actually<00:03:39.050> offers<00:03:39.650> phantom<00:03:40.010> power<00:03:40.190> so<00:03:40.370> there's

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
actually offers phantom power so there's

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.040 
actually offers phantom power so there's
no<00:03:40.670> external<00:03:41.150> power<00:03:41.300> source<00:03:41.570> it<00:03:41.750> goes<00:03:41.840> all

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
no external power source it goes all

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.890 
no external power source it goes all
through<00:03:42.200> USB<00:03:42.500> and<00:03:42.860> you<00:03:42.950> can<00:03:43.100> use<00:03:43.430> any<00:03:43.640> mic

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
through USB and you can use any mic

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.360 
through USB and you can use any mic
through<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.350> Icicle<00:03:45.890> which<00:03:46.040> is<00:03:46.160> great

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
through the Icicle which is great

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.890 
through the Icicle which is great
because<00:03:46.670> I<00:03:46.700> was<00:03:46.850> fearing<00:03:47.420> that<00:03:47.450> it<00:03:47.660> wouldn't

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
because I was fearing that it wouldn't

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.720 
because I was fearing that it wouldn't
work<00:03:47.990> with<00:03:48.350> my<00:03:48.500> heavier<00:03:48.950> Duty<00:03:49.280> microphones

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
work with my heavier Duty microphones

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.670 
work with my heavier Duty microphones
that<00:03:49.910> required<00:03:50.240> more<00:03:50.450> voltage<00:03:50.660> but<00:03:51.410> it<00:03:51.530> does

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
that required more voltage but it does

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.790 
that required more voltage but it does
and<00:03:51.890> you're<00:03:52.430> good<00:03:52.700> to<00:03:52.730> go<00:03:52.850> so<00:03:53.180> we<00:03:54.050> got<00:03:54.230> this<00:03:54.440> we

and plug it in and we're set and ready
to<00:03:59.900> go<00:04:00.110> so<00:04:00.350> it<00:04:00.709> doesn't<00:04:01.310> make<00:04:01.640> it<00:04:01.820> the<00:04:02.120> best

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
to go so it doesn't make it the best

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.660 
to go so it doesn't make it the best
looking<00:04:02.720> microphone<00:04:03.290> but<00:04:03.620> it<00:04:03.890> does<00:04:04.400> offer

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
looking microphone but it does offer

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.240 
looking microphone but it does offer
functionality<00:04:05.630> now<00:04:05.810> right<00:04:06.050> here<00:04:06.500> you'll<00:04:07.190> be

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
functionality now right here you'll be

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.650 
functionality now right here you'll be
able<00:04:07.430> to<00:04:07.610> see<00:04:07.760> that<00:04:07.910> there<00:04:08.060> is<00:04:08.240> a<00:04:08.270> gain<00:04:08.630> knob

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
able to see that there is a gain knob

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.810 
able to see that there is a gain knob
that's<00:04:09.380> the<00:04:09.530> only<00:04:09.830> knob<00:04:10.040> that's<00:04:10.280> really<00:04:10.670> on

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
that's the only knob that's really on

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.420 
that's the only knob that's really on
the<00:04:10.910> whole<00:04:11.120> device<00:04:11.480> and<00:04:11.890> you<00:04:12.890> know<00:04:12.980> that's<00:04:13.160> why

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
the whole device and you know that's why

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.640 
the whole device and you know that's why
the<00:04:13.940> m-audio<00:04:14.390> fast<00:04:14.780> track<00:04:14.959> pro<00:04:15.200> still<00:04:15.500> app

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
the m-audio fast track pro still app

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.530 
the m-audio fast track pro still app
does<00:04:15.950> it<00:04:16.160> in<00:04:16.310> a<00:04:16.400> couple<00:04:16.700> areas<00:04:16.820> because<00:04:17.330> this

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
does it in a couple areas because this

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.570 
does it in a couple areas because this
just<00:04:18.260> doesn't<00:04:18.650> offer<00:04:18.799> all<00:04:19.190> of<00:04:19.220> the

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
just doesn't offer all of the

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.460 
just doesn't offer all of the
versatility<00:04:20.150> that<00:04:20.390> the<00:04:20.660> m-audio<00:04:20.900> fast<00:04:21.260> track

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
versatility that the m-audio fast track

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.980 
versatility that the m-audio fast track
pro<00:04:21.680> does<00:04:21.920> but<00:04:22.330> you<00:04:23.330> have<00:04:23.480> your<00:04:23.630> gain<00:04:23.810> and

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
pro does but you have your gain and

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.290 
pro does but you have your gain and
volume<00:04:24.020> knob<00:04:24.470> one<00:04:25.280> thing<00:04:25.520> I'm<00:04:25.670> sad<00:04:25.910> to<00:04:26.120> see

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
volume knob one thing I'm sad to see

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.240 
volume knob one thing I'm sad to see
that<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:26.630> Icicle<00:04:27.080> doesn't<00:04:27.440> have<00:04:27.650> is<00:04:27.890> a<00:04:27.920> line

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
that the Icicle doesn't have is a line

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.860 
that the Icicle doesn't have is a line
out<00:04:28.550> that<00:04:28.880> would<00:04:28.970> be<00:04:29.000> awesome<00:04:29.510> because<00:04:29.630> it

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
out that would be awesome because it

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.960 
out that would be awesome because it
wouldn't<00:04:30.110> require<00:04:30.440> USB<00:04:31.160> to<00:04:31.310> do<00:04:31.430> everything

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
wouldn't require USB to do everything

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.400 
wouldn't require USB to do everything
that's<00:04:32.510> one<00:04:32.720> thing<00:04:32.840> I<00:04:32.930> like<00:04:33.080> about<00:04:33.140> the

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
that's one thing I like about the

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:34.719 
that's one thing I like about the
m-audio<00:04:33.620> fast<00:04:34.010> track<00:04:34.190> Pro<00:04:34.400> it's

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
m-audio fast track Pro it's

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.269 
m-audio fast track Pro it's
we<00:04:34.909> plugged<00:04:35.180> into<00:04:35.360> the<00:04:35.569> wall<00:04:35.839> and<00:04:36.139> I<00:04:36.650> am<00:04:36.830> using

00:04:37.269 --> 00:04:37.279 
we plugged into the wall and I am using

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:41.529 
we plugged into the wall and I am using
it<00:04:37.430> to<00:04:37.930> get<00:04:38.930> the<00:04:39.610> blue<00:04:40.610> spark<00:04:41.089> which<00:04:41.360> is<00:04:41.509> a

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
it to get the blue spark which is a

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:43.869 
it to get the blue spark which is a
condenser<00:04:42.110> microphone<00:04:42.370> into<00:04:43.370> my<00:04:43.520> camera

00:04:43.869 --> 00:04:43.879 
condenser microphone into my camera

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:45.850 
condenser microphone into my camera
which<00:04:44.120> is<00:04:44.270> excellent<00:04:44.569> because<00:04:44.809> if<00:04:45.289> there's<00:04:45.770> a

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
which is excellent because if there's a

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.589 
which is excellent because if there's a
phantom<00:04:46.279> powered<00:04:46.520> mic<00:04:46.699> you<00:04:46.879> can't<00:04:47.059> do<00:04:47.210> that<00:04:47.360> so

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599 
phantom powered mic you can't do that so

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:50.049 
phantom powered mic you can't do that so
I<00:04:47.839> wish<00:04:48.289> the<00:04:48.499> Icicle<00:04:48.949> had<00:04:49.159> a<00:04:49.189> line<00:04:49.490> out<00:04:49.669> because

00:04:50.049 --> 00:04:50.059 
I wish the Icicle had a line out because

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:52.029 
I wish the Icicle had a line out because
right<00:04:50.360> now<00:04:50.659> you<00:04:50.719> have<00:04:51.050> to<00:04:51.199> go<00:04:51.319> through<00:04:51.469> USB<00:04:51.740> and

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
right now you have to go through USB and

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:53.799 
right now you have to go through USB and
without<00:04:52.249> a<00:04:52.279> computer<00:04:52.819> this<00:04:53.300> little<00:04:53.659> bad<00:04:53.779> boy

00:04:53.799 --> 00:04:53.809 
without a computer this little bad boy

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:56.350 
without a computer this little bad boy
is<00:04:53.990> worthless<00:04:54.319> but<00:04:54.949> if<00:04:55.669> you<00:04:55.789> take<00:04:55.969> a<00:04:55.999> peek<00:04:56.210> on

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
is worthless but if you take a peek on

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.519 
is worthless but if you take a peek on
the<00:04:56.389> bottom<00:04:56.719> you'll<00:04:56.870> see<00:04:56.930> that<00:04:57.199> there<00:04:57.319> is<00:04:57.349> a

00:04:57.519 --> 00:04:57.529 
the bottom you'll see that there is a

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:59.950 
the bottom you'll see that there is a
mini<00:04:57.979> USB<00:04:58.159> out<00:04:58.610> all<00:04:58.999> you<00:04:59.330> got<00:04:59.449> to<00:04:59.569> do<00:04:59.629> is<00:04:59.779> take

track<00:05:33.259> Pro<00:05:33.469> which<00:05:33.649> amazed<00:05:33.979> me<00:05:34.159> I<00:05:34.189> thought<00:05:34.399> the

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
track Pro which amazed me I thought the

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.100 
track Pro which amazed me I thought the
audio<00:05:34.789> quality<00:05:34.969> wouldn't<00:05:35.419> even<00:05:35.479> be<00:05:35.659> close<00:05:35.689> but

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
audio quality wouldn't even be close but

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.649 
audio quality wouldn't even be close but
it's<00:05:36.229> identical<00:05:36.740> and<00:05:37.039> really<00:05:37.879> maximizes<00:05:38.539> the

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:38.659 
it's identical and really maximizes the

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:39.790 
it's identical and really maximizes the
power<00:05:38.899> of<00:05:38.990> your<00:05:39.080> microphone<00:05:39.439> there<00:05:39.649> it's

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
power of your microphone there it's

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.260 
power of your microphone there it's
phantom<00:05:40.159> power<00:05:40.339> which<00:05:40.580> is<00:05:40.699> excellent<00:05:40.999> so<00:05:41.149> you

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
phantom power which is excellent so you

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.209 
phantom power which is excellent so you
can<00:05:41.389> use<00:05:41.509> pretty<00:05:41.659> much<00:05:41.810> any<00:05:42.020> mic<00:05:42.229> and<00:05:42.469> I<00:05:42.830> really

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:43.219 
can use pretty much any mic and I really

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:45.100 
can use pretty much any mic and I really
cannot<00:05:43.520> recommend<00:05:43.879> this<00:05:44.120> much<00:05:44.509> more<00:05:44.779> highly

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
cannot recommend this much more highly

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.510 
cannot recommend this much more highly
the<00:05:45.259> build<00:05:45.439> quality<00:05:45.649> is<00:05:45.889> a<00:05:45.949> little<00:05:45.979> bit<00:05:46.249> cheap

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
the build quality is a little bit cheap

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.209 
the build quality is a little bit cheap
but<00:05:47.120> for<00:05:47.389> 60<00:05:47.779> bucks<00:05:47.959> nothing<00:05:48.499> even<00:05:48.770> parallels

00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:49.219 
but for 60 bucks nothing even parallels

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:52.119
