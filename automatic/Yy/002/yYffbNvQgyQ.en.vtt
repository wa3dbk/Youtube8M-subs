of<00:00:40.140> video<00:00:40.469> cards<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.309> let's<00:00:41.520> take<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.969> look<00:00:42.149> at

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
of video cards so let's take a look at

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.510 
of video cards so let's take a look at
what's<00:00:42.450> inside<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.930> box<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.590> specs<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.129> how

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
what's inside the box the specs and how

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.279 
what's inside the box the specs and how
it<00:00:44.640> performs<00:00:45.090> against<00:00:45.360> other<00:00:45.600> cards<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.140> its

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
it performs against other cards in its

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.279 
it performs against other cards in its
same<00:00:46.590> price<00:00:47.129> range<00:00:47.510> ok<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:48.570> check<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:49.020> out<00:00:49.079> here

this this has been double to the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.940 
this this has been double to the
previous<00:01:14.610> 5<00:01:14.820> generation<00:01:15.299> card<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.950> 5750

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
previous 5 generation card so the 5750

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.910 
previous 5 generation card so the 5750
had<00:01:17.310> half<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.939> what<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.180> 6850<00:01:18.960> has<00:01:19.140> obviously

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
had half of what the 6850 has obviously

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.800 
had half of what the 6850 has obviously
you<00:01:20.040> get<00:01:20.159> directly<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:20.700> 11i<00:01:21.180> affinity<00:01:21.659> and

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
you get directly so 11i affinity and

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.469 
you get directly so 11i affinity and
