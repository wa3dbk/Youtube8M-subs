00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello dear friends today 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.569
 Dota 2 review is waiting for you 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.179
 after my first two reviews my one 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.990
 friend told me they gave you january 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.300
 in dota 2 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.490
 I am of course very happy for me 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.800
 that meant my reviews to him 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.210
 Liked he decided to listen to me 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.900
 I will estimate the second dose 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.640
 but unfortunately I was mistaken at the very same 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.400
 In fact, he pursued a completely different 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.730
 goal he just wanted to break my life 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.880
 this is at least meanness and now i'm 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.440
 going to do the same with you 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.730
 it would seem that can attract in the game 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.460
 where only however 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.500
 but there is a huge amount of hero 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.110
 with different abilities that gives such 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.850
 diversity i'm just happy the same 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.860
 must take into account the fact that or 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.390
 team game there is a mass 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.190
 variations of combining these 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.350
 abilities goes great 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.120
 the number of things you can take and 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.960
 that will help in combat as common 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.059
 characteristics 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.399
 as well as additional abilities 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.050
 Honestly, at first I just ohuel from 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.699
 the amount of text that I will have 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.100
 other to understand the game 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.189
 Imagine yourself playing 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.229
 yard football and pass the scoring pass 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.540
 and bowlegger your teams 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.060
 of course you start right there 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.430
 cocks each other 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.470
 the main beauty of the game is the yard 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.979
 the atmosphere just hold down the button and say 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.020
 your team does not think anything 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.299
 indescribable feelings in general we will begin 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.250
 game to start we need to choose a hero 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.500
 for which we will play i 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.509
 I almost always choose women as 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.880
 computer games is the only place 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.500
 where can i really manage them 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.960
 for the rest of the time, I'm just 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.509
 I dig a little distracted I 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.460
 I plan to release a series of video tutorials under 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.070
 these two because now i dedicate 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.340
 I have all my free time I will 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.490
 combine business with pleasure 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.380
 useful to be useful useful in the game 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.329
 all the same there are downsides for example now 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.939
 let me be very frustrated but short 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.299
 still waiting believe me this is worse 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.460
 downloads and another minus the breaks between 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.300
 writing replicas I decided to play and 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.319
 spent two odd hours on two matches 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.780
 merciless game just robs me 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.930
 total free time given the fact that 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.790
 all my time is free no no serious 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.069
 I'm not doing anything at all except 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.290
 how do i write reviews and initial songs 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.090
 standard you need to pump one of 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.709
 four abilities to buy a couple 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.200
 items for the initial game 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.569
 Pleases that specially for crayfish game 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.019
 gives advice what is best to buy in 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.480
 beginning in the middle and at the end of the game we are with 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.090
 you are already happy and fully prepared 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.090

 whip beautiful turrets of the face I no longer 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.110
 I remember when I was last in nature 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.849
 but the game take care of me at 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.670
 least still remember what color 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:54.269
 foliage given the winter outside the window though fucking 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.280
 spring is even like that 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.700
 poems 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.010
 label the poet and i decide to go to black 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.170
 demon I think we get great 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.390
 like a picnic here and far away 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.000
 I have a pretty clearing with me 4 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.580
 bottle panama luminous eggs and 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.370
 firewood for the fire would soon come 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.319
 for sure he already waited for me in general 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.349
 the initial goal of the game is to protect the small 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.810
 beer stall creeps why 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.849
 creeps never understood will call 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.069
 their local alcoholics are all the more so if 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:28.409
 take a look at how they run then immediately 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.140
 you can see who is drinking in the morning 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:34.370
 masterpiece little song 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:37.069
 dedicated to this flying gait 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:41.330
 gait 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:49.390
 my thoughts for a beer 1. 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:57.680
 people appeared then we are with guys 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:04:00.980
 still beautiful enamel and went on 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.040
 and I will now explain why I called 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.020
 wheezing drunks and towers beer stalls 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.480
 the thing is that we play for strength 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.950
 light or the powers of darkness and the bases of these all 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.700
 more like manufacturing plants 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.440
 liquor but it's warring 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.320
 among themselves plants as the power of light 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.540
 pours delicious wonderful invigorating body 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.640
 and the spirit pivasik and the power of darkness spills 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.720
 something red is likely grape 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.020
 day or jaguar 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.710
 or worse, burnt wine just like 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.700
 in reality, the power of light and the power of darkness 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.490
 pivasik vinische 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.560
 and as we all know interfere with the divine 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.600
 nectar, along with the infamous seer can not be 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.940
 because you can die 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.380
 really perish workers two 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.420
 beyond corporate part-time 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.760
 creeps attack each other and 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.430
 makes you drink your product because of what 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.950
 their lives are diminished they die 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.150
 but in this cruel and merciless war 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.730
 have their heroes 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.370
 it's like warriors just cooler they have 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.930
 superpowers that they got in 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.490
 the result of long and fast 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.400
 drunkenness and that they will 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.990
 storm an enemy factory they 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.830
 must end this war 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.930
 win or lose now you can 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.930
 watch me masterfully destroy 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:18.110
 enemy creeps and so I was horrified with 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.840
 this hero and this is the first blood what 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:24.080
 cool score 1 0 in favor of the power of light 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.120
 fuck already 11 enemy team killed 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.590
 some of our crayfish but I notice 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.330
 an enemy hero whose left 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.330
 quite a mallet of life I owe him 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:35.090
 get there yes I kinda already told what 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.160
 fucking archer past review now 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.110
 I hope everyone was convinced of that 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.419
 I think all this can be said about 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.780
 this game you need to play it and not talk 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.530
 o not 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:48.380
 and the most important difference is dota 1 2 in 1 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.150
 I could not figure it out at all 2 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.370
 it seemed so easy to learn 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.870
 plus the game has a level system that 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.210
 throws in one 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.310
 you start with beginners and the rest with 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.930
 the rest can always ask a question 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.760
 as in the text version and in 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.710
 the microphone during the game is not important 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.220
 take on the headstock crayfish and from your 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.170
 teams 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:09.050
 since they are so residential like you 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:12.050
 respectively newcomers and I also noticed 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:14.150
 interesting thing who plays the worst 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.010
 most pizdets well, naturally you 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:19.130
 also be able to send it to check what 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:23.410
 engaged his mother and the final song 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:27.590
 did the fool in the world dance and sing 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:31.640
 if he passes by cheers honestly 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:36.230

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:37.130

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:41.540
 all by 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:44.390
 why is he so bad because he 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:48.460
 plays dota 2 2 2 2 2 

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:53.960
 because he doesn't know how to play a rarara 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:59.050
 because he is real ra because ra 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:07:02.320
 that he is a fool and in the very beginning he 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:05.520
 merges in the description of swing 

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:09.509
 the team doesn't like his guitar 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:12.810
 and noob call and that can be similar through 

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:14.909
 steam to tell him and not change it 

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:21.030
 he know what is well deserved 

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:24.060
 continue to blunt cast because he 

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:28.370
 plays dota 2 2 2 2 2 

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:33.080
 because he doesn't know how to play 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:37.509
 because before lizard 

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:42.069
