00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.650
 This is it, my dear friends, turn around. 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.370
 girs 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:13.769
 finally decide to send my bike to a 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:16.859
 good mechanic even the next is after 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.910
 All motor-driven engines 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.720
 eyes inside 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:25.529
 I rolled the rear tire a little so I 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.740
 who turns slowly can throw the oil 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.809
 everything inside the engine is as follows 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:37.710
 by hand here I could turn well 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:40.649
 magnet in this turning tycoon eg the engine 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.950
 whole is the following that rotated with the 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.410
 lam believe that such force is not so 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.100
 He could not even force himself to turn 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.760
 that there 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.829
 Okay, well, everything is set up on the spot. 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.489
 I just got off the ground and worked 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:00.480
 Little baby, I finished the gasoline I made 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:04.199
 I've been in the station until today and come back 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.930
 carburetor also filled say Sunday and 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:16.979
 it was very loose 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:20.430
 Is what happened, what happened to me? 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.560
 I believe it can not be owned by the 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.220
 I'm broke and never in my life will 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.619
 doing this will not come with 250 or maybe 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.960
 any other motorcycle 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:36.090
 Although there is no choice, there is only life. 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.070
 damn next there that piece showing 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:45.350
 for you a head 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.350
 I'm more focused here foot in Mexico 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:53.330
 to make the noise even the most focused here 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.500
 on the banana axis thus and so is a 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.200
 gap 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:07.100
 I want to show you how it works. 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:09.890
 fit this piece, yes, there it went 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.590
 all this here which is not complicated 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.800
 so come on guys we have to 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:20.600
 have a bump here make it look good 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:24.110
 yields almost yields with the right gear 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.720
 There is also one end here so that 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.420
 little chemistry arrives in her and causes 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.580
 She used to live here so easy. 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:39.830
 because of the slack she has the beauty 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:43.040
 What is another piece to piece that broke 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:48.489
 broke broke in the engine apart 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:50.060
 here ok then what happens guys 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:55.730
 it broke 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:59.120
 Why can not we change, whatever? 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:05.359
 just forced the guys look what she did 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:11.570
 here on scale 5 of the piece that saw the 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:19.730
 Throw in what happened this 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:21.530
 as this piece here is not so 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.370
 It's so weak, that 's what you did. 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.560
 on here 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:29.180
 the belt for not bursting will not 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.090
 is sending the mechanic from there 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:37.370
 information is passing on to you is the 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:41.230
 next that the only thing I have 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:47.319
 To think what happened here was that 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.319
 because I have spent a lot of glue 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:54.889
 past in the glue can be tried paid 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.260
 a path in which the oil passes is 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:04:00.470
 cuddly too small 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.140
 then miss looking it up and saw the ce 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.250
 what cable locking here is the only thing 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.510
 What do I have to think about at the moment? 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:11.930
 because he treated everything right on time 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.940
 So, it's beautiful, but we're going there like that. 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.180
 then enchant for you the 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:20.410
 that could have happened the beauty speaks 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.410
 galway uwe
