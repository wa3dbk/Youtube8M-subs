00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
excited for an advanced warfare is

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.359 
excited for an advanced warfare is
obviously<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.810> multiplayer<00:01:10.409> but<00:01:11.010> luckily

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
obviously the multiplayer but luckily

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.950 
obviously the multiplayer but luckily
the<00:01:11.760> guys<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.090> sledgehammer<00:01:12.510> games<00:01:12.630> are

the guys the sledgehammer games are

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.420 
the guys the sledgehammer games are
finally<00:01:13.320> doing<00:01:13.439> something<00:01:13.590> about<00:01:14.040> call<00:01:14.400> of

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
finally doing something about call of

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.460 
finally doing something about call of
duty<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.970> way<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.240> looks<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.840> don't<00:01:16.380> think

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
duty and the way it looks I don't think

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.289 
duty and the way it looks I don't think
call<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.950> duty<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> specifically<00:01:17.909> bad

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
call of duty is a specifically bad

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.510 
call of duty is a specifically bad
looking<00:01:18.810> game<00:01:18.990> but<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.350> does<00:01:19.590> look<00:01:19.619> dated

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
looking game but it does look dated

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.760 
looking game but it does look dated
especially<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.600> ghosts<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.170> became<00:01:22.470> very

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
especially in ghosts is became very

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.620 
especially in ghosts is became very
obvious<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.580> now<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.330> game<00:01:24.600> is

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
obvious and now that this game is

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.300 
obvious and now that this game is
finally<00:01:25.049> doing<00:01:25.350> something<00:01:25.500> different<00:01:26.280> with

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
finally doing something different with

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.640 
finally doing something different with
the<00:01:26.460> graphics<00:01:26.880> engine<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.390> does<00:01:28.110> look<00:01:28.140> rather

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
the graphics engine it does look rather

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.950 
the graphics engine it does look rather
striking<00:01:29.360> especially<00:01:30.360> within<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.689> footage

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
striking especially within the footage

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.270 
striking especially within the footage
that<00:01:31.110> they<00:01:31.200> showed<00:01:31.409> at<00:01:31.530> e3<00:01:31.650> which<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.159> an

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
that they showed at e3 which is an

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.980 
that they showed at e3 which is an
alternate<00:01:32.670> scenario<00:01:33.150> within<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.570> campaign

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
alternate scenario within the campaign

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.319 
alternate scenario within the campaign
it's<00:01:34.650> pretty<00:01:34.979> good-looking<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.700> will<00:01:36.119> give<00:01:36.299> it

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
it's pretty good-looking I will give it

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.940 
it's pretty good-looking I will give it
that<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.750> way<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.020> characters<00:01:37.170> move<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.860> way

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
that the way the characters move the way

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.740 
that the way the characters move the way
the<00:01:38.070> motion<00:01:38.460> capture<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.119> motion<00:01:39.329> blur

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
the motion capture is the motion blur

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.780 
the motion capture is the motion blur
and<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.290> overall<00:01:40.560> just<00:01:40.890> quality<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.610> how<00:01:41.729> the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
and the overall just quality of how the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.380 
and the overall just quality of how the
game<00:01:42.060> looks<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.930> way<00:01:43.649> way<00:01:44.310> above<00:01:44.549> what<00:01:45.000> is

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
game looks is is way way above what is

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.999 
game looks is is way way above what is
going<00:01:45.720> on<00:01:45.810> in<00:01:45.990> previous<00:01:46.320> Call<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.530> Duty<00:01:46.799> games

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009

the<00:01:47.520> only<00:01:47.640> reason<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.939> can't<00:01:48.180> say<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.509> game<00:01:48.659> is

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
the only reason I can't say the game is

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.870 
the only reason I can't say the game is
just<00:01:49.049> awesome<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.770> because<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.130> didn't<00:01:50.460> play<00:01:50.670> it

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
just awesome is because I didn't play it

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.219 
just awesome is because I didn't play it

I really feel that once once to call a
duty<00:02:11.280> formula<00:02:11.819> became<00:02:12.120> so<00:02:12.390> routine

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
duty formula became so routine

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.240 
duty formula became so routine
and<00:02:13.300> so<00:02:13.480> formulaic<00:02:13.930> that<00:02:14.830> they<00:02:14.980> ended<00:02:15.130> up

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
and so formulaic that they ended up

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.250 
and so formulaic that they ended up
removing<00:02:15.459> things<00:02:16.120> from<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.540> game<00:02:16.690> mostly<00:02:17.080> in

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
it it didn't matter if the connection

it it didn't matter if the connection
was<00:02:20.890> good<00:02:21.130> it<00:02:21.400> what<00:02:22.150> really<00:02:22.420> murdered<00:02:22.959> it<00:02:23.080> for
