00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:32.070
 After two and a half days of detailed workshops, we present here only the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.210
 Results of the seminar participants 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.100
 Hannelore you told us yesterday that you'd rather be behind the camera 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.710
 is better that has a reason 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.950
 I can believe I have my experiences and what I feel warns too 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.540
 bring about density of fur were so comment on Peter 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.290
 for example, new ones count 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.900
 and I think I'm a seasoned diver and he might be one 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.440
 Exercise in the water quite well 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.860
 but of course there are also people who are just better in front of the camera 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.100
 Of course, that means yes of my mum longest under 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.240
 Water what a photographer so irritated 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.409
 it's not just the photography that's the diving view that not too 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.509
 four years still far that is life under water of the weightless 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.490
 and then also the nature that I see and discoverer and also with many 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.890
 Dives I discover something new again 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.210
 And to take pictures of course is also less beautiful thing about what you 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.110
 SID and what you experienced percent of non-smokers to show or even 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.640
 the divers who go in I am also trainings 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.490
 Show them what you can discover there 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.490
 Therefore it is easy to get excited about the choirs 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.530
 Camera is so that they can stop synonymous make the videos you have this 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.009
 Also test the function 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.200
 Of course, that's also the great thing about the camera that you get from 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.560
 Picture can change to the video for me is anyway the digital photography 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.510
 not so underwater yet not so familiar that he produced lost 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.840
 For me it's just about every new one in the digital field and there too 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.440
 these 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.300
 To possibilities that I did not know before that one can switch from 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.090
 Photo of Video that's it 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.819
 quite fascinating yes 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.609
 do you have the function as simple goals 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:13.089
 very simple 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:17.010
 more Tobias Fotograf Editor of the theater magazine 2 f 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.930
 and photographed underwater for the first time today with the Lumix tz7 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.339
 is it because you did the astonishingly good 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:28.599
 Percent of the year's replaced reports 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.760
 Of course, reversals about the world and our readers are also gone 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.499
 again under water on the way 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:38.729
 and the percent Lumix is â€‹â€‹of course both above and below 

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:41.830
 Water and what I'm especially percent Rolf Ende 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.019
 that was next to not only photos but also videos 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.299
 Percent that is very easy for me as a lecturer inexperienced 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.379
 Underwater photographers or forever 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.489
 percent the actual at the first good 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.389
 if it so that the lumix tz7 its mirrors 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:00.499
 could replace a flex camera in the long term 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:03.499
 Well, I put my 4 front-page photos we 

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:12.859
 especially Karl, of course, for underwater shots you want 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.469
 you do not carry the big parts with you or extra film equipment 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:18.269
 Carry photo equipment with you 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.230
 Since I can imagine very well that one was old one or 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.230
 other photo could also print 

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:27.979
 pages 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.739

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:50.309
