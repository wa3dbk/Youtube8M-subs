00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
forging with the hammer that's what this

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:22.920 
forging with the hammer that's what this
weapon<00:03:17.260> was<00:03:17.879> so<00:03:19.829> gee<00:03:21.420> look<00:03:22.420> at<00:03:22.510> how<00:03:22.659> you<00:03:22.719> fit

weapon was so gee look at how you fit

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:32.429 
weapon was so gee look at how you fit
this<00:03:23.049> on<00:03:24.540> oh<00:03:29.849> well<00:03:30.849> it<00:03:31.060> doesn't<00:03:31.269> matter<00:03:31.480> but<00:03:31.900> if

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:32.439 
this on oh well it doesn't matter but if

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:34.199 
this on oh well it doesn't matter but if
you<00:03:32.560> could<00:03:32.680> find<00:03:32.739> out<00:03:33.099> a<00:03:33.159> way<00:03:33.280> there<00:03:33.760> is<00:03:33.879> a<00:03:33.909> way

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
you could find out a way there is a way

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.449 
you could find out a way there is a way
where<00:03:34.450> he<00:03:34.659> can<00:03:34.840> hold<00:03:35.109> it<00:03:35.319> with<00:03:35.590> two<00:03:35.620> hands<00:03:36.129> so<00:03:36.629> I

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
where he can hold it with two hands so I

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.459 
where he can hold it with two hands so I
think<00:03:39.459> it's<00:03:39.760> pretty<00:03:39.969> decent<00:03:40.209> compared<00:03:41.109> to<00:03:41.290> the

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:41.469 
think it's pretty decent compared to the

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:44.129 
think it's pretty decent compared to the
show<00:03:42.090> if<00:03:43.090> you<00:03:43.180> want<00:03:43.359> to<00:03:43.419> put<00:03:43.540> a<00:03:43.569> licker<00:03:43.780> just
