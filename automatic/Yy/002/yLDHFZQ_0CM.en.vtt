is<00:02:14.270> totally<00:02:14.620> this<00:02:15.620> bush<00:02:15.920> got<00:02:16.100> so<00:02:16.280> big<00:02:16.489> it

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
is totally this bush got so big it

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.580 
is totally this bush got so big it
totally<00:02:17.209> choked<00:02:17.510> out<00:02:17.690> this<00:02:17.900> other<00:02:18.050> bush<00:02:18.319> and

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
totally choked out this other bush and

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
totally choked out this other bush and
caused<00:02:18.800> all<00:02:19.330> kinds<00:02:20.330> of<00:02:20.420> death<00:02:20.630> and<00:02:21.459> that's<00:02:22.459> why

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
caused all kinds of death and that's why

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.370 
caused all kinds of death and that's why
it's<00:02:22.760> so<00:02:22.850> necessary<00:02:22.880> to<00:02:23.720> prune<00:02:23.930> these<00:02:24.110> things

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380

as you can see up here you can actually

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.880
