00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:09.860
 When the 21st century, mankind has made a lot of mistakes and our home 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:12.530
 The mood is devastated. Food is decreasing. 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.740
 Humanity gets harder and harder to survive. 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:20.449
 I want to find answers in space, not Earth. 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:24.680
 Cooper, a former parlor with screws'll Dunn built a factory in humans can live 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:26.240
 We are still in the universe of the universe. 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.439
 Can I sleep well ? 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.160
 Yes 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.160
 Interstellar Le 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.700
 Interstellar Christopher Nolan has been very active in casting before the release 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:41.489
 It is the work which received hot attention 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:45.480
 Two million domestic audiences have already been lightly released. 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.920
 Interstellar is imeneun hobulho the film diverge as many people spoke 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.789
 It is clear. 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:55.589
 The wormhole black hole, which is mainly covered in this way, 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:01:00.030
 It pointed out that the film is very appropriate, even once the usual interest in the universe 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:02.339
 It may be interesting to you, but it is very 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.880
 It can be boring. 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:07.409
 How the women of astrophysics itself is a surface that can support the upcoming 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.430
 Because 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:15.060
 In fact there are other parts of the draft that Europe does not have 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:19.200
 I'm surprised that there is a whole part of the impression. 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:23.460
 In the early part, there is a portion that is put in too long , 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:27.990
 I do not know if I want the y-contrast effect when I go over 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.570
 This is really creepy when the body has too yirwot light seen in the film visual effects 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.700
 I still can not forget the feeling of it. 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:38.790
 Ever black hole is not a visual representation of this potion is paired to Kip Thorne 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:42.930
 To come closer to the reality created by the Advisory Committee invited 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.150
 Other than that, it would be obvious that the moon would look like this if it actually existed . 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.780
 It was so beautiful. 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:53.280
 I can say that I am not the beauty of Uji and the universe is coming to us 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:56.640
 That greatness is enough to impress us. 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:00.780
 Interstellar's story is well structured. 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:04.920
 As always, if you want to find us in a science fiction movie like Interstellar, 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.600
 There is no end, but except for that, the electricity using the relativity of time 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.530
 I really did . 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:14.760
 Personally, I thought that the movie itself is similar yirang dichroic ago 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:18.240
 Inception The element of time is a classic element that comes in reverse and storage 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:22.260
 I would like to raise my hand before white 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:25.200
 Interstellar is a bit tricky when it comes to crisis 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:29.550
 I felt a lot. 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:33.629
 It seemed to me that the infant Interstellar wanted to say two things. 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:38.640
 The first is that we are in the universe and the universe told Good figured beauty 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:43.230
 How lonely there is to be a small being . 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:46.610
 In this way, you are evaluating the position and the marie in the article, 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:51.110
 I'd like to throw a ticket to him. 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:54.920
 The second is quite philosophical about love and human nature. 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.140
 About the role of space, but kkaena plate, more so the more paradoxical 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.310
 I think it's coming. 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:04.700
 In fact, the marketability of the reasons the film to the philosophy of his own, which I like a director Nolan 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:09.640
 Indeyo because it does not become very well in the film nokyeonae 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.640
 In that respect, I believe Stella has not failed. 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:17.720
 Interstellar is on his way to approach the subject itself attractive to anyone 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:22.230
 Though it may not be 100 yen , the way the movie gets to us 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:26.580
 So far we have gone out in a way that we could not have done with other movies. 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:31.049
 Oh, Interstellar was a film I personally did not meet my expectations. 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.220
 The basic story line to the completion of the controversy I feel lonely holding the previous work 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.750
 I got it. 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:39.629
 But the English visual auditory this tomb was enough to raise our hearts 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:43.620
 The cover we're talking about is meaningful. 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:46.670
 Music was turned to the Kashi jinma is well dissolved in the film actors' really 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.670
 We have captured us. 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.090
 Ah 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.370
 Oh why in the chair Haaa 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:01.890
 I'd like to give 4 points out of 5 on 3 points. 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.930
 There must have been a great movie, but the topic itself was tricky shaving Zilla 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:08.849
 There was no shaving. 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:12.329
 Besides, the composition of the story was not as much as what the controversy showed us. 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:14.610
 The film was perfect, but it was not worth a million bucks 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:18.780
 Interstellar 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:23.540
 How did you feel? Leave a lot of your valuable feedback 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.540
 I Aced it with a cup itguyo idea so far
