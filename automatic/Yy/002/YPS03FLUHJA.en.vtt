so we've seen burnout paradise demoed
and<00:02:22.300> where<00:02:23.260> you<00:02:23.350> literally<00:02:23.620> just<00:02:23.890> hold<00:02:24.130> on<00:02:24.310> to

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
and where you literally just hold on to

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.280 
and where you literally just hold on to
the<00:02:24.580> steering<00:02:24.790> wheel<00:02:25.000> like<00:02:25.180> this<00:02:25.209> and<00:02:26.080> then

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
the steering wheel like this and then

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.190 
the steering wheel like this and then
and<00:02:26.670> your<00:02:27.670> foot<00:02:28.000> is<00:02:28.209> our<00:02:28.630> flat<00:02:28.870> on<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.080> floor

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
and your foot is our flat on the floor

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.720 
and your foot is our flat on the floor
with<00:02:29.410> no<00:02:29.560> controller<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.340> that's<00:02:30.580> your

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
with no controller and that's your

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.350 
with no controller and that's your
accelerator<00:02:31.470> so<00:02:32.790> it's<00:02:33.790> going<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.060> compete

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
accelerator so it's going to compete

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.390 
accelerator so it's going to compete
with<00:02:34.600> like<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:35.050> wii<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.650> there's<00:02:36.100> kind<00:02:36.340> of

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
with like the wii and there's kind of

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.770 
with like the wii and there's kind of
that<00:02:36.550> interactive<00:02:37.209> game<00:02:37.390> plan<00:02:37.630> I<00:02:37.660> think

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
that interactive game plan I think

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.600 
that interactive game plan I think
PlayStation<00:02:38.440> have<00:02:38.560> got<00:02:38.739> a<00:02:38.769> motion<00:02:39.250> control

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
PlayStation have got a motion control

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.560 
PlayStation have got a motion control
coming<00:02:39.910> out<00:02:40.090> as<00:02:40.239> well<00:02:40.420> as<00:02:40.570> share<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:43.450> it's

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
coming out as well as share and so it's

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:44.729 
coming out as well as share and so it's
going<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:43.720> interact<00:02:44.080> it's<00:02:44.320> going<00:02:44.440> to<00:02:44.500> compete

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
going to interact it's going to compete

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.949 
going to interact it's going to compete
with<00:02:44.920> that<00:02:44.950> interactive<00:02:45.730> game<00:02:45.910> play<00:02:46.150> and<00:02:46.360> but

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
there will be no controller there's some

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.460 
there will be no controller there's some

resources and just for the camera so

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.939 
resources and just for the camera so
games<00:04:56.430> like<00:04:56.610> halo<00:04:56.970> 3<00:04:57.330> and<00:04:57.600> call<00:04:57.870> of<00:04:57.990> duty<00:04:58.320> they

games like halo 3 and call of duty they

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:00.439 
games like halo 3 and call of duty they
already<00:04:59.190> push<00:04:59.490> your<00:04:59.669> xbox<00:05:00.000> to<00:05:00.150> the<00:05:00.240> max

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
they're already using all of your

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.330 
they're already using all of your
processing<00:05:02.490> power<00:05:02.699> and<00:05:03.500> so<00:05:04.500> it's<00:05:04.650> unclear<00:05:05.130> as

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
processing power and so it's unclear as

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.770 
processing power and so it's unclear as
to<00:05:05.430> whether<00:05:05.580> the<00:05:05.820> game<00:05:06.030> developers<00:05:06.539> are<00:05:06.630> going

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
to whether the game developers are going

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.200 
to whether the game developers are going
to<00:05:06.840> make<00:05:07.020> a<00:05:07.199> game<00:05:07.440> which<00:05:08.280> uses<00:05:08.639> less<00:05:08.789> resources

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
to make a game which uses less resources

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.000 
to make a game which uses less resources
just<00:05:09.570> so<00:05:09.750> that<00:05:09.900> they<00:05:10.020> can<00:05:10.229> include<00:05:10.560> project

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
just so that they can include project

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.310 
just so that they can include project
natal<00:05:11.310> or<00:05:12.060> whether<00:05:12.240> they<00:05:12.449> they'd<00:05:12.930> leave<00:05:13.139> our

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
natal or whether they they'd leave our

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.659 
natal or whether they they'd leave our
project<00:05:13.680> a<00:05:13.710> towel<00:05:13.889> and<00:05:13.919> they<00:05:14.190> still<00:05:14.460> make

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
project a towel and they still make

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:18.050 
project a towel and they still make

means is the AI the artificial
intelligence<00:05:33.750> in<00:05:33.870> the<00:05:33.900> game<00:05:34.110> isn't<00:05:34.380> going<00:05:34.680> to

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
intelligence in the game isn't going to

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.040 
intelligence in the game isn't going to
be<00:05:34.830> as<00:05:34.950> good<00:05:35.160> and<00:05:35.370> so<00:05:36.060> the<00:05:36.180> way<00:05:36.330> you<00:05:36.750> interact

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
be as good and so the way you interact

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.960 
be as good and so the way you interact
with<00:05:37.229> an<00:05:37.380> enemy<00:05:37.710> and<00:05:37.919> they're<00:05:38.669> not<00:05:38.760> going<00:05:38.820> to

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
with an enemy and they're not going to

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.330 
with an enemy and they're not going to
be<00:05:39.060> able<00:05:39.090> to<00:05:39.389> respond<00:05:40.260> in<00:05:40.530> the<00:05:40.590> same<00:05:40.860> way<00:05:41.099> as

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
be able to respond in the same way as

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.550 
be able to respond in the same way as
they<00:05:41.460> do<00:05:41.520> it<00:05:41.729> in<00:05:41.789> a<00:05:41.820> minute<00:05:41.940> and<00:05:42.229> then<00:05:43.229> like

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
they do it in a minute and then like

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.810 
they do it in a minute and then like
when<00:05:43.680> you<00:05:43.770> shoot<00:05:44.010> something<00:05:44.280> and<00:05:44.460> it<00:05:44.550> blows<00:05:44.760> up

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
when you shoot something and it blows up

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.270 
when you shoot something and it blows up
and<00:05:45.240> all<00:05:46.020> the<00:05:46.199> smoke<00:05:46.620> and<00:05:46.919> the<00:05:46.949> bits<00:05:47.190> that

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
and all the smoke and the bits that

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.770 
and all the smoke and the bits that
blast<00:05:47.639> out<00:05:47.940> and<00:05:48.210> all<00:05:48.300> that<00:05:48.330> kind<00:05:48.690> of<00:05:48.720> stuff

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
blast out and all that kind of stuff

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.689 
blast out and all that kind of stuff
that's<00:05:49.620> all<00:05:49.889> being<00:05:50.010> processed<00:05:50.310> from<00:05:50.580> the

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 
that's all being processed from the

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:52.520 
that's all being processed from the
background<00:05:50.960> so<00:05:51.960> there's<00:05:52.080> going<00:05:52.169> to<00:05:52.289> be<00:05:52.320> less

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
background so there's going to be less

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.339 
background so there's going to be less
resources<00:05:53.070> for<00:05:53.669> that<00:05:53.880> kind<00:05:54.180> of<00:05:54.240> activity<00:05:54.419> and

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:55.349 
resources for that kind of activity and

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:57.189 
resources for that kind of activity and
it's<00:05:55.500> going<00:05:55.590> to<00:05:55.650> be<00:05:55.740> used<00:05:55.949> up<00:05:56.099> by<00:05:56.220> the<00:05:56.280> camera

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 
it's going to be used up by the camera

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:00.770 
it's going to be used up by the camera
so<00:05:58.199> this<00:05:59.160> could<00:05:59.370> either<00:05:59.520> go<00:05:59.699> two<00:05:59.910> ways<00:06:00.090> high<00:06:00.599> in

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
so this could either go two ways high in

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.870 
so this could either go two ways high in
games<00:06:01.020> could<00:06:01.349> either<00:06:01.440> could<00:06:02.039> not<00:06:02.250> include

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
games could either could not include

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.570 
games could either could not include
that<00:06:03.030> kind<00:06:03.270> of<00:06:03.330> stuff<00:06:03.570> and<00:06:04.250> just<00:06:05.250> use<00:06:05.430> the

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
that kind of stuff and just use the

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.040 
that kind of stuff and just use the
camera<00:06:05.760> or<00:06:06.090> they<00:06:06.330> can<00:06:06.449> leave<00:06:06.570> the<00:06:06.690> camera<00:06:06.960> out

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
camera or they can leave the camera out

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.930 
camera or they can leave the camera out
and<00:06:07.260> they<00:06:07.500> can<00:06:07.650> stomach<00:06:07.860> really<00:06:08.400> interactive

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
and they can stomach really interactive

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.439 
and they can stomach really interactive
games<00:06:09.150> and<00:06:09.620> all<00:06:10.669> project<00:06:11.669> natal<00:06:11.970> could<00:06:12.270> be

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:12.449 
games and all project natal could be

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:16.460 
games and all project natal could be
like<00:06:12.660> the<00:06:13.169> wii<00:06:13.440> for<00:06:14.370> the<00:06:14.669> xbox<00:06:15.120> where<00:06:15.810> they're

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470 
like the wii for the xbox where they're
