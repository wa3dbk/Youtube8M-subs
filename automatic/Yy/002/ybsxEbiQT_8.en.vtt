00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.670
 to present to our government is a 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.340
 little active challenge and that is similar to 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.320
 same policeman challenge but different in 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.180
 the sense that an athlete shoots 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.330
 almost professional that had been a lot 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.340
 way and I had learned and it was about 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.580
 recover it from deciding it in a while 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.890
 well short of Chinese in this case embargo 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.720
 trujillo a story from the magazine that 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.119
 will come out in February the magazine has 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.870
 rescindido rose magazine is a magazine 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.489
 then of rustic urban theater of 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.890
 sports a little young patient that 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.479
 he wants to be a shaker of everything and 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.159
 within the contact interview 

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:44.540
 communication an interview about these 

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:46.970
 ravines on a thousand people about 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.070
 project elements of the interview 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.320
 he feels very attracted by the theme of the challenge 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.330
 of isma and that as we say in their 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.309
 preparations to change a person 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.010
 in as little time as they are eight weeks 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.570
 so the day does not live with him 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.120
 we agreed 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.120
 a less conventional challenge because as 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.310
 You will see in some guidelines that 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.440
 had the button but we think that 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.940
 can reach more people and that will be more 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.659
 easy that you can meet 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.850
 from home or what you fuck about it is 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.190
 rethink of 8 weeks and those of 13 of 1 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.830
 that this next Monday to 9 of 3 that is 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.160
 a Friday of the month of March two weeks 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.200
 natural and simply in the 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.330
 specialties that has its challenge is that 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.220
 there will be no gym that is to say only 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.100
 will work with two dumbbells a bar and 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.050
 a bread and the challenge will be simply 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.399
 transforming the body he is a 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.410
 person from the Netherlands but who is not 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:42.200
 form would not be defined and is 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.270
 toned and is here with a lot of volume 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.550
 and few laws are out of shape 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.289
 so if the gym thing is very 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.149
 important for all the people who are not 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.039
 criminals you enter at home that 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.500
 you enter the street that attends ponte de 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:57.440
 free form way without going to any 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.910
 center where there is this access 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.910
 to all kinds of cardiovascular machines 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.650
 the challenge will be in eight weeks to change its 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.350

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.600
