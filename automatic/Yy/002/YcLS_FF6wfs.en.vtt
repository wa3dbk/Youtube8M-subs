of plastic it is it also has the letters
HDPE<00:00:34.140> which<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.280> acronym<00:00:35.430> for<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.850> type

HDPE which is the acronym for the type
of<00:00:36.059> plastic<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.660> this<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.590> reason

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
of plastic that this is and the reason

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.979 
of plastic that this is and the reason
this<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.219> important<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.629> different

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
this is important is that the different

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.110 
this is important is that the different
types<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.410> plastic<00:00:40.860> one<00:00:41.309> through<00:00:41.489> seven<00:00:41.820> need

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
types of plastic one through seven need

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.690 
types of plastic one through seven need
to<00:00:42.270> be<00:00:42.390> recycled<00:00:43.020> by<00:00:43.530> themselves<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.430> order<00:00:44.610> to

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
to be recycled by themselves in order to

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.670 
to be recycled by themselves in order to
create<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.210> product<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.079> same<00:00:46.440> as

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
create a product that is the same as

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.740 
create a product that is the same as
this<00:00:47.460> product<00:00:47.910> if<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.120> mix<00:00:48.329> plastics

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
this product if you mix plastics

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.930 
this product if you mix plastics
together<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.350> creates<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.890> weaker<00:00:50.219> plastic<00:00:50.700> so

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
together it creates a weaker plastic so

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.939 
together it creates a weaker plastic so
it's<00:00:51.180> not<00:00:51.300> as<00:00:51.480> useful<00:00:51.930> then<00:00:52.079> now<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.440> good<00:00:52.680> rule

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
it's not as useful then now a good rule

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.139 
it's not as useful then now a good rule
of<00:00:52.980> thumb<00:00:53.129> when<00:00:53.579> thinking<00:00:53.879> about<00:00:54.000> what

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
of thumb when thinking about what

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.369 
of thumb when thinking about what
plastics<00:00:55.020> are<00:00:55.230> more<00:00:55.500> or<00:00:55.710> less<00:00:55.739> toxic<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:57.379> 12:45

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
plastics are more or less toxic is 12:45

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.310 
plastics are more or less toxic is 12:45
stay<00:00:59.039> alive<00:00:59.340> three<00:01:00.149> six<00:01:00.390> seven<00:01:00.570> straight<00:01:01.170> to

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
stay alive three six seven straight to

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.319 
stay alive three six seven straight to
heaven<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.370> plastics<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:02.940> have<00:01:03.180> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
heaven so the plastics that have the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.329 
heaven so the plastics that have the
number<00:01:03.570> one<00:01:03.840> two<00:01:04.199> four<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.650> five<00:01:04.979> are

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
number one two four and five are

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.270 
number one two four and five are
generally<00:01:05.970> safer<00:01:06.540> than<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.229> plastics<00:01:07.770> three

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
generally safer than the plastics three

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.120 
generally safer than the plastics three
six<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.880> seven<00:01:09.390> now<00:01:09.810> one<00:01:10.260> thing<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.560> want<00:01:11.010> to

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
six and seven now one thing I want to

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.580 
six and seven now one thing I want to
say<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.880> even<00:01:12.090> though<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:13.140> have<00:01:13.170> that

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
say is that even though you have that

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.070 
say is that even though you have that
little<00:01:13.890> rule<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.220> thumb<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.729> personally<00:01:15.630> avoid

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
little rule of thumb I personally avoid

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.800 
little rule of thumb I personally avoid
plastic<00:01:16.740> around<00:01:17.400> my<00:01:17.790> food<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.450> drink

plastic bottles I never put food into
plastic<00:01:24.540> containers<00:01:25.049> because<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:26.040> just<00:01:26.430> feel

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
plastic containers because I just feel

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.770 
plastic containers because I just feel
like<00:01:26.820> there's<00:01:27.060> just<00:01:27.119> too<00:01:27.420> much<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.630> an

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
like there's just too much of an

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.690 
like there's just too much of an
opportunity<00:01:28.320> for<00:01:28.530> plastic<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.159> leach<00:01:29.400> into

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
the food or the drink and I just want to

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.219 
the food or the drink and I just want to
avoid<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:33.869> important<00:01:34.200> because

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
avoid that and this is important because

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.170 
avoid that and this is important because
