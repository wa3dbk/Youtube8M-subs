00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.950 
and there you can see it it's a golden
tea<00:02:31.880> lush<00:02:32.180> green<00:02:33.040> and<00:02:34.270> as<00:02:35.270> you<00:02:35.390> can<00:02:35.480> see<00:02:35.720> like

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
tea lush green and as you can see like

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.980 
tea lush green and as you can see like
around<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.550> shade<00:02:37.760> stick<00:02:38.180> is<00:02:38.390> like<00:02:38.660> how<00:02:38.840> it

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
around the shade stick is like how it

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.860 
around the shade stick is like how it
appears<00:02:39.760> without<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.910> base<00:02:41.090> so<00:02:41.390> it's<00:02:41.570> very

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
appears without the base so it's very

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.010 
appears without the base so it's very
beautiful<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:43.790> use<00:02:43.970> it<00:02:44.150> with<00:02:44.480> or<00:02:44.720> without<00:02:44.840> a

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
beautiful to use it with or without a

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.850 
beautiful to use it with or without a
black<00:02:45.260> base<00:02:45.560> and<00:02:45.890> I<00:02:46.610> guess<00:02:47.570> that's<00:02:47.810> why<00:02:48.650> this

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
black base and I guess that's why this

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.180 
black base and I guess that's why this
palette<00:02:49.220> is<00:02:49.340> so<00:02:49.370> useful<00:02:49.700> is<00:02:50.060> because<00:02:50.390> you<00:02:50.630> can

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
palette is so useful is because you can

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.699 
palette is so useful is because you can
use<00:02:52.190> it<00:02:52.340> for<00:02:52.490> so<00:02:52.610> many<00:02:52.640> different<00:02:52.820> things<00:02:53.120> and

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
use it for so many different things and

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.530 
use it for so many different things and
the<00:02:54.709> next<00:02:54.860> color<00:02:55.280> is<00:02:55.490> like<00:02:55.670> this<00:02:55.850> blue<00:02:56.209> color
