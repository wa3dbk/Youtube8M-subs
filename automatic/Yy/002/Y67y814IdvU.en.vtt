00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510 

I<00:00:00.240> felt<00:00:00.659> this<00:00:00.750> parable<00:00:01.260> pay<00:00:01.500> tithe<00:00:01.770> I'd<00:00:02.129> have

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
I felt this parable pay tithe I'd have

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.679 
I felt this parable pay tithe I'd have
been<00:00:02.700> just<00:00:02.850> kind<00:00:03.030> of<00:00:03.120> sitting<00:00:03.419> in<00:00:03.540> my<00:00:03.629> closet

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
been just kind of sitting in my closet

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.690 
been just kind of sitting in my closet
but<00:00:04.589> haven't<00:00:04.890> been<00:00:04.920> able<00:00:05.009> to<00:00:05.279> thrown<00:00:05.609> away

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
but haven't been able to thrown away

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.579 
but haven't been able to thrown away
because<00:00:05.910> I<00:00:06.120> only<00:00:06.210> went<00:00:06.509> once<00:00:06.810> and<00:00:07.109> had<00:00:07.290> to<00:00:07.379> run

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
because I only went once and had to run

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.640 
because I only went once and had to run
in<00:00:07.770> it<00:00:07.919> so<00:00:08.580> I<00:00:08.610> decided<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:09.269> cut<00:00:09.719> it<00:00:09.840> up<00:00:09.960> and<00:00:10.200> use

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
in it so I decided to cut it up and use

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.830 
in it so I decided to cut it up and use
on<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.130> fabric<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.910> curl<00:00:12.210> my<00:00:12.330> hair<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.630> then

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
on the fabric to curl my hair and then

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.930 
on the fabric to curl my hair and then
thought<00:00:13.049> it'd<00:00:13.200> be<00:00:13.230> really<00:00:13.500> great<00:00:13.710> since<00:00:14.070> it's

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
thought it'd be really great since it's

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.910 
thought it'd be really great since it's
so<00:00:15.150> weightless<00:00:15.450> it's<00:00:15.990> not<00:00:16.170> gonna<00:00:16.320> string<00:00:16.770> your

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
so weightless it's not gonna string your

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.179 
so weightless it's not gonna string your
scalp<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.720> they're<00:00:18.720> stretchy<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.710> it's<00:00:19.980> very

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
scalp and they're stretchy so it's very

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.429 
scalp and they're stretchy so it's very
easy<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.640> work<00:00:20.789> with<00:00:21.000> on<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.779> bottom<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.410> have

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
easy to work with on the bottom I have

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.830 
easy to work with on the bottom I have
three<00:00:23.130> on<00:00:23.250> each<00:00:23.490> side<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:24.180> kind<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:24.689> just

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
three on each side that I kind of just

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.220 
three on each side that I kind of just
alternated<00:00:25.560> with<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:27.269> pattern<00:00:27.660> so<00:00:28.080> my

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
alternated with the the pattern so my

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.650 
alternated with the the pattern so my
curl<00:00:28.529> inward<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:29.670> my<00:00:29.910> girl<00:00:30.179> outward

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660

into these big messy waves which are

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.980 
into these big messy waves which are
really<00:03:00.220> really<00:03:00.490> pretty<00:03:00.880> in<00:03:01.180> my<00:03:01.210> opinion<00:03:01.780> and

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
really really pretty in my opinion and

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.680 
really really pretty in my opinion and
the<00:03:02.410> top<00:03:02.770> layers<00:03:03.070> which<00:03:03.400> which<00:03:04.210> I<00:03:04.330> didn't<00:03:04.600> do<00:03:04.660> a

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
the top layers which which I didn't do a

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.440 
the top layers which which I didn't do a
very<00:03:04.960> good<00:03:05.080> job<00:03:05.260> of<00:03:05.440> curling<00:03:06.100> to<00:03:06.940> begin<00:03:07.210> with

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
very good job of curling to begin with

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.350 
very good job of curling to begin with
or<00:03:08.170> just<00:03:08.440> kind<00:03:08.650> of<00:03:08.740> straighten<00:03:09.220> now<00:03:09.430> if<00:03:10.120> I<00:03:10.240> have

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
or just kind of straighten now if I have

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.940 
or just kind of straighten now if I have
our<00:03:10.450> curly<00:03:10.840> hair<00:03:11.050> with<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.260> same<00:03:11.470> technique

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
our curly hair with the same technique

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.160 
our curly hair with the same technique
in<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.250> future<00:03:12.610> I<00:03:12.880> would<00:03:13.150> definitely<00:03:13.810> split

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
in the future I would definitely split

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.199 
in the future I would definitely split
the<00:03:14.440> top<00:03:14.650> portion<00:03:14.980> into<00:03:15.310> at<00:03:15.850> least<00:03:15.910> three

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
the top portion into at least three

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.910 
the top portion into at least three
sections<00:03:16.870> so<00:03:16.990> I'll<00:03:17.110> get<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.440> same<00:03:17.680> type<00:03:17.860> of

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
sections so I'll get the same type of

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.340 
sections so I'll get the same type of
effect<00:03:18.310> on<00:03:18.430> getting<00:03:18.880> down<00:03:19.060> here<00:03:19.510> in<00:03:20.260> the

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
effect on getting down here in the

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.690 
effect on getting down here in the
morning<00:03:20.680> when<00:03:20.800> it<00:03:20.920> was<00:03:20.950> like<00:03:21.160> sir<00:03:21.310> poofy<00:03:21.670> I

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
morning when it was like sir poofy I

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.490 
morning when it was like sir poofy I
actually<00:03:21.970> had<00:03:22.300> to<00:03:22.390> run<00:03:22.570> out<00:03:22.720> so<00:03:22.930> I<00:03:22.959> wasn't<00:03:23.290> able

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
actually had to run out so I wasn't able

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.790 
actually had to run out so I wasn't able
to<00:03:23.680> fill<00:03:23.920> myself<00:03:24.100> after<00:03:24.610> two<00:03:25.330> hours<00:03:25.660> which<00:03:25.989> was

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
to fill myself after two hours which was

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.610 
to fill myself after two hours which was
when<00:03:27.070> it<00:03:27.280> looked<00:03:27.550> the<00:03:27.760> best<00:03:27.790> I<00:03:28.180> think<00:03:28.209> I<00:03:28.720> just

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
when it looked the best I think I just

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.590 
when it looked the best I think I just
had<00:03:29.800> it<00:03:29.920> in<00:03:30.040> a<00:03:30.070> messy<00:03:30.550> side<00:03:30.790> bun<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:31.239> just<00:03:31.450> look

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
had it in a messy side bun and just look

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.780 
had it in a messy side bun and just look
like<00:03:31.810> I<00:03:32.080> had<00:03:32.470> a<00:03:32.500> lot<00:03:32.830> of<00:03:32.860> volume<00:03:33.190> and<00:03:33.550> texture

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
like I had a lot of volume and texture

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.030 
like I had a lot of volume and texture
going<00:03:34.030> on<00:03:34.300> so<00:03:34.660> you<00:03:35.110> can<00:03:35.230> always<00:03:35.500> tell<00:03:35.890> this

going on so you can always tell this

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.290 
going on so you can always tell this
your<00:03:36.250> hair<00:03:36.489> that<00:03:36.700> way<00:03:36.850> you<00:03:36.910> don't<00:03:37.090> have<00:03:37.180> to

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
for some reason the heat free method

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.160 
for some reason the heat free method
doesn't<00:03:42.220> work<00:03:42.400> out<00:03:42.700> right<00:03:43.570> when<00:03:43.810> you<00:03:43.900> take<00:03:44.050> it

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.590 
doesn't work out right when you take it
