00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.470
 and that I'm looking for the 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.750
 shows because we are going to 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.200
 do something to present to Pauline 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:15.910
 Pauline blond first encounter 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.910
 paulina with thalÃ­a 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:26.890
 then we who we want 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.890
 do we want to do all 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.490
 then the idea what is important is to act 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.090
 to something like carpet style 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.090
 red 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.879
 simply also 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.760
 the other new ones run with all the 

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:55.250
 expenses but now when you are 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.689
 managing with you the schedules we 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.510
 they tell us about a job that you can 

00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:03.960
 be three days two and mostly do 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:07.019
 castings we can give 200 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.019
 [Music] 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:17.119
 I think the price is well 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.140
 below what is stipulated 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.140
 within the market 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.910
 but the important thing is the opportunity 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.100
 also that we are going to pay everything I think 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.170
 that you who are expressing encouragement 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.750
 I should take that opportunity because 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.880
 there is one thing that we love you the huerna 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.979
 for the casting and other things that you 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.979
 you think you're already the luminary 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.180
 the coffee and the other is that you do not go 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.419
 to think that you are a very long light 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.419
 [Music] 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.579
 boys is doing very well and 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:05.920
 is doing a thing avis either 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.759
 because sometimes they start screaming this 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.759
 come back like crazy 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.489
 when you suck 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.629
 today I thought that at least I could 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.629
 earn me a thousand dollars 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:35.140
 to be thinking that he is not going to turn 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.140
 in slow motion 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:46.490
 [Music] 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.780
 I do not like 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.780
 and they tell me 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.659
 and he 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:59.549
 [Music] 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:59.549
 the screen divided into two cameras 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.040
 as always the evil ones apologize 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.660
 national 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.480
 although anyway 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.720
 wrong to 20 fries 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.210
 Y 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:43.080
 do not breathe behave 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:45.710
 [Music] 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.710

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:54.159
