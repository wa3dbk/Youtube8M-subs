to<00:00:32.189> be<00:00:32.309> one<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.669> few<00:00:32.880> people<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.450> say<00:00:33.630> that

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
to be one of the few people to say that

to be one of the few people to say that
watchdogs<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.829> my<00:00:34.950> opinion<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.550> better<00:00:36.180> than

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
watchdogs in my opinion is better than

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.080 
watchdogs in my opinion is better than
GTA<00:00:37.170> 5<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:38.309> think<00:00:38.520> it's<00:00:38.640> actually<00:00:38.820> better

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
GTA 5 and I think it's actually better

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.959 
GTA 5 and I think it's actually better
than<00:00:39.570> GTA<00:00:39.899> 5<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> lot<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.530> ways<00:00:40.710> -<00:00:41.010> first<00:00:41.820> of

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
than GTA 5 in a lot of ways - first of

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.299 
than GTA 5 in a lot of ways - first of
all<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.480> main<00:00:42.690> thing<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.410> story<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.920> feel

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
all the main thing is the story I feel

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.090 
all the main thing is the story I feel
like<00:00:44.370> GTA<00:00:44.789> 5<00:00:45.059> story<00:00:45.420> was<00:00:45.989> good<00:00:46.289> but<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:46.980> was

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
like GTA 5 story was good but it was

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.490 
like GTA 5 story was good but it was
overrated<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.850> very<00:00:48.090> boring<00:00:48.329> at<00:00:48.600> times<00:00:48.870> it

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
overrated and very boring at times it

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.930 
overrated and very boring at times it
only<00:00:49.829> started<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.309> get<00:00:50.520> good<00:00:50.700> when<00:00:50.850> you

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
only started to get good when you

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.700 
only started to get good when you
finally<00:00:51.149> met<00:00:51.420> Trevor<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:52.020> think<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.559> was<00:00:52.680> a

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
finally met Trevor I think that was a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.369 
finally met Trevor I think that was a
good<00:00:53.250> bit<00:00:53.460> into<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.760> story<00:00:54.030> -<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.449> also<00:00:55.230> feel

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
good bit into the story - I also feel

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.470 
good bit into the story - I also feel
like<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.800> story<00:00:56.010> for<00:00:56.250> GTA<00:00:56.550> 5<00:00:56.789> was<00:00:57.000> dragged<00:00:57.300> on

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
like the story for GTA 5 was dragged on

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.840 
like the story for GTA 5 was dragged on
too<00:00:57.690> long<00:00:57.899> by<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.620> lot<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.949> pointless<00:00:59.340> missions

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
too long by a lot of pointless missions

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.729 
too long by a lot of pointless missions
which<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.449> think<00:01:00.660> they<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:00.989> added<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.469> there

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
which I think they just added in there

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.399 
which I think they just added in there
to<00:01:02.250> make<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.489> campaign<00:01:02.850> seem<00:01:03.149> longer<00:01:03.449> but<00:01:04.290> in

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
to make the campaign seem longer but in

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.590 
to make the campaign seem longer but in
watchdogs<00:01:04.790> actually<00:01:05.790> like<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.150> storytelling

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
watchdogs actually like the storytelling

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.810 
watchdogs actually like the storytelling
better<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.080> overall<00:01:07.470> plot<00:01:07.680> more<00:01:07.979> all<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
better and overall plot more all the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.399 
better and overall plot more all the
missions<00:01:09.119> seemed<00:01:09.299> like<00:01:09.510> they<00:01:09.689> had<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.930> purpose

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
missions seemed like they had a purpose

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.140 
missions seemed like they had a purpose
and<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.680> wasn't<00:01:11.400> going<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.820> bunch<00:01:12.000> of

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
and you wasn't going a bunch of

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.850 
and you wasn't going a bunch of
pointless<00:01:12.420> missions<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.439> game<00:01:13.590> was<00:01:13.740> just

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
pointless missions the game was just

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.230 
pointless missions the game was just
straight<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.280> point<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.760> was<00:01:15.000> still<00:01:15.210> a

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
straight to the point and it was still a

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.690 
straight to the point and it was still a
good<00:01:15.420> link<00:01:15.659> campaign<00:01:16.140> another<00:01:17.100> thing<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.580> is

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
good link campaign another thing that is

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.520 
good link campaign another thing that is
better<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.180> watchdogs<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.140> gameplay

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
better in watchdogs is the gameplay

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.830 
better in watchdogs is the gameplay
mechanics<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.280> watchdogs<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.299> movement<00:01:21.720> and

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
mechanics and watchdogs the movement and

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.749 
mechanics and watchdogs the movement and
shooting<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.290> much<00:01:22.590> more<00:01:22.830> smooth<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.369> fluid

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
shooting is much more smooth and fluid

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.510 
shooting is much more smooth and fluid
compared<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.540> GTA<00:01:24.720> 5<00:01:25.170> which<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:25.979> felt<00:01:26.159> like<00:01:26.400> it

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
compared to GTA 5 which I felt like it

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.149 
compared to GTA 5 which I felt like it
was<00:01:26.640> very<00:01:26.820> clunky<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.509> also<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.470> free<00:01:28.680> free

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
was very clunky and also the free free

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.679 
was very clunky and also the free free
aim<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.490> GTA<00:01:29.759> 5<00:01:30.000> was<00:01:30.240> terrible

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
aim in GTA 5 was terrible

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.600 
aim in GTA 5 was terrible
it<00:01:30.840> was<00:01:30.960> terrible<00:01:31.320> I'm<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:32.040> driving<00:01:32.369> in<00:01:32.460> both

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
it was terrible I'm the driving in both

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.780 
it was terrible I'm the driving in both
games<00:01:32.909> was<00:01:33.360> trash<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:34.409> be<00:01:34.560> honest<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.520> didn't

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
games was trash to be honest so I didn't

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.789 
games was trash to be honest so I didn't
want<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:35.970> talk<00:01:36.090> about<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.509> but<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.259> have<00:01:37.619> no

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
want to talk about that but I have no

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.410 
want to talk about that but I have no
idea<00:01:38.100> why<00:01:38.250> Rockstar<00:01:38.790> changed<00:01:39.150> some<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.360> the

GTA 5 multiplayer was trashed to me that
all<00:02:14.519> doing<00:02:14.819> crap<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.390> couldn't<00:02:15.870> deal<00:02:15.959> with<00:02:15.989> it

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
all doing crap I couldn't deal with it

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.140 
all doing crap I couldn't deal with it
it<00:02:16.379> was<00:02:16.709> just<00:02:16.890> running<00:02:17.159> around<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.700> whoever

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
it was just running around and whoever

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.839 
it was just running around and whoever
sees<00:02:18.330> who<00:02:18.510> first<00:02:18.810> locks<00:02:19.500> on<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.310> gets<00:02:20.730> the

sees who first locks on and gets the
kill<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.299> was<00:02:21.840> lame<00:02:22.080> and<00:02:22.470> casual<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.129> guess

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
kill it was lame and casual I guess

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.309
