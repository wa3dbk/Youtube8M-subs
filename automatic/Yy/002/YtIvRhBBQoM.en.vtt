00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.320 
running Stella Stella is a Atari 2600
emulator<00:04:17.810> run<00:04:18.810> that<00:04:18.989> guy<00:04:19.200> here

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
emulator run that guy here

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:26.890 
emulator run that guy here
and<00:04:21.330> we'll<00:04:22.290> pick<00:04:22.440> a<00:04:22.500> game<00:04:22.740> like<00:04:22.980> berserk<00:04:25.820> okay

wrong way
I<00:05:06.810> can<00:05:07.020> almost<00:05:07.140> fold<00:05:07.500> it<00:05:07.620> by<00:05:07.680> accident<00:05:09.890> but<00:05:10.890> in

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
I can almost fold it by accident but in

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:17.180 
I can almost fold it by accident but in
general<00:05:11.520> it<00:05:11.610> works<00:05:11.820> pretty<00:05:12.090> well<00:05:16.130> okay<00:05:17.130> you
