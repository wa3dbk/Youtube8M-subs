compatible with Android tablets but the

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.920 
compatible with Android tablets but the
problem<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.399> there's<00:00:35.579> no<00:00:35.730> filter<00:00:36.090> in<00:00:36.480> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
problem is that there's no filter in the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.840 
problem is that there's no filter in the
in<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.530> Play<00:00:37.710> Store<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:38.039> shows<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.670> which

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
in the Play Store that shows you which

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.520 
in the Play Store that shows you which
applications<00:00:39.480> have<00:00:39.719> been<00:00:39.930> properly

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
applications have been properly

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.939

optimized<00:00:41.129> for<00:00:41.850> larger<00:00:42.690> devices<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.410> that's

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
optimized for larger devices and that's

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.549 
optimized for larger devices and that's
basically<00:00:44.399> where<00:00:44.840> tabla<00:00:45.840> fide<00:00:45.989> market<00:00:46.350> comes

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
basically where tabla fide market comes

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.410 
basically where tabla fide market comes
in<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.280> when<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.489> first<00:00:47.760> launch<00:00:48.329> the

tablet optimized apps and the way we you
know<00:03:44.480> find<00:03:44.810> out<00:03:44.990> if<00:03:45.140> their<00:03:45.290> tablet<00:03:45.650> optimized

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
know find out if their tablet optimized

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.860 
know find out if their tablet optimized
or<00:03:46.490> not<00:03:46.610> is<00:03:46.850> basically<00:03:47.180> we<00:03:47.390> have<00:03:47.600> to<00:03:47.750> go

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
or not is basically we have to go

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.770 
or not is basically we have to go
through<00:03:48.640> we<00:03:49.640> have<00:03:49.790> a<00:03:49.820> search<00:03:50.000> process<00:03:50.480> and<00:03:50.720> we

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
through we have a search process and we

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.390 
through we have a search process and we
add<00:03:50.960> the<00:03:51.170> apps<00:03:51.320> manually<00:03:51.920> so<00:03:52.070> we<00:03:52.160> have<00:03:52.280> to

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
add the apps manually so we have to

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.970 
add the apps manually so we have to
actually<00:03:52.490> check<00:03:52.850> them<00:03:53.090> to<00:03:53.300> make<00:03:53.450> sure<00:03:53.660> that

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
actually check them to make sure that

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.800 
actually check them to make sure that
they<00:03:54.980> fall<00:03:55.280> within<00:03:55.490> our<00:03:55.880> guidelines<00:03:56.540> and

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
they fall within our guidelines and

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.030 
they fall within our guidelines and
recently<00:03:57.530> Google<00:03:57.710> has<00:03:58.040> published<00:03:58.490> a<00:03:59.950> sort<00:04:00.950> of

a a checklist of what tablet apps should
be<00:04:04.010> and<00:04:04.280> how<00:04:04.700> they<00:04:04.880> should<00:04:04.910> look<00:04:05.150> like<00:04:05.210> and

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
be and how they should look like and

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.480 
be and how they should look like and
we're<00:04:06.110> not<00:04:06.230> advocating<00:04:06.590> that<00:04:07.070> you<00:04:07.190> should

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.650 
have a separate tablet app in a phone
app<00:04:09.770> we<00:04:10.580> think<00:04:10.790> that<00:04:10.910> it<00:04:10.970> should<00:04:11.120> be<00:04:11.150> combined

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
app we think that it should be combined

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.040 
app we think that it should be combined
into<00:04:11.870> one<00:04:12.290> one<00:04:12.980> apk<00:04:13.460> or<00:04:13.490> one<00:04:13.760> file<00:04:14.090> so<00:04:14.780> that<00:04:14.810> you

looking for you know developers who have

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.960 
looking for you know developers who have
taken<00:04:24.350> the<00:04:24.410> time<00:04:24.620> to<00:04:24.919> optimize<00:04:25.430> their

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
taken the time to optimize their

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:26.580 
taken the time to optimize their
application

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
application

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.280 
application
that<00:04:26.800> you<00:04:26.980> know<00:04:27.100> to<00:04:27.310> pain<00:04:27.580> view<00:04:27.970> is<00:04:28.180> mostly<00:04:28.840> the

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
that you know to pain view is mostly the

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.840 
that you know to pain view is mostly the
the<00:04:29.530> most<00:04:29.710> common<00:04:29.800> way<00:04:30.130> to<00:04:30.160> do<00:04:30.340> it<00:04:30.460> like<00:04:30.699> we

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
the most common way to do it like we

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.990 
the most common way to do it like we
call<00:04:31.600> that<00:04:31.750> fragments<00:04:32.260> and<00:04:32.460> if<00:04:33.460> we<00:04:33.669> see<00:04:33.850> that

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
call that fragments and if we see that

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.670 
call that fragments and if we see that
it's<00:04:34.419> different<00:04:34.810> than<00:04:35.050> the<00:04:35.080> phone<00:04:35.440> app<00:04:35.650> and

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
it's different than the phone app and

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.890 
it's different than the phone app and
they<00:04:36.070> really<00:04:36.370> put<00:04:36.550> effort<00:04:36.880> into<00:04:37.030> it<00:04:37.240> we<00:04:37.419> add<00:04:37.720> it

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
they really put effort into it we add it

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.080 
they really put effort into it we add it
to<00:04:37.930> our<00:04:38.020> list<00:04:38.139> so<00:04:38.949> we<00:04:39.070> don't<00:04:39.220> just<00:04:39.370> add<00:04:39.580> in<00:04:39.820> you

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
to our list so we don't just add in you
