the level on to the right and right to
the<00:05:59.950> lab<00:06:00.450> so<00:06:01.450> you<00:06:01.510> can<00:06:01.780> have<00:06:01.990> a<00:06:02.760> very<00:06:03.760> nice

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
the lab so you can have a very nice

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.150 
the lab so you can have a very nice
figure<00:06:05.590> there<00:06:06.810> and<00:06:07.810> I<00:06:07.960> also<00:06:08.320> noticed<00:06:08.770> that<00:06:08.830> the

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.160 
figure there and I also noticed that the

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.300 
figure there and I also noticed that the
size<00:06:09.460> wise<00:06:09.700> is<00:06:10.030> figure<00:06:10.919> that's<00:06:11.919> come<00:06:12.130> with<00:06:12.280> a

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
size wise is figure that's come with a

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.750 
size wise is figure that's come with a
hit<00:06:12.550> we're<00:06:13.300> looking<00:06:13.780> from<00:06:14.050> this<00:06:14.229> side<00:06:14.760> not

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760 
hit we're looking from this side not

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:21.240 
hit we're looking from this side not
like<00:06:15.940> some<00:06:15.970> Stricker<00:06:16.710> so<00:06:18.960> it<00:06:19.960> is<00:06:20.140> it<00:06:20.860> is<00:06:21.010> very

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.250 
like some Stricker so it is it is very

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.890 
like some Stricker so it is it is very
right<00:06:21.430> so<00:06:21.610> as<00:06:21.729> soon<00:06:21.849> as<00:06:22.000> I<00:06:22.090> clip<00:06:22.330> size<00:06:22.539> wise<00:06:22.750> one

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
right so as soon as I clip size wise one

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:23.390 
right so as soon as I clip size wise one
will<00:06:23.080> be

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 
will be

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.760 
will be
at<00:06:23.790> once<00:06:24.060> well<00:06:26.630> that's<00:06:27.630> cool<00:06:27.840> that's<00:06:28.530> the

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
at once well that's cool that's the

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.460 
at once well that's cool that's the
thing<00:06:28.979> that<00:06:29.030> that<00:06:30.030> has<00:06:30.240> we<00:06:30.419> should<00:06:30.630> do<00:06:30.780> with<00:06:31.020> a

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
thing that that has we should do with a

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:35.510 
thing that that has we should do with a
lot<00:06:31.949> of<00:06:32.180> these<00:06:33.180> figures<00:06:33.979> mostly<00:06:34.979> the<00:06:35.490> ones

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
lot of these figures mostly the ones

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.040 
lot of these figures mostly the ones
they<00:06:35.880> are<00:06:35.910> repainted<00:06:36.630> and<00:06:37.259> not<00:06:38.190> to<00:06:38.310> repaint

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
they are repainted and not to repaint

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.170 
they are repainted and not to repaint
only<00:06:40.050> the<00:06:40.169> same<00:06:40.410> old<00:06:40.650> but<00:06:40.919> try<00:06:41.610> to<00:06:41.669> make<00:06:41.940> a

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.180 
only the same old but try to make a

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.900 
only the same old but try to make a
little<00:06:42.570> bit<00:06:42.740> different<00:06:43.759> in<00:06:44.759> the

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:44.910 
little bit different in the

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.400 
little bit different in the
transformation<00:06:45.539> process<00:06:45.570> like<00:06:46.020> they<00:06:46.229> did

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:46.410 
transformation process like they did

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:51.640 
transformation process like they did
with<00:06:46.560> this<00:06:47.030> that<00:06:48.030> I<00:06:48.330> think<00:06:48.870> kind<00:06:49.259> of<00:06:49.380> nice

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:51.650 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.050 

other<00:06:52.650> than<00:06:52.830> that<00:06:52.889> I<00:06:53.039> like<00:06:53.310> this<00:06:53.460> figure<00:06:53.820> a<00:06:53.850> lot

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.060 
other than that I like this figure a lot

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.170 
other than that I like this figure a lot
