 in this case in this fish 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.780
 really very little salt but the most 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.910

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.380

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.040
 with a fork at the same time we warm up 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:33.819

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:56.340
 a little more dill in the pan 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.359
 a teaspoon of butter 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.359

 see what starts and grabs 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.770

 Leave a little bit of this here and here 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:57.840

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:00.600
