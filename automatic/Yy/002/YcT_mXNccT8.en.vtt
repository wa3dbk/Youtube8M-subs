00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
would it be what suffice enough for him

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.390 
would it be what suffice enough for him
to<00:03:19.720> vote<00:03:20.720> for<00:03:20.750> that<00:03:21.079> game<00:03:21.350> I<00:03:21.650> mean<00:03:22.250> ultimately

but I don't think it was the game that
ultimately<00:03:27.020> was<00:03:27.260> chosen<00:03:27.500> at<00:03:27.860> that<00:03:28.100> boat<00:03:28.370> but<00:03:29.150> I
