00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
if you can tell on the little YouTube

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.369

screen<00:00:56.820> but<00:00:57.289> there's<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.440> three<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.879> top

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
screen but there's a three on that top

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.750 
screen but there's a three on that top
on<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.890> cushion<00:01:02.629> whoops<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.019> make<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.439> and

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
on that cushion whoops and make it and

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.149 
on that cushion whoops and make it and
usually<00:01:05.760> if<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.479> go<00:01:06.900> back<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.290> forth<00:01:07.710> three

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
usually if you go back and forth three

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.469 
usually if you go back and forth three
times<00:01:08.930> just<00:01:09.930> two<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.950> then<00:01:11.670> three<00:01:12.119> then<00:01:12.150> you

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
times just two and then three then you

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.039 
times just two and then three then you
can<00:01:12.630> make<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:14.030> might<00:01:15.030> be<00:01:15.210> possible<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.810> do

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
can make it it might be possible to do

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.109 
can make it it might be possible to do
it<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.380> two<00:01:16.619> but<00:01:16.920> sometimes<00:01:17.159> obviously<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:18.000> have

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
it in two but sometimes obviously I have

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:18.740 
it in two but sometimes obviously I have
trouble<00:01:18.330> do

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
trouble do

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.500 
trouble do
great<00:01:19.170> also<00:01:19.980> I<00:01:20.010> think<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.520> matters<00:01:20.850> what<00:01:20.880> part

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
great also I think it matters what part

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.830 
great also I think it matters what part
of<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.780> cushion<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.380> grab<00:01:23.160> on<00:01:23.370> to<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:24.570> it

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
of the cushion you grab on to and it

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.870 
of the cushion you grab on to and it
might<00:01:24.990> work<00:01:25.200> better<00:01:25.500> if<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:26.010> actually<00:01:26.250> grab

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
might work better if you actually grab

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.480 
might work better if you actually grab
on<00:01:27.120> the<00:01:27.330> front<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.660> it<00:01:28.040> okay<00:01:29.040> I'm<00:01:29.160> going<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.400> get
