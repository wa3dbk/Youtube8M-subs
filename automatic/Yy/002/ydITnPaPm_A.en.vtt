underneath the car it's coolant and I
need<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.070> figure<00:00:35.250> out<00:00:35.370> where<00:00:35.640> it's<00:00:35.790> coming

need to figure out where it's coming

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.100 
need to figure out where it's coming
from<00:00:36.200> unless<00:00:37.200> it's<00:00:37.379> just<00:00:37.440> real<00:00:37.800> obvious<00:00:39.110> which

from unless it's just real obvious which

from unless it's just real obvious which
in<00:00:40.470> this<00:00:40.590> case<00:00:40.770> it's<00:00:41.010> not<00:00:41.180> a<00:00:42.180> couple<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.110> things

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
in this case it's not a couple of things

in this case it's not a couple of things
about<00:00:43.500> cooling<00:00:43.890> system<00:00:44.190> real<00:00:45.000> quickly<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
about cooling system real quickly the

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.870 
about cooling system real quickly the
systems<00:00:46.079> are<00:00:46.260> pressurized<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.160> there's<00:00:47.820> a

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 
systems are pressurized and there's a

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.229 
systems are pressurized and there's a
reason<00:00:48.210> for<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:49.230> gain<00:00:49.790> degrees<00:00:50.790> on<00:00:51.000> top

reason for that you gain degrees on top

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.990 
reason for that you gain degrees on top
of<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.480> boiling<00:00:51.840> point<00:00:52.670> inside<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.730> this

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
of the boiling point inside of this

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.940 
of the boiling point inside of this
system<00:00:54.480> for<00:00:54.720> every<00:00:55.050> pound<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.380> pressure<00:00:55.680> that

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
system for every pound of pressure that

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.299 
system for every pound of pressure that
you<00:00:56.010> can<00:00:56.280> hold<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:57.440> usually<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.860> radiator

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
you can hold and usually on the radiator

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.490 
you can hold and usually on the radiator
cap<00:00:59.610> you<00:01:00.329> can<00:01:00.390> see<00:01:00.720> how<00:01:00.870> many<00:01:01.050> pounds<00:01:01.290> of

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
cap you can see how many pounds of

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.759 
cap you can see how many pounds of
pressure<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.520> system<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.439> designed<00:01:04.439> to

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
pressure that the system is designed to

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.120 
pressure that the system is designed to
hold<00:01:05.009> in<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.790> case<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.390> says<00:01:06.659> 16<00:01:07.259> pounds<00:01:07.950> if

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
hold in this case that says 16 pounds if

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.700 
hold in this case that says 16 pounds if
this<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.460> an<00:01:08.579> original<00:01:09.030> style<00:01:09.990> cap<00:01:10.350> in<00:01:10.590> any

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
this is an original style cap in any

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.430 
this is an original style cap in any
event<00:01:11.270> this<00:01:12.270> would<00:01:12.540> gain<00:01:12.750> quite<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.140> few

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
event this would gain quite a few

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.700 
event this would gain quite a few
degrees<00:01:13.560> upon<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.549> normal<00:01:14.970> boiling<00:01:15.120> point<00:01:15.710> and

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
degrees upon a normal boiling point and

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.690 
degrees upon a normal boiling point and
that<00:01:16.890> would<00:01:17.010> be<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.220> addition<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.610> any

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
that would be in addition to any

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.060 
that would be in addition to any
chemical<00:01:18.270> additives<00:01:18.690> in<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.870> coolant<00:01:19.290> anti

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
chemical additives in the coolant anti

chemical additives in the coolant anti
boil<00:01:20.340> additives<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.320> any<00:01:22.409> event

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
boil additives that is so in any event

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
it's a pressurized system you never want

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.910 
it's a pressurized system you never want
to<00:01:25.650> open<00:01:26.130> radiator<00:01:26.700> caps<00:01:27.210> when<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:28.020> car<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.619> hot

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
to open radiator caps when a car is hot

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.820 
to open radiator caps when a car is hot
or<00:01:29.190> running<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.790> whole<00:01:30.570> warm<00:01:31.290> because<00:01:31.530> they're

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
or running a whole warm because they're

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.310 
or running a whole warm because they're
pressurized<00:01:32.190> I<00:01:32.670> made<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.570> mistake<00:01:33.750> many

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
pressurized I made that mistake many

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.679 
pressurized I made that mistake many
many<00:01:34.590> years<00:01:34.860> ago<00:01:35.010> when<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.369> was<00:01:35.549> young<00:01:35.580> and<00:01:36.030> it

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
many years ago when I was young and it

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.179 
many years ago when I was young and it
looked<00:01:36.930> like<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.320> coolant<00:01:37.650> was<00:01:37.770> just<00:01:37.979> being

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
looked like the coolant was just being

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.070 
looked like the coolant was just being
puked<00:01:38.520> out<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.090> radiator<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.780> got<00:01:39.930> all

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
puked out of the radiator and it got all

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.289 
puked out of the radiator and it got all
over<00:01:40.110> me<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.070> don't<00:01:41.280> ever<00:01:41.400> open<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.909> radiator

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
over me so don't ever open a radiator

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.520 
over me so don't ever open a radiator
cap<00:01:42.390> when<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.500> systems<00:01:43.950> are<00:01:44.189> hot<00:01:44.930> and<00:01:45.930> for

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
cap when the systems are hot and for

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.890 
cap when the systems are hot and for
this<00:01:46.710> test<00:01:47.010> it's<00:01:47.400> best<00:01:47.729> obviously<00:01:48.540> for<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
this test it's best obviously for the

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.590 
this test it's best obviously for the
system<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.439> be<00:01:49.650> cold<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.939> can<00:01:51.119> do<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.420> when

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
system to be cold you can do it when

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.300 
system to be cold you can do it when
it's<00:01:51.750> warm<00:01:52.290> but<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.680> don't<00:01:52.860> want<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.189> be

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
it's warm but you don't want it to be

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.749 
it's warm but you don't want it to be
pressurized<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.900> my<00:01:55.830> recommendation<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.640> to

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
pressurized so my recommendation is to

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.100 
pressurized so my recommendation is to
do<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.060> when<00:01:57.240> it's<00:01:57.420> cold<00:01:59.630> in<00:02:00.630> order<00:02:00.900> to<00:02:00.990> run

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
do it when it's cold in order to run

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.749 
do it when it's cold in order to run
this<00:02:01.320> test<00:02:01.560> I'm<00:02:01.770> going<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:01.950> use<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.369> piece<00:02:02.610> of

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
this test I'm going to use a piece of

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.429 
this test I'm going to use a piece of
equipment<00:02:03.180> that<00:02:03.210> we<00:02:03.450> call<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.900> cooling<00:02:04.290> system

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439

pressure tester I happen to have one

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.919 
pressure tester I happen to have one
because<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:08.039> was<00:02:08.250> mechanic<00:02:08.789> years<00:02:09.000> ago<00:02:09.299> if<00:02:09.539> you

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
because I was mechanic years ago if you

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.869 
because I was mechanic years ago if you
happen<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.590> be<00:02:10.769> in<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.920> situation<00:02:11.579> where<00:02:11.760> you

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
happen to be in a situation where you

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.770 
happen to be in a situation where you
have<00:02:12.060> many<00:02:12.560> older<00:02:13.560> cars<00:02:13.799> running<00:02:14.099> around<00:02:14.780> you

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
have many older cars running around you

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.100 
have many older cars running around you
may<00:02:15.900> want<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.140> invest<00:02:16.410> in<00:02:16.560> one<00:02:16.970> I<00:02:17.970> don't<00:02:18.959> know

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
may want to invest in one I don't know

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.720 
may want to invest in one I don't know
how<00:02:19.230> much<00:02:19.349> they<00:02:19.560> run<00:02:19.739> these<00:02:19.920> days<00:02:20.160> this<00:02:20.489> one's

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
how much they run these days this one's

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.590 
how much they run these days this one's
probably<00:02:20.940> 20<00:02:21.390> years

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
probably 20 years

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.530 
probably 20 years
old<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:21.990> still<00:02:22.170> works<00:02:22.440> so<00:02:22.680> I<00:02:22.710> use<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:24.030> lot<00:02:24.390> of

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
old it still works so I use it a lot of

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.460 
old it still works so I use it a lot of
the<00:02:24.660> newer<00:02:24.900> cars<00:02:25.290> have<00:02:25.530> different<00:02:26.130> styles<00:02:26.430> of

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
the newer cars have different styles of

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.810 
the newer cars have different styles of
reservoirs<00:02:28.470> expansion<00:02:29.100> tanks<00:02:29.490> and<00:02:29.610> all<00:02:29.670> that

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
reservoirs expansion tanks and all that

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.460 
reservoirs expansion tanks and all that
other<00:02:29.970> kind<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.270> stuff<00:02:30.480> which<00:02:30.660> this<00:02:31.200> one<00:02:31.440> is

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
other kind of stuff which this one is

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.590 
other kind of stuff which this one is
doesn't<00:02:31.920> have<00:02:32.160> adapters<00:02:32.670> for<00:02:32.940> it<00:02:33.030> all<00:02:33.240> it<00:02:33.420> does

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
doesn't have adapters for it all it does

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.200 
doesn't have adapters for it all it does
is<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:34.530> I<00:02:34.710> happen<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.010> purchased<00:02:35.610> an<00:02:35.760> adapter

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
is it I happen to purchased an adapter

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.350 
is it I happen to purchased an adapter
for<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.480> import<00:02:36.930> smaller<00:02:37.470> style<00:02:37.890> neck<00:02:38.360> to

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
for the import smaller style neck to

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.240 
for the import smaller style neck to
adapt<00:02:39.600> to<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.930> larger<00:02:41.750> domestic<00:02:42.750> style<00:02:43.250> neck

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
adapt to the larger domestic style neck

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.970 
adapt to the larger domestic style neck
the<00:02:45.150> way<00:02:45.240> this<00:02:45.420> thing<00:02:45.690> works<00:02:45.870> pretty<00:02:46.230> pretty

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
the way this thing works pretty pretty

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.250 
the way this thing works pretty pretty
cool<00:02:47.160> it's<00:02:47.550> just<00:02:47.580> like<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.880> tire<00:02:48.090> pressure<00:02:48.570> or<00:02:49.230> a

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
cool it's just like a tire pressure or a

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.030 
cool it's just like a tire pressure or a
tire<00:02:49.620> pump<00:02:50.160> that's<00:02:50.760> got<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.060> gauge<00:02:51.420> here<00:02:52.040> you

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
tire pump that's got a gauge here you

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.400 
tire pump that's got a gauge here you
can<00:02:53.190> see<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.430> gauge<00:02:53.780> give<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.930> close-up<00:02:55.320> of

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
can see the gauge give you a close-up of

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.290 
can see the gauge give you a close-up of
the<00:02:55.530> gauge<00:02:55.770> you<00:02:56.250> pump<00:02:56.520> it<00:02:56.640> yeah<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:56.970> pump<00:02:57.210> it

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
the gauge you pump it yeah you pump it

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.510 
the gauge you pump it yeah you pump it
up<00:02:57.450> essentially<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:58.020> hook<00:02:58.170> this<00:02:58.890> end<00:02:59.160> up<00:02:59.310> I

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
up essentially you hook this end up I

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.510 
up essentially you hook this end up I
know<00:02:59.850> I'm<00:02:59.970> off-camera<00:03:00.480> look<00:03:01.350> this<00:03:01.530> end<00:03:01.740> up<00:03:01.920> to

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
know I'm off-camera look this end up to

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.310 
know I'm off-camera look this end up to
the<00:03:02.610> radiator<00:03:02.970> neck<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.630> then<00:03:05.810> you<00:03:06.810> press<00:03:07.050> you

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
the radiator neck and then you press you

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.430 
the radiator neck and then you press you
pump<00:03:07.710> it<00:03:07.830> up<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.100> however<00:03:08.280> high<00:03:08.970> your<00:03:09.900> cap<00:03:10.110> says

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
pump it up to however high your cap says

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.110 
pump it up to however high your cap says
and<00:03:10.740> then<00:03:11.160> ideally<00:03:11.430> it's<00:03:11.700> going<00:03:11.880> to<00:03:11.940> hold

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
and then ideally it's going to hold

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.380 
and then ideally it's going to hold
pressure<00:03:12.420> if<00:03:13.140> not<00:03:13.500> it<00:03:13.830> will<00:03:14.010> slowly<00:03:14.460> go<00:03:15.180> down

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
pressure if not it will slowly go down

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.040 
pressure if not it will slowly go down
and<00:03:15.950> in<00:03:16.950> that<00:03:17.190> case<00:03:17.430> you'll<00:03:17.640> either<00:03:17.760> see<00:03:18.150> where

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
and in that case you'll either see where

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.680 
and in that case you'll either see where
it's<00:03:19.200> leaking<00:03:19.380> or<00:03:19.740> you<00:03:19.860> can<00:03:20.010> hear<00:03:20.250> hiss

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
it's leaking or you can hear hiss

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.710 
it's leaking or you can hear hiss
sometimes<00:03:23.120> so<00:03:24.120> that's<00:03:24.150> kind<00:03:24.480> of<00:03:24.510> how<00:03:24.600> this

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
sometimes so that's kind of how this

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.310 
sometimes so that's kind of how this
thing<00:03:24.960> works

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
thing works

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.550 
thing works
and<00:03:25.890> this<00:03:26.430> one<00:03:27.030> happens<00:03:27.390> to<00:03:27.450> be<00:03:27.570> made<00:03:27.870> by<00:03:28.110> by

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
and this one happens to be made by by

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.040 
and this one happens to be made by by
stant<00:03:29.070> which<00:03:29.340> is<00:03:29.520> a<00:03:29.720> pretty<00:03:30.720> common

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
stant which is a pretty common

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.650 
stant which is a pretty common
manufacturer<00:03:31.860> of

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
manufacturer of

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.970 
manufacturer of
radiator<00:03:33.660> caps<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:34.140> that<00:03:34.170> kind<00:03:34.410> of<00:03:34.470> stuff<00:03:34.680> so

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
radiator caps and that kind of stuff so

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.620 
radiator caps and that kind of stuff so
let's<00:03:35.430> look<00:03:35.550> this<00:03:35.640> thing<00:03:35.820> up<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:36.150> see<00:03:36.240> what<00:03:36.510> it

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
let's look this thing up and see what it

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:37.700 
let's look this thing up and see what it
does<00:03:36.750> find<00:03:37.140> out<00:03:37.200> where<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.440> leaks<00:03:37.620> coming

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
does find out where the leaks coming

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:43.820 
does find out where the leaks coming
from<00:03:41.090> okay<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.240> next<00:03:42.480> step<00:03:42.660> is<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.380> actually

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
from okay the next step is to actually

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.620 
from okay the next step is to actually
hook<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.100> gauge<00:03:44.310> setup<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.030> radiator<00:03:45.450> you

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
hook the gauge setup to the radiator you

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.430 
hook the gauge setup to the radiator you
treat<00:03:46.380> this<00:03:46.680> end<00:03:47.040> like<00:03:47.880> a<00:03:48.060> radiator<00:03:48.450> cap<00:03:48.510> it's

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
treat this end like a radiator cap it's

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.870 
treat this end like a radiator cap it's
got<00:03:49.560> a<00:03:49.590> couple<00:03:49.770> of<00:03:49.950> tangs<00:03:50.190> just<00:03:50.490> like<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.730> cap

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
got a couple of tangs just like the cap

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.960 
got a couple of tangs just like the cap
does<00:03:51.090> you<00:03:51.270> put<00:03:51.480> it<00:03:51.570> into<00:03:52.110> the<00:03:52.200> radiator<00:03:52.530> neck

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
does you put it into the radiator neck

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.970 
does you put it into the radiator neck
apply<00:03:53.970> downward<00:03:54.030> pressure<00:03:54.390> and<00:03:54.900> spin<00:03:55.860> it

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
apply downward pressure and spin it

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:03.110 
apply downward pressure and spin it
right<00:03:56.100> on<00:04:01.280> alright<00:04:02.280> once<00:04:02.520> you've<00:04:02.670> got<00:04:02.910> the

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
right on alright once you've got the

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.940 
right on alright once you've got the
gauge<00:04:03.510> set<00:04:03.810> hooked<00:04:03.990> up<00:04:04.110> to<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.290> radiator<00:04:04.650> you

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
gauge set hooked up to the radiator you

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.400 
gauge set hooked up to the radiator you
just<00:04:05.580> pump<00:04:05.730> it<00:04:05.880> up<00:04:06.030> to<00:04:06.360> about<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:07.080> amount<00:04:07.320> of

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
just pump it up to about the amount of

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.290 
just pump it up to about the amount of
pounds<00:04:07.680> that<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.130> cap<00:04:08.340> calls<00:04:08.640> for<00:04:08.880> otherwise

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
pounds that the cap calls for otherwise

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.400 
pounds that the cap calls for otherwise
a<00:04:09.360> good<00:04:10.730> safe<00:04:11.730> area<00:04:12.450> would<00:04:12.600> be<00:04:12.720> about<00:04:12.930> thirteen

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
a good safe area would be about thirteen

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.050 
a good safe area would be about thirteen
to<00:04:13.500> fourteen<00:04:13.680> pounds<00:04:14.070> on<00:04:14.370> this<00:04:14.460> gauge<00:04:14.760> set

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
to fourteen pounds on this gauge set

to fourteen pounds on this gauge set
being<00:04:15.450> up<00:04:15.720> here<00:04:15.900> in<00:04:16.020> the<00:04:16.109> blue<00:04:16.440> so<00:04:17.340> I'm<00:04:17.400> gonna

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
being up here in the blue so I'm gonna

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:25.840 
being up here in the blue so I'm gonna
start<00:04:17.640> pumping<00:04:17.940> it<00:04:18.000> up<00:04:18.120> here<00:04:18.299> so<00:04:18.540> we<00:04:18.690> get

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.080 

okay<00:04:26.850> we're<00:04:27.000> going<00:04:27.120> to<00:04:27.210> lay<00:04:27.330> this<00:04:27.510> down<00:04:27.570> here

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
okay we're going to lay this down here

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.930 
okay we're going to lay this down here
and<00:04:30.090> we're<00:04:30.510> going<00:04:30.630> to<00:04:30.660> keep<00:04:30.840> an<00:04:30.990> eye<00:04:31.110> on<00:04:31.140> to<00:04:31.590> see

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
and we're going to keep an eye on to see

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.020 
and we're going to keep an eye on to see
if<00:04:32.940> we<00:04:33.240> if<00:04:33.630> the<00:04:33.930> needle<00:04:34.380> goes<00:04:34.620> down<00:04:34.980> okay

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
if we if the needle goes down okay

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.350 
if we if the needle goes down okay
while<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:37.050> gauge<00:04:37.260> set<00:04:37.590> is<00:04:37.830> pumped<00:04:38.310> up<00:04:38.460> always

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
while the gauge set is pumped up always

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.940 
while the gauge set is pumped up always
want<00:04:39.660> to<00:04:39.690> look<00:04:39.810> under<00:04:40.080> the<00:04:40.110> car<00:04:40.410> and<00:04:40.620> see<00:04:40.830> what

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
want to look under the car and see what

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.760 
want to look under the car and see what
we<00:04:41.070> got<00:04:41.190> going<00:04:41.520> on<00:04:41.610> here<00:04:42.260> looks<00:04:43.260> like<00:04:43.470> we<00:04:43.590> got

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
we got going on here looks like we got

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.040 
we got going on here looks like we got
some<00:04:43.950> leaks<00:04:44.130> here<00:04:44.400> it's<00:04:44.610> just<00:04:44.810> dripping<00:04:45.810> away

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
some leaks here it's just dripping away

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.230 
some leaks here it's just dripping away
so<00:04:46.500> we'll<00:04:47.400> see<00:04:47.550> if<00:04:47.610> we<00:04:47.700> can<00:04:47.850> find<00:04:48.060> them<00:04:48.150> by

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
so we'll see if we can find them by

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.200 
so we'll see if we can find them by
looking<00:04:48.360> up<00:04:48.630> top<00:04:49.700> after<00:04:50.700> having<00:04:51.120> a

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
looking up top after having a

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.590 
looking up top after having a
pressurized<00:04:51.810> for<00:04:52.200> some<00:04:52.620> time<00:04:52.860> I<00:04:53.070> noticed<00:04:53.600> of

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
pressurized for some time I noticed of

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.230 
pressurized for some time I noticed of
course<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:55.140> spot<00:04:55.380> on<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:55.590> floor<00:04:55.800> but<00:04:56.130> up<00:04:56.700> here

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
course the spot on the floor but up here

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.610 
course the spot on the floor but up here
on<00:04:57.420> the<00:04:57.600> drive<00:04:57.980> belt<00:04:58.980> area<00:04:59.550> of<00:04:59.760> the<00:04:59.910> car<00:05:00.620> it's

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
on the drive belt area of the car it's

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.820 
on the drive belt area of the car it's

happens to be driving the water pump

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.040 
happens to be driving the water pump
right<00:05:07.470> there<00:05:07.530> the<00:05:07.890> bolts<00:05:08.250> to<00:05:08.700> the<00:05:08.730> right<00:05:09.150> bolt

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
right there the bolts to the right bolt

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.470 
right there the bolts to the right bolt
up<00:05:10.290> the<00:05:10.440> water<00:05:10.650> pump<00:05:10.950> that's<00:05:11.220> the<00:05:11.370> pulley<00:05:11.610> see

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
up the water pump that's the pulley see

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.090 
up the water pump that's the pulley see
if<00:05:12.540> I<00:05:12.600> can<00:05:12.780> zoom<00:05:12.810> in<00:05:13.140> here<00:05:13.350> and<00:05:13.500> show<00:05:13.710> you<00:05:13.770> it's

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
if I can zoom in here and show you it's

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.010 
if I can zoom in here and show you it's
difficult<00:05:14.340> and<00:05:14.850> a<00:05:14.910> lighting<00:05:15.180> but<00:05:15.540> let<00:05:15.690> me<00:05:15.780> see

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
difficult and a lighting but let me see

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:22.790 
difficult and a lighting but let me see
if<00:05:16.110> I<00:05:16.200> can<00:05:16.350> show<00:05:16.560> you<00:05:21.050> it's<00:05:22.050> very<00:05:22.320> wet<00:05:22.590> right

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
if I can show you it's very wet right

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:29.750 
if I can show you it's very wet right
there<00:05:25.610> okay<00:05:26.610> I<00:05:26.640> placed<00:05:26.940> a<00:05:27.120> mirror<00:05:28.460> so<00:05:29.460> we<00:05:29.550> could

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
there okay I placed a mirror so we could

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.760 
there okay I placed a mirror so we could
there's<00:05:30.150> the<00:05:30.330> water<00:05:30.510> pump<00:05:30.810> but<00:05:31.230> the<00:05:31.380> mirror<00:05:31.620> is

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
there's the water pump but the mirror is

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.350 
there's the water pump but the mirror is
looking<00:05:32.100> underneath<00:05:32.550> it<00:05:32.760> and<00:05:32.970> you<00:05:33.120> can<00:05:33.300> see

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
looking underneath it and you can see

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:43.520 
looking underneath it and you can see
it's<00:05:36.360> dripping<00:05:38.750> there<00:05:39.750> it<00:05:39.870> goes<00:05:42.530> under

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
it's dripping there it goes under

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.460 
it's dripping there it goes under
pressure<00:05:44.720> so<00:05:45.720> the<00:05:45.840> water<00:05:46.020> pump<00:05:46.200> needs<00:05:46.380> to<00:05:46.410> be

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
pressure so the water pump needs to be

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.129 
pressure so the water pump needs to be
changed

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:51.139 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:53.529 

and<00:05:51.229> that's<00:05:52.009> looking<00:05:52.340> directly<00:05:52.539> underneath

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:53.539 
and that's looking directly underneath

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:58.600 
and that's looking directly underneath
this<00:05:53.870> water<00:05:54.110> pump<00:05:54.289> unit<00:05:54.590> right<00:05:54.710> here<00:05:57.219> so<00:05:58.219> the

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
this water pump unit right here so the

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.850 
this water pump unit right here so the
cooling<00:05:59.120> system<00:05:59.479> pressure<00:05:59.719> checker<00:06:00.110> is<00:06:00.439> of

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
cooling system pressure checker is of

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.129 
cooling system pressure checker is of
course<00:06:01.129> a<00:06:01.249> really<00:06:01.430> nice<00:06:01.699> tool<00:06:02.029> to<00:06:02.090> have<00:06:02.300> not

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
course a really nice tool to have not

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:05.290 
course a really nice tool to have not
sure<00:06:03.379> that<00:06:03.529> any<00:06:03.710> normal<00:06:04.099> individual<00:06:04.999> would

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
sure that any normal individual would

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.589 
sure that any normal individual would
would<00:06:05.960> want<00:06:06.319> to<00:06:06.439> invest<00:06:06.590> in<00:06:06.979> one<00:06:07.449> the<00:06:08.449> ones

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:08.599 
would want to invest in one the ones

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:10.239 
would want to invest in one the ones
they<00:06:08.779> make<00:06:08.990> these<00:06:09.169> days<00:06:09.379> I'm<00:06:09.650> sure<00:06:09.680> are<00:06:10.069> much

00:06:10.239 --> 00:06:10.249 
they make these days I'm sure are much

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:13.360 
they make these days I'm sure are much
more<00:06:11.120> elaborate<00:06:11.419> than<00:06:11.930> this<00:06:12.259> one<00:06:12.529> can<00:06:13.069> work<00:06:13.219> on

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
more elaborate than this one can work on

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.769 
more elaborate than this one can work on
expansion<00:06:13.909> tanks<00:06:14.240> and<00:06:14.360> a<00:06:14.419> bunch<00:06:14.569> of<00:06:14.659> other

00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:14.779 
expansion tanks and a bunch of other

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:16.779 
expansion tanks and a bunch of other
stuff<00:06:15.020> this<00:06:15.169> is<00:06:15.349> just<00:06:15.560> an<00:06:15.710> old<00:06:15.919> basic<00:06:16.430> one<00:06:16.610> it's

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:16.789 
stuff this is just an old basic one it's

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:20.950 
stuff this is just an old basic one it's
probably<00:06:17.349> twenty-two<00:06:18.349> years<00:06:18.590> old<00:06:18.770> or<00:06:19.370> so<00:06:19.960> you

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
probably twenty-two years old or so you

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.600 
probably twenty-two years old or so you
can<00:06:21.110> emulate<00:06:21.319> pressurizing<00:06:22.219> your<00:06:22.340> cooling

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:22.610 
can emulate pressurizing your cooling

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.879 
can emulate pressurizing your cooling
system<00:06:22.639> by<00:06:23.120> running<00:06:23.300> it<00:06:23.599> it'll<00:06:23.900> be<00:06:24.020> hot<00:06:24.259> and<00:06:24.590> of

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:24.889 
system by running it it'll be hot and of

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:26.140 
system by running it it'll be hot and of
course<00:06:25.099> you<00:06:25.189> wouldn't<00:06:25.370> want<00:06:25.520> to<00:06:25.550> open<00:06:25.849> the<00:06:25.939> cap

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.150 
course you wouldn't want to open the cap

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.320 
course you wouldn't want to open the cap
when<00:06:26.900> it's<00:06:27.050> hot<00:06:27.580> with<00:06:28.580> this<00:06:28.819> you<00:06:29.000> can<00:06:29.120> also

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
when it's hot with this you can also

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.390 
when it's hot with this you can also
check<00:06:29.750> this<00:06:30.139> particular<00:06:30.500> kit<00:06:30.919> you<00:06:31.039> can<00:06:31.189> check

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 
check this particular kit you can check

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.670 
check this particular kit you can check
your<00:06:31.550> cap<00:06:31.789> it<00:06:31.969> has<00:06:32.090> an<00:06:32.210> adapter<00:06:32.719> that<00:06:33.259> goes<00:06:33.319> on

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 
your cap it has an adapter that goes on

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.959 
your cap it has an adapter that goes on
here<00:06:33.710> and<00:06:34.009> then<00:06:34.099> you<00:06:34.189> put<00:06:34.219> your<00:06:34.460> cap<00:06:34.669> on<00:06:34.849> the

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:34.969 
here and then you put your cap on the

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:36.730 
here and then you put your cap on the
adapter<00:06:35.419> and<00:06:35.449> pump<00:06:35.900> it<00:06:36.020> up<00:06:36.110> and<00:06:36.319> you<00:06:36.500> can<00:06:36.620> see

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:36.740 
adapter and pump it up and you can see

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.439 
adapter and pump it up and you can see
how<00:06:36.830> much<00:06:36.949> pressure<00:06:37.159> it<00:06:37.370> will<00:06:37.460> hold<00:06:37.639> so

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:38.449 
how much pressure it will hold so

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:40.450 
how much pressure it will hold so
today's<00:06:38.810> pressure<00:06:39.379> systems<00:06:39.889> pressure

checker<00:06:40.789> systems<00:06:41.270> I'm<00:06:41.689> sure<00:06:41.990> much<00:06:42.319> nicer<00:06:42.710> than

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:42.830 
checker systems I'm sure much nicer than

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.769 
checker systems I'm sure much nicer than
this<00:06:42.979> one<00:06:43.189> for<00:06:43.819> the<00:06:43.909> average<00:06:44.060> Joe<00:06:44.300> though<00:06:44.750> I

00:06:44.769 --> 00:06:44.779 
this one for the average Joe though I

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:48.219 
this one for the average Joe though I
don't<00:06:45.020> know<00:06:45.229> that<00:06:45.409> they<00:06:45.529> would<00:06:46.930> invest<00:06:47.930> in<00:06:48.080> one

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:48.229 
don't know that they would invest in one

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:51.040 
don't know that they would invest in one
of<00:06:48.319> these<00:06:48.520> but<00:06:49.520> if<00:06:49.610> you<00:06:49.729> do<00:06:49.909> have<00:06:50.150> more<00:06:50.990> than

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.050 
of these but if you do have more than

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:52.989 
of these but if you do have more than
two<00:06:51.349> cars<00:06:51.650> running<00:06:52.159> around<00:06:52.460> that<00:06:52.580> are<00:06:52.669> older

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:55.460 
it might not be a bad idea okay anyway I
