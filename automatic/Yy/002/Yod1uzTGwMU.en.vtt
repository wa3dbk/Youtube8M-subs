00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:24.060
 instead you really want to replace the 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:27.510

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:30.000

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.390
 copied from other 20 do it equal ie 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:39.030

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.970
 archives and let them es 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:16.340
