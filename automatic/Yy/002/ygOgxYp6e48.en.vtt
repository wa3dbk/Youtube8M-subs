timer on it and the camera will go off

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.249 
timer on it and the camera will go off
at<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.600> time<00:01:40.340> here<00:01:41.340> we<00:01:41.490> have<00:01:41.610> our<00:01:41.759> exposure

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
at that time here we have our exposure

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.749 
at that time here we have our exposure
exposure<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.470> very<00:01:43.530> similar<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.040> brightness

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
exposure is very similar to brightness

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.410 
exposure is very similar to brightness
so<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.750> can<00:01:45.960> change<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.439> exposure<00:01:46.939> and<00:01:47.939> right

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
so you can change the exposure and right

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.999 
so you can change the exposure and right
here<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.720> have<00:01:48.750> her<00:01:48.990> flash<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.710> can<00:01:49.740> turn

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
here you have her flash you can turn

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.039 
here you have her flash you can turn
flash<00:01:50.460> on<00:01:50.759> auto<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.720> will<00:01:51.840> flash

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
flash on auto so it will flash

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.050 
flash on auto so it will flash
automatically<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.829> dark<00:01:53.040> setting<00:01:53.310> or<00:01:54.000> you
