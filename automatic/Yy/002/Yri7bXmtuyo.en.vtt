00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.500 
would say 18 to 25 miles in a weekend
Friday<00:05:11.960> to<00:05:12.140> Sunday<00:05:12.590> and<00:05:12.970> so<00:05:13.970> it<00:05:14.030> really<00:05:14.270> is

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
Friday to Sunday and so it really is

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.570 
Friday to Sunday and so it really is
about<00:05:14.690> being<00:05:14.840> comfortable<00:05:15.620> the<00:05:16.550> whole
