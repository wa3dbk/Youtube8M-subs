00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.009
 hello everyone my name is Anton is busy and 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.920
 someone asked me a question about who where 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:13.570
 better to buy cars in america from a dealer 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:20.120
 either a log cabin what's the pros what's the cons and what 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:23.630
 looker I bought the car in the usa with hands 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:28.910
 Well, with me, my friends very much 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.470
 I bought cars from dealers so I 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.520
 I think that I can answer this question 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.260
 and speaking about when you buy a log cabin 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.200
 Well, see for yourself when you buy from 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.300
 hands you like buying a cat in a bag also 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.070
 like in any other country i mean you 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:48.020
 no one gives any guarantees that this 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:50.210
 the car will break tomorrow so I 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.809
 would buy the car only if 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:57.410
 if the car is very very cheap very 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.239
 Used and I'm not afraid if it 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.510
 it breaks down that I'm ready for what she is 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.519
 it will also break with hands 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.450
 buy a car much cheaper than she 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:11.240
 worth it really in the market at the dealer well then 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.039
 have you can save money when i 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.130
 I say not very expensive car I have 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:19.009
 due to up to five thousand dollars to five to 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.829
 six can be up to 7000 dollars 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.439
 max to 7000 dollars still makes sense 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:26.929
 buy rub in all other cases i 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.159
 bought from a dealer because the dealer any 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:30.200
 the dealer gives you a guarantee 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.029
 he is legally obliged to give you a guarantee 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.520
 at least one or two months there 

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:43.369
 it is firstly second for dealers 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:45.799
 As a rule, the price is always reasonable 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.679
 there you are not buying a cat in a bag 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.649
 dealer exactly the price for which 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.840
 this car on the market is very much ready to buy 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.240
 that is, they do not usually have excessive prices. 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.939
 and they have no low prices that is it 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.219
 real market price 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.869
 Well, you can immediately understand that it is very 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:04.939
 Cheap buy will not work because 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.520
 the dealer will never sell lower 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.649
 the price for which this can really 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.380
 car pick up any moment is you 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.480
 must take with the dealer 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.180
 In addition to insurance, very often 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.860
 and to understand such as a lifetime 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.079
 if the car is not cheap if the car 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.799
 more or less fresh 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:28.519
 I do not know three years yuzany 4 something very 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:30.380
 it is often a fight like that 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.200
 means the machine is certified 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.489
 Ie dealer check on her 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.280
 additional warranties have been made 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.640
 means that if usually this 4 years 5 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.120
 years either 100 thousand kilometers to 100,000 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.130
 miles rather run that is buying 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.680
 car for example 60 thousand 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.959
 some sirte fight you can be 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.299
 calm over the next 40 thousand miles that 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.030
 if something happens the wheel will fall off 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.910
 burn out don't know headlamp then you can 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.310
 come to the dealer and say let me 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:06.109
 it is not free and it is perfect 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:08.569
 quietly done so if we once again 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.549
 let's sum up yes if we buy a car 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.819
 very cheap very old 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:15.260
 then it makes sense to do exactly the term 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.430
 because the dealer will sell 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.180
 somewhat more expensive than people who 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.299
 sell themselves as a rule 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.430
 here if the car is more or less expensive if 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.480
 it is more or less fresh then I advise 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.280
 dealer only 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.400
 because you will have extra 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:36.120
 guarantee you will be able arte 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.769
 fight you will be strongly proven 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.000
 a machine that no dealer will 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:44.189
 sell rotten not working 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.629
 car giving her a good car 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:48.120
 because and the beauty dealer spikes him 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.889
 important reputation he will also be afraid 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.980
 what do you end up suing and because he 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:59.280
 you will be told one will actually be different 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:04:01.639
 so if I bought a car, I would 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.950
 probably 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:06.239
 guided here but here these 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.900
 the principle in which I just told you 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:11.939
 voiced if you liked the video 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.730
 be sure to like subscribe to 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:19.560
 channel if you for some reason still 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:21.150
 did not do this and ask questions under 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.970
 this video in the comments if you 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.340
 have any questions about america 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.440
 ask if they are interesting and 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.380
 if anything because of them people will vote 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.870
 then I will answer them and take them off 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:37.039
 separate video like this all up 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.039
 meeting it was anton understated
