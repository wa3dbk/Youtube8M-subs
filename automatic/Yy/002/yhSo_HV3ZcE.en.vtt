00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:08.789 
started we started our hub channels we

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:10.610 
started we started our hub channels we
did<00:06:08.970> start<00:06:09.210> a<00:06:09.270> ps3<00:06:09.570> channel<00:06:10.169> and<00:06:10.320> there<00:06:10.440> was

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
did start a ps3 channel and there was

did start a ps3 channel and there was
like<00:06:10.800> a<00:06:10.889> whole<00:06:11.070> optic<00:06:11.550> ps13<00:06:12.000> but<00:06:12.840> then<00:06:13.050> we

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
like a whole optic ps13 but then we

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.860 
like a whole optic ps13 but then we
