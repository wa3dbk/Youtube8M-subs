00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.690 
then again with memory max memory you
want<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.500> take<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.040> change<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.579> the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
want to take it and change it to the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.670 
want to take it and change it to the
maximum<00:01:51.000> memory<00:01:51.329> which<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.689> your<00:01:51.899> RAM<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.649> I

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
maximum memory which is your RAM so I

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.230 
maximum memory which is your RAM so I
have<00:01:52.860> 8<00:01:53.009> gigabytes<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.549> RAM<00:01:53.700> installed<00:01:54.000> so

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
have 8 gigabytes of RAM installed so

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.030 
have 8 gigabytes of RAM installed so
mine<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:55.729> 8192<00:01:56.930> after<00:01:57.930> you've<00:01:58.079> changed<00:01:58.890> both

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
mine is 8192 after you've changed both

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.709 
mine is 8192 after you've changed both
of<00:01:59.100> them<00:01:59.430> click<00:01:59.790> OK<00:02:01.759> then<00:02:02.759> what<00:02:03.329> you<00:02:03.420> can<00:02:03.540> also

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
of them click OK then what you can also

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.130 
of them click OK then what you can also
do<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.170> click<00:02:04.409> no<00:02:04.979> GUI<00:02:05.549> on<00:02:05.670> boot<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.719> basically

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
do is click no GUI on boot so basically

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.900 
do is click no GUI on boot so basically
what<00:02:07.409> this<00:02:07.619> will<00:02:07.799> do<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.520> will<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.849> will

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
what this will do is it will it will

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.969 
what this will do is it will it will
show<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.090> black<00:02:09.360> scream<00:02:09.780> on<00:02:10.020> as<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.709> turn<00:02:10.890> on

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
show a black scream on as you turn on

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.860 
show a black scream on as you turn on
your<00:02:11.099> computer<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:12.209> will<00:02:12.330> increase<00:02:12.569> boot

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
your computer and it will increase boot

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.640 
your computer and it will increase boot
speed<00:02:13.140> so

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
speed so

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.410 
speed so
you<00:02:14.040> can<00:02:14.189> do<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.430> if<00:02:14.549> you<00:02:14.670> want<00:02:14.879> or<00:02:15.090> if<00:02:15.120> you'd

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
you can do that if you want or if you'd

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.059 
you can do that if you want or if you'd
like<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.689> see<00:02:15.840> windows<00:02:16.140> load<00:02:16.409> up<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:16.860> can

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
like to see windows load up you can

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.759 
like to see windows load up you can
leave<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.459> on<00:02:17.640> ticks<00:02:18.120> but<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.540> personally<00:02:19.230> take

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
leave it on ticks but I personally take

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.759 
leave it on ticks but I personally take
it<00:02:20.629> timeout<00:02:21.629> will<00:02:21.810> be<00:02:21.989> automatically<00:02:22.470> set<00:02:22.739> to

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
it timeout will be automatically set to

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.640 
it timeout will be automatically set to
30<00:02:23.159> seconds<00:02:23.840> so<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:24.900> want<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.230> change<00:02:25.349> it<00:02:25.530> to

30 seconds so you want to change it to

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.440 
30 seconds so you want to change it to
three<00:02:28.040> then<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.370> want<00:02:29.549> to<00:02:29.610> go<00:02:29.760> over<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.180> the
