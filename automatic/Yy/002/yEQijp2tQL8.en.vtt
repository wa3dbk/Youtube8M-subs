00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.249 
first we'll just grind it up mix it up
together<00:01:39.280> and<00:01:39.609> then<00:01:39.789> we'll<00:01:39.969> add<00:01:40.119> water

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:53.969

fine paste along with the coconut but I

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.080 
fine paste along with the coconut but I
still<00:02:02.020> need<00:02:02.380> it<00:02:02.409> even<00:02:02.770> fine<00:02:03.250> so<00:02:03.670> we'll<00:02:03.880> add

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
still need it even fine so we'll add

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.430 
still need it even fine so we'll add

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
some more water that's it not much

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.199 
some more water that's it not much
because<00:02:09.039> we<00:02:09.250> do<00:02:09.369> not<00:02:09.489> want<00:02:09.550> a<00:02:09.789> very<00:02:09.819> runny

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
because we do not want a very runny

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.680 
because we do not want a very runny

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
takes longer which is why we have not

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.150 
takes longer which is why we have not
added<00:03:56.880> mustard<00:03:57.329> seeds<00:03:57.600> first<00:03:57.930> generally<00:03:58.829> in<00:03:59.010> a
