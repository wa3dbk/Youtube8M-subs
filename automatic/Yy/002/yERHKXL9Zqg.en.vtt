00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.599
 Hi, I 'm a girl and welcome to 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.519
 another video of the organism 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.460
 I'm going to make a video today, 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.590
 you have been asking for a long time 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.510
 asking in the comments to teach the 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.320
 use drill screwdriver 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.939
 I'm not a professional, maybe I'm 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.470
 There's something I said that did not 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.029
 It's quite correct, you can 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.399
 correct in comments 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.370
 because I learned a little my 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.960
 husband a little testing same step 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.210
 It's important to talk to you a little bit. 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.100
 and how all this started nec in this 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.690
 wanting to teach them how to 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.030
 screwdriver and drill 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.430
 in fact she comes from a family 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.079
 where my mother loves crafts 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.039
 I grew up watching her do 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.649
 crafts 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.449
 My father is super curious, he does the 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.170
 things on their own without knowing that 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.480
 he will ask, study and do always 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.879
 like home to things so I think 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.680
 that taste and that security and 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.960
 risk and in my family 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.400
 When I started a blog I started to 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.369
 to risk much more 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.650
 I started painting more than I stopped 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.210
 inventing more things and one day I 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.250
 I woke up thinking I could do the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.650
 mobile I do not even know where I got it 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.790
 but I thought I could have gone to the 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.530
 MIC timber 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.420
 he cut the manners the size I 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.340
 I wanted to do a drawing 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.990
 I got home, my husband laughed. 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.540
 me because you thought I was staying 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.790
 crazy and I did not have to cross border 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.229
 I did not have a drill I did the aap 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.600
 joking that I'll leave the link 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.750
 side for you who wants to see only with 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.369
 a screwdriver screw and I think 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.950
 that she looks beautiful, I do not like her 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.930
 so she looked wonderful and then 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.369
 That's when I sang more with him. 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.380
 getting more buying more tools 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.649
 so much so that I sing of tools 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.270
 has grown a lot in the last two years and I 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.729
 I'll share with you what I know now. 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.770
 The first one I'm going to talk about the screwdriver. 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.619
 This mine is a screwdriver from 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.619
 Tramontina she already has a battery here in 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:08.970
 down then there is no yarn that is great 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.100
 and you have to choose points several 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.070
 tips here 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.080
 according to the screw then today I 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.600
 I left it separate so I'll use this 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.380
 screw here and this total fits 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.060
 right 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.830
 this bridge is like the part of the 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.850
 front of a screwdriver a wrench 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.410
 philips 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:32.000
 I'll fit that end here right. 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:37.610
 and I'll squeeze you again in 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.080
 box here and until the first time I 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.330
 I moved with a screwdriver I was a 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:46.010
 little insecure because I pressed well 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.000
 strong and then I escaped the screw 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.040
 I got scared little by little I went 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.710
 realizing that according to what you 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.560
 squeezes goes faster slower 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.240
 so if I squeeze a little bit her 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.050
 turns a little bit just have a little more 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:04.970
 according to the person getting more 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:07.550
 fast is to screw these boards 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.640
 of wood that I will not need to stick 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.080
 and nothing I go straight with the screw 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.120
 screwdriver and a screw is already going 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.960
 get into the wood will fix a way 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.240
 in the other 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.100
 This is the way to separate spindle was very 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.500
 thick wood was a way very 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:27.340
 It is good to drill a guide hole with the 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.340
 Drill a future before we go there 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:34.770
 Oh, I fixed it so I'm going to talk about the 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.620
 The drill I use 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.200
 she has this support in front and I 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.900
 I just started to be safe to use 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.819
 Drill with this model is here 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.380
 because of that part of the front that I 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.000
 I think it gets firmer 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.650
 formerly with the drill that only had 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.970
 This part here I was afraid to stay 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.150
 father in my hand 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:57.030
 so I feel a lot more security 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.670
 here we will need the drill idea 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:04.920
 drill will vary according to what 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:07.380
 You'll stick then you have drill in exchange. 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.150
 which is for the wood has block that is 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.890
 From the wall has to drill 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.940
 metal 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:16.079
 I used to buy those who 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.910
 had a store of 99 and were well 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.549
 cheaper than here 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.220
 but sometimes lasted a same used 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.320
 and it was already broken was already crooked 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.750
 it did not work right and then I thought 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.669
 it was worth investing in a kit better than 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.330
 I 'm already using enough time 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.770
 whole so now I'm going to do it's two 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.370
 holes in the wood 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:47.039
 I'm going to use this drug for the most 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:48.539
 fine and to put it like that is the same 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:51.419
 The way I showed you the 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:53.910
 placing the screwdriver tip that 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:56.520
 I just generated it here, it's just like here 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:00.380
 We 'll need this little piece that 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.550
 click here to open it to close 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.510
 is already open 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:09.200
 I'll put the drill I chose to 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.200
 the wood 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:22.670
 And hey, we tighten it up. 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.670
 straight and jataÃ­ in place 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.870
 who wants to start using a drill 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.790
 but gets a little insecure is good to start 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.700
 with wood because the most 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.740
 mole much easier and then you practice 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.870
 Are you getting more security? 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.930
 Then I can have a phone. I put it on. 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:43.620
 This mania from low to not because 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:47.420
 when I 'm boring it 's when the drill 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.420
 to lean in that other way I stop 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.770
 I'll support 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:04.070
 I'm already done now the other 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:16.510
 so it's really easy, there's no secret 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.390
 none 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:21.010
 now I'll put it on the wall I've already scored 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:23.950
 on the wall where I'm going to stick 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:27.400
 I'm going to use bushings, here's the screw. 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.690
 for this bush and the drill also 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.550
 the drill 6 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:34.030
 So you have to do well. 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:36.400
 attention that is all of the same number and 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.870
 drill bit is also drill for masonry 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.520
 in it I was working with the drill 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.800
 Wood now I changed Bruno 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:45.600
 I would like to take this opportunity. 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.600
 firmness and a little strength 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.050
 ah 

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.480
 now again just to do his 

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.550
 I hope people who were 

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:47.140
 requesting this video if they liked it 

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.430
 I still have a question that I can 

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.080
 answer can put us here 

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:52.090
 comments that I answer 

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:55.530
 Thank you so much for watching. 

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:55.530
 and until the next video
