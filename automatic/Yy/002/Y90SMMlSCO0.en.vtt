I'm<00:02:27.269> since<00:02:27.870> I'm<00:02:27.989> far<00:02:28.170> away<00:02:28.230> i'm<00:02:28.379> lagging<00:02:28.620> so

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
I'm since I'm far away i'm lagging so

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.640 
I'm since I'm far away i'm lagging so
instead<00:02:29.819> i<00:02:29.879> just<00:02:30.209> hopped<00:02:30.420> out<00:02:30.660> my<00:02:30.840> xenon<00:02:31.290> which

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
instead i just hopped out my xenon which

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.350 
instead i just hopped out my xenon which
is<00:02:31.769> out<00:02:31.920> 47<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:33.840> i'm<00:02:34.019> training<00:02:34.260> at<00:02:34.379> cds<00:02:35.360> I'm

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
is out 47 and i'm training at cds I'm

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.300 
is out 47 and i'm training at cds I'm
telling<00:02:36.629> I<00:02:37.049> need<00:02:37.290> look<00:02:37.470> for<00:02:37.620> another<00:02:37.739> place<00:02:37.890> to

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
telling I need look for another place to

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.460 
telling I need look for another place to
Train<00:02:38.670> I<00:02:38.790> guess<00:02:39.000> since<00:02:39.239> it's<00:02:39.480> starts<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.379> get

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
Train I guess since it's starts to get

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.400 
Train I guess since it's starts to get
slow<00:02:40.709> at<00:02:40.890> cds<00:02:41.310> for<00:02:41.519> me<00:02:41.640> so<00:02:42.540> maybe<00:02:42.840> robles

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
slow at cds for me so maybe robles

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.690 
slow at cds for me so maybe robles
you'll<00:02:43.680> see<00:02:43.830> how<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.069> goes<00:02:44.250> well<00:02:44.519> right<00:02:44.670> now

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
you'll see how it goes well right now

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.640 
you'll see how it goes well right now
I'm<00:02:44.819> just<00:02:44.879> training<00:02:45.239> around<00:02:45.540> like<00:02:46.079> not<00:02:46.260> rain

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.490 
and metals and yeah you know that's
pretty<00:02:56.340> much<00:02:56.489> what<00:02:56.670> i've<00:02:56.760> been<00:02:56.819> doing<00:02:57.019> and<00:02:58.019> the

problem one problem another problem to

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.069 
problem one problem another problem to
another<00:03:01.079> problem<00:03:01.470> she<00:03:02.040> saw<00:03:02.190> leads<00:03:02.459> on

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
another problem she saw leads on

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.410 
another problem she saw leads on
probably<00:03:04.079> right<00:03:04.349> now<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.500> main<00:03:04.829> issue<00:03:05.700> i<00:03:06.000> have
