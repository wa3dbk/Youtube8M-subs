00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:11.279
 earlier 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.069
 I think that these decisions 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:28.759
 Yana Karpenko 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:30.779
 and today we are still in tons 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.100
 why 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.100
 important granddaughter 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.120
 it's five in the morning 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.660
 I want to share with you bills 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.270
 several months 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.970
 i started practicing the early ascents and 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.650
 now share why 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.280
 is of great importance 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.700
 in my life 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.950
 can also make a big difference for 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.950
 needs 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.080
 as a gift in the morning 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.830
 First of all 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.310
 You get 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.130
 wonderful morning prices on the market 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.790
 it is not comparable with the evening allergies and 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.040
 in the east it is called energy was kakheti 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.870
 it really is 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.220
 yes he met the tram cleaned off 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.630
 happiness is not like that 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.190
 so it was afternoon 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.280
 and in the evening 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.909
 this state of goodness is given 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.580
 tranquility 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.860
 cleared more attachment 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.550
 our values 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.550
 and felt 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.050
 you know 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.050
 that the most important thing is life 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.280
 I will not give 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.340
 Do you know that 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.900
 things are better much earlier 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.090
 than most people are 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.410
 you are around 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.969
 and ask yourself 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.069
 how natural would be 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:04.130
 if you say for example 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.440
 at three in the morning 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.160
 Of course this is much less stiskin than 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.699
 get up 

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.529
 eight seems to you at first sight now 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:16.529
 but if the sun sings in the summer at 5 am 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:19.829
 settled 3 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.700
 i.e. unstable night usa 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.709
 and before the doctors found the sun 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.359
 it would not they can naturally 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:29.629
 so I invite you to try 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:31.379
 together with the sun 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.379
 and with him meets skills 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.429
 you will feel that agreeing 

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:41.359
 embedded universe 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.989
 agreeing countries of life on 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.539
 our planet 

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:47.799
 planet Earth 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.530
 life as such 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.699
 and exponentially 

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:53.599
 will also support this your choice 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.609
 and will not help 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.459
 more economical and more stable 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.239
 of life 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.099
 because you recognize 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.099
 There is a rule of some kind of residence 

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:08.739
 the universe also recognize 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.159
 and this is not the first 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.389
 and give you back a hundredfold 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:15.499
 so the first reason is this 

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:17.300
 what morning energy 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.869
 pushing you 

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:20.219
 and supports 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:22.589
 karma will not be good for parliament 

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:25.119
 the second reason is what to build with 

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:25.769
 by the sun 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.700
 much more natural 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.949
 for sure for eternity 

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:31.309
 what to build 

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:34.779
 a minute later 

00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:37.189
 for example, some are 8 am 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:40.619
 some 101 9 or even in akimat 

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:43.619
 and but the tension too there are such people 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:46.409
 the next reason why this is important 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:47.759
 do 

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:50.409
 this is something that new games in these few hours 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:52.209
 time is not today 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.549
 you win a few hours very 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.099
 quality time 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.069
 because when you fall behind earlier 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:59.499
 other 

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:01.949
 you understand that only you 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:04.229
 belongs to this time 

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:07.249
 business someday household matters not yet 

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:08.329
 started 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:11.329
 first and have the opportunity 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.390

 I am a young mother 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.430
 I really appreciate that time 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.129
 loneliness 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:31.129
 which i get in the morning when austria 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.490

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.660
 habits and says my mentor 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.099
 Nikolaev Tomsk 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:46.009
 when you learn 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.039
 their children into the habit of the early 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.919

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.040
 that this habit will serve you all 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:55.740

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.089
 of women 

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:07.009
 to begin 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.009
 getting up early is easy and fun 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:11.919
 how to find like-minded people 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.080
