00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.520
 two 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.210
 life gives you change and you go 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.039
 offering different ways than good 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.529
 from being doing the production of 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.500
 a phito or manuel carrasco tour 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.900
 Fangoria ends up selling and making a 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.720
 product as rooted to the earth as 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.029
 the oil 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.160
 my father had dedicated himself to doing 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.660
 oil simply to sell it in bulk 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.640
 as it had been done in a traditional way 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.160
 but the rules of the game in the market 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.769
 had changed there were options for the 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.629
 Quality first for us 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:47.210
 fundamental was to have our product 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.920
 perfectly defined, you had to know and 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.530
 to be very clear that we were going to sell 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.960
 we create our essential brand olivé se 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.850
 creates as the main objective of quality 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.140
 our end was not in Spain not 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.120
 I was in the province in a market 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.699
 close but you had to go outside and 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.220
 we think about tourism that was something that 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.740
 revolutionized our project because of 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.080
 some way has been the tool that 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.850
 it has made it possible for us to go out 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.979
 accelerate our internationalization 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.720
 our goal was to fall in love with 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.680
 our product and so we did 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:24.190
 American visitors began to arrive 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.840
 Chilean Chinese German and Chinese 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.520
 our big surprise was when that 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.229
 start to have feedback for our 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.710
 company coming people who know how 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.920
 we do 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.360
 in two months three months he calls again 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.520
 I want to sell your oil in germany 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.560
 I want to sell your oil in France 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.420
 I want to sell your oil in the USA 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.560
 In short, what we wanted was that 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.140
 when someone has a bottle of 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.540
 oil and I have known how the 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.299
 oil up there values ​​the farmer 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.610
 value the traditional life of 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.070
 small towns values ​​rural life 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.720
 and values a product that has a lot 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.000
 work behind there is a human part 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.479
 inside that bottle we are not 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.700
 selling smoke we are exposing what 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.710
 we do with the illusion and desire that 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.090
 we do it and with the illusion that this 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.090
 follow your path
