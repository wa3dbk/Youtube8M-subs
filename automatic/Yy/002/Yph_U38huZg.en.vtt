00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
splitter to the HDTV um let's see this

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:16.830 
splitter to the HDTV um let's see this
is<00:03:10.170> a<00:03:10.200> 9<00:03:10.530> volt<00:03:10.860> or<00:03:11.100> 12

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:27.510 

so<00:03:18.209> 24-volt<00:03:22.709> right<00:03:23.709> now<00:03:24.030> five<00:03:25.030> volt<00:03:26.520> sorry

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
so 24-volt right now five volt sorry

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.729 
so 24-volt right now five volt sorry
it's<00:03:27.670> my<00:03:27.760> first<00:03:28.000> time<00:03:28.120> eating<00:03:28.330> it<00:03:28.560> here's<00:03:29.560> the

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
remotes got five switches one two three

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.050 
remotes got five switches one two three
four<00:03:33.459> five

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
four five

four five
I<00:03:34.170> poured<00:03:35.170> amplified<00:03:35.620> selector<00:03:36.069> remote

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
I poured amplified selector remote

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.770 
I poured amplified selector remote
control<00:03:36.849> hopefully<00:03:37.150> this<00:03:37.269> has<00:03:37.390> batteries

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
control hopefully this has batteries

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.880 
control hopefully this has batteries
okay<00:03:37.930> but<00:03:38.290> probably<00:03:38.739> doesn't<00:03:40.500> here<00:03:41.500> is<00:03:41.680> the

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
okay but probably doesn't here is the

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.259 
okay but probably doesn't here is the
receiver<00:03:44.400> it's<00:03:45.400> a<00:03:45.489> little<00:03:45.700> smaller<00:03:45.940> than<00:03:46.030> I

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
receiver it's a little smaller than I

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.120 
receiver it's a little smaller than I
thought<00:03:46.510> but<00:03:47.080> that<00:03:47.260> is<00:03:47.410> good<00:03:47.709> because<00:03:47.920> I

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
thought but that is good because I

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.890 
thought but that is good because I
really<00:03:48.280> don't<00:03:48.640> need<00:03:48.819> a<00:03:48.880> big<00:03:49.120> bulky<00:03:49.510> stuff<00:03:49.720> all

pretty sure this has to be seen by the

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.969 
pretty sure this has to be seen by the
remote<00:04:31.360> so<00:04:32.200> it's<00:04:32.320> not<00:04:32.410> big<00:04:32.560> deal<00:04:34.650> now<00:04:35.650> let's

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
mean this is switcher a cheap switcher I

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.900 
mean this is switcher a cheap switcher I
got<00:04:45.370> this<00:04:45.490> for<00:04:45.700> $15<00:04:46.330> on<00:04:46.450> eBay<00:04:47.070> I<00:04:48.070> could<00:04:48.820> have

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
got this for $15 on eBay I could have

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.760 
got this for $15 on eBay I could have
gotten<00:04:49.030> more<00:04:49.180> expensive<00:04:49.270> one<00:04:49.930> but<00:04:50.320> I<00:04:50.560> bought

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
gotten more expensive one but I bought

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.980 
gotten more expensive one but I bought
this<00:04:50.919> with<00:04:51.100> birthday<00:04:51.400> money<00:04:51.610> and<00:04:51.850> I<00:04:52.690> figured

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
this with birthday money and I figured

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.900 
this with birthday money and I figured
it'd<00:04:53.080> be<00:04:53.110> nice<00:04:53.320> to<00:04:53.350> start<00:04:53.770> out<00:04:54.310> with<00:04:54.610> and<00:04:54.880> then

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
it'd be nice to start out with and then

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.469 
it'd be nice to start out with and then
move<00:04:55.360> on<00:04:55.479> to<00:04:55.570> a<00:04:55.660> more<00:04:55.900> expensive<00:04:56.229> one<00:04:57.330> as<00:04:58.330> you

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
move on to a more expensive one as you

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.550 
move on to a more expensive one as you
can<00:04:58.600> see<00:04:58.720> it's<00:04:58.840> got<00:04:58.960> the<00:04:59.080> five<00:05:00.060> inputs<00:05:01.560> these

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
can see it's got the five inputs these

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.580 
can see it's got the five inputs these
