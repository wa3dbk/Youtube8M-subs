00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:07.620
 hello how about with these things welcome 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.150
 to fight night as fredys 2 about two 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.349
 months I played part 1 and a lot of 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.150
 you warned me now that you know the 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.620
 part 2 and I'll play them that will play it 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.759
 they were suffering a lot and in fact 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.170
 when that's why the name of the game in 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.670
 youtube one of the most sought after things 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.810
 play german so you really 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.010
 they want me to play this game 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.880
 ok press control to use the light of 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.880
 marriages now 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.560
 wow 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.570
 because I think this is already a little bit so 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.370
 let's jump I did it press control 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.300
 to use the lite flash or the 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.170
 lantern we have a kind 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.670
 we have a kind of mask that 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.080
 I guess it's like to camouflage 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.570
 now because they told me that in this 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.570
 game no longer there is no 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.180
 there are no doors anymore there are lights basically 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.160
 so we can not close the entrance 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.760
 in no time because we are going to see the 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.039
 first cameras 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.920
 although I can use it with the control it can 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.360
 use light to see what happens as 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.880
 which gives a little more suspense to the 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.799
 matter although there is nobody around here nothing 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.939
 over there or here all right 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.520
 because they are the types that eventually 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:22.549
 they're going to want to kill me so look at them 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:25.680
 well it's a bunny I need for that 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.570
 There is something new and I have not seen it 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.800
 basically they look a lot like the game the 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.220
 only difference that we can put the 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.190
 light 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.050
 [Music] 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.159
 and we have this mask for 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.590
 hide 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.859
 and we do not have doors which is bad 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.859
 like 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.909
 like a diabolical little boy we do not like 

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:47.549
 children 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.079
 in horror games I mean 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.789
 we need to keep as that is we 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.759
 to string the musical box 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.929
 I do not know for what the fuck but I assume that in 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.439
 some time that will cause me a 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:57.439
 cardiac arrest 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.470
 now here while there is no one here 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.220
 neither easy nor in while there is nobody 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.259
 here or nobody here we are fine all good 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.250
 from here to there 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.250
 okay 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.670
 one already left one already left that's not 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.280
