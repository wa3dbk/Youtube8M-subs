00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
the previous units that we used so we're

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.229 
the previous units that we used so we're
really<00:03:35.269> pleased<00:03:35.690> with<00:03:36.519> my<00:03:37.519> veterinarian<00:03:38.060> and

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
really pleased with my veterinarian and

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.640 
really pleased with my veterinarian and
I<00:03:38.300> walked<00:03:38.660> through<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.900> milk<00:03:39.080> bar<00:03:39.290> and<00:03:39.410> after

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
I walked through the milk bar and after

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.620 
I walked through the milk bar and after
every<00:03:39.860> practice<00:03:40.370> and<00:03:40.400> we<00:03:40.760> just<00:03:40.970> look<00:03:41.360> at<00:03:41.480> tea

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
every practice and we just look at tea

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.120 
every practice and we just look at tea
tins<00:03:41.840> and<00:03:42.170> judge<00:03:42.410> them<00:03:42.620> and<00:03:42.769> see<00:03:42.890> how<00:03:42.950> they're

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
tins and judge them and see how they're

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.360 
tins and judge them and see how they're
going<00:03:43.310> and<00:03:44.170> we<00:03:45.170> since<00:03:45.650> using<00:03:45.860> the<00:03:46.040> impulse

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
going and we since using the impulse

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.680 
going and we since using the impulse
airliner<00:03:46.730> we've<00:03:46.910> noticed<00:03:47.209> they've<00:03:47.360> gotten

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
airliner we've noticed they've gotten

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.280

better<00:03:47.840> and<00:03:48.170> the<00:03:48.769> teens<00:03:49.130> have<00:03:49.630> have<00:03:50.630> greatly

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
better and the teens have have greatly

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.210 
better and the teens have have greatly
improved<00:03:51.830> here

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
improved here

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.550 
improved here
yeah<00:03:52.970> the<00:03:53.090> clusters<00:03:53.510> come<00:03:53.660> off<00:03:53.810> very<00:03:53.840> well<00:03:54.170> and

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
yeah the clusters come off very well and

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.580 
yeah the clusters come off very well and
they're<00:03:55.370> nice<00:03:55.730> and<00:03:55.790> light<00:03:56.120> to<00:03:56.299> put<00:03:56.510> on<00:03:56.660> I<00:03:56.870> found

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
they're nice and light to put on I found

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.170 
they're nice and light to put on I found
the<00:03:57.769> clusters<00:03:58.220> that<00:03:58.250> we<00:03:58.430> had<00:03:58.580> before<00:03:58.910> heavy

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
the clusters that we had before heavy

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.120 
the clusters that we had before heavy
and<00:03:59.360> cumbersome<00:03:59.810> but<00:04:00.440> these<00:04:00.620> are<00:04:00.890> sort<00:04:01.070> of

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
and cumbersome but these are sort of

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.789 
and cumbersome but these are sort of
very<00:04:01.340> springy<00:04:01.760> and<00:04:01.970> light<00:04:02.180> and<00:04:02.480> I'm<00:04:03.170> sure<00:04:03.620> the

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
very springy and light and I'm sure the

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.289 
very springy and light and I'm sure the
heifers<00:04:04.130> take<00:04:04.370> to<00:04:04.489> them<00:04:04.610> a<00:04:04.670> lot<00:04:04.790> better<00:04:05.000> than

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
heifers take to them a lot better than

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.100 
heifers take to them a lot better than
they<00:04:05.480> used<00:04:05.989> to<00:04:06.170> take<00:04:06.380> to<00:04:06.470> the<00:04:06.590> older<00:04:06.860> ones

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110
