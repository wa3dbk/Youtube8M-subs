00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.760
 what is the first one just not 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.400
 to increase the missions to come empty 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.750
 unitary new sketch we had a little 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.129
 wrong initially we are just in 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.580
 train to find a rhythm a little bit 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.869
 to stay very very long in 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.190
 laval's joke writing actually and 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.590
 how to get out we did not know 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.880
 if we had to finally do how 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.230
 writing is what you write as a manga 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.760
 like the very bad jokes and after 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.260
 that's what counter - effects are 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.760
 tour szavay boss wrote as 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.020
 students of the first skits 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.960
 we did not really know where we were going 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.210
 to others and r actually seeing them at 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.170
 montage and turn robin it's like that 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.909
 that we must finally do we must change 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.140
 its shape and its strip to that it's suddenly 

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:42.969
 actually there now we took a 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:45.489
 true with fashion and creation is a little 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:46.749
 wobbly will not be very it will be 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.760
 actually the case and that there has been 

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:50.890
 but after that we often say there are 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.699
 drifts to blake posted on the page 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.710
 Facebook 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.179
 me it's a great suck do not have to 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.579
 put and then actually done well it's okay 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:01:00.370
 it's shia thouars that's what is 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.539
 interesting with them with its programs 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.469
 whether it is real or what we are 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.750
 doing is that each 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.430
 sketch in full finds his audience that 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.320
 made some people laugh which do 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.880
 not at all low and so I was there 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.800
 finds his account and that too when 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.570
 we write in definition the whole base for 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.990
 Let's us happy make us 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.409
 to laugh at a very selfish agency but 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.460
 to have it make us laugh yes these are these 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.689
 If ass stories break 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.250
 side a little side a little plane plan 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:33.720
 fixed it's extraordinary we can do 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:35.729
 to explain to you while watching 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.610
 we become the press conference 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.990
 yes no it is framed but it is in everything 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.170
 this is bavaisis it's nice thank you 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:49.049
 so here I saw david lavoie the lime 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.610
 who are we coming to the conference of 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.440
 palmashow launch press 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.549

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.130
 launch of mediabus 2 December 3 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:03.780

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:08.280
 new chain is enchanted form it 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.330
 do not laugh at yourself what is it 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.289
 stones because there since talents 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.880
 actor to ask questions 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.989
 I imagine if you certainly have 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.540
 do a skit even on conferences 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.680
 press I'm pretty sure that's it 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.180
 the guys who make sure for example 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.980
 that but it's the web is to do 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.299
 2 podcast stick to it what is the 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.500
 questions you would not like 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.200
 never hear and we are not we 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.250
 ask yes that's right there is why the 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.700
 little macho that does when you are 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.700
 racist 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.860
 people do not necessarily pick up and like 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.390
 it's a bit open to everyone 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.020
 world on the comments of the cool 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.450
 yes internet 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.770
 we can say that it's great and 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.520
 just below you fuck room fucked 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.850
 it's like in real life 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.080
 part is a little all ages ago 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:18.920
 never who will come someone who goes 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:20.270
 finally this internet internet thing for 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.680
 you would do that what represents what in 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.480
 hearing term we said everything to 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.100
 the time we talked with a kid the 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.270
 theirs and who said that it is his 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.220
 winged legs look directly 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.120
 not my shoe on the internet which 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.190
 is interesting is that there is on 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.180
 internet is the public quite young and 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.460
 and then what they want to see again 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.770
 actually or sermat and introduced 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.600
 older ECCC in fact it is 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.700
 train to touch 100 content that one 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.650
 does not intend to reach an audience really 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.970
 wide and that's pretty cool and 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.770
 now on the internet as we know 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.460
 it's important already because we have to 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.320
 so much internet that's what he did 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.300
 but we do not do skits for 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.400
 internet like we do not skate 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.010
 for TV as we said we are very 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.280
 set list we did sketches for this 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.700
 to laugh and then the 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.020
 believes that it must be disseminated by its 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.760
 passes and not it's not specifically 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.770
 does it like cip nothing or the norman d 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.069
 hugo director only for a format 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.069
 Internet 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.960
 did that open up some of the 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.030
 media doors the people who have you 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.070
 called artists you thought 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.150
 maybe never touched are there since 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.260
 very long time and that just told you 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.490
 I love what you do my kid 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.890
 you show it to me to show on a 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:56.060
 this is crazy we did not talk about 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:05:19.510
 thaler especially not appreciated since 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:22.750
 honored notice it starts to film 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.750
 to write something 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:32.460
 go ahead do it as you feel oasis 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:36.889
 if it is freely the street there are some 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:47.599
 ideas we will do a little bit of scenes 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:49.650
 and yeah nan it's not written here I have the 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:06:04.740
 watch programmer the written arrangement 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:06:09.840
 but gaza and then he wants to do a 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:13.460
 new thing I think it suits me 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.460
 to write how many numbers already written 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.500
 but me it would be great it's true 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:35.849
 in this case I had already made you his 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:07:00.389
 homework really write in session and 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:07:01.319
 writing I will be absolutely perfect 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:02.940
 we wish you 

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:03.750
 we want to be kept from doing full 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.110
 of audience where you do not care 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.110
 completely 

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:14.300
 interviews the dwarfs stuff this 

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:15.590
 what was going to do with things that 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.909
 passed this case the iphone but that's 

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.909
