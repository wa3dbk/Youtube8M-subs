00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.120 
to be doing another hairstyle tutorial I
have<00:00:18.810> been<00:00:18.960> getting<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.230> few<00:00:19.350> comments<00:00:19.890> lately

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
have been getting a few comments lately

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.279 
have been getting a few comments lately
from<00:00:20.430> people<00:00:21.529> inquiring<00:00:23.539> positively<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.810> not

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
from people inquiring positively and not

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.370 
from people inquiring positively and not
so<00:00:25.560> positively<00:00:26.630> about<00:00:27.630> why<00:00:27.839> I<00:00:27.869> do<00:00:28.019> tutorials

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
so positively about why I do tutorials

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.189 
so positively about why I do tutorials
but<00:00:29.249> I<00:00:29.279> never<00:00:29.489> do<00:00:29.699> them<00:00:29.849> on<00:00:29.999> myself<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
but I never do them on myself so the

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.530 
but I never do them on myself so the
reason<00:00:31.499> for<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.739> being<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.340> purely<00:00:33.180> and

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
reason for that being is purely and

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.600 
reason for that being is purely and
simply<00:00:33.750> because<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.560> a<00:00:34.920> hundred<00:00:35.430> times

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
simply because it is a hundred times

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.940 
simply because it is a hundred times
easier<00:00:36.149> but<00:00:36.660> also<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> hundred<00:00:37.740> times

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
easier but also it is a hundred times

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.220 
easier but also it is a hundred times
clearer<00:00:38.400> for<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.820> guys<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.420> see<00:00:39.990> what<00:00:40.140> I'm

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
clearer for you guys to see what I'm

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.020 
clearer for you guys to see what I'm
doing<00:00:40.620> without<00:00:41.130> trying<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.700> complicate

clip<00:02:00.450> I'm<00:02:00.689> just<00:02:00.930> using<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.409> sort<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.799> one

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
clip I'm just using this sort of one

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.380 
clip I'm just using this sort of one
here<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.880> keep<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.330> sections<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.990> hair<00:02:04.200> from

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
here to keep the sections of hair from

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.509 
here to keep the sections of hair from
this<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.510> how<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.720> start<00:02:07.250> you<00:02:08.250> want<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.459> start

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
this is how you start you want to start

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.059 
this is how you start you want to start
by<00:02:08.819> smoothing<00:02:09.330> all<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.049> hair<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.560> work

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
by smoothing all of the hair and work

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.699 
by smoothing all of the hair and work
from<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.670> bottom<00:02:11.849> upwards<00:02:12.269> so<00:02:13.200> start<00:02:13.530> at<00:02:13.620> the

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
from the bottom upwards so start at the

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:14.910 
from the bottom upwards so start at the
ear<00:02:13.890> until<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.490> reach

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
ear until you reach

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.339 
ear until you reach
the<00:02:14.980> top<00:02:15.250> section<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:16.060> pair<00:02:16.990> where<00:02:17.230> you

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
the top section a pair where you

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.070 
the top section a pair where you
originally<00:02:17.650> split<00:02:18.310> in<00:02:18.610> half<00:02:18.880> or<00:02:19.330> sectioned

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
originally split in half or sectioned

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.110 
originally split in half or sectioned
off<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.840> you<00:02:22.900> can<00:02:23.260> take<00:02:23.709> your<00:02:23.920> comb<00:02:24.370> hold<00:02:25.030> it

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
off so you can take your comb hold it

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.190 
off so you can take your comb hold it
back<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:28.720> this<00:02:29.080> is<00:02:29.319> going<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:29.770> be<00:02:29.920> your<00:02:30.370> first

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
back and this is going to be your first

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.570 
back and this is going to be your first
braid<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.709> you<00:02:32.860> want<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.069> pin<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.310> rest<00:02:33.430> of

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
braid and you want to pin the rest of

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.400 
braid and you want to pin the rest of
the<00:02:33.640> hair<00:02:33.790> out<00:02:33.940> of<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.060> way

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
the hair out of the way

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.410 
the hair out of the way
okay<00:02:35.410> so<00:02:35.470> you<00:02:35.709> want<00:02:35.950> to<00:02:36.010> take<00:02:36.160> two<00:02:36.850> very<00:02:38.069> very

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
okay so you want to take two very very

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.140 
okay so you want to take two very very
small<00:02:40.420> sections<00:02:41.110> up<00:02:41.350> front<00:02:41.830> and<00:02:42.580> basically

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
small sections up front and basically

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.990 
small sections up front and basically
the<00:02:43.360> technique<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:44.050> this<00:02:44.200> is<00:02:44.550> basically<00:02:45.550> just

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
the technique to this is basically just

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.300 
the technique to this is basically just
twisting<00:02:46.510> bits<00:02:46.810> of<00:02:46.959> hair<00:02:47.170> so<00:02:47.860> you<00:02:47.920> want<00:02:48.220> it

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
twisting bits of hair so you want it

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.479 
twisting bits of hair so you want it
twisted<00:02:49.050> always<00:02:50.050> upwards<00:02:50.739> so<00:02:50.920> you<00:02:50.980> always

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
twisted always upwards so you always

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.750 
twisted always upwards so you always
want<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.730> have<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:53.470> hair<00:02:53.709> going<00:02:54.040> up<00:02:54.310> towards

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
want to have the hair going up towards

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.059 
want to have the hair going up towards
the<00:02:54.940> ceiling<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:55.420> you<00:02:55.600> always<00:02:55.930> add<00:02:56.140> in<00:02:56.500> hair

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
the ceiling and you always add in hair

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.640 
the ceiling and you always add in hair
strands<00:02:57.430> to<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:57.730> bottom<00:02:58.090> only<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.410> bottom

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
strands to the bottom only to the bottom

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.330 
strands to the bottom only to the bottom
so<00:03:00.430> you<00:03:00.549> take<00:03:00.700> us<00:03:00.850> around<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.260> bottom<00:03:02.410> and

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
so you take us around to the bottom and

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.449 
so you take us around to the bottom and
you<00:03:03.400> twist<00:03:03.670> it<00:03:03.790> up<00:03:03.850> towards<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.269> ceiling<00:03:05.459> and

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
you twist it up towards the ceiling and

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.550 
you twist it up towards the ceiling and
again<00:03:06.819> I'm<00:03:07.690> you<00:03:07.989> want<00:03:08.140> to<00:03:08.200> keep<00:03:08.290> it<00:03:08.470> as<00:03:08.530> tight

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
again I'm you want to keep it as tight

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.309 
again I'm you want to keep it as tight
as<00:03:08.860> possible<00:03:09.130> to<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:10.060> actual<00:03:10.540> hair<00:03:10.840> root<00:03:13.319> and

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
as possible to the actual hair root and

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.460 
as possible to the actual hair root and
you<00:03:14.440> want<00:03:14.590> to<00:03:14.650> keep<00:03:14.799> doing<00:03:15.250> this<00:03:16.140> until<00:03:17.140> you

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
you want to keep doing this until you

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.880 
you want to keep doing this until you
get<00:03:17.620> all<00:03:17.830> the<00:03:18.100> way<00:03:18.190> back<00:03:18.220> to<00:03:19.380> this<00:03:20.380> section

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
get all the way back to this section

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.330 
get all the way back to this section
just<00:03:20.920> behind<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.670> ear<00:03:22.709> keep<00:03:23.709> remembering<00:03:23.980> to

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
just behind the ear keep remembering to

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.099 
just behind the ear keep remembering to
pull<00:03:24.579> it<00:03:24.700> tight<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:26.220> I<00:03:27.220> in<00:03:27.430> small<00:03:27.790> sections

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
pull it tight and I in small sections

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:35.370 
pull it tight and I in small sections
all<00:03:29.109> the<00:03:29.350> time

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.310 

this<00:03:35.980> will<00:03:36.160> work<00:03:36.280> on<00:03:36.490> any<00:03:36.550> length<00:03:37.030> pair<00:03:37.360> and<00:03:37.720> he

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
this will work on any length pair and he

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.070 
this will work on any length pair and he
texts<00:03:38.800> your<00:03:38.920> hair<00:03:39.130> it's<00:03:39.580> particularly<00:03:40.120> good

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
I didn't small strands to the bottom

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.700 
I didn't small strands to the bottom
strand<00:04:29.350> I'm<00:04:29.650> pulling<00:04:30.040> tight<00:04:30.280> the<00:04:30.550> whole<00:04:30.580> time

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710

this<00:04:32.710> is<00:04:32.920> perfect<00:04:33.430> for<00:04:34.470> unci<00:04:35.470> running<00:04:36.100> out<00:04:36.310> the

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
this is perfect for unci running out the

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.430 
this is perfect for unci running out the
door<00:04:37.090> in<00:04:37.330> the<00:04:37.360> morning<00:04:37.510> and<00:04:37.840> I<00:04:37.900> think<00:04:38.170> if<00:04:38.290> your

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
door in the morning and I think if your

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.520 
door in the morning and I think if your
hair<00:04:38.620> was<00:04:38.650> wet<00:04:39.070> it<00:04:39.540> could<00:04:40.540> possibly<00:04:40.690> be<00:04:40.990> easier

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
hair was wet it could possibly be easier

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:47.490 
hair was wet it could possibly be easier
to<00:04:41.800> work<00:04:41.980> with<00:04:45.540> but<00:04:46.540> this<00:04:46.720> look<00:04:47.020> is<00:04:47.230> much

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
to work with but this look is much

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.310 
to work with but this look is much
better<00:04:47.740> I<00:04:48.100> think<00:04:49.090> than<00:04:49.540> the<00:04:49.600> regular<00:04:50.080> three

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
better I think than the regular three

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.470 
better I think than the regular three

or if you wanted to have a different
texture<00:06:07.340> even<00:06:07.670> hairspray<00:06:08.630> would<00:06:08.840> work<00:06:09.760> or<00:06:10.760> you

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:10.970 
texture even hairspray would work or you

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.700 
texture even hairspray would work or you
could<00:06:11.120> try<00:06:11.270> it<00:06:11.330> out<00:06:11.450> on<00:06:11.510> wet<00:06:11.870> hair<00:06:11.900> like<00:06:12.410> I<00:06:12.440> said

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.020 
and when you take out these twists your
hair<00:06:16.310> will<00:06:16.610> be<00:06:16.930> extremely<00:06:17.930> I<00:06:18.730> want<00:06:19.730> to<00:06:19.850> say

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.030 
hair will be extremely I want to say

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.210 
hair will be extremely I want to say
wavy<00:06:20.540> but<00:06:20.870> it<00:06:20.990> could<00:06:21.200> be<00:06:21.380> that<00:06:21.710> it's<00:06:21.860> sort<00:06:22.130> of

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
wavy but it could be that it's sort of

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:28.390 
wavy but it could be that it's sort of
twisted<00:06:24.370> and<00:06:25.370> crimped<00:06:25.820> looking<00:06:27.010> so<00:06:28.010> again

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
twisted and crimped looking so again

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.760 
twisted and crimped looking so again
once<00:06:28.790> you<00:06:29.000> reach<00:06:29.150> the<00:06:29.330> back<00:06:29.510> it's<00:06:29.960> an<00:06:30.050> extra<00:06:30.470> -

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:30.770 
once you reach the back it's an extra -

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.160 
once you reach the back it's an extra -
I<00:06:31.120> probably<00:06:32.120> would<00:06:32.360> reduce<00:06:32.660> the<00:06:32.870> number<00:06:33.140> of

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:33.170 
I probably would reduce the number of

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.570 
I probably would reduce the number of
choice<00:06:33.470> that<00:06:33.500> you<00:06:33.740> do<00:06:33.860> once<00:06:34.190> you've<00:06:34.370> reached

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.580 
choice that you do once you've reached

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.280 
choice that you do once you've reached
the<00:06:34.760> end<00:06:34.790> of<00:06:35.300> this<00:06:35.480> sort<00:06:35.660> of<00:06:35.720> back<00:06:35.900> section
