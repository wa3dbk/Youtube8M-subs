100 more horsepower and what we're going
to<00:00:58.340> do<00:00:58.430> now<00:00:58.550> is<00:00:58.730> flip<00:00:58.880> if<00:00:59.090> I<00:00:59.180> give<00:00:59.390> it<00:00:59.480> some<00:00:59.570> more

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
to do now is flip if I give it some more

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.480 
to do now is flip if I give it some more
climbing<00:01:00.080> when<00:01:00.200> I<00:01:00.230> give<00:01:00.410> me<00:01:00.560> the<00:01:00.860> last<00:01:01.040> boat

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:03.490 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.860 

I'm<00:01:04.490> going<00:01:04.640> to<00:01:04.730> show<00:01:04.910> you<00:01:04.940> the<00:01:05.180> boost<00:01:05.390> gauge<00:01:05.480> so

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
I'm going to show you the boost gauge so

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.150 
I'm going to show you the boost gauge so
you<00:01:05.930> would<00:01:06.140> store<00:01:06.440> the<00:01:06.470> boost<00:01:06.770> gauge<00:01:06.830> is<00:01:07.040> right

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
you would store the boost gauge is right

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.440 
you would store the boost gauge is right
here<00:01:07.310> up<00:01:07.400> on<00:01:07.520> top<00:01:08.350> turn<00:01:09.350> on<00:01:09.470> the<00:01:09.530> light<00:01:10.450> you

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
here up on top turn on the light you

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.790 
here up on top turn on the light you
guys<00:01:11.630> can<00:01:11.840> see<00:01:12.020> what<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:12.260> boost<00:01:12.440> is<00:01:12.560> going<00:01:12.740> to

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
guys can see what the boost is going to

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
guys can see what the boost is going to
be<00:01:12.970> and<00:01:13.970> you<00:01:14.360> see<00:01:14.570> how<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:16.580> boost<00:01:16.820> feeds

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.600 

let's<00:01:20.180> get<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.540> fourth

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
let's get the fourth

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.790 
let's get the fourth
now<00:01:23.090> see<00:01:23.270> how<00:01:23.330> these<00:01:23.480> vortex<00:01:23.960> will<00:01:24.110> ramp<00:01:24.320> boost

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
now see how these vortex will ramp boost

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.620 
now see how these vortex will ramp boost
up<00:01:25.040> on<00:01:25.250> the<00:01:25.340> terminal

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
up on the terminal

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.240 
up on the terminal
turbos<00:01:27.380> always<00:01:27.680> gonna<00:01:27.770> make<00:01:27.860> a<00:01:27.979> little<00:01:28.070> bit

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
turbos always gonna make a little bit

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.679 
turbos always gonna make a little bit
more<00:01:28.369> power<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:28.850> last<00:01:29.030> car<00:01:29.210> beyond<00:01:29.390> here<00:01:29.600> was

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
more power the last car beyond here was

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.940 
more power the last car beyond here was
an<00:01:29.810> event<00:01:30.049> that<00:01:30.080> kids<00:01:30.409> car<00:01:31.869> and<00:01:32.869> it's<00:01:33.439> made

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
an event that kids car and it's made

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.640 
an event that kids car and it's made
about<00:01:34.159> 300<00:01:34.400> once<00:01:34.820> the<00:01:34.970> policy

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.170 

there's<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.100> lot<00:01:38.340> more<00:01:38.550> power<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:39.120> this

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
there's a lot more power but this

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:46.810 
there's a lot more power but this
because<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.480> a<00:01:39.650> severe<00:01:40.650> burn<00:01:40.920> forth

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:02:09.639 

we<00:01:47.360> go<00:01:47.480> starting<00:01:47.900> to<00:01:47.960> test

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:10.839 

let's<00:02:09.799> see<00:02:09.890> what<00:02:10.009> kind<00:02:10.069> of<00:02:10.189> power<00:02:10.340> numbers<00:02:10.729> it

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
let's see what kind of power numbers it

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.830 
let's see what kind of power numbers it
makes

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.730 

the<00:02:15.020> test

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:28.350 

more<00:02:19.160> time<00:02:19.370> from<00:02:19.610> before

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.990 

that's<00:02:28.870> what<00:02:29.050> I<00:02:29.080> made<00:02:29.260> before

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:44.510 

terming<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.630> little<00:02:32.870> bit<00:02:32.960> me

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.030 

Hey<00:02:45.090> five<00:02:45.900> more<00:02:46.110> started<00:02:46.620> getting<00:02:46.800> a<00:02:46.830> couple

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
Hey five more started getting a couple

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.800 
Hey five more started getting a couple
more<00:02:47.160> degrees<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.610> mean<00:02:47.760> this<00:02:48.180> is<00:02:48.360> more<00:02:48.660> than

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
more degrees I mean this is more than

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.170 
more degrees I mean this is more than
enough<00:02:48.960> for<00:02:49.350> what<00:02:50.100> this<00:02:50.250> car<00:02:50.490> is<00:02:50.520> doing<00:02:50.880> when

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
enough for what this car is doing when

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.330 
enough for what this car is doing when
it's<00:02:51.360> making<00:02:51.600> them<00:02:51.930> when<00:02:52.620> it's<00:02:52.740> making<00:02:52.950> boost

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
it's making them when it's making boost

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.020 
it's making them when it's making boost
I<00:02:53.610> mean<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:55.220> guess<00:02:56.220> that<00:02:56.250> turbo<00:02:56.670> was<00:02:56.760> always

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
I mean I guess that turbo was always

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.930 
I mean I guess that turbo was always
gonna<00:02:57.120> make<00:02:57.210> one<00:02:57.480> a<00:02:57.630> lot<00:02:57.810> more<00:02:58.080> power<00:02:59.070> but<00:02:59.850> I

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
gonna make one a lot more power but I

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.490 
gonna make one a lot more power but I
mean<00:03:00.060> this<00:03:00.150> is<00:03:00.270> a<00:03:00.300> really<00:03:00.630> decent<00:03:00.780> number<00:03:01.230> for

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
mean this is a really decent number for

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.980 
mean this is a really decent number for
3pz<00:03:02.100> at<00:03:02.340> six<00:03:02.550> over<00:03:02.760> three<00:03:03.090> or<00:03:03.510> 20<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.840> wheels

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
3pz at six over three or 20 the wheels

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.490 
3pz at six over three or 20 the wheels
is<00:03:04.230> as<00:03:05.160> close<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.550> 400<00:03:06.060> plus<00:03:06.240> horsepower<00:03:06.500> at

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
is as close to 400 plus horsepower at

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.400 
is as close to 400 plus horsepower at
the<00:03:07.710> motor<00:03:07.920> on<00:03:08.100> this<00:03:08.250> car

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
the motor on this car

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.560 
the motor on this car
I'm<00:03:10.470> happy<00:03:10.770> with<00:03:10.860> that<00:03:11.100> so<00:03:12.060> here<00:03:12.180> we<00:03:12.240> are<00:03:12.270> Bros

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
I'm happy with that so here we are Bros

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.880 
I'm happy with that so here we are Bros
is<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.380> final<00:03:14.870> final<00:03:15.870> tune<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:16.350> was<00:03:16.470> aiming<00:03:16.860> for

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
is the final final tune I was aiming for

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:17.750 
is the final final tune I was aiming for
3:30

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
3:30

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.530 
3:30
I'll<00:03:18.150> take<00:03:18.390> through<00:03:18.570> 29<00:03:20.060> except<00:03:21.060> those<00:03:21.240> Johnny

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
I'll take through 29 except those Johnny

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.940 
I'll take through 29 except those Johnny
here<00:03:21.750> just<00:03:21.900> ate<00:03:21.990> in<00:03:22.080> this<00:03:22.200> war<00:03:22.350> tight<00:03:22.530> car<00:03:22.770> for
