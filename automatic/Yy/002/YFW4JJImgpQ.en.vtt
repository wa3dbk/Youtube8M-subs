crystal<00:02:57.720> flash<00:02:57.959> for<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.290> Winx<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.859> what<00:02:59.519> I<00:02:59.549> do

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
crystal flash for the Winx and what I do

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.789 
crystal flash for the Winx and what I do
is<00:03:00.000> I<00:03:00.120> just<00:03:00.739> cut<00:03:01.739> it<00:03:01.799> in<00:03:02.159> two<00:03:03.120> different<00:03:03.510> pieces

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
is I just cut it in two different pieces

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.949 
is I just cut it in two different pieces
so<00:03:04.799> I<00:03:04.829> have<00:03:05.209> two<00:03:06.209> different<00:03:06.359> pieces<00:03:06.629> that<00:03:06.720> got

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
so I have two different pieces that got

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.360 
so I have two different pieces that got
that<00:03:07.049> a<00:03:07.109> little<00:03:07.319> too<00:03:07.440> short<00:03:07.769> and<00:03:08.010> do<00:03:08.220> that

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
that a little too short and do that

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:18.439 
that a little too short and do that
again<00:03:14.690> so<00:03:15.690> I<00:03:15.750> have<00:03:15.989> two<00:03:16.260> separate<00:03:16.680> pieces<00:03:17.449> and

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:18.449 
again so I have two separate pieces and

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:19.460 
again so I have two separate pieces and
what<00:03:18.540> I'm<00:03:18.629> going<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:18.810> do<00:03:18.989> is<00:03:19.109> I'm<00:03:19.230> just<00:03:19.260> gonna

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
what I'm going to do is I'm just gonna

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.699 
what I'm going to do is I'm just gonna
time<00:03:19.829> in<00:03:20.120> on<00:03:21.120> this<00:03:21.510> side<00:03:22.370> my<00:03:23.370> side<00:03:23.400> that<00:03:23.849> is<00:03:24.709> two

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
time in on this side my side that is two

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.189 
time in on this side my side that is two
on<00:03:25.919> that<00:03:26.160> and<00:03:26.400> then<00:03:26.549> I'll<00:03:26.669> take<00:03:26.940> a<00:03:27.329> few<00:03:27.930> wraps

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:28.199 
on that and then I'll take a few wraps

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:33.110 
on that and then I'll take a few wraps
back<00:03:28.699> and<00:03:29.699> then<00:03:30.329> pull<00:03:30.810> these<00:03:31.280> other<00:03:32.280> two<00:03:32.609> over

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
back and then pull these other two over

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.180 
back and then pull these other two over
to<00:03:33.209> this<00:03:33.359> side<00:03:33.629> so<00:03:34.440> that<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:34.769> just<00:03:34.919> makes<00:03:35.099> a

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
to this side so that it just makes a

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.550 
to this side so that it just makes a
little<00:03:35.310> bit<00:03:35.489> more<00:03:35.639> pronounced<00:03:36.299> winged<00:03:36.560> coming

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
little bit more pronounced winged coming

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:45.110 
little bit more pronounced winged coming
out<00:03:37.680> of<00:03:37.799> there<00:03:37.919> and<00:03:42.410> you<00:03:43.790> can<00:03:44.790> always<00:03:44.910> make

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
out of there and you can always make

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.610 
out of there and you can always make
them<00:03:45.239> shorter<00:03:45.660> if<00:03:45.900> I<00:03:46.109> feel<00:03:46.290> it's<00:03:46.440> necessary

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
them shorter if I feel it's necessary

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:53.360 
them shorter if I feel it's necessary
but<00:03:47.160> for<00:03:47.489> now<00:03:47.690> this<00:03:48.690> is<00:03:48.840> on<00:03:48.959> a<00:03:48.989> 2488<00:03:52.220> this<00:03:53.220> one

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
but for now this is on a 2488 this one

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.189 
but for now this is on a 2488 this one
in<00:03:53.459> particular<00:03:53.909> is<00:03:54.030> a<00:03:54.060> size<00:03:54.299> 18<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:54.780> I'll<00:03:55.049> tie

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:55.199 
in particular is a size 18 and I'll tie

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:59.210 
in particular is a size 18 and I'll tie
it<00:03:55.230> all<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.190> way<00:03:56.310> down<00:03:56.489> to<00:03:56.790> oh<00:03:57.590> I'll<00:03:58.590> go<00:03:58.829> to<00:03:58.889> 22

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
a little bit of it shines through that's

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.840 
a little bit of it shines through that's
great<00:04:30.900> and<00:04:31.140> by<00:04:31.350> shine<00:04:31.620> through<00:04:31.950> you'll
