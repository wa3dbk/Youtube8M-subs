00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:10.310
 let's cook with agar-agar 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.159
 in our case as always but nothing 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:17.089
 because it is better that we can be found in the market come from a 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:19.929
 just make it called gelid and a 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:24.129
 which is the best so that later our dish genifique or in this case our 

00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:25.560
 dish cream before 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.569
 that thick 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:31.839
 The first thing we are going to do is present the ingredients in this case 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:33.440
 very fast and very easy 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.790
 we have some peas that what we have done is simply thaw them 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.990
 a little salt 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.260
 oil 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.520
 Pepper 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.700
 Water 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.050
 this ham we have here that we have been a little bit is simply 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.920
 to decorate 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.970
 and how not but nothing 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.970
 we add the peas 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.150
 a little water 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.860
 approximately then for half a kilo of in 10 before 300 milliliters 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.520
 we close 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.680
 hard viatri 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.530
 while I have here in a saucepan 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.039
 heating a deciliter of water when it boils 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:15.530
 we got to be by the hour 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.530
 As always remember you have to cast them design form life move 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.080
 constantly and have it about a minute 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.650
 this process is going to be much faster than if we use another type of 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.650
 staging is like for example fish tail 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.289
 in which you have to hydrate previously 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:37.170
 then who to put it 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.130
 the preparation we want to use 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.039
 and finally being about 2 3 hours even more time 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.850
 in cold until we set, we have the luckiest thing that went in to swim 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.330
 by the way 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.469
 we do not have to follow all the steps 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:55.609
 and you learn a lot faster than the edifying power ten 

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:56.670
 times higher 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.160
 to the others that pieces 4 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.160
 we have the water already practically boiling 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.690
 what we are going to do is add a gram the pronaa bar envelopes 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.390
 they have four grams so what we are going to do is weigh it, I have the 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.679
 lucky to have this crusade that will ask me to weigh it 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:16.759
 at home 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:20.089
 a teaspoon of this date is about a gram 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.059
 as usual 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:31.719
 sprinkled 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:36.659
 in the form of rain and moving if we can not get lux 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:39.529
 these funds 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:44.409
 while this warms up I think it's important that we know what 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.659
 we are eating what we are consuming 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:48.339
 and here to say 

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:53.329
 ron agar has approximately 95% fiber dietary fiber 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.509
 who is going to be very good for our body 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.209
 elevates the car constipation 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.549
 that will positively influence diabetes for example 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:05.190
 Thus 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.289
 apart from being an edible food 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:10.579
 I also know that the state contributes 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.059
 things beneficial to the body 

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:17.079
 because there are indications that are targeted vegetable 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:21.759
 then another curiosity that we could tell from the point of view 

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:22.900
 astronomically 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.519
 of pronaa cats 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.779
 it's a jelly 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:32.599
 we can do it, we can qualify, that is, take a body but then we can 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:33.909
 to warm 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:37.180
 and on heating it will continue with the same shape as before 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.989
 therefore we are going to take a jelly streets 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:42.739
 we already have it 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.019
 i here 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.019
 we will incorporate it directly 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:52.969
 to our pea cream 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.049
 simply this is a bit that is not so liquid 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:05.979
 we add 

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:07.109
 and already step 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.249
 let's add 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:10.969
 a little salt 

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:16.590
 of pepper and oil all that as always pleasant and little by little do not go to 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.329
 to be married 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.569
 oil let's see a good jet cited paco 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:25.949
 health 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.150
 pepper a little too 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.150
 it's a matter of refining and working 

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:37.789
 the good thing about this cream 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:40.789
 is that we have made it very fast very easy 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.639
 in a very short time 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.199
 and at the same time 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.199
 as Sahrawi 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:53.889
 see what color and texture 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.050
 so pretty has 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.360
 and to give it a touch a little more original simply 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:04.460
 that state a little bit of Serrano ham 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.169
 that I think with the cream 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:07.629
 It is always accompanied very well
