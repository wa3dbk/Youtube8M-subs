of sprues and a couple of colors it's so

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.599 
of sprues and a couple of colors it's so
simple<00:00:21.720> in<00:00:22.050> fact<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.859> instructions<00:00:23.460> are

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
simple in fact that the instructions are

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.080 
simple in fact that the instructions are
printed<00:00:23.820> on<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.240> inside<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.710> box<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.910> do

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.429 
have a sticker sheet here unfortunately
I<00:00:29.519> think<00:00:29.580> this<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.210> worst<00:00:30.480> sticker<00:00:31.080> sheet

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
I think this is the worst sticker sheet

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.160 
I think this is the worst sticker sheet
out<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.189> entire<00:00:32.640> wave<00:00:33.000> just<00:00:33.570> because<00:00:33.899> this

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
out of the entire wave just because this

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.340 
out of the entire wave just because this
whole<00:00:34.739> sticker<00:00:35.370> here<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:36.030> his<00:00:36.270> entire<00:00:36.719> face

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
whole sticker here is his entire face

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.610 
whole sticker here is his entire face
and<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:38.309> just<00:00:38.820> looks<00:00:39.360> awful<00:00:39.600> when<00:00:40.469> it's

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620

of<00:00:43.739> paper<00:00:44.840> now<00:00:45.840> personally<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:47.010> think<00:00:47.280> hunter

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
of paper now personally I think hunter

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.430 
of paper now personally I think hunter
is<00:00:48.120> by<00:00:48.719> far<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.739> best<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.510> three<00:00:51.899> level

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
is by far the best of the three level

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.799 
is by far the best of the three level
one<00:00:52.710> figures<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.879> looks<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.480> part

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
one figures it looks the part

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.959 
one figures it looks the part
once<00:00:55.079> again<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.649> color<00:00:55.890> scheme<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.699> pretty

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
once again the color scheme is is pretty

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.540

which<00:02:13.800> i<00:02:13.950> think<00:02:13.980> is<00:02:14.370> amazing<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.330> he<00:02:15.930> that

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
which i think is amazing and he that

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.500 
which i think is amazing and he that
easily<00:02:16.980> makes<00:02:17.430> him<00:02:17.670> have<00:02:17.819> more<00:02:18.000> playability

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
easily makes him have more playability

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.800 
easily makes him have more playability
than<00:02:18.959> any<00:02:19.349> of<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.830> other<00:02:20.040> level<00:02:20.610> ones<00:02:20.849> as<00:02:21.269> for

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
than any of the other level ones as for

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.509 
than any of the other level ones as for
articulation<00:02:22.470> his<00:02:22.650> head<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.040> little<00:02:23.099> bit

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
articulation his head is a little bit

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.009 
articulation his head is a little bit
limited<00:02:23.849> just<00:02:24.330> because<00:02:24.540> he's<00:02:24.660> kind<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:24.900> in

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
limited just because he's kind of in

this hunched over position but it's got

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.880 
this hunched over position but it's got
some<00:02:27.599> pretty<00:02:27.780> decent<00:02:28.019> range<00:02:28.440> all<00:02:28.680> things

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
some pretty decent range all things

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.220 
some pretty decent range all things

has<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:36.780> most<00:02:36.989> range<00:02:37.410> out<00:02:37.680> of<00:02:37.769> any<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:38.069> them

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
has the most range out of any of them

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.619 
has the most range out of any of them
just<00:02:38.790> because<00:02:40.040> well<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.340> shape<00:02:41.610> of<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:42.030> his

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
elbow bends it's on a ball joint so it

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.170 
elbow bends it's on a ball joint so it

little<00:02:57.390> bit<00:02:57.540> strange<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:58.470> only<00:02:58.590> get<00:02:58.799> about

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
little bit strange you only get about

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.699 
little bit strange you only get about
that<00:02:59.370> much<00:02:59.730> movement<00:03:00.000> out<00:03:00.420> of<00:03:00.480> them<00:03:00.780> stale

that much movement out of them stale

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.800 
that much movement out of them stale
here<00:03:02.010> is<00:03:02.310> also<00:03:02.640> on<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.790> ball<00:03:03.030> joint<00:03:03.209> comes<00:03:03.660> out

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
here is also on a ball joint comes out

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.660 
here is also on a ball joint comes out
often<00:03:04.049> but<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:04.829> can<00:03:04.950> get<00:03:05.099> that<00:03:05.220> going<00:03:05.489> around

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
often but you can get that going around

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.630 
often but you can get that going around
and<00:03:06.239> he<00:03:06.989> also<00:03:07.140> has<00:03:07.470> ball<00:03:07.709> joints<00:03:08.129> in<00:03:08.280> his

and he also has ball joints in his
ankles<00:03:09.299> this<00:03:10.290> guy's<00:03:10.470> a<00:03:10.500> little<00:03:11.160> bit<00:03:11.519> more

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
ankles this guy's a little bit more

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.569 
ankles this guy's a little bit more
flimsy<00:03:12.150> than<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.780> other<00:03:12.930> two<00:03:13.200> I<00:03:13.230> find<00:03:13.739> but<00:03:14.010> the

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
flimsy than the other two I find but the

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.150 
flimsy than the other two I find but the
ball<00:03:14.730> joints<00:03:15.090> snap<00:03:15.540> together<00:03:15.780> pretty<00:03:16.260> well<00:03:16.560> I

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
ball joints snap together pretty well I

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.309 
ball joints snap together pretty well I
don't<00:03:17.519> really<00:03:17.819> see<00:03:17.970> them<00:03:18.269> getting<00:03:18.540> loose<00:03:18.810> over

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
don't really see them getting loose over

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.270 
don't really see them getting loose over
time<00:03:19.670> but<00:03:20.870> it's<00:03:21.870> worth<00:03:21.989> mentioning<00:03:22.560> that<00:03:22.739> they

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
time but it's worth mentioning that they

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.720 
time but it's worth mentioning that they
are<00:03:23.430> kind<00:03:23.940> of<00:03:24.120> loose<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:24.870> begin<00:03:25.200> with<00:03:25.430> so<00:03:26.430> who

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
are kind of loose to begin with so who

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.589 
are kind of loose to begin with so who
knows<00:03:27.139> hunter<00:03:28.139> is<00:03:28.700> super<00:03:29.700> cool<00:03:29.910> like<00:03:30.209> I<00:03:30.329> said

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
easily the best out of the bunch I just

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.960 
easily the best out of the bunch I just
I<00:03:36.239> like<00:03:36.569> hunters<00:03:37.079> design<00:03:37.799> and<00:03:38.190> I<00:03:38.549> might<00:03:38.760> be<00:03:38.790> a

I like hunters design and I might be a

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.970 
I like hunters design and I might be a
little<00:03:39.269> bit<00:03:39.510> biased<00:03:39.720> because<00:03:40.109> of<00:03:40.470> that<00:03:40.650> but

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
little bit biased because of that but

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.729 
little bit biased because of that but
yeah<00:03:41.819> this<00:03:42.060> one<00:03:42.269> might<00:03:42.630> actually<00:03:42.959> be<00:03:43.530> worth

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
yeah this one might actually be worth

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.920 
yeah this one might actually be worth
getting<00:03:44.010> he<00:03:44.430> can<00:03:44.609> you<00:03:44.730> know<00:03:44.760> perch<00:03:45.239> on<00:03:45.599> the<00:03:45.780> end

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
getting he can you know perch on the end

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.110 
getting he can you know perch on the end
of<00:03:46.049> your<00:03:46.139> desk<00:03:46.470> or<00:03:46.829> on<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.370> edge<00:03:47.519> of<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:47.819> shelf

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
and and snipe away so here he is next to

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.539 
and and snipe away so here he is next to
the<00:03:51.480> other<00:03:51.599> two<00:03:52.069> there<00:03:53.069> you<00:03:53.160> go

the other two there you go

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.390 
the other two there you go
I<00:03:53.840> don't<00:03:54.840> have<00:03:55.079> the<00:03:55.349> level<00:03:55.530> to<00:03:55.769> Hunter<00:03:56.099> but<00:03:56.370> I

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
I don't have the level to Hunter but I

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.339 
I don't have the level to Hunter but I
can<00:03:56.609> only<00:03:56.700> assume<00:03:56.880> it<00:03:57.269> is<00:03:57.419> much<00:03:57.810> better<00:03:58.200> than

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
can only assume it is much better than

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.650 
can only assume it is much better than
this<00:03:58.709> in<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.160> end<00:03:59.280> once<00:03:59.910> again<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.419> price

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
this in the end once again the price

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.020 
this in the end once again the price
point<00:04:00.989> of<00:04:01.169> these<00:04:01.380> things<00:04:01.739> really<00:04:02.489> make<00:04:02.730> them

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
point of these things really make them

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.949 
point of these things really make them
hard<00:04:03.780> to<00:04:04.079> recommend<00:04:05.180> especially<00:04:06.180> because<00:04:06.419> of

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
hard to recommend especially because of

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.440 
hard to recommend especially because of
the<00:04:07.470> level<00:04:07.769> of<00:04:07.859> detail<00:04:08.280> and<00:04:08.310> playability<00:04:08.970> that

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
the level of detail and playability that

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.620 
the level of detail and playability that
you<00:04:09.630> are<00:04:09.780> lacking<00:04:10.169> from<00:04:10.980> them<00:04:11.370> however<00:04:12.120> I

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
you are lacking from them however I

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.069 
you are lacking from them however I
mentioned<00:04:13.470> in<00:04:13.650> my<00:04:14.010> Achilles<00:04:14.849> review<00:04:15.569> that<00:04:15.810> all

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
mentioned in my Achilles review that all

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.080 
mentioned in my Achilles review that all
the<00:04:16.260> ball<00:04:16.470> joints<00:04:16.950> on<00:04:17.070> these<00:04:17.370> guys<00:04:17.700> are

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
the ball joints on these guys are

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.240 
the ball joints on these guys are
exactly<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:19.169> same<00:04:19.349> size<00:04:19.620> and<00:04:19.919> you<00:04:20.010> can

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
exactly the same size and you can

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.850 
exactly the same size and you can
actually<00:04:20.400> mix<00:04:20.970> and<00:04:21.389> match<00:04:21.750> parts<00:04:22.380> from<00:04:22.620> them

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
actually mix and match parts from them

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.339 
actually mix and match parts from them
something<00:04:23.430> they<00:04:23.729> do<00:04:23.789> not<00:04:23.969> advertise<00:04:24.840> on<00:04:25.320> the

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
something they do not advertise on the

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:26.570 
something they do not advertise on the
box<00:04:25.740> and<00:04:26.130> I

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
box and I

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.760 
box and I
really<00:04:26.939> think<00:04:27.180> they<00:04:27.389> should<00:04:27.419> so<00:04:28.080> let's<00:04:28.560> see

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
really think they should so let's see

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.719 
really think they should so let's see
that<00:04:28.949> in<00:04:29.069> action<00:04:30.500> now<00:04:31.500> using<00:04:31.919> all<00:04:32.069> three<00:04:32.340> kits

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
that in action now using all three kits

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.209 
that in action now using all three kits
I<00:04:32.939> was<00:04:33.090> able<00:04:33.389> to<00:04:33.419> throw<00:04:33.750> this<00:04:34.409> together

00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:35.219 
I was able to throw this together

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:37.909 
I was able to throw this together
and<00:04:35.310> I<00:04:35.669> think<00:04:35.729> just<00:04:36.599> via<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.259> fact<00:04:37.590> that<00:04:37.830> it

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
and I think just via the fact that it

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.369 
and I think just via the fact that it
has<00:04:38.069> more<00:04:38.280> color<00:04:38.610> variation<00:04:39.449> it's<00:04:39.930> a<00:04:40.050> lot<00:04:40.229> more

00:04:40.369 --> 00:04:40.379 
has more color variation it's a lot more

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:42.080 
has more color variation it's a lot more
interesting<00:04:41.039> to<00:04:41.250> look<00:04:41.280> at<00:04:41.669> than<00:04:41.969> the

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
interesting to look at than the

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.830 
interesting to look at than the
individual<00:04:42.810> kits<00:04:43.229> I<00:04:43.699> used<00:04:44.699> the<00:04:45.150> tail<00:04:45.449> of

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
individual kits I used the tail of

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.990 
individual kits I used the tail of
hunter<00:04:46.289> along<00:04:46.830> with<00:04:46.949> the<00:04:47.039> torso<00:04:47.460> of<00:04:47.580> Achilles

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
hunter along with the torso of Achilles

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.540 
hunter along with the torso of Achilles
to<00:04:48.150> sort<00:04:48.360> of<00:04:48.419> give<00:04:48.960> them<00:04:49.050> a<00:04:49.199> scarf<00:04:49.590> and<00:04:50.250> then<00:04:50.520> I

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
to sort of give them a scarf and then I

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.350 
to sort of give them a scarf and then I
have<00:04:50.789> the<00:04:51.139> tilted<00:04:52.139> wrists<00:04:52.650> of<00:04:52.860> Hunter<00:04:53.789> here<00:04:54.180> so

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
have the tilted wrists of Hunter here so

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.300 
have the tilted wrists of Hunter here so
that<00:04:54.479> it<00:04:54.599> can<00:04:54.750> hold<00:04:54.960> the<00:04:55.319> achilles<00:04:55.860> lamps

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
that it can hold the achilles lamps

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.779 
that it can hold the achilles lamps
properly<00:04:57.229> it's<00:04:58.229> definitely<00:04:58.710> kind<00:04:59.190> of<00:04:59.310> strange

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
properly it's definitely kind of strange

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:01.480 
properly it's definitely kind of strange
but<00:05:00.150> I<00:05:00.180> think<00:05:00.479> it<00:05:00.599> looks<00:05:00.629> cool<00:05:01.020> nonetheless

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
but I think it looks cool nonetheless

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.980 
but I think it looks cool nonetheless
this<00:05:02.490> is<00:05:02.699> something<00:05:03.090> once<00:05:03.330> again<00:05:03.719> I<00:05:03.750> think

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
this is something once again I think

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.839 
this is something once again I think
they<00:05:04.349> should<00:05:04.560> have<00:05:04.590> advertised<00:05:05.340> because<00:05:05.699> this

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:05.849 
they should have advertised because this

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:09.140 
they should have advertised because this
is<00:05:06.000> an<00:05:06.210> entire<00:05:06.960> play<00:05:07.530> feature<00:05:07.949> that<00:05:08.639> you<00:05:08.879> can

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
is an entire play feature that you can

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.070 
is an entire play feature that you can
accomplish<00:05:09.629> here<00:05:10.229> that<00:05:10.710> is<00:05:11.069> just<00:05:11.129> completely

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
accomplish here that is just completely

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.659 
accomplish here that is just completely
ignored<00:05:13.080> that<00:05:13.409> you<00:05:13.770> would<00:05:13.949> have<00:05:14.039> done<00:05:14.219> a<00:05:14.490> lot

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
ignored that you would have done a lot

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.339 
ignored that you would have done a lot
better<00:05:14.729> and<00:05:15.300> it<00:05:15.629> would<00:05:15.750> have<00:05:15.840> given<00:05:16.020> the<00:05:16.199> line

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:16.349 
better and it would have given the line

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:19.550 
better and it would have given the line
a<00:05:16.530> little<00:05:16.949> bit<00:05:17.099> more<00:05:17.400> play<00:05:17.849> value<00:05:18.210> as<00:05:18.659> far<00:05:19.469> as

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
a little bit more play value as far as

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.619 
a little bit more play value as far as
advertising<00:05:19.740> goes<00:05:20.520> if<00:05:20.849> they<00:05:21.330> would<00:05:21.539> have

00:05:21.619 --> 00:05:21.629 
advertising goes if they would have

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:24.800 
advertising goes if they would have
exploited<00:05:22.199> this<00:05:22.560> so<00:05:23.219> I<00:05:23.460> think<00:05:23.969> hunter<00:05:24.599> is

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
exploited this so I think hunter is

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.959 
exploited this so I think hunter is
easily<00:05:25.409> the<00:05:25.560> best<00:05:25.740> out<00:05:26.099> of<00:05:26.129> the<00:05:26.400> three<00:05:26.430> as<00:05:26.909> I

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:26.969 
easily the best out of the three as I

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:29.659 
easily the best out of the three as I
said<00:05:27.779> if<00:05:28.590> you're<00:05:28.770> going<00:05:28.919> to<00:05:29.009> get<00:05:29.099> multiples

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
said if you're going to get multiples

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.390 
said if you're going to get multiples
however<00:05:30.060> I'd<00:05:30.360> still<00:05:30.810> probably<00:05:31.050> get<00:05:31.529> multiples

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
however I'd still probably get multiples

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.850 
however I'd still probably get multiples
of<00:05:32.610> DQ<00:05:33.150> just<00:05:33.449> because<00:05:33.719> I<00:05:33.750> think<00:05:33.900> army<00:05:34.469> building

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
of DQ just because I think army building

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.969 
of DQ just because I think army building
it<00:05:35.069> can<00:05:35.340> be<00:05:35.550> pretty<00:05:35.849> impressive<00:05:36.800> Achilles<00:05:37.800> I

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
it can be pretty impressive Achilles I

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:40.339 
it can be pretty impressive Achilles I
wouldn't<00:05:38.490> bother<00:05:38.699> with<00:05:39.029> but<00:05:39.389> if<00:05:39.629> you<00:05:39.750> want<00:05:39.960> one

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:40.349 
wouldn't bother with but if you want one

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:43.399 
wouldn't bother with but if you want one
level<00:05:41.039> one<00:05:41.310> from<00:05:41.550> this<00:05:41.699> line<00:05:42.029> make<00:05:42.750> it<00:05:42.930> hunter

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:43.409 
level one from this line make it hunter

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:46.159 
level one from this line make it hunter
so<00:05:43.949> that<00:05:44.370> is<00:05:44.639> about<00:05:44.819> it<00:05:45.089> guys<00:05:45.300> and<00:05:45.629> this<00:05:45.750> is<00:05:45.810> IX
