00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 
virtualization show what what does LG

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:48.689 
virtualization show what what does LG
shown<00:00:46.960> here<00:00:47.260> well<00:00:48.039> you<00:00:48.460> know<00:00:48.519> you'd<00:00:48.670> be

shown here well you know you'd be

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:50.490 
shown here well you know you'd be
surprised<00:00:49.149> that<00:00:49.300> a<00:00:49.600> company<00:00:50.050> is<00:00:50.170> primarily

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
surprised that a company is primarily

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.650 
surprised that a company is primarily
known<00:00:50.680> for<00:00:50.739> consumer<00:00:51.309> products<00:00:51.730> is<00:00:51.850> here<00:00:52.180> but

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
known for consumer products is here but

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.630 
known for consumer products is here but
with<00:00:53.079> everything<00:00:53.620> mobile<00:00:53.949> these<00:00:54.219> days<00:00:54.429> it

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
with everything mobile these days it

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.700 
with everything mobile these days it
first<00:00:54.820> starts<00:00:55.120> out<00:00:55.239> in<00:00:55.390> the<00:00:55.449> consumer<00:00:55.899> side<00:00:56.079> so

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
first starts out in the consumer side so

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.830 
first starts out in the consumer side so
we've<00:00:57.039> got<00:00:57.219> mobile<00:00:57.730> smart<00:00:58.000> phones<00:00:58.030> that<00:00:58.750> are

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
we've got mobile smart phones that are

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.750 
we've got mobile smart phones that are
actually<00:00:58.989> using<00:00:59.559> a<00:00:59.980> new<00:01:00.370> p.m.<00:01:00.609> where

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
actually using a new p.m. where

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.069 
actually using a new p.m. where
technology<00:01:01.390> called<00:01:01.570> the<00:01:01.809> mobile

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
technology called the mobile

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.259 
technology called the mobile
virtualization<00:01:02.559> platform<00:01:03.250> to<00:01:03.760> enable<00:01:03.789> you<00:01:04.239> to

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
virtualization platform to enable you to

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:05.880 
virtualization platform to enable you to
do<00:01:04.480> the<00:01:04.570> same<00:01:04.750> thing<00:01:04.989> that<00:01:05.140> you<00:01:05.230> might<00:01:05.379> do<00:01:05.590> for

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
do the same thing that you might do for

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.160 
do the same thing that you might do for
instance<00:01:06.190> let's<00:01:06.760> say<00:01:06.850> you<00:01:06.970> had<00:01:07.240> an<00:01:07.570> apple

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
instance let's say you had an apple

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.560 
instance let's say you had an apple
macintosh<00:01:09.010> and<00:01:09.520> you<00:01:09.940> wanted<00:01:10.150> to<00:01:10.240> be<00:01:10.330> able<00:01:10.480> to

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
macintosh and you wanted to be able to

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.899 
macintosh and you wanted to be able to
run<00:01:10.720> Windows<00:01:11.530> applications<00:01:12.250> for<00:01:12.520> work<00:01:12.700> you

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
run Windows applications for work you

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.819 
run Windows applications for work you
run<00:01:13.479> a<00:01:13.509> hypervisor<00:01:13.930> on<00:01:14.290> it<00:01:14.439> and<00:01:14.619> there's<00:01:14.740> a

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:14.829 
run a hypervisor on it and there's a

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:17.580 
run a hypervisor on it and there's a
second<00:01:15.579> OS<00:01:16.150> running<00:01:16.390> on<00:01:16.659> it<00:01:16.810> in<00:01:16.930> this<00:01:17.409> case

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
second OS running on it in this case

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.800 
second OS running on it in this case
Windows<00:01:18.040> you<00:01:18.909> can<00:01:18.970> do<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:19.329> same<00:01:19.509> thing<00:01:19.689> on

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
Windows you can do the same thing on

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.749 
Windows you can do the same thing on
mobile<00:01:20.049> phones<00:01:20.079> when<00:01:20.860> do<00:01:21.040> we<00:01:21.100> really<00:01:21.369> get<00:01:21.610> this

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
mobile phones when do we really get this

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:23.670 
mobile phones when do we really get this
on<00:01:22.030> existing<00:01:22.630> phones<00:01:23.079> when<00:01:23.470> is<00:01:23.590> this

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
on existing phones when is this

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.109

well any mobile phone be able to do this
it's<00:01:57.670> like<00:01:58.000> anything<00:01:58.420> with

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
it's like anything with

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.940 
it's like anything with
mobile<00:02:00.390> if<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.900> have<00:02:01.110> more<00:02:01.350> processing

it doesn't necessarily have to have

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.270 
it doesn't necessarily have to have
multiple<00:02:06.660> processors<00:02:07.440> in<00:02:07.620> this<00:02:07.740> case<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:08.100> is

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
multiple processors in this case this is

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.830 
multiple processors in this case this is
a<00:02:08.310> single<00:02:08.670> processor<00:02:09.119> device<00:02:09.390> it's<00:02:09.630> a<00:02:09.690> 1

as<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:35.190> galaxy<00:02:35.670> phone<00:02:36.170> essentially<00:02:37.170> what<00:02:37.350> this

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
as a galaxy phone essentially what this
