know how you supposed to survive to this
round<00:01:37.799> anyways<00:01:38.390> helpers<00:01:39.390> kind<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.110> help<00:01:40.259> out

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
round anyways helpers kind of help out

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.410 
round anyways helpers kind of help out
but<00:01:40.740> look<00:01:41.369> at<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.520> guy<00:01:41.640> he's<00:01:41.759> pretty<00:01:42.090> dummy

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
but look at this guy he's pretty dummy

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.780 
but look at this guy he's pretty dummy
doesn't<00:01:43.350> really<00:01:43.470> do<00:01:43.590> too<00:01:43.829> much<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.280> there's

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
doesn't really do too much and there's

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.370 
doesn't really do too much and there's
bill<00:01:46.729> and<00:01:47.729> also<00:01:47.939> i<00:01:47.970> think<00:01:48.240> it's<00:01:48.810> glitch<00:01:49.170> that

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
bill and also i think it's glitch that

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.359 
bill and also i think it's glitch that
if<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.590> don't<00:01:49.939> open<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.420> gate<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:52.890> monsters

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
if you don't open that gate the monsters

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.899 
if you don't open that gate the monsters
don't<00:01:53.579> zombies<00:01:54.270> don't<00:01:54.360> spawn<00:01:54.810> up<00:01:55.140> here<00:01:55.909> I

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
don't zombies don't spawn up here I

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.280 
don't zombies don't spawn up here I
don't<00:01:57.299> really<00:01:57.450> know<00:01:57.630> if<00:01:57.659> that's<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.930> case<00:01:58.020> or

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
don't really know if that's the case or

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.679 
don't really know if that's the case or
not<00:01:58.439> but<00:01:58.710> that's<00:01:59.070> just<00:01:59.219> what<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.430> heard<00:01:59.729> but

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
not but that's just what I heard but

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.899 
not but that's just what I heard but
yeah<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.590> figured<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.040> just<00:02:02.250> record<00:02:02.610> this<00:02:02.729> for

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
yeah so I figured I just record this for

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.969 
yeah so I figured I just record this for
posterity<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.540> don't<00:02:03.810> know<00:02:03.990> just<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.770> show<00:02:04.950> that

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
posterity I don't know just to show that

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:12.110

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
what I can think of the kill I solve is

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.970 
what I can think of the kill I solve is
to<00:02:23.480> keep<00:02:23.600> jumping<00:02:23.960> down<00:02:24.110> repeatedly<00:02:24.530> don't

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
to keep jumping down repeatedly don't
