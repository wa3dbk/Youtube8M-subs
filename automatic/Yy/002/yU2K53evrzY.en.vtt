 this bar where it is and I know 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.040
 to perform operations 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.970
 actually these icons that are also within the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.550

 the file that I select in this window 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.910
 the characteristics of the browser's working window and all the 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.190
 other windows 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.620

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.160
 i percent 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.769
 the tools menu bar 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:10.789
 hideki tv and directv 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:11.710

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.710
 reading window of what does not have particular characteristics 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.610
 for example it is divided in two the left part is a window 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.709
 and the part of what is 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:21.869
 another window 

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:25.679
 then here at the same time I want I can scroll over all the folders that 

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:27.719
 it is inside of me 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:31.469
 of my computer not for example right now we are in Christmas d 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:38.359
 in fact it has been in unit 6 you can minimize friend c is the vidic unit 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:42.439
 that is the life I decided not to share documents the retail sites 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:45.159
 we work in a 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:46.739
 under the 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.799
 some domain of the group 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.019
 so well here we have the most folders 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.560
 any operation that I want to carry out first is Feliciano in the 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:56.589
 binder 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:03:00.769
 and I can use one of the options that the bar menu bar 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:01.849
 tools 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.939
 One way to change these views according to the needs would be to change 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:10.930
 the way to see precisely the information right now we have a list 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.209
 from kiko but if I need more information 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.609
 I can percent have another type of list in this case of ine statistics 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.409
 sample in size that has 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:25.949
 in the folder the file for example this file has 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:30.389
 for being a little over a month no longer and I told myself what kind of file is that is 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:37.119
 a document punishment I am married because it was modified on August 22, 2008 

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:39.109
 at half past nine 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:40.329
 p.m 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.519
 then that is the additional information that statesman can show me 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.040
 and also that I can continue adding other information 

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:51.679
 if I need to know 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:53.729
 saw 

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:54.859
 so 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.019
 what things can we do 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.639
 with windows and windows explorer 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:04.809
 In addition to showing the information I can also create folders achi vos 

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:09.399
 these are the folders I can organize for example here I have iniesta image and 

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:12.269
 the folder where you could show all the images 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.009
 that I keep on my computer not and in that way organize better the 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.790
 information 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.620
 let's create a folder inside the folder my documents as right click 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.699
 new folder with imposes and I put him 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:28.830
 binder 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.969
 arteta 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:34.589
 there is already we have created enter to confirm and it contains this folder 

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:39.379
 prada is empty here and we can go matching information I can create a 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:40.570
 word document 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.570
 Call Carmen 

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:47.539
 mayer than successively 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:48.919
 you can create a lot of disinformation
