00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hi there is a small guide for those who 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.839
 wants to learn how to control 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.240
 turn speed on attack aircraft will show 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.219
 I'm on the example of the Su-25 because he has 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.830
 visual display of the brake 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.210
 covered how it works you now 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.430
 see on your screens 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.380
 that is, you will always know when I 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.560
 I press the brake and with what 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.880
 periodicity and resentment makes and 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.340
 a few words about my layout 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.630
 keyboards so that you understand and which 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.969
 keys and when i press the w key y 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.059
 I am assigned to raise her up that is 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.550
 nose up now i live on w and 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.950
 accordingly see that I am continuously 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.070
 time whatsoever features my keyboard 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.660
 let 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:49.239
 see without assigning a brake and 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.820
 control turning by pressing 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.040
 key w them speed control 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.940
 clicking on with just one finger 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:00.129
 which is basically comfortable enough well 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.650
 with this, we also figured out and let's 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.950
 let's start with a horizontal rotation 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.680
 that is, I am now looking for w and for that 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.250
 to enter the limits of ideal speed 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.789
 need to hold the brake hold it up to those 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.530
 while we are not yet our figurine 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:20.710
 the aircraft is more precise than the maximum 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.470
 drop down after she 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.080
 as much as possible fell down and further 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.979
 stops moving we press brake 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.630
 not starting to continuously monitor 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.210
 our speed by pressing short 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:38.180
 by clicking on the brake my case is from 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.920
 so push the brake down as much as possible 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.210
 m brake and control speed 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.240
 short taps 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.870
 again the frequency and when exactly I 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.810
 I press 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:51.170
 Now you too can see on their screens 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.120
 In principle, there is nothing complicated and this is the most 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.729
 easy way to effectively learn 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.430
 control the speed that is exactly 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.560
 horizontal turning is so good 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.210
 now let's try the same 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.760
 just make it vertical 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:10.850
 click on w and respectively 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.720
 the same press on the brake perk 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.280
 aircraft as much as possible down the screen and 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.620
 I start to control the speed by pressing 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.320
 humility here is a little different all 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.120
 that is, you see that I click top 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.120
 so much lower part will 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.150
 when to look exactly at the nose 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.230
 night brake aligned with horizon 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.440
 and before leaving the nose again 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.159
 horizon I release the brake 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.349
 accordingly we get 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.519
 perfect speed 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.560
 visual confirmation of the ideal 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.250
 speed is again an airplane figure 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.220
 run as maximum 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.480
 goes down the monitor nothing complicated 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.340
 this 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.099
 now let's try 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.349
 diagonal turn the most 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.780
 difficult reversal but if you mastered 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:02.560
 vertical turn of the vanga is not 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.560
 will work 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.290
 until it stops 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.530
 not a cake 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.930
 when the nose looks at the horizon click on 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.150
 the brake is released before exiting 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.439
 horizon 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.439
 basically listened to nothing 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.310
 brake 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.310
 let down 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.319
 brake 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.319
 let go 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.250
 brake 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.900
 let go 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.210
 right let's do it again 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.130
 vertical and just as well gonna talk 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.640
 when 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.640
 notary 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.750
 brake let 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.750
 brake 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.720
 brake 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.730
 let down 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.319
 I repeat again absolutely nothing 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.510
 complex 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.480
 because this guide basically refers to 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.400
 all stormtroopers will be such 5 fountain 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.200
 or from the 10th narcologist 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.540
 the only difference between them is 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.739
 that the figures of the aircraft are slightly at an angle 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.249
 and shifting 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:15.910
 from the monitor but none the less 

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:18.209
 we look when he goes down and 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.699
 accordingly then we begin which 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.280
 bed today is another bonus video 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:25.289
 which concerns helicopters now you 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.720
 will show you as soon as possible 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.880
 take off no matter what 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.500
 helicopter view you sit down whether 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.360
 reconnaissance shock or 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.180
 transport but first let's 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.130
 Let's see how it takes off, that is, more precisely, with 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.289
 what speed the helicopter takes off 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.289
 default sit down and rise 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:49.979
 slow enough and there is every chance 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:52.050
 catch or opposers now 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:55.280
 a little instruction how to fly 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.780
 much faster for this we need 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.240
 when landing the helicopter immediately 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.789
 switch to the pilot's seat and back 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:07.430
 more precisely in place of the arrow and back to 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:07.430
 pilot's seat and so let's try 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:15.600
 much faster that is switch to 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:19.980
 arrow on the pilot and take off immediately 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.980
 let's try scout 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:30.040
 very fast 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:30.040
 This is the same check on the transport 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.410
 too fast 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:41.389
 now you know how to fly fast 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.389
 Thank you all for your attention.
