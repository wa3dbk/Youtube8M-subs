of this game on Twitch and apparently it

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.640

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
took around 35 to 40 hours of gameplay

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.560 
took around 35 to 40 hours of gameplay

only thing that will do you any good and
one<00:01:27.689> thing<00:01:27.900> I've<00:01:28.020> noticed<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.829> all<00:01:28.979> these

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
one thing I've noticed is that all these

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.710 
one thing I've noticed is that all these
high<00:01:29.369> rounders<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.030> know<00:01:30.150> these<00:01:30.299> people<00:01:30.600> who

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
high rounders you know these people who

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.630 
high rounders you know these people who
are<00:01:30.810> getting<00:01:31.079> over<00:01:31.259> 100<00:01:31.740> rounds<00:01:32.040> on<00:01:32.159> transit

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
are getting over 100 rounds on transit

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.910 
are getting over 100 rounds on transit
they<00:01:33.060> all<00:01:33.270> use<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.720> jet<00:01:33.930> gun<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.290> same<00:01:34.619> way

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
they all use the jet gun the same way

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.770 
they all use the jet gun the same way
they<00:01:35.369> use<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:35.790> short<00:01:36.000> little<00:01:36.210> bursts<00:01:36.659> and

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
they use it in short little bursts and

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.390 
they use it in short little bursts and
even<00:01:37.020> though<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.200> only<00:01:37.259> kills<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.799> few<00:01:38.009> zombies

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
even though it only kills a few zombies

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.429 
even though it only kills a few zombies
at<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.549> time<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:39.090> barely<00:01:39.450> heats<00:01:39.869> up<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.229> way

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
at a time it barely heats up this way

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.350 
at a time it barely heats up this way
meaning<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.490> can<00:01:41.640> continue<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.270> do

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
meaning that you can continue to do

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.940 
meaning that you can continue to do
these<00:01:42.509> short<00:01:42.780> little<00:01:42.810> bursts<00:01:43.229> without<00:01:43.530> having

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
these short little bursts without having

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.920 
these short little bursts without having
to<00:01:44.040> wait<00:01:44.220> for<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.520> gun<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.759> cool<00:01:44.909> down<00:01:45.180> to

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
to wait for the gun to cool down to

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.630 
to wait for the gun to cool down to
prevent<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.409> from<00:01:46.439> breaking<00:01:46.950> apart<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.399> of

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
prevent it from breaking apart and of

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.100 
prevent it from breaking apart and of
course<00:01:47.880> he's<00:01:48.060> looking<00:01:48.180> out<00:01:48.420> for<00:01:48.570> nukes<00:01:48.840> and

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
course he's looking out for nukes and

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.719 
course he's looking out for nukes and
insta<00:01:49.439> kill<00:01:49.560> power-ups<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.100> make<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.460> rounds

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
insta kill power-ups to make the rounds

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.880 
insta kill power-ups to make the rounds
go<00:01:50.880> by<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.060> little<00:01:51.360> bit<00:01:51.450> quicker<00:01:51.770> anything<00:01:52.770> to

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
go by a little bit quicker anything to

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.499 
go by a little bit quicker anything to
make<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.159> rounds<00:01:53.399> go<00:01:53.460> by<00:01:53.670> faster<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.270> good

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
make the rounds go by faster is good

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.630 
make the rounds go by faster is good
because<00:01:54.930> at<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:55.649> point<00:01:55.860> they're<00:01:56.100> taking<00:01:56.490> you

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
because at this point they're taking you

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.249 
because at this point they're taking you
know<00:01:56.670> over<00:01:57.119> an<00:01:57.210> hour<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.600> complete<00:01:57.750> one<00:01:58.110> round

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
know over an hour to complete one round

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.170 
know over an hour to complete one round
apparently<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.100> that's<00:01:59.640> what's<00:01:59.850> cool<00:02:00.000> about

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
apparently and that's what's cool about

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.639 
apparently and that's what's cool about
the<00:02:00.299> jet<00:02:00.479> gun<00:02:00.689> though<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:00.930> will<00:02:01.020> actually<00:02:01.200> give

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
the jet gun though it will actually give

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.230 
the jet gun though it will actually give
you<00:02:01.770> power-ups<00:02:02.280> once<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.670> while<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.180> you

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
you power-ups once in a while so you

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.760 
you power-ups once in a while so you
know<00:02:03.509> over<00:02:03.689> time<00:02:03.990> we've<00:02:04.229> kind<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.500> come<00:02:04.649> to

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
know over time we've kind of come to

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.170 
know over time we've kind of come to
realize<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:05.430> thing<00:02:05.640> really<00:02:05.820> isn't

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
realize that this thing really isn't

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.999 
realize that this thing really isn't
such<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.570> bad<00:02:06.810> weapon<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.320> use<00:02:07.500> at<00:02:07.649> all<00:02:07.770> in

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
such a bad weapon to use at all in

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.010 
such a bad weapon to use at all in
that's<00:02:08.310> what<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.640> seemed<00:02:08.849> like<00:02:09.030> at<00:02:09.179> first<00:02:09.390> but

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
that's what it seemed like at first but

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.440 
that's what it seemed like at first but
if<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.140> think<00:02:10.410> about<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:10.860> has

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
if you think about it it has

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.080 
if you think about it it has
mo<00:02:11.930> it's<00:02:12.110> an<00:02:12.319> insta-kill<00:02:12.920> and<00:02:13.520> it<00:02:13.670> generates

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
mo it's an insta-kill and it generates

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.059 
mo it's an insta-kill and it generates
power-ups<00:02:14.540> so<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:15.319> thing<00:02:15.530> is<00:02:15.560> you<00:02:15.680> just<00:02:15.860> gotta

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
power-ups so the thing is you just gotta

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.860 
power-ups so the thing is you just gotta
be<00:02:16.340> patient<00:02:16.489> with<00:02:16.849> it<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.180> as<00:02:17.360> you<00:02:17.390> can<00:02:17.690> see

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
be patient with it and as you can see

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.540 
be patient with it and as you can see
you<00:02:18.020> know<00:02:18.110> he's<00:02:18.290> using<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.800> short<00:02:19.099> burst<00:02:19.340> like

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
you know he's using the short burst like

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.160 
you know he's using the short burst like
I<00:02:19.670> talked<00:02:19.880> about<00:02:20.120> but<00:02:20.300> he<00:02:20.420> doesn't<00:02:20.780> just<00:02:20.900> keep

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
I talked about but he doesn't just keep

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.260 
I talked about but he doesn't just keep
the<00:02:21.349> jet<00:02:21.560> gun<00:02:21.770> out<00:02:21.890> like<00:02:22.099> most<00:02:22.310> people<00:02:22.640> do<00:02:22.790> the

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
the jet gun out like most people do the

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.240 
the jet gun out like most people do the
trick<00:02:23.480> that<00:02:23.510> he's<00:02:23.750> using<00:02:23.959> is<00:02:24.680> putting<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.099> gun

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
trick that he's using is putting the gun

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.220 
trick that he's using is putting the gun
away<00:02:25.280> as<00:02:25.670> soon<00:02:25.970> as<00:02:26.180> he<00:02:26.300> shoots<00:02:26.569> it<00:02:26.750> just<00:02:27.020> for<00:02:27.200> a

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
away as soon as he shoots it just for a

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.500 
away as soon as he shoots it just for a
second<00:02:27.680> so<00:02:28.190> that<00:02:28.340> it<00:02:28.430> barely<00:02:28.640> heats<00:02:29.060> up<00:02:29.270> at<00:02:29.390> all

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
second so that it barely heats up at all

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.300 
second so that it barely heats up at all
it's<00:02:29.690> a<00:02:29.750> nice<00:02:29.959> little<00:02:30.200> trick<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:30.680> I<00:02:31.069> like<00:02:31.220> I

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
it's a nice little trick and I like I

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.430 
it's a nice little trick and I like I
said<00:02:31.489> it<00:02:31.610> makes<00:02:31.819> it<00:02:31.970> faster<00:02:32.180> a<00:02:32.480> plus<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:33.140> seems

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
said it makes it faster a plus it seems

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.809 
said it makes it faster a plus it seems
like<00:02:33.620> it<00:02:33.770> really<00:02:33.800> makes<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.340> game<00:02:34.520> a<00:02:34.550> lot

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
like it really makes the game a lot

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.790 
like it really makes the game a lot
safer<00:02:35.120> but<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.660> way<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.870> game<00:02:35.900> ends<00:02:36.440> is<00:02:36.530> just

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
safer but the way the game ends is just

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.440 
safer but the way the game ends is just
a<00:02:36.890> complete<00:02:37.370> bummer<00:02:37.670> I<00:02:37.760> mean<00:02:38.000> he<00:02:38.120> gets<00:02:38.239> the

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
a complete bummer I mean he gets the

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.240 
a complete bummer I mean he gets the
error<00:02:38.630> message<00:02:39.140> and<00:02:39.470> is<00:02:39.620> kicked<00:02:39.920> out<00:02:40.069> of<00:02:40.100> the

error message and is kicked out of the
game<00:02:40.400> he<00:02:40.580> doesn't<00:02:40.760> even<00:02:40.940> go<00:02:41.120> down<00:02:41.360> but<00:02:42.260> it's

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
game he doesn't even go down but it's

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.050 
game he doesn't even go down but it's
like<00:02:42.590> due<00:02:42.739> to<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:42.980> lack<00:02:43.160> of<00:02:43.190> memory<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.880> black

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
like due to the lack of memory the black

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.880 
like due to the lack of memory the black
ops<00:02:44.269> 2<00:02:44.480> holds<00:02:44.840> for<00:02:45.019> high<00:02:45.140> round<00:02:45.350> gameplay
