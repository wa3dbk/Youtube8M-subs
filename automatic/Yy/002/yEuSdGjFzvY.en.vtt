00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.340 
go inside and like rob a house or you
can<00:02:01.649> go<00:02:01.890> like<00:02:02.399> go<00:02:02.969> like<00:02:03.000> break<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.869> window<00:02:04.200> and

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
can go like go like break the window and

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.679 
can go like go like break the window and
enter<00:02:04.439> through<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.770> window<00:02:05.250> or<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:06.299> can<00:02:06.450> go

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
enter through the window or you can go

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.900 
enter through the window or you can go
in<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.649> think<00:02:07.740> would<00:02:08.069> be<00:02:08.190> really<00:02:08.220> cool<00:02:08.670> and

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
in and I think would be really cool and

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.089 
in and I think would be really cool and
realistic<00:02:09.569> if<00:02:09.720> there<00:02:09.989> was<00:02:10.110> like<00:02:10.289> house<00:02:10.500> alarms

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
realistic if there was like house alarms

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.580 
realistic if there was like house alarms
like<00:02:11.670> robbery<00:02:12.180> alarms<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:13.140> just<00:02:13.349> think<00:02:13.500> it

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
like robbery alarms and I just think it

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.550 
like robbery alarms and I just think it
would<00:02:13.650> be<00:02:13.709> amazing<00:02:14.099> if<00:02:14.720> like<00:02:15.720> in<00:02:15.870> Skyrim<00:02:16.410> you

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
would be amazing if like in Skyrim you

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.770 
would be amazing if like in Skyrim you
know<00:02:16.680> in<00:02:16.800> Skyrim<00:02:17.160> sometimes<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.879> can<00:02:18.060> lock

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
know in Skyrim sometimes you can lock

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.960 
know in Skyrim sometimes you can lock
pick<00:02:19.080> houses<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.739> sometimes<00:02:20.400> there's<00:02:20.640> people

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
pick houses and sometimes there's people

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.119 
pick houses and sometimes there's people
and<00:02:21.180> sometimes<00:02:21.540> there's<00:02:21.989> not<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.470> think<00:02:23.010> that'd

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
and sometimes there's not I think that'd

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.100 
and sometimes there's not I think that'd
be<00:02:23.250> cool<00:02:23.400> if<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:23.700> brought<00:02:24.030> that<00:02:24.239> to<00:02:24.360> GTA<00:02:24.750> and

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
be cool if that brought that to GTA and

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.199 
be cool if that brought that to GTA and
if<00:02:25.500> there's<00:02:25.709> like<00:02:25.860> modern<00:02:26.310> houses<00:02:26.849> you<00:02:26.940> can<00:02:27.030> go

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
if there's like modern houses you can go

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.750 
if there's like modern houses you can go
in<00:02:27.620> most<00:02:28.620> likely<00:02:28.920> you'll<00:02:29.220> only<00:02:29.370> be<00:02:29.550> able<00:02:29.580> to

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
in most likely you'll only be able to

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.420 
in most likely you'll only be able to
take<00:02:29.940> like<00:02:30.120> money<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.480> stuff<00:02:30.810> but<00:02:31.430> maybe

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
take like money and stuff but maybe

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.540 
take like money and stuff but maybe
maybe<00:02:33.030> this<00:02:33.300> extra<00:02:33.690> time<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.950> rock<00:02:35.340> star

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
maybe this extra time the rock star

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.520 
maybe this extra time the rock star
needs<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.879> release<00:02:36.150> in<00:02:36.330> September<00:02:36.840> maybe<00:02:37.410> they

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
needs a release in September maybe they

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.589 
needs a release in September maybe they
can<00:02:37.709> work<00:02:37.950> on<00:02:38.190> maybe<00:02:38.519> being<00:02:38.910> able<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.330> rob

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
can work on maybe being able to rob

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.740 
can work on maybe being able to rob
different<00:02:40.260> places<00:02:40.470> different<00:02:40.830> stuff<00:02:41.400> and

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
draw different places like maybe we

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.960 
draw different places like maybe we
could<00:02:44.760> take<00:02:45.180> TVs<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.319> computers<00:02:46.379> and<00:02:47.370> every

911 and the cops show up at the houses
door<00:03:22.709> and<00:03:22.920> then<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.459> have<00:03:23.580> to<00:03:23.700> fight<00:03:23.879> off<00:03:24.030> the

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
hiding under the table stuff like that I

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.320 
hiding under the table stuff like that I
just<00:03:28.140> think<00:03:28.319> that<00:03:28.379> would<00:03:28.590> be<00:03:28.830> amazing<00:03:29.340> I<00:03:29.819> don't

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
just think that would be amazing I don't

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.720 
just think that would be amazing I don't
know<00:03:30.390> if<00:03:30.480> they<00:03:30.599> could<00:03:30.989> put<00:03:31.110> it<00:03:31.530> in<00:03:31.680> maybe<00:03:32.400> since

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
know if they could put it in maybe since

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.160 
know if they could put it in maybe since
they<00:03:32.849> have<00:03:32.940> seven<00:03:33.239> months<00:03:33.569> they<00:03:33.690> could<00:03:33.840> put<00:03:34.049> it

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
they have seven months they could put it

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.050 
they have seven months they could put it
in<00:03:34.260> if<00:03:34.560> they<00:03:34.709> decide<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.040> be<00:03:35.640> able<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:35.879> rob

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
in if they decide to be able to rob

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.910 
in if they decide to be able to rob
stuff<00:03:36.420> so<00:03:37.080> I<00:03:37.110> just<00:03:37.409> think<00:03:37.560> they'll<00:03:37.709> be<00:03:37.799> an

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
stuff so I just think they'll be an

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.559 
stuff so I just think they'll be an
amazing<00:03:38.430> thing<00:03:38.610> if<00:03:38.700> they<00:03:38.819> added<00:03:39.090> it<00:03:39.209> one<00:03:39.450> of

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
amazing thing if they added it one of

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.180 
amazing thing if they added it one of
