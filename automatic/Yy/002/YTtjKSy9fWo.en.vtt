been here to diagnose the unit but when

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.410 
been here to diagnose the unit but when
I<00:00:37.469> was<00:00:37.649> here<00:00:37.829> before<00:00:37.860> with<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.969> unit<00:00:39.239> plugged

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
I was here before with the unit plugged

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.020 
I was here before with the unit plugged
in<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.629> said<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.230> bake<00:00:40.440> turn<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.520> on<00:00:41.640> I

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
in I said it to bake turn it on I

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.510 
in I said it to bake turn it on I
noticed<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.140> igniter<00:00:43.440> came<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
noticed that the igniter came on the

were the oven temp sensor and I had

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.460 
were the oven temp sensor and I had
tested<00:01:05.640> them<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.030> they<00:01:06.540> had<00:01:06.930> said<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.350> it

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
tested them and they had said that it

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.920 
tested them and they had said that it
was<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> 350<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.460> oven<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.060> had<00:01:09.299> also<00:01:09.420> tested

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
was a 350 in the oven I had also tested

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.990 
was a 350 in the oven I had also tested
them<00:01:10.020> before<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.409> started<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.580> make<00:01:11.700> sure<00:01:11.880> they

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
them before I started to make sure they

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.920 
them before I started to make sure they
are<00:01:12.119> right<00:01:12.360> around<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:13.110> 1150<00:01:14.040> 1180<00:01:14.640> owns<00:01:15.390> mark

this unit you have a temp sensor that
sends<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.229> message<00:01:56.070> up<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.340> board<00:01:56.670> tells<00:01:56.909> it

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
sends a message up to the board tells it

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.910 
sends a message up to the board tells it
when<00:01:57.210> it's<00:01:57.360> at<00:01:57.479> temperature<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.229> what

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
when it's at temperature and what

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.910 
when it's at temperature and what
temperature<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.790> is<00:02:00.030> at<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.439> board<00:02:01.680> knows

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
temperature it is at so the board knows

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.469

inside the temperature inside the oven

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.740 
inside the temperature inside the oven
when<00:05:33.729> I'm<00:05:33.820> pointing<00:05:34.180> it<00:05:34.240> in<00:05:34.330> there<00:05:34.539> I'm

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
when I'm pointing it in there I'm

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:40.320 
when I'm pointing it in there I'm
getting<00:05:35.080> about<00:05:35.169> 300<00:05:36.039> or<00:05:36.160> so<00:05:39.120> and<00:05:40.120> where<00:05:40.300> I

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
getting about 300 or so and where I

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.250 
getting about 300 or so and where I
point<00:05:41.099> the<00:05:42.099> greeting<00:05:42.880> says<00:05:43.090> it's<00:05:43.270> at<00:05:43.360> 250<00:05:44.080> but

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
point the greeting says it's at 250 but

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.550 
point the greeting says it's at 250 but
these<00:05:44.470> it<00:05:44.800> may<00:05:45.010> not<00:05:45.220> be<00:05:45.370> exactly<00:05:45.789> right<00:05:45.900> so<00:05:46.900> at

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
these it may not be exactly right so at

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.560 
these it may not be exactly right so at
this<00:05:47.800> point<00:05:48.039> I'm<00:05:48.190> going<00:05:48.310> to<00:05:48.370> now<00:05:48.490> retest<00:05:49.180> the
