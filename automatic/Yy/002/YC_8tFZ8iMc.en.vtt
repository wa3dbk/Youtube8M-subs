back down the scaling hit 8.4 get in the
gentlemen<00:01:23.939> general<00:01:24.360> area<00:01:24.840> now<00:01:25.880> if<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.150> notice

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
gentlemen general area now if you notice

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.270 
gentlemen general area now if you notice
like<00:01:27.659> we<00:01:27.840> did<00:01:28.020> with<00:01:28.200> three<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.650> can't<00:01:28.920> set<00:01:29.250> it

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
like we did with three you can't set it

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.069 
like we did with three you can't set it
to<00:01:29.520> zero<00:01:29.790> because<00:01:30.000> if<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.329> set<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.689> eggs<00:01:30.840> off

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
to zero because if you set the eggs off

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.219 
to zero because if you set the eggs off
set<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.530> zero<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:33.270> know<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.630> sets<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.020> X

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
set to zero it you know it sets the X

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.190 
set to zero it you know it sets the X
offset<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.159> like<00:01:35.310> in<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.640> center<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.000> it

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
offset to like in the center of it

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.190 
offset to like in the center of it
that's<00:01:37.200> just<00:01:37.439> how<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.650> set<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.159> up<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.369> accident

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
that's just how I set it up on accident

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.120 
that's just how I set it up on accident
it<00:01:40.200> doesn't<00:01:40.500> work<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.619> way<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:40.920> we're<00:01:41.040> gonna

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
it doesn't work that way so we're gonna

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.149 
it doesn't work that way so we're gonna
have<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.310> eyeball<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.729> little<00:01:42.090> bit<00:01:42.829> that<00:01:43.829> looks

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
have to eyeball a little bit that looks

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.700 
have to eyeball a little bit that looks

centered to me well hold up that looks

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.910 
centered to me well hold up that looks
centered<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.189> me<00:01:47.340> now<00:01:47.579> i'm<00:01:47.700> going<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.920> nudge

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
I'm going to go on a later demonstration

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.160 
I'm going to go on a later demonstration
of<00:02:44.790> how<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:44.970> set<00:02:45.299> up<00:02:45.329> all<00:02:46.319> of<00:02:46.920> my<00:02:47.069> addons

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
because I do setup grid a lot

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.509 
because I do setup grid a lot
differently<00:02:51.720> than<00:02:52.110> how<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:52.319> is<00:02:52.620> set<00:02:52.920> up<00:02:54.380> and<00:02:55.519> if
