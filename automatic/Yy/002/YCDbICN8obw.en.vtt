well<00:02:01.560> we'll<00:02:01.740> go<00:02:01.860> out<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.130> ride<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.340> bike<00:02:02.490> and

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
well we'll go out and ride the bike and

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:31.710 
well we'll go out and ride the bike and
see<00:02:02.820> how<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.060> works

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.000 

a<00:02:33.840> few<00:02:34.840> things<00:02:35.080> definitely<00:02:35.290> stood<00:02:35.680> out<00:02:35.740> in<00:02:35.920> our

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
a few things definitely stood out in our

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.410 
a few things definitely stood out in our
minds<00:02:36.190> after<00:02:36.400> riding<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.910> Honda<00:02:37.180> for<00:02:37.330> the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
minds after riding the Honda for the

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.020 
minds after riding the Honda for the
first<00:02:37.630> time<00:02:37.870> for<00:02:38.320> one<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.830> motor<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:39.670> changes

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
first time for one the motor the changes

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.400 
first time for one the motor the changes
they<00:02:40.120> made<00:02:40.300> to<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.540> cylinder<00:02:40.870> head<00:02:41.050> and<00:02:41.290> the

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
they made to the cylinder head and the

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.620 
they made to the cylinder head and the
exhaust<00:02:41.710> pipe<00:02:41.950> made<00:02:42.130> a<00:02:42.160> big<00:02:42.370> difference<00:02:42.630> our

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
exhaust pipe made a big difference our

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.260 
exhaust pipe made a big difference our
testers<00:02:44.050> noticed<00:02:44.470> a<00:02:44.680> much<00:02:45.100> more<00:02:45.490> livelier

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
testers noticed a much more livelier

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.330 
testers noticed a much more livelier
bottom<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:46.840> a<00:02:46.990> little<00:02:47.230> more<00:02:47.350> hit<00:02:48.010> off<00:02:48.190> the

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
bottom and a little more hit off the

bottom and on the other side of the
spectrum<00:02:50.470> much<00:02:51.100> more<00:02:51.340> over-rev<00:02:51.880> it<00:02:51.910> still

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
spectrum much more over-rev it still

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.270 
spectrum much more over-rev it still
might<00:02:52.660> not<00:02:52.690> be<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:53.200> most<00:02:53.410> powerful<00:02:53.680> bike<00:02:54.100> in

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
might not be the most powerful bike in

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.490 
might not be the most powerful bike in
its<00:02:54.430> class<00:02:54.640> but<00:02:55.030> it's<00:02:55.390> pretty<00:02:55.570> darn<00:02:55.810> close<00:02:56.050> and

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
its class but it's pretty darn close and

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.100 
its class but it's pretty darn close and
it's<00:02:56.650> very<00:02:57.100> very<00:02:57.460> usable<00:02:58.060> power<00:02:58.330> so<00:02:58.960> that

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
it's very very usable power so that

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.740 
it's very very usable power so that
could<00:02:59.260> come<00:02:59.410> come<00:02:59.800> in<00:02:59.920> handy<00:03:00.310> in<00:03:01.240> long<00:03:01.510> races

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
could come come in handy in long races

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.290 
could come come in handy in long races
and<00:03:02.170> stuff<00:03:02.460> and<00:03:03.460> also<00:03:03.760> we<00:03:03.850> like<00:03:03.940> to<00:03:04.090> mapping

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
and stuff and also we like to mapping

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.020 
and stuff and also we like to mapping
the<00:03:04.510> three<00:03:04.810> three<00:03:05.380> modes<00:03:05.950> they<00:03:06.670> all<00:03:06.790> worked

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
the three three modes they all worked

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.170 
the three three modes they all worked
well<00:03:07.270> our<00:03:07.900> testers<00:03:08.320> referred<00:03:08.770> the<00:03:09.180> they

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
well our testers referred the they

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.550 
well our testers referred the they
actually<00:03:10.450> liked<00:03:10.600> the<00:03:10.690> standard<00:03:11.050> setting<00:03:11.380> and

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
actually liked the standard setting and

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.050 
actually liked the standard setting and
they<00:03:11.620> also<00:03:11.770> liked<00:03:12.040> a<00:03:12.130> little<00:03:12.250> softer<00:03:12.730> one<00:03:12.850> for

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
they also liked a little softer one for

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.060 
they also liked a little softer one for
the<00:03:13.120> track<00:03:13.300> dried<00:03:13.570> out<00:03:13.750> but<00:03:14.380> it<00:03:14.500> was<00:03:14.590> very<00:03:14.860> cool

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
the track dried out but it was very cool

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.440 
the track dried out but it was very cool
to<00:03:15.100> be<00:03:15.250> able<00:03:15.340> to<00:03:15.459> stop<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:15.880> decide<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.240> track

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
to be able to stop and decide the track

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.080 
to be able to stop and decide the track
hit<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:16.750> button<00:03:17.080> and<00:03:17.170> change<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.680> modes<00:03:18.090> as

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
hit the button and change the modes as

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.880

far<00:03:19.330> as<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.570> Forex<00:03:19.930> we<00:03:20.110> were<00:03:20.200> very<00:03:20.410> happy<00:03:20.620> with

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
far as the Forex we were very happy with

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.680 
far as the Forex we were very happy with
them<00:03:21.070> it<00:03:21.340> took<00:03:21.490> a<00:03:21.520> little<00:03:21.730> while<00:03:21.880> to<00:03:22.060> get<00:03:22.510> them

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
them it took a little while to get them

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.300 
them it took a little while to get them
dialed<00:03:23.140> in<00:03:23.230> to<00:03:23.380> where<00:03:23.500> he<00:03:23.560> wanted<00:03:23.890> at<00:03:24.070> first

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
dialed in to where he wanted at first

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.860 
dialed in to where he wanted at first
the<00:03:24.430> bike<00:03:24.610> felt<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:25.300> front<00:03:25.510> end<00:03:25.630> felt<00:03:25.840> a

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
the bike felt the front end felt a

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.540 
the bike felt the front end felt a
little<00:03:25.990> light<00:03:26.260> little<00:03:26.590> little<00:03:26.980> movement<00:03:27.459> up

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
little light little little movement up

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.790 
little light little little movement up
there<00:03:27.580> and<00:03:27.970> kind<00:03:28.060> of<00:03:28.180> busy<00:03:28.480> but<00:03:29.050> once<00:03:29.560> we<00:03:29.650> made

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
there and kind of busy but once we made

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.740 
there and kind of busy but once we made
some<00:03:29.980> changes<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.459> both<00:03:30.760> mostly<00:03:31.630> the

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
some changes to both mostly the

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.690 
some changes to both mostly the
compression<00:03:32.260> we<00:03:32.950> got<00:03:33.100> the<00:03:33.220> front<00:03:33.370> end<00:03:33.490> working

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
compression we got the front end working

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.460 
compression we got the front end working
really<00:03:34.120> really<00:03:34.270> well<00:03:34.690> in<00:03:34.840> our<00:03:34.930> testers<00:03:35.290> was

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
really really well in our testers was

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.050 
really really well in our testers was
quite<00:03:35.680> happy<00:03:36.010> with<00:03:36.100> the<00:03:36.250> fork<00:03:36.489> so<00:03:36.850> it<00:03:36.910> did<00:03:37.030> take

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
quite happy with the fork so it did take

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.340 
quite happy with the fork so it did take
a<00:03:37.209> little<00:03:37.420> bit<00:03:37.540> of<00:03:37.600> trial<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:37.870> error<00:03:38.050> but<00:03:38.260> we

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
a little bit of trial and error but we

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.890 
a little bit of trial and error but we
got<00:03:38.530> it<00:03:38.650> got<00:03:38.980> it<00:03:39.130> all<00:03:39.250> figured<00:03:39.459> out<00:03:39.700> and<00:03:40.150> so<00:03:40.330> we

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
got it got it all figured out and so we

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.380 
got it got it all figured out and so we
have<00:03:40.989> to<00:03:41.400> say<00:03:42.400> that<00:03:42.580> we<00:03:42.640> finished<00:03:42.940> off<00:03:43.060> a<00:03:43.209> day

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
have to say that we finished off a day

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.229 
have to say that we finished off a day
like<00:03:43.930> in<00:03:44.140> the<00:03:44.230> new<00:03:44.350> fork<00:03:44.680> and<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:46.120> other

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
like in the new fork and the other

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.970 
like in the new fork and the other
really<00:03:46.540> standout<00:03:46.959> was<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:47.380> new<00:03:47.500> front<00:03:47.769> brake

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
really standout was the new front brake

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.440 
really standout was the new front brake
the<00:03:48.160> bigger<00:03:48.310> disc<00:03:48.640> really<00:03:49.150> makes<00:03:49.360> a

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
the bigger disc really makes a

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.449 
the bigger disc really makes a
difference<00:03:49.840> you<00:03:49.930> have<00:03:50.080> great<00:03:50.560> great<00:03:51.250> power

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
difference you have great great power

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.570 
difference you have great great power
and<00:03:51.790> good<00:03:51.910> control<00:03:52.300> on<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:53.410> front<00:03:53.530> brake<00:03:53.830> so

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
and good control on the front brake so

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.190 
and good control on the front brake so
overall<00:03:55.000> after<00:03:55.269> on<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.600> bike<00:03:55.720> for<00:03:55.930> the<00:03:55.959> first

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
overall after on the bike for the first

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.720 
overall after on the bike for the first
time<00:03:56.440> you<00:03:56.650> feel<00:03:56.830> like<00:03:56.860> it<00:03:57.010> is<00:03:57.280> an<00:03:57.459> improvement

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
time you feel like it is an improvement

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.300 
time you feel like it is an improvement
over<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:58.120> 2014<00:03:58.920> especially<00:03:59.920> in<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:00.130> motor

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310
