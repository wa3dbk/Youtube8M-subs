00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.560
 of the cross

 some people asked me there in my 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.260
 channel and today I'll do it for you 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.259
 step by step 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:29.800
 Enclosing and coming from this soil, that 's it. 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.480
 Let's go guys, I'll put the camera. 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.430
 has a little closer so that you 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.989
 see a guitar arm better 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:48.309
 Come on upstairs and we'll be sleepy 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:51.149
 here's the phrase like here's the team 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.149
 repeat 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.909
 also remembering that you are in the middle of a 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.830
 low 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:14.670
 then you'll have to download or tony but 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.670
 there are those who do not remember 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:53.729
 repeating that part right there it goes 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:56.729
 starting here 11 arpeggio is starting from this 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.729
 smaller 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.649
 remembering that you will extend it 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.039
 start here 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:20.709
 This is the argument here for longer. 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:22.900
 my whole guitar 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.910
 this is it people I hope you 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.910
 learn this and that's it, that's it
