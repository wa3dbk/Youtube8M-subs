00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.800 
then we're like returns on their head so
like<00:03:59.739> a<00:03:59.770> turban<00:04:00.280> I<00:04:01.150> thought<00:04:01.540> that<00:04:01.660> was

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
like a turban I thought that was

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.770 
like a turban I thought that was
reversible<00:04:02.290> so<00:04:02.650> what<00:04:03.130> I<00:04:03.160> sure<00:04:03.430> does<00:04:04.000> but<00:04:04.540> this

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
reversible so what I sure does but this

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.699 
reversible so what I sure does but this
is<00:04:04.989> it<00:04:05.290> it's<00:04:05.980> weighted<00:04:06.849> a<00:04:07.030> 160<00:04:07.959> so<00:04:08.140> it<00:04:08.290> is<00:04:08.440> one

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
is it it's weighted a 160 so it is one

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.720 
is it it's weighted a 160 so it is one
of<00:04:08.739> the<00:04:08.890> higher<00:04:09.130> ones<00:04:10.780> sad<00:04:11.400> look<00:04:12.400> side

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
of the higher ones sad look side

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.360 
of the higher ones sad look side
