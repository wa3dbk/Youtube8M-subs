little pointer right here it's a

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.440 
little pointer right here it's a
straight<00:00:31.050> six<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.949> it's<00:00:32.550> got<00:00:32.790> those<00:00:32.969> coil

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
straight six and it's got those coil

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.280 
straight six and it's got those coil
over<00:00:33.809> plugs<00:00:34.200> now<00:00:34.910> you<00:00:35.910> can<00:00:36.149> read<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.690> codes<00:00:37.020> if

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
over plugs now you can read the codes if

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.810 
over plugs now you can read the codes if
you<00:00:37.380> get<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> check<00:00:37.829> engine<00:00:38.070> light<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.640> can

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
you get a check engine light you can

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.610 
you get a check engine light you can
read<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.120> codes<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.629> you've<00:00:39.719> got<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.960> misfire

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
read the codes and you've got a misfire

on in this car what you can do is it'll

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.959 
on in this car what you can do is it'll
tell<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.260> which<00:00:46.440> one<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.219> miss<00:00:47.399> fine<00:00:47.640> it'll<00:00:47.910> be

two or whatever that number is that's

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.090 
two or whatever that number is that's
gonna<00:00:52.649> be<00:00:52.860> your<00:00:53.039> cylinder<00:00:53.840> now<00:00:54.840> all<00:00:55.829> you've

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
gonna be your cylinder now all you've

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.200 
gonna be your cylinder now all you've
got<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.489> do<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:58.190> go<00:00:59.190> ahead<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.640> swap<00:00:59.940> those

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
got to do is go ahead and swap those

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.920 
got to do is go ahead and swap those
coils<00:01:00.780> out<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:02.000> see<00:01:03.000> if<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.300> follows<00:01:03.750> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
coils out and see if it follows the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.440 
coils out and see if it follows the
misfire<00:01:04.439> if<00:01:05.129> you've<00:01:05.369> got<00:01:05.549> multiple<00:01:05.760> misfires

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
misfire if you've got multiple misfires

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.210 
misfire if you've got multiple misfires
usually<00:01:06.840> it's<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.080> EGR<00:01:07.560> problem<00:01:07.950> with<00:01:08.070> these

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
usually it's a EGR problem with these

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.050 
usually it's a EGR problem with these
cars<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:09.619> 90%<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.189> times<00:01:11.490> you've<00:01:11.850> got

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
cars but 90% of the times you've got

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.670 
cars but 90% of the times you've got
multiple<00:01:12.270> misfire<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.170> just<00:01:13.320> gonna<00:01:13.439> be<00:01:13.590> an

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
multiple misfire it's just gonna be an

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.700 
multiple misfire it's just gonna be an
easy<00:01:13.830> job<00:01:14.100> if<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.460> got<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.670> single<00:01:15.380> misfire<00:01:16.380> on

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
easy job if you got a single misfire on

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.300 
easy job if you got a single misfire on
this<00:01:16.979> car<00:01:17.720> and<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:19.409> want<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.770> follow<00:01:19.979> the

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
this car and you want to follow the

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.380 
this car and you want to follow the
cylinders<00:01:21.650> the<00:01:22.650> cylinders<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:23.820> car<00:01:24.119> go

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
cylinders the cylinders in this car go

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.060 
cylinders the cylinders in this car go
six<00:01:24.840> five<00:01:25.680> four<00:01:26.610> three<00:01:27.030> two<00:01:27.810> one<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:28.979> they

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
six five four three two one so they

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.510 
six five four three two one so they
started<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.460> inside<00:01:31.040> firewall<00:01:32.040> right<00:01:32.250> here

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
started this inside firewall right here

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.660 
started this inside firewall right here
if<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.759> can<00:01:32.939> see<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.829> number<00:01:35.250> six<00:01:35.520> is

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
if you can see so so the number six is

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.450 
if you can see so so the number six is
closest<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.299> dash<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:38.570> closest<00:01:39.570> to

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
closest to the dash and closest to

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.320 
closest to the dash and closest to
closest<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.729> radiator<00:01:42.150> is

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
closest to the radiator is

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.870 
closest to the radiator is
if<00:01:45.330> you<00:01:45.750> had<00:01:45.960> like<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.230> misfire<00:01:46.860> number<00:01:47.460> six<00:01:47.760> you

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
if you had like a misfire number six you

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.760 
if you had like a misfire number six you
could<00:01:48.060> switch<00:01:48.630> out<00:01:48.810> six<00:01:49.170> with<00:01:49.350> five<00:01:49.560> they're

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
could switch out six with five they're

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.660 
could switch out six with five they're
so<00:01:50.040> easy<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.490> switch<00:01:50.730> out<00:01:51.020> all<00:01:52.220> it<00:01:53.220> takes<00:01:53.460> is

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
so easy to switch out all it takes is

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.740 
so easy to switch out all it takes is
just<00:01:54.320> Torx<00:01:55.320> bit<00:01:56.180> switch<00:01:57.180> them<00:01:57.360> out<00:01:57.480> make<00:01:57.720> sure

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
just Torx bit switch them out make sure

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.140 
just Torx bit switch them out make sure
they're<00:01:58.050> seated<00:01:58.410> in<00:01:58.560> there<00:01:58.680> right<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.280> and

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
they're seated in there right and and

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.970 
they're seated in there right and and
they're<00:02:00.690> just<00:02:00.930> plug<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:01.470> over<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.160> coils<00:02:02.580> so

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
they're just plug in over the coils so

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.830 
they're just plug in over the coils so
it's<00:02:04.980> pretty<00:02:05.310> easy<00:02:05.580> to<00:02:05.940> do<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.300> pretty<00:02:06.480> easy<00:02:06.750> to

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
it's pretty easy to do it pretty easy to

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.570 
it's pretty easy to do it pretty easy to
figure<00:02:07.260> out<00:02:07.470> and<00:02:07.680> if<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.860> do<00:02:08.040> have<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.250> coil

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
figure out and if you do have a coil

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.680 
figure out and if you do have a coil
misfire<00:02:09.119> just<00:02:09.770> get<00:02:10.770> on<00:02:10.950> one<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.940> auction

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
misfire just get on one of the auction

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.020 
misfire just get on one of the auction
sites<00:02:12.990> and<00:02:13.350> I<00:02:13.650> wouldn't<00:02:13.920> go<00:02:14.040> spending<00:02:14.880> that

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
sites and I wouldn't go spending that

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.320 
sites and I wouldn't go spending that
much<00:02:15.210> money<00:02:15.240> on<00:02:15.800> coils<00:02:16.800> you<00:02:16.890> can<00:02:17.070> usually<00:02:18.000> get

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
much money on coils you can usually get

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.910 
much money on coils you can usually get
cause<00:02:18.600> for<00:02:18.840> about<00:02:18.990> thirty-five<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:19.530> think<00:02:19.860> I

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
cause for about thirty-five I think I

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.910 
cause for about thirty-five I think I
got<00:02:20.100> one<00:02:20.340> for<00:02:20.550> $40<00:02:21.209> and<00:02:21.240> it<00:02:21.720> even<00:02:22.350> had<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.590> crack

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
got one for $40 and it even had a crack

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.680 
got one for $40 and it even had a crack
in<00:02:23.160> it<00:02:23.250> but<00:02:23.490> it<00:02:23.730> doesn't<00:02:24.030> have<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.180> misfire

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690
