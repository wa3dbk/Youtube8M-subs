there's<00:02:35.550> not<00:02:35.670> much<00:02:35.820> to<00:02:36.000> say<00:02:36.240> about<00:02:36.390> this

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
think if any of you find it or go yeah

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.650 
think if any of you find it or go yeah
then<00:02:43.620> it's<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:44.010> really<00:02:44.190> good<00:02:44.280> thing<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:45.060> pick<00:02:45.480> up
