also got the solution I think it's

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:11.500 
also got the solution I think it's
saline<00:02:08.470> solution<00:02:09.729> I'm<00:02:10.729> not<00:02:10.940> too<00:02:11.090> sure<00:02:11.300> oh<00:02:11.450> no

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
saline solution I'm not too sure oh no

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.300

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
its water 45 percent water and

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.470 
its water 45 percent water and
55%<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:16.620> polymer<00:02:17.310> water<00:02:19.550> yes<00:02:20.550> oh<00:02:20.760> it's<00:02:20.940> saline

55% to polymer water yes oh it's saline

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.390 
55% to polymer water yes oh it's saline
solution<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:23.030> then<00:02:24.030> put<00:02:24.599> them<00:02:24.780> in<00:02:24.930> there<00:02:25.400> but

this<00:04:26.460> it's<00:04:26.730> called<00:04:26.970> funky<00:04:27.270> all-in-one

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
this it's called funky all-in-one

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.580 
this it's called funky all-in-one
solution<00:04:28.410> and<00:04:29.720> I'm<00:04:30.720> not<00:04:31.020> sure<00:04:31.260> what<00:04:31.470> the

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
solution and I'm not sure what the

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.040 
solution and I'm not sure what the
expiry<00:04:32.130> on<00:04:32.430> this<00:04:32.670> is<00:04:35.300> doesn't<00:04:36.300> seem<00:04:36.600> to<00:04:36.840> have

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
expiry on this is doesn't seem to have

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.260 
expiry on this is doesn't seem to have
one<00:04:37.410> so<00:04:37.980> I<00:04:38.660> assume<00:04:39.660> it<00:04:39.900> doesn't<00:04:40.080> expire<00:04:41.270> but

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
one so I assume it doesn't expire but

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.080 
one so I assume it doesn't expire but
yeah<00:04:42.540> it<00:04:42.930> says<00:04:43.200> manufactured<00:04:44.070> for<00:04:44.370> beautify

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
yeah it says manufactured for beautify

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.210 
yeah it says manufactured for beautify
so<00:04:45.600> this<00:04:45.900> must<00:04:46.140> be<00:04:46.320> their<00:04:46.620> own<00:04:46.860> brand<00:04:49.220> it's

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
so this must be their own brand it's

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.330 
so this must be their own brand it's
quite<00:04:50.460> big<00:04:50.760> this<00:04:51.030> as<00:04:51.240> well<00:04:51.420> it's<00:04:51.710> 120<00:04:52.710> mils<00:04:52.980> and

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
quite big this as well it's 120 mils and

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.080 
quite big this as well it's 120 mils and
I'm<00:04:54.210> not<00:04:54.390> sure<00:04:54.600> how<00:04:54.900> much<00:04:55.110> it<00:04:55.320> will<00:04:55.530> cast<00:04:56.090> but

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
I'm not sure how much it will cast but

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.160 
I'm not sure how much it will cast but
