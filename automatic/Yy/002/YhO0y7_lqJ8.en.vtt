00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.209
 re 4th place 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.350
 There is counter film for smartphone Machine Easy surely 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:15.700
 But I use a needle 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:19.680
 Comes with double-sided tape etc. purchased at amazon 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:25.260
 Of course LCD protective film can put glass film 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:29.190
 When the initial game is peeled off , adhesive cutting for fixing the smartphone body appears 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.669
 How to use is very easy Set the glass film 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:37.230
 Lift the glass film crowded down the flap 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:41.790
 Remove dirt and dust from your smartphone screen while lifting 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.809
 Also after removing the protective film of the adhesion part of the glass film, the glass film is also 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.280
 Paste 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.350
 Push bubbles with attached squeezer 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.100
 tan 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:57.160
 You can also put a glass film very easily in this way 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:01:01.660
 Officially, there can be a lifetime film up to a 7-inch sized terminal 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:07.180
 Therefore, 4.7 inches of iphone 6 is also targeted 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:08.290
 However, in glass bloom is heavy weight above the Renchaku force of this for flap 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.760
 It takes 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:16.570
 There were a lot of cases that it was not possible to paste well to fall off first and leave 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:21.780
 There was no problem at all in the case of 4 inch iphone 5 s glass film 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:27.470
 But in the case of the glass filler of iphone 6 it seems too too 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:31.970
 You need the wind if you put a bra film of this order's now a large smartphone 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.560
 Glasses and tr 3 for iphone 66 plus 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:39.830
 Take the example of how to bend 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:42.800
 The tips will teach you about 2 points First of all paste the included double-sided tape to the adhesive part of the flap 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:47.460
 Is a point to restore the adhesion 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:51.060
 The second point is that we use gum tape flap and handle seal 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:55.079
 In affirmation that it is strictly affirmed with gum tape 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.299
 I will absolutely never be on the way 5.5 inches iphone 6 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.580
 Even glass film for plus 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.000
 I have never been lacquered 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:07.480
 Quality is about to be sure to break 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:13.350
 If it 's spring, it 's spring and glass of appearance and tr series 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.350
 If you put the film easily, Easy Fit is recommended 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:23.150
 From the button on the screen from dc to the button on the bottom of the screen from the smartphone 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.150
