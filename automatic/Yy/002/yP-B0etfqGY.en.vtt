a<00:00:08.040> lesson<00:00:08.280> on<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:09.480> left<00:00:10.139> hand<00:00:10.380> technique<00:00:10.790> that

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
a lesson on a left hand technique that

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.910 
a lesson on a left hand technique that
was<00:00:12.030> used<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.480> lot<00:00:12.509> during<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.670> ragtime<00:00:15.920> stride

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
was used a lot during the ragtime stride

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.679 
was used a lot during the ragtime stride
period<00:00:17.699> ragtime<00:00:18.320> you<00:00:19.320> think<00:00:19.560> of<00:00:20.510> he's<00:00:21.510> like<00:00:21.660> a

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
period ragtime you think of he's like a

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.429 
period ragtime you think of he's like a
Scott<00:00:22.050> Joplin<00:00:22.710> or<00:00:23.539> stride<00:00:24.539> maybe<00:00:24.990> Jelly<00:00:25.350> Roll

Morton<00:00:25.590> Fats<00:00:26.160> Waller<00:00:26.480> this<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.660> one<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:27.990> the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
Morton Fats Waller this is one of the

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.560 
Morton Fats Waller this is one of the
basic<00:00:28.740> bass<00:00:29.070> techniques<00:00:29.730> at<00:00:29.939> C<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.179> I'm<00:00:30.390> going

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
basic bass techniques at C so I'm going

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.530 
basic bass techniques at C so I'm going
to<00:00:30.599> show<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:30.900> three<00:00:31.590> different<00:00:31.619> ways<00:00:32.540> of

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
to show you three different ways of

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.870 
to show you three different ways of
doing<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:34.079> one<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.980> going<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.190> be<00:00:35.340> very<00:00:35.460> simple

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
doing it one is going to be very simple

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.119 
doing it one is going to be very simple
and<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.420> next<00:00:36.809> if<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.620> want<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.890> get<00:00:37.980> more

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
and the next if you want to get more

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.010 
and the next if you want to get more
advanced<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:38.940> feel<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.570> can<00:00:39.719> put<00:00:39.899> the

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
advanced and you feel you can put the

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.049 
advanced and you feel you can put the
hands<00:00:40.200> together<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.219> then<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.790> do<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
hands together and you then you do the

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.880 
hands together and you then you do the
more<00:00:42.660> advanced<00:00:43.020> one<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.350> then<00:00:43.440> there's<00:00:43.649> one

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
more advanced one and then there's one

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.380 
more advanced one and then there's one
that's<00:00:43.920> that's<00:00:44.700> quite<00:00:45.300> advanced<00:00:46.820> so<00:00:47.820> we'll

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
that's that's quite advanced so we'll

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.930 
that's that's quite advanced so we'll
start<00:00:48.690> with<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.020> simple<00:00:49.440> one<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.980> this

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
start with the simple one and this

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.740 
start with the simple one and this
technique<00:00:51.449> we<00:00:52.289> start<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.949> left<00:00:53.129> hand

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
technique we start in the left hand

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.689 
technique we start in the left hand
remember<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.870> bass<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.559> bass<00:00:55.739> line<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
remember the bass the bass line and the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.250 
remember the bass the bass line and the
left<00:00:56.850> hand<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.210> very<00:00:57.420> important<00:00:57.989> when<00:00:58.170> you're

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
left hand is very important when you're

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.810 
left hand is very important when you're
playing<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:59.520> kind<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.910> stride<00:01:00.300> style<00:01:01.109> and

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
playing this kind of stride style and

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.280 
playing this kind of stride style and
because<00:01:02.820> it's<00:01:02.969> providing<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.690> left<00:01:03.870> hand<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
because it's providing the left hand the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.609 
because it's providing the left hand the
bass<00:01:04.470> note<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.920> providing<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:06.360> base<00:01:07.320> of

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
bass note is providing the base of

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.750 
bass note is providing the base of
course<00:01:08.540> and<00:01:09.540> you're<00:01:09.900> also<00:01:10.110> getting<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:11.100> sense

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
course and you're also getting a sense

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.570 
course and you're also getting a sense
of<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.210> meter<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.229> movement<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.860> pulse<00:01:14.130> and

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
of the meter the movement the pulse and

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.399 
of the meter the movement the pulse and
you're<00:01:15.150> also<00:01:15.299> getting<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.990> harmony

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
you're also getting the harmony

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.200 
you're also getting the harmony
especially<00:01:17.400> if<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.700> do<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.060> more

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
especially if you do in the more

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.300 
especially if you do in the more
advanced<00:01:18.540> way<00:01:18.869> because<00:01:19.710> you're<00:01:19.890> adding<00:01:20.250> a

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
advanced way because you're adding a

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.710 
advanced way because you're adding a
harmony<00:01:20.759> chord<00:01:21.030> on<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.210> second<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
harmony chord on the second and the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.600 
harmony chord on the second and the
fourth<00:01:21.869> beat<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.460> we're<00:01:23.460> going<00:01:23.549> to

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
fourth beat so we're going to

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.260 
fourth beat so we're going to
demonstrate<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.360> all<00:01:24.540> on<00:01:24.780> AC<00:01:25.049> chord<00:01:26.270> we

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
demonstrate this all on AC chord we

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.350 
demonstrate this all on AC chord we
start<00:01:27.600> with<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.930> left<00:01:28.110> hand<00:01:29.030> playing<00:01:30.030> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
start with the left hand playing the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.780 
start with the left hand playing the
root<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.720> chord<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.259> that's<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.560> C<00:01:31.799> first

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
root of the chord so that's the C first

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.999 
root of the chord so that's the C first
beat<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.869> second<00:01:34.290> beat<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.650> left<00:01:34.829> hands

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
beat on the second beat the left hands

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.340 
beat on the second beat the left hands
going<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.189> pop<00:01:35.460> way<00:01:35.729> up<00:01:35.880> here<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.600> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
going to pop way up here to this the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.469 
going to pop way up here to this the
tenth<00:01:37.979> or<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.520> third<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:38.970> chord<00:01:39.210> up<00:01:39.360> an

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
tenth or the third of the chord up an

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.679 
tenth or the third of the chord up an
octave<00:01:40.070> okay<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.130> our<00:01:41.340> up<00:01:41.460> here<00:01:41.820> should<00:01:42.450> be<00:01:42.630> an

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
octave okay so our up here should be an

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.649 
octave okay so our up here should be an
e<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.170> then<00:01:44.009> we<00:01:44.100> jump<00:01:44.399> down<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.030> fifth<00:01:45.390> on

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
e and then we jump down to the fifth on

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.960 
e and then we jump down to the fifth on
the<00:01:45.720> third<00:01:46.229> beat<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.340> measure<00:01:47.490> which<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:47.850> a

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
the third beat of the measure which is a

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.030 
the third beat of the measure which is a
G<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.799> then<00:01:49.799> we<00:01:49.920> go<00:01:50.240> back<00:01:51.240> up<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.439> third<00:01:52.500> so

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
G and then we go back up to the third so

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.600 
G and then we go back up to the third so
it's<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:54.560> so<00:01:55.560> we<00:01:55.649> get<00:01:55.799> all<00:01:55.950> parts<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.490> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
it's this so we get all parts of the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.209 
it's this so we get all parts of the
chord<00:01:56.880> right<00:01:57.060> we<00:01:57.270> get<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.450> root<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.530> third<00:01:58.799> or

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
chord right we get the root the third or

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:07.249 
chord right we get the root the third or
the<00:01:59.340> tenth<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:04.280> it's<00:02:05.299> squarely<00:02:06.299> right<00:02:06.840> on<00:02:07.079> the

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
the tenth and it's squarely right on the

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.779 
the tenth and it's squarely right on the
beat<00:02:07.469> it's<00:02:07.770> not<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:08.039> between<00:02:08.429> it's<00:02:08.640> not

beat it's not in between it's not

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:09.249 
beat it's not in between it's not

paid<00:02:09.379> it<00:02:09.560> at<00:02:09.679> all<00:02:10.090> now<00:02:11.090> we're<00:02:11.870> going<00:02:12.049> to<00:02:12.170> take<00:02:12.709> a

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
paid it at all now we're going to take a

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.949 
paid it at all now we're going to take a
version<00:02:13.159> of<00:02:13.340> that<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:13.790> little<00:02:14.150> more<00:02:14.299> advanced

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
version of that a little more advanced

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.289 
version of that a little more advanced
and<00:02:15.110> we're<00:02:15.500> going<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.650> go<00:02:15.860> instead<00:02:16.849> of<00:02:16.970> going

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
and we're going to go instead of going

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.830 
and we're going to go instead of going
up<00:02:17.510> here<00:02:18.110> we're<00:02:19.040> just<00:02:19.069> going<00:02:19.549> to<00:02:19.670> play<00:02:20.180> this

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
up here we're just going to play this

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.210 
up here we're just going to play this
actually<00:02:21.200> isn't<00:02:21.349> all<00:02:21.560> that<00:02:21.620> much<00:02:21.829> more

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
actually isn't all that much more

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.979 
actually isn't all that much more
difficult<00:02:22.459> than<00:02:22.760> what<00:02:22.939> I<00:02:22.970> just<00:02:23.060> did<00:02:23.540> we're

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
difficult than what I just did we're

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.649 
difficult than what I just did we're
playing<00:02:24.349> the<00:02:24.560> root<00:02:24.769> of<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:24.920> chord<00:02:25.220> here<00:02:25.700> and

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:26.659 
playing the root of the chord here and

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:29.979 
playing the root of the chord here and
then<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.079> two<00:02:28.030> upper<00:02:29.030> notes<00:02:29.239> of<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.480> C<00:02:29.690> chord

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
then the two upper notes of the C chord

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.710 
then the two upper notes of the C chord
which<00:02:30.200> are<00:02:30.409> E<00:02:30.709> and<00:02:30.980> G<00:02:31.220> right<00:02:31.519> so<00:02:32.180> right<00:02:32.510> there

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
which are E and G right so right there

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.780 
which are E and G right so right there
when<00:02:32.870> I<00:02:32.900> move<00:02:33.200> around<00:02:33.409> much<00:02:33.650> and<00:02:33.920> then<00:02:34.040> we<00:02:34.159> pop

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
when I move around much and then we pop

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.289 
when I move around much and then we pop
down<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.209> the<00:02:35.599> fifth<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:36.470> then<00:02:37.280> we<00:02:37.430> bring<00:02:38.239> that

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
down to the fifth and then we bring that

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.809 
down to the fifth and then we bring that
back<00:02:38.480> up<00:02:38.900> so<00:02:39.109> it's<00:02:39.769> the<00:02:40.189> root<00:02:40.370> of<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.519> chord

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
back up so it's the root of the chord

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.000 
back up so it's the root of the chord
the<00:02:41.540> third<00:02:41.810> of<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.079> fist<00:02:42.290> of<00:02:42.379> the<00:02:42.440> chord<00:02:42.739> and

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
the third of the fist of the chord and

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.390 
the third of the fist of the chord and
then<00:02:43.819> the<00:02:44.090> lower<00:02:44.299> fifth<00:02:44.690> down<00:02:44.930> here<00:02:45.319> and<00:02:46.159> we<00:02:46.280> go

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
then the lower fifth down here and we go

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:53.800 
then the lower fifth down here and we go
back<00:02:46.549> up<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:46.940> this<00:02:51.609> most<00:02:52.609> of<00:02:52.849> the<00:02:52.970> baseline<00:02:53.540> in

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
back up to this most of the baseline in

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.280 
back up to this most of the baseline in
stride<00:02:54.379> piano<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:55.159> and<00:02:55.400> ragtime<00:02:56.329> piano<00:02:56.840> is

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
stride piano and and ragtime piano is

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.530 
stride piano and and ragtime piano is
root<00:02:57.680> to<00:02:58.069> the<00:02:58.099> fifth<00:02:58.670> sometimes<00:02:59.269> it's

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
root to the fifth sometimes it's

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.690 
root to the fifth sometimes it's
sometimes<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:00.530> go<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:00.739> the<00:03:01.010> third<00:03:01.280> as<00:03:01.639> a

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
sometimes you go to the third as a

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.860 
sometimes you go to the third as a
transition<00:03:02.629> to<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:02.870> next<00:03:03.109> chord<00:03:04.540> most<00:03:05.540> times

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
transition to the next chord most times

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.490 
transition to the next chord most times
root<00:03:06.170> fits<00:03:06.560> or<00:03:06.829> fifth<00:03:07.099> root<00:03:08.049> okay<00:03:09.049> so<00:03:09.109> the

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
root fits or fifth root okay so the

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.129 
root fits or fifth root okay so the
first<00:03:09.680> version<00:03:09.920> we<00:03:10.250> had<00:03:10.459> was<00:03:10.639> this<00:03:14.139> second

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:15.139 
first version we had was this second

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:21.159 
first version we had was this second
second<00:03:15.829> option<00:03:16.160> is<00:03:16.310> this<00:03:19.720> okay<00:03:20.720> you<00:03:20.780> ready<00:03:21.079> for

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
second option is this okay you ready for

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:24.009 
second option is this okay you ready for
the<00:03:21.500> more<00:03:21.650> difficult<00:03:21.829> one<00:03:22.310> that<00:03:22.579> is<00:03:23.449> you<00:03:23.750> play

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
the more difficult one that is you play

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.409 
the more difficult one that is you play
the<00:03:24.169> root<00:03:24.349> of<00:03:24.440> the<00:03:24.530> chord<00:03:24.769> and<00:03:25.340> then<00:03:25.970> you<00:03:26.150> pop

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:26.419 
the root of the chord and then you pop

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:29.470 
the root of the chord and then you pop
up<00:03:26.449> here<00:03:27.139> and<00:03:27.349> play<00:03:27.590> some<00:03:28.239> inversion<00:03:29.239> of<00:03:29.329> the

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
up here and play some inversion of the

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.420 
up here and play some inversion of the
chord<00:03:29.780> of<00:03:29.930> a<00:03:30.019> C<00:03:30.230> chord<00:03:30.440> so<00:03:30.739> we<00:03:30.889> could<00:03:31.040> play<00:03:31.190> like

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
chord of a C chord so we could play like

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.300 
chord of a C chord so we could play like
this

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
this

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.220 
this
or<00:03:33.940> we<00:03:34.060> have<00:03:34.209> the<00:03:34.330> third<00:03:34.540> at<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:34.690> bottom<00:03:35.020> and

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
or we have the third at the bottom and

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.800 
or we have the third at the bottom and
the<00:03:35.620> fence<00:03:35.860> the<00:03:36.040> throat<00:03:36.280> or<00:03:36.550> plate<00:03:37.030> up<00:03:37.150> here<00:03:37.450> so

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
the fence the throat or plate up here so

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.470 
the fence the throat or plate up here so
if<00:03:37.870> you<00:03:37.930> go<00:03:38.050> like<00:03:38.140> this<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:39.370> then<00:03:40.060> we<00:03:40.150> play<00:03:40.330> the

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
if you go like this and then we play the

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.230 
if you go like this and then we play the
fifth<00:03:40.780> let<00:03:41.650> me<00:03:41.709> go<00:03:41.830> back<00:03:42.069> leg<00:03:42.459> or<00:03:42.670> whatever

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
fifth let me go back leg or whatever

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.510 
fifth let me go back leg or whatever
inversion<00:03:43.840> you've<00:03:44.080> chosen<00:03:44.440> whatever<00:03:44.980> form<00:03:45.340> of

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
inversion you've chosen whatever form of

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.500 
inversion you've chosen whatever form of
the<00:03:45.640> chord<00:03:45.880> that<00:03:45.970> your<00:03:46.090> plan<00:03:46.270> that<00:03:46.300> you've

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
the chord that your plan that you've

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.809 
the chord that your plan that you've
chosen<00:03:46.660> just<00:03:47.260> just<00:03:47.770> repeat<00:03:48.220> that<00:03:48.250> don't

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
chosen just just repeat that don't

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.370 
chosen just just repeat that don't
change<00:03:49.180> that<00:03:49.420> it<00:03:49.600> gets<00:03:49.750> a<00:03:49.840> little<00:03:49.930> confusing

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
change that it gets a little confusing

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.860 
change that it gets a little confusing
so<00:03:50.650> start<00:03:51.340> with<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:51.550> root<00:03:51.760> and<00:03:52.060> there's<00:03:52.540> a<00:03:52.600> C

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
so start with the root and there's a C

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.520 
so start with the root and there's a C
chord<00:03:53.080> and<00:03:53.410> the<00:03:54.060> fifth<00:03:55.060> and<00:03:55.390> through<00:03:56.230> it<00:03:56.440> again

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
chord and the fifth and through it again

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.250 
chord and the fifth and through it again
like<00:03:56.920> that<00:03:57.360> some<00:03:58.360> left<00:03:58.630> hand<00:03:58.870> is<00:03:58.959> really

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
like that some left hand is really

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.630 
like that some left hand is really
bouncing<00:03:59.800> around<00:03:59.890> you<00:04:00.130> got<00:04:00.280> to<00:04:00.310> know<00:04:00.520> your

we're<00:04:22.390> going<00:04:22.510> to<00:04:22.750> an<00:04:22.840> F<00:04:23.020> chord

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.650 

see<00:04:31.960> we<00:04:32.860> did<00:04:32.980> that<00:04:33.100> whole<00:04:33.220> thing<00:04:33.280> again<00:04:33.910> with

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
see we did that whole thing again with

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:48.080 
see we did that whole thing again with
the<00:04:35.200> the<00:04:35.980> next<00:04:36.540> Waypoint<00:04:37.540> which<00:04:37.780> would<00:04:37.900> be

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.430 

right<00:04:49.090> up<00:04:49.240> here<00:04:49.450> you<00:04:50.230> can<00:04:50.380> see<00:04:50.410> it<00:04:51.690> back<00:04:52.690> to<00:04:53.080> see

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
right up here you can see it back to see

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.830 
right up here you can see it back to see
and<00:04:54.100> then<00:04:54.370> the<00:04:54.490> little<00:04:55.150> more<00:04:55.270> difficult

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
and then the little more difficult

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:12.599 
and then the little more difficult
output<00:04:56.320> moving<00:04:56.800> up<00:04:56.920> a<00:04:57.010> notch<00:04:57.220> would<00:04:57.550> be

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:12.609 

00:05:12.609 --> 00:05:13.839 

okay

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:13.849 
okay

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:16.689 
okay
so<00:05:14.149> I<00:05:14.179> am<00:05:14.479> a<00:05:14.869> little<00:05:15.769> difficulty<00:05:16.579> without

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:16.699 
so I am a little difficulty without

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:21.279 
so I am a little difficulty without
myself<00:05:16.999> so<00:05:17.689> yeah<00:05:19.539> if<00:05:20.539> you<00:05:20.629> really<00:05:20.929> want<00:05:21.109> to<00:05:21.199> get

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
myself so yeah if you really want to get

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.039 
myself so yeah if you really want to get
more<00:05:21.499> difficult<00:05:22.039> you<00:05:22.279> can<00:05:22.549> add<00:05:22.849> a<00:05:23.149> full<00:05:23.509> octave

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:24.049 
more difficult you can add a full octave

00:05:24.049 --> 00:05:25.899 
more difficult you can add a full octave
to<00:05:24.199> the<00:05:24.259> left<00:05:24.499> hand<00:05:24.799> which<00:05:24.979> is<00:05:25.009> what<00:05:25.189> Fats

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:25.909 
to the left hand which is what Fats

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:28.059 
to the left hand which is what Fats
Waller<00:05:26.089> did<00:05:26.599> a<00:05:26.629> lot<00:05:26.869> of<00:05:26.899> which<00:05:27.139> was<00:05:27.379> instead<00:05:28.009> of

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:28.069 
Waller did a lot of which was instead of

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:32.169 
Waller did a lot of which was instead of
just<00:05:28.279> plain<00:05:29.379> sure<00:05:30.379> he<00:05:30.649> did<00:05:30.829> the<00:05:30.949> octave<00:05:31.909> of<00:05:32.029> the

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:32.179 
just plain sure he did the octave of the

00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:37.899 
just plain sure he did the octave of the
scene<00:05:34.629> and<00:05:35.629> really<00:05:36.229> moving<00:05:36.559> around<00:05:36.859> what<00:05:37.789> you

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:37.909 
scene and really moving around what you

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:39.939 
scene and really moving around what you
want<00:05:38.119> to<00:05:38.209> do<00:05:38.329> is<00:05:38.569> of<00:05:38.719> course<00:05:38.749> and<00:05:39.289> I<00:05:39.439> always<00:05:39.619> I

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:39.949 
want to do is of course and I always I

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:44.109 
want to do is of course and I always I
always<00:05:41.259> say<00:05:42.259> this<00:05:42.529> is<00:05:42.709> to<00:05:43.279> practice<00:05:43.489> that<00:05:43.819> left

00:05:44.109 --> 00:05:44.119 
always say this is to practice that left

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:46.539 
always say this is to practice that left
hand<00:05:44.389> by<00:05:44.659> itself<00:05:44.989> you<00:05:45.799> really<00:05:46.069> need<00:05:46.279> to<00:05:46.369> do

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:46.549 
hand by itself you really need to do

00:05:46.549 --> 00:05:49.539 
hand by itself you really need to do
that<00:05:46.579> and<00:05:47.089> then<00:05:47.749> then<00:05:48.649> you<00:05:48.769> add<00:05:48.889> the<00:05:49.039> melody<00:05:49.399> to

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:49.549 
that and then then you add the melody to

00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:51.669 
that and then then you add the melody to
it<00:05:49.699> you're<00:05:50.359> going<00:05:50.479> to<00:05:50.569> find<00:05:50.869> of<00:05:51.109> course<00:05:51.409> that

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:51.679 
it you're going to find of course that

00:05:51.679 --> 00:05:54.009 
it you're going to find of course that
when<00:05:51.799> you<00:05:51.949> add<00:05:52.159> the<00:05:52.339> melody<00:05:52.819> to<00:05:52.999> it<00:05:53.029> that

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:54.019 
when you add the melody to it that

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:55.509 
when you add the melody to it that
that's<00:05:54.169> a<00:05:54.349> whole<00:05:54.499> other<00:05:54.649> ball<00:05:54.919> game<00:05:54.949> in<00:05:55.339> terms

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:55.519 
that's a whole other ball game in terms

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:57.279 
that's a whole other ball game in terms
of<00:05:55.729> coordination<00:05:56.449> on<00:05:56.629> the<00:05:56.719> left<00:05:56.899> in<00:05:57.049> the<00:05:57.109> right

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:57.289 
of coordination on the left in the right

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:59.949 
of coordination on the left in the right
hand<00:05:57.589> that's<00:05:58.219> why<00:05:58.579> the<00:05:59.119> left<00:05:59.419> hand<00:05:59.629> needs<00:05:59.869> to

00:05:59.949 --> 00:05:59.959 
hand that's why the left hand needs to

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:03.549 
hand that's why the left hand needs to
be<00:06:00.049> totally<00:06:00.799> secure<00:06:01.609> and<00:06:02.329> comfortable<00:06:02.929> before

00:06:03.549 --> 00:06:03.559 
be totally secure and comfortable before

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:04.569 
be totally secure and comfortable before
you're<00:06:03.679> adding<00:06:03.949> the<00:06:04.009> right<00:06:04.189> hand<00:06:04.429> because

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:04.579 
you're adding the right hand because

00:06:04.579 --> 00:06:06.579 
you're adding the right hand because
usually<00:06:04.699> the<00:06:04.969> right<00:06:05.149> hand<00:06:05.419> melody<00:06:05.869> has<00:06:06.379> some

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:06.589 
usually the right hand melody has some

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:08.409 
usually the right hand melody has some
syncopation<00:06:07.279> to<00:06:07.429> its<00:06:07.609> playing<00:06:07.879> off<00:06:08.029> the<00:06:08.209> beat

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
syncopation to its playing off the beat

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:10.419 
syncopation to its playing off the beat
and<00:06:08.599> you<00:06:09.199> need<00:06:09.409> to<00:06:09.499> be<00:06:09.619> able<00:06:09.739> to<00:06:09.889> keep<00:06:10.159> this

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:10.429 
and you need to be able to keep this

00:06:10.429 --> 00:06:12.849 
and you need to be able to keep this
this<00:06:10.819> is<00:06:10.999> your<00:06:11.149> foundation<00:06:11.329> right<00:06:11.989> providing

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:12.859 
this is your foundation right providing

00:06:12.859 --> 00:06:15.309 
this is your foundation right providing
the<00:06:12.949> pulse<00:06:13.219> the<00:06:13.879> bass<00:06:14.119> and<00:06:14.479> the<00:06:14.809> harmony<00:06:15.199> it's

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:15.319 
the pulse the bass and the harmony it's

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:17.139 
the pulse the bass and the harmony it's
a<00:06:15.439> lot<00:06:15.739> that's<00:06:16.039> happening<00:06:16.519> down<00:06:16.579> there

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:17.149 
a lot that's happening down there

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:21.129 
a lot that's happening down there
okay<00:06:18.249> so<00:06:19.249> there's<00:06:20.149> another<00:06:20.389> technique<00:06:20.869> for

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:21.139 
okay so there's another technique for

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:23.889 
okay so there's another technique for
you<00:06:21.349> to<00:06:22.159> use<00:06:22.339> for<00:06:22.369> the<00:06:22.669> left<00:06:22.879> hand<00:06:23.179> have<00:06:23.869> a

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:23.899 
you to use for the left hand have a

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:26.289 
you to use for the left hand have a
great<00:06:24.110> day
