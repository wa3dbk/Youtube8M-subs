motherboard this motherboard is based

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.599 
motherboard this motherboard is based
upon<00:00:45.289> the<00:00:45.590> Intel<00:00:46.129> 9<00:00:46.910> to<00:00:47.600> 5<00:00:48.309> chipset<00:00:49.309> it

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609 
upon the Intel 9 to 5 chipset it

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.970 
upon the Intel 9 to 5 chipset it
supports<00:00:50.149> the<00:00:50.420> latest<00:00:51.019> Intel<00:00:51.859> socket<00:00:52.579> 775

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
supports the latest Intel socket 775

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.340 
supports the latest Intel socket 775
CPUs<00:00:54.980> and<00:00:55.190> they<00:00:55.760> get<00:00:55.999> installed<00:00:56.420> right<00:00:56.929> here

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
CPUs and they get installed right here

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.649 
CPUs and they get installed right here
now<00:00:57.859> before<00:00:58.190> I<00:00:58.219> go<00:00:58.399> any<00:00:58.429> further<00:00:58.579> I'll<00:00:59.420> just

00:00:59.649 --> 00:00:59.659 
now before I go any further I'll just

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.680 
now before I go any further I'll just
show<00:01:00.230> you<00:01:00.260> here<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.370> difference<00:01:01.879> between<00:01:01.969> a

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
show you here the difference between a

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:10.750 
show you here the difference between a
socket<00:01:04.089> 478<00:01:05.380> CPU<00:01:06.380> and<00:01:06.620> a<00:01:07.130> socket<00:01:07.780> 775<00:01:09.550> you<00:01:10.550> can

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
socket 478 CPU and a socket 775 you can

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.750 
socket 478 CPU and a socket 775 you can
see<00:01:11.000> that<00:01:11.630> on<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:11.900> socket<00:01:12.170> 478<00:01:12.650> there<00:01:13.610> are

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
see that on the socket 478 there are

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.150 
see that on the socket 478 there are
pins<00:01:14.120> well<00:01:15.050> on<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:15.590> socket<00:01:16.360> 775<00:01:17.890> there<00:01:18.890> is

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
pins well on the socket 775 there is

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.900 
pins well on the socket 775 there is
none<00:01:19.430> rather<00:01:20.360> there<00:01:20.960> are<00:01:20.990> pins<00:01:21.410> on<00:01:21.910> the

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
none rather there are pins on the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.310 
none rather there are pins on the
motherboard<00:01:23.300> instead<00:01:24.050> of<00:01:24.380> on<00:01:25.310> the<00:01:26.210> CPU<00:01:26.900> now

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
motherboard instead of on the CPU now

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.630 
motherboard instead of on the CPU now
let's<00:01:27.500> have<00:01:27.620> a<00:01:27.710> closer<00:01:27.980> look<00:01:28.280> at<00:01:28.460> this

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
let's have a closer look at this

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.430 
let's have a closer look at this
motherboard<00:01:28.970> well<00:01:29.390> right<00:01:29.660> here<00:01:29.990> is<00:01:30.140> where<00:01:30.290> the

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
motherboard well right here is where the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.130 
motherboard well right here is where the
socket<00:01:30.890> 775<00:01:31.310> CPU<00:01:32.270> gets<00:01:32.420> installed<00:01:32.930> now

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
socket 775 CPU gets installed now

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.860 
socket 775 CPU gets installed now
there's<00:01:33.350> a<00:01:33.410> plastic<00:01:34.070> protective<00:01:34.730> plate<00:01:35.090> over

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
there's a plastic protective plate over

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.810 
there's a plastic protective plate over
it<00:01:36.320> as<00:01:36.530> you<00:01:36.890> can<00:01:37.010> see<00:01:37.070> well<00:01:37.520> you<00:01:37.550> need<00:01:37.730> to

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
it as you can see well you need to

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.170 
it as you can see well you need to
remove<00:01:38.180> that<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:38.810> then<00:01:39.290> install<00:01:39.710> the<00:01:39.980> CPU<00:01:40.190> you

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
remove that and then install the CPU you

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.950 
remove that and then install the CPU you
can<00:01:41.330> put<00:01:41.510> up<00:01:41.600> to<00:01:41.630> four<00:01:42.110> gigs<00:01:42.590> of<00:01:42.950> dual-channel

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
can put up to four gigs of dual-channel

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.790 
can put up to four gigs of dual-channel
ddr2<00:01:44.960> memory<00:01:45.730> right<00:01:46.730> here<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.960> regular<00:01:48.320> IDE

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
connection is right here floppy right

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.020 
connection is right here floppy right
here<00:01:51.560> there<00:01:51.740> are<00:01:51.860> four<00:01:52.160> serial<00:01:52.760> ata

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
here there are four serial ata

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.940 
here there are four serial ata
connections<00:01:53.570> right<00:01:53.780> here<00:01:54.110> and<00:01:54.290> this<00:01:54.710> board

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
connections right here and this board

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.480 
connections right here and this board
does<00:01:55.370> do<00:01:55.930> raid<00:01:56.930> there<00:01:57.470> are<00:01:57.560> also<00:01:57.680> two<00:01:58.070> PCI

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
does do raid there are also two PCI

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.220 
does do raid there are also two PCI
slots<00:01:58.910> as<00:01:59.120> well<00:01:59.150> as<00:01:59.650> 116<00:02:00.650> times<00:02:01.210> PCI<00:02:02.230> Express

slot<00:02:03.650> right<00:02:04.400> here<00:02:04.670> there<00:02:05.180> are<00:02:05.300> five<00:02:05.540> fan

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
slot right here there are five fan

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.139 
slot right here there are five fan
headers<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:06.620> this<00:02:06.920> one<00:02:07.100> here<00:02:07.340> is<00:02:07.370> taken<00:02:07.820> up<00:02:07.940> by

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
headers and this one here is taken up by

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.200 
headers and this one here is taken up by
the<00:02:08.599> Northbridge<00:02:09.789> heatsink<00:02:10.789> here<00:02:10.970> you<00:02:11.060> can

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
the Northbridge heatsink here you can

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.840 
the Northbridge heatsink here you can
see<00:02:11.420> this<00:02:11.600> heatsink<00:02:12.080> also<00:02:12.410> has<00:02:12.560> a<00:02:12.590> fan<00:02:13.070> right

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
see this heatsink also has a fan right

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.010 
see this heatsink also has a fan right
here<00:02:14.270> this

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
here this

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.950 
here this
where<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.320> CPU<00:02:16.190> fan<00:02:17.030> would<00:02:17.390> get<00:02:17.600> connected

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
where the CPU fan would get connected

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.530 
where the CPU fan would get connected
and<00:02:18.350> you<00:02:18.800> have<00:02:18.950> three<00:02:19.220> more<00:02:19.430> fan<00:02:19.970> headers<00:02:20.300> one

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
and you have three more fan headers one

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.410 
and you have three more fan headers one
right<00:02:20.720> here<00:02:21.020> one<00:02:21.680> right<00:02:21.710> here<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.520> one<00:02:23.120> right

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
right here one right here and one right

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.720 
right here one right here and one right
here<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:24.470> there<00:02:24.710> are<00:02:24.740> two<00:02:25.040> main<00:02:25.340> power

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
here and there are two main power

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.310 
here and there are two main power
