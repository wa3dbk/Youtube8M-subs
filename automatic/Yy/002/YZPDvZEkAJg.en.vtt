now<00:00:00.450> we're<00:00:00.599> going<00:00:00.780> to<00:00:00.930> look<00:00:01.079> at<00:00:01.260> validating

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
now we're going to look at validating

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.079 
now we're going to look at validating
emails<00:00:03.020> now<00:00:04.020> this<00:00:04.259> is<00:00:04.500> a<00:00:04.529> very<00:00:05.339> simple<00:00:05.819> task

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
emails now this is a very simple task

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.030 
emails now this is a very simple task
that<00:00:06.270> some<00:00:06.690> people<00:00:07.020> like<00:00:07.200> to<00:00:07.230> make<00:00:07.379> difficult

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
that some people like to make difficult

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.060 
that some people like to make difficult
for<00:00:08.660> whatever<00:00:09.660> reason<00:00:10.290> I<00:00:10.440> don't<00:00:10.530> know<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:10.920> be

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
for whatever reason I don't know to be

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.289 
for whatever reason I don't know to be
honest<00:00:12.200> here's<00:00:13.200> why<00:00:13.410> did<00:00:13.799> I<00:00:14.009> created<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.820> valid

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
honest here's why did I created a valid

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.269 
honest here's why did I created a valid
email<00:00:15.480> variable<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.440> I<00:00:16.560> assigned<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.250> a

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
email variable and I assigned it to a

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.240 
email variable and I assigned it to a
valid<00:00:17.850> email<00:00:18.210> then<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:18.869> created<00:00:19.260> an<00:00:19.619> invalid

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
valid email then I created an invalid

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.830 
valid email then I created an invalid
email<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.789> assigned<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.300> hello<00:00:21.720> world

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
email and assigned it to hello world

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.300 
email and assigned it to hello world
which<00:00:22.650> obviously<00:00:23.100> isn't<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.820> valid<00:00:24.000> email<00:00:24.269> and

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
which obviously isn't a valid email and

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.029 
which obviously isn't a valid email and
then<00:00:26.310> created<00:00:26.760> its<00:00:27.000> valid<00:00:27.480> which<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.619> equal<00:00:28.949> to

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
then created its valid which is equal to

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.130 
then created its valid which is equal to
Craig<00:00:29.310> match<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.760> may<00:00:29.880> have<00:00:30.029> this<00:00:30.269> super<00:00:30.990> long

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
Craig match I may have this super long

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.700 
Craig match I may have this super long
regular<00:00:31.710> expression<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.600> then<00:00:33.600> we<00:00:34.140> pass<00:00:34.440> in

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
regular expression and then we pass in

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.490 
regular expression and then we pass in
the<00:00:35.010> valid<00:00:35.370> email<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.020> below<00:00:37.020> here<00:00:37.290> we're

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
the valid email and below here we're

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.410 
the valid email and below here we're
just<00:00:37.530> saying<00:00:38.190> if<00:00:38.430> it's<00:00:38.579> valid<00:00:38.760> echo<00:00:39.059> valid

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
just saying if it's valid echo valid

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.410 
just saying if it's valid echo valid
email<00:00:39.540> provided<00:00:39.989> else<00:00:40.410> blah<00:00:40.739> blah<00:00:40.890> blah<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.820> if

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
email provided else blah blah blah so if

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.590 
email provided else blah blah blah so if
we<00:00:42.660> go<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.840> our<00:00:42.989> browser<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.850> they<00:00:44.850> refresh<00:00:45.270> we

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
we go to our browser and they refresh we

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.510 
we go to our browser and they refresh we
get<00:00:45.750> valid<00:00:46.140> email<00:00:46.500> provided<00:00:46.860> which<00:00:47.340> is

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
get valid email provided which is

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.690 
get valid email provided which is
correct<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.539> valid<00:00:49.050> email<00:00:49.280> if<00:00:50.280> we<00:00:50.460> pass

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
correct this is a valid email if we pass

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.479 
correct this is a valid email if we pass
in<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.149> variable<00:00:51.600> instead<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.860> invalid

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
in this variable instead so invalid

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.939 
in this variable instead so invalid
email<00:00:53.670> we're<00:00:54.570> going<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.899> get<00:00:55.079> invalidating

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
email we're going to get invalidating

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.459 
email we're going to get invalidating
your<00:00:56.010> provided<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.629> fine<00:00:57.899> everything

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
your provided so this is fine everything

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.560 
your provided so this is fine everything
is<00:00:58.559> working<00:00:58.949> right<00:01:00.260> well<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.920> works<00:01:02.449> but<00:01:03.449> it's

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
is working right well it works but it's

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.130 
is working right well it works but it's
not<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.899> way<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.320> would<00:01:04.409> go<00:01:04.619> about<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:06.140> not

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
not the way that I would go about it not

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.399 
not the way that I would go about it not
only<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.950> super<00:01:08.909> super<00:01:09.630> unreadable

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
only is this super super unreadable

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.550 
only is this super super unreadable
but<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.310> also<00:01:11.490> makes<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.330> difference<00:01:12.960> in<00:01:13.200> speed

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
but it also makes a difference in speed

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.310 
but it also makes a difference in speed
it's<00:01:13.860> not<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.340> super<00:01:15.000> significant<00:01:15.840> speed

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
it's not a super significant speed

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.410 
it's not a super significant speed
difference<00:01:16.680> but<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.610> does<00:01:17.670> make<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.000> difference

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
difference but it does make a difference

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.359 
difference but it does make a difference
especially<00:01:18.900> if<00:01:19.530> you're<00:01:19.710> running<00:01:19.860> running

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
especially if you're running running

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.260 
especially if you're running running
more<00:01:20.820> than<00:01:20.880> one<00:01:21.060> expression<00:01:22.729> so<00:01:23.729> I'm<00:01:23.880> going<00:01:24.090> to

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
more than one expression so I'm going to

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.719 
more than one expression so I'm going to
replace<00:01:24.869> all<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:25.560> with<00:01:26.159> just<00:01:26.369> one

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
replace all of this with just one

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.760 
replace all of this with just one
function<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.659> we're<00:01:27.930> not<00:01:28.049> going<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.350> use<00:01:28.530> any

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
function and we're not going to use any

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.399 
function and we're not going to use any
regular<00:01:29.310> expression<00:01:29.759> at<00:01:29.850> all<00:01:30.200> so<00:01:31.200> we're<00:01:31.290> going

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
regular expression at all so we're going

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.109 
regular expression at all so we're going
to<00:01:31.530> say<00:01:31.650> filter<00:01:32.040> var<00:01:32.220> we're<00:01:32.430> going<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.700> pass<00:01:32.909> in

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
to say filter var we're going to pass in

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.999 
to say filter var we're going to pass in
the<00:01:33.150> email<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.869> then<00:01:34.409> we're<00:01:34.530> going<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.770> pass

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
the email and then we're going to pass

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.730 
the email and then we're going to pass
in<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.340> constant<00:01:35.880> filter<00:01:36.689> validate<00:01:37.079> email<00:01:37.530> and

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
in a constant filter validate email and

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.550 
in a constant filter validate email and
this<00:01:38.340> tells<00:01:38.579> PHP<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.270> we<00:01:39.570> want<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.869> check<00:01:40.320> if

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
this tells PHP that we want to check if

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.580 
this tells PHP that we want to check if
this<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:41.040> an<00:01:41.220> email<00:01:41.659> so<00:01:42.659> now<00:01:42.869> let's<00:01:43.170> go<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.470> a

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
this is an email so now let's go to a

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.130 
this is an email so now let's go to a
browser<00:01:43.829> hit<00:01:44.220> refresh<00:01:44.360> valid<00:01:45.360> email<00:01:45.780> provided

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
browser hit refresh valid email provided

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.370 
browser hit refresh valid email provided
perfect<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.460> valid<00:01:47.820> email<00:01:48.170> replace<00:01:49.170> it

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
perfect this is a valid email replace it

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.249 
perfect this is a valid email replace it
with<00:01:49.500> invalid<00:01:50.070> email<00:01:50.280> refresh<00:01:51.110> invalid<00:01:52.110> email

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
with invalid email refresh invalid email

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.190 
with invalid email refresh invalid email
provided<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.090> much<00:01:54.450> more<00:01:54.780> clean

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
provided so this is a much more clean

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.609 
provided so this is a much more clean
much<00:01:55.920> more<00:01:56.159> readable<00:01:56.610> much<00:01:57.170> faster<00:01:58.170> way<00:01:58.350> of
