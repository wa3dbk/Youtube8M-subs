00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.740 
one that's closed in one set two
repulsor<00:02:42.630> hand

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
repulsor hand

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.210 
repulsor hand
also<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.870> painter<00:02:45.260> I<00:02:45.290> think<00:02:45.739> it's<00:02:45.950> really

let's go to the articulation

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.860 
let's go to the articulation
articulation<00:03:00.700> well<00:03:01.700> first<00:03:01.970> off<00:03:02.209> the<00:03:02.420> head<00:03:02.599> can

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
articulation well first off the head can

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.800 
articulation well first off the head can
move<00:03:02.900> will<00:03:03.440> open<00:03:03.860> up<00:03:04.010> you<00:03:05.000> actually<00:03:05.360> do<00:03:05.540> you

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
the side and the repulsor hands you can

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:39.759 
the side and the repulsor hands you can
kind<00:03:38.510> of<00:03:38.569> make<00:03:38.720> to<00:03:38.900> look<00:03:39.110> like<00:03:39.260> a<00:03:39.380> repulsor

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
kind of make to look like a repulsor

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:46.140 
kind of make to look like a repulsor
blasts<00:03:40.010> and<00:03:40.280> you<00:03:40.370> can<00:03:40.519> see<00:03:43.030> kind<00:03:44.030> of<00:03:44.120> like<00:03:44.180> that

on<00:04:03.970> to<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.269> legs<00:04:04.480> cuz<00:04:04.930> that's<00:04:05.500> really<00:04:05.709> all<00:04:06.280> we

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
on to the legs cuz that's really all we

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.960 
on to the legs cuz that's really all we
need<00:04:06.700> a<00:04:06.730> cover<00:04:07.890> so<00:04:08.890> you<00:04:09.340> can<00:04:09.489> see<00:04:09.640> right<00:04:09.760> there

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
need a cover so you can see right there

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.000 
need a cover so you can see right there
the<00:04:10.090> looks<00:04:10.299> can't<00:04:10.750> actually<00:04:10.989> move<00:04:11.500> and<00:04:11.830> make

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
the looks can't actually move and make

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.009 
the looks can't actually move and make
it<00:04:12.129> Bend<00:04:12.489> so<00:04:12.790> maybe<00:04:13.239> like<00:04:14.459> its<00:04:15.459> head<00:04:15.580> fell<00:04:15.790> off

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
it Bend so maybe like its head fell off

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.500 
it Bend so maybe like its head fell off
but<00:04:17.019> I'm<00:04:17.139> still<00:04:17.380> fine<00:04:17.699> so<00:04:18.699> it<00:04:19.000> was<00:04:19.180> kind<00:04:19.359> of<00:04:19.419> way

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
but I'm still fine so it was kind of way

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.990 
but I'm still fine so it was kind of way
to<00:04:19.540> put<00:04:19.780> on<00:04:19.900> the<00:04:20.019> head<00:04:20.169> the<00:04:20.320> end<00:04:20.639> but<00:04:21.639> anyways

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
to put on the head the end but anyways

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.230 
to put on the head the end but anyways

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
so can see the foot can move bend it a

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.860 
so can see the foot can move bend it a
little<00:04:25.419> bit<00:04:25.600> you<00:04:25.960> know<00:04:26.050> also<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:26.710> leg<00:04:26.919> has

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
more than one part of articulation you

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.640 
more than one part of articulation you
can<00:04:30.550> see<00:04:30.699> right<00:04:30.850> there<00:04:31.320> just<00:04:32.320> give<00:04:32.530> me<00:04:32.620> a

basically<00:04:47.740> the<00:04:47.889> same<00:04:48.070> leg<00:04:48.310> but<00:04:48.490> still<00:04:48.669> it's<00:04:48.789> a

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
basically the same leg but still it's a

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.900 
basically the same leg but still it's a
pretty<00:04:49.030> awesome<00:04:49.120> figure<00:04:50.639> just<00:04:51.639> what<00:04:51.820> they

pretty awesome figure just what they

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.150 
pretty awesome figure just what they
could<00:04:52.060> have<00:04:52.150> done<00:04:52.270> better<00:04:52.330> is<00:04:52.870> to<00:04:52.900> release<00:04:53.590> you
