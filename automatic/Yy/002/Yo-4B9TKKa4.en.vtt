Nova shuttle I'm seeing possibilities to
maybe<00:01:48.240> even<00:01:48.509> do<00:01:48.780> like<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:49.079> shuttle<00:01:49.530> without

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:49.709 
maybe even do like a shuttle without

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:52.309 
maybe even do like a shuttle without
using<00:01:50.189> modded<00:01:50.729> parts<00:01:51.090> which<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.479> awesome<00:01:51.810> I

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
with it especially at night with the

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.790 
with it especially at night with the
lights<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.420> stuff<00:02:12.660> i<00:02:12.900> would<00:02:13.230> like<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.590> see

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
lights and stuff i would like to see

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.030 
lights and stuff i would like to see
like<00:02:14.130> sort<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.180> like<00:02:15.380> landing<00:02:16.380> lights<00:02:16.620> kind<00:02:16.950> of

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
like sort of like landing lights kind of

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.740 
like sort of like landing lights kind of
thing<00:02:17.220> as<00:02:17.400> your

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
thing as your

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.030 
thing as your
me<00:02:17.810> in<00:02:17.960> that<00:02:18.140> would<00:02:18.230> be<00:02:18.320> really<00:02:18.470> cool<00:02:18.740> but

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
me in that would be really cool but

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.310 
me in that would be really cool but
that's<00:02:19.610> you<00:02:20.270> know<00:02:20.300> whatever<00:02:20.780> that's<00:02:21.050> for<00:02:21.260> the

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
that's you know whatever that's for the

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.380 
that's you know whatever that's for the
future<00:02:21.620> I<00:02:21.650> guess<00:02:21.820> another<00:02:22.820> thing<00:02:23.000> I<00:02:23.060> really

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
future I guess another thing I really

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.710 
future I guess another thing I really
like<00:02:23.720> about<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:24.740> rover<00:02:25.400> wheels<00:02:25.670> is<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.570> way

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
like about the rover wheels is the way

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.390 
like about the rover wheels is the way
they<00:02:26.900> behave<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:27.500> where<00:02:27.620> they<00:02:27.710> operate<00:02:27.860> as

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
they behave and where they operate as

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.510 
they behave and where they operate as
far<00:02:28.670> as<00:02:28.790> requiring<00:02:29.240> power<00:02:29.690> and<00:02:30.140> I<00:02:31.070> think<00:02:31.400> it's

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
far as requiring power and I think it's

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.010 
far as requiring power and I think it's
a<00:02:31.580> really<00:02:31.760> good<00:02:31.850> system<00:02:32.360> and<00:02:32.510> I<00:02:32.540> can't<00:02:32.780> wait<00:02:32.930> to

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
a really good system and I can't wait to

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.680 
a really good system and I can't wait to
try<00:02:33.200> them<00:02:33.410> out<00:02:33.560> in<00:02:33.860> other<00:02:34.190> planets<00:02:34.970> in<00:02:35.150> other

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
try them out in other planets in other

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.750 
try them out in other planets in other
locations<00:02:36.220> so<00:02:37.220> if<00:02:37.430> you've<00:02:37.550> been<00:02:37.700> following

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
locations so if you've been following

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.270 
locations so if you've been following
along<00:02:38.390> in<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.840> development<00:02:39.440> in<00:02:39.560> this<00:02:39.740> game<00:02:40.010> if

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
along in the development in this game if

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.220 
along in the development in this game if
you've<00:02:40.850> been<00:02:40.970> watching<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.630> Kerbal<00:02:42.200> space

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
you've been watching the Kerbal space

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.530 
you've been watching the Kerbal space
program<00:02:42.470> twitch<00:02:43.190> TV<00:02:43.400> channel<00:02:43.880> you've<00:02:44.030> seen<00:02:44.510> a

to highlight it in this video anyways

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.120 
to highlight it in this video anyways
because<00:02:47.690> some<00:02:47.900> of<00:02:47.930> you<00:02:48.110> may<00:02:48.260> have<00:02:48.290> not<00:02:48.620> seen<00:02:48.950> it

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
because some of you may have not seen it

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.030 
because some of you may have not seen it
so<00:02:50.060> this<00:02:50.209> is<00:02:50.270> a<00:02:50.420> new<00:02:50.690> launch<00:02:51.110> platform<00:02:51.800> and

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
so this is a new launch platform and

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.550 
so this is a new launch platform and
they've<00:02:52.640> redone<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.180> entire<00:02:53.720> area<00:02:53.750> there's

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
they've redone the entire area there's

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.620 
they've redone the entire area there's
no<00:02:54.800> longer<00:02:55.220> like<00:02:55.489> when<00:02:55.670> you<00:02:55.760> walk<00:02:55.940> across<00:02:56.209> the

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
no longer like when you walk across the

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.750 
no longer like when you walk across the
field<00:02:56.900> around<00:02:57.709> the<00:02:58.040> area<00:02:58.340> with<00:02:58.459> the<00:02:58.550> launch

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
field around the area with the launch

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.580 
field around the area with the launch
pad<00:02:58.970> is<00:02:59.150> there's<00:02:59.330> like<00:02:59.510> no<00:02:59.720> clipping<00:03:00.050> anymore

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
pad is there's like no clipping anymore

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.060 
pad is there's like no clipping anymore

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
stuff is actually touching the ground

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.570 
stuff is actually touching the ground
here<00:03:05.930> and<00:03:05.959> the<00:03:06.410> collision<00:03:06.860> detection<00:03:07.190> seems

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
here and the collision detection seems

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.410 
here and the collision detection seems
to<00:03:07.670> be<00:03:07.790> quite<00:03:07.970> well<00:03:08.420> um<00:03:09.280> also<00:03:10.280> look<00:03:11.180> at<00:03:11.300> what

to be quite well um also look at what
they've<00:03:11.570> done<00:03:11.870> with<00:03:11.930> a<00:03:12.170> launch<00:03:12.620> pad<00:03:12.890> the

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
they've done with a launch pad the

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.770 
they've done with a launch pad the
launch<00:03:13.220> pad<00:03:13.459> is<00:03:13.580> excellent<00:03:14.239> now<00:03:14.420> you<00:03:14.480> can

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
launch pad is excellent now you can

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.900 
launch pad is excellent now you can
build<00:03:14.989> those<00:03:15.170> large<00:03:15.590> craft<00:03:15.980> without<00:03:16.489> having

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
build those large craft without having

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.250 
build those large craft without having
to<00:03:16.970> worry<00:03:17.180> about<00:03:17.239> that<00:03:17.660> launched<00:03:18.080> our

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
used and like looks like launches have

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.100 
used and like looks like launches have
been<00:03:29.870> going<00:03:30.110> on<00:03:30.230> which<00:03:30.799> is<00:03:30.950> really<00:03:31.190> cool<00:03:31.549> and

probably<00:03:38.540> well<00:03:38.810> aware<00:03:38.840> of<00:03:39.080> and<00:03:39.410> i<00:03:40.160> can

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
probably well aware of and i can

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
probably well aware of and i can
highlight<00:03:40.730> some<00:03:40.970> of<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.120> things<00:03:41.299> I've

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
highlight some of the things I've

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.940 
highlight some of the things I've
actually<00:03:41.630> been<00:03:41.810> doing<00:03:42.260> in<00:03:42.380> the<00:03:42.500> game<00:03:42.680> recently

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
actually been doing in the game recently

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.880 
actually been doing in the game recently
so<00:03:43.880> lately<00:03:44.390> I've<00:03:44.840> been<00:03:45.140> spending<00:03:45.470> a<00:03:45.680> lot<00:03:45.709> of

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
so lately I've been spending a lot of

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.370 
so lately I've been spending a lot of
time<00:03:46.040> in<00:03:46.519> the<00:03:46.640> core<00:03:46.970> game<00:03:47.269> and<00:03:47.540> I<00:03:47.570> haven't<00:03:48.260> been

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
time in the core game and I haven't been

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.780 
time in the core game and I haven't been
using<00:03:48.590> mods<00:03:48.950> and<00:03:49.190> I'm

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
using mods and I'm

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.890 
using mods and I'm
to<00:03:50.090> design<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:51.049> develop<00:03:51.200> a<00:03:51.819> large

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
to design and develop a large

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.509 
to design and develop a large
functioning<00:03:53.900> space<00:03:54.409> plane<00:03:54.739> that<00:03:55.010> can<00:03:55.189> lift

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
functioning space plane that can lift

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.819 
functioning space plane that can lift
off<00:03:55.760> from<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:56.090> runway<00:03:56.480> and<00:03:56.719> get<00:03:57.200> into<00:03:57.379> orbit

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
off from the runway and get into orbit

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.890 
off from the runway and get into orbit
and<00:03:58.069> I've<00:03:58.670> got<00:03:58.939> to<00:03:59.030> tell<00:03:59.239> you<00:03:59.299> this<00:03:59.569> is<00:03:59.780> an

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
and I've got to tell you this is an

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.170 
and I've got to tell you this is an
extremely<00:04:00.560> challenging<00:04:01.459> thing<00:04:01.700> to<00:04:01.849> do<00:04:02.000> in

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
extremely challenging thing to do in

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.080 
extremely challenging thing to do in
this<00:04:02.299> game<00:04:02.390> I've<00:04:02.750> really<00:04:03.230> been<00:04:03.849> I've<00:04:04.849> gone

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
this game I've really been I've gone

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.250 
this game I've really been I've gone
through<00:04:05.150> so<00:04:05.840> many<00:04:06.290> failures<00:04:07.060> so<00:04:08.060> this<00:04:08.810> is<00:04:09.019> one

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
through so many failures so this is one

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.099 
through so many failures so this is one
of<00:04:09.379> my<00:04:09.470> more<00:04:09.799> successful<00:04:09.970> versions<00:04:10.970> of<00:04:11.120> space

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
of my more successful versions of space

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.009 
of my more successful versions of space
plane<00:04:12.379> and<00:04:12.530> a<00:04:12.620> design<00:04:12.980> and<00:04:13.939> it<00:04:14.180> can<00:04:14.420> just

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
plane and a design and it can just

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.560 
plane and a design and it can just
almost<00:04:15.620> get<00:04:16.340> into<00:04:16.489> orbit<00:04:17.000> this<00:04:17.180> one<00:04:17.389> with

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
almost get into orbit this one with

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.020 
almost get into orbit this one with
probably<00:04:18.049> really<00:04:18.350> good<00:04:18.400> piloting<00:04:19.400> you<00:04:19.820> can

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
probably really good piloting you can

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.879 
probably really good piloting you can
get<00:04:20.239> it<00:04:20.359> into<00:04:20.509> orbit<00:04:21.049> and<00:04:21.229> pretty<00:04:21.470> much<00:04:21.530> run

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
get it into orbit and pretty much run

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.040 
get it into orbit and pretty much run
out<00:04:21.919> of<00:04:22.009> fuel<00:04:22.310> and<00:04:22.610> you'll<00:04:23.330> need<00:04:23.479> to<00:04:23.660> launch<00:04:23.900> a

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
out of fuel and you'll need to launch a

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.310 
out of fuel and you'll need to launch a
second<00:04:24.560> vehicle<00:04:24.740> up<00:04:25.250> there<00:04:25.460> to<00:04:26.060> try<00:04:26.599> to<00:04:26.630> refuel

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
second vehicle up there to try to refuel

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.150 
second vehicle up there to try to refuel
it<00:04:27.610> to<00:04:28.610> allow<00:04:28.820> it<00:04:28.940> to<00:04:29.000> do<00:04:29.210> anything<00:04:29.750> else<00:04:30.160> it

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
it to allow it to do anything else it

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.480 
it to allow it to do anything else it
came<00:04:31.430> into<00:04:31.699> orbit<00:04:32.210> I<00:04:32.360> just<00:04:33.250> you<00:04:34.250> know<00:04:34.280> is

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
came into orbit I just you know is

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.980 
came into orbit I just you know is
spending<00:04:34.820> a<00:04:34.880> lot<00:04:35.000> of<00:04:35.030> time<00:04:35.120> here<00:04:35.389> but<00:04:35.599> this

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
spending a lot of time here but this

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.350 
spending a lot of time here but this
one's<00:04:36.229> essentially<00:04:36.949> a<00:04:36.979> failure<00:04:37.400> to<00:04:37.639> because

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
one's essentially a failure to because

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.790 
one's essentially a failure to because
it<00:04:38.479> can't<00:04:38.690> do<00:04:38.900> any<00:04:38.930> of<00:04:39.199> the<00:04:39.320> things<00:04:39.380> that<00:04:39.770> I

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
it can't do any of the things that I

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.580 
it can't do any of the things that I
want<00:04:40.130> you<00:04:40.370> to<00:04:40.520> do<00:04:40.639> with<00:04:41.479> my<00:04:41.630> outline<00:04:42.050> design

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
want you to do with my outline design

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.370 
want you to do with my outline design
characteristics<00:04:43.479> so<00:04:44.479> one<00:04:44.900> of<00:04:44.930> the<00:04:45.139> main

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
characteristics so one of the main

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.650 
characteristics so one of the main
problems<00:04:45.410> I've<00:04:46.220> been<00:04:46.250> running<00:04:46.699> into<00:04:47.240> when

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
problems I've been running into when

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.110 
problems I've been running into when
developing<00:04:48.259> the<00:04:48.410> spacecraft<00:04:49.130> is<00:04:49.400> as<00:04:49.729> you<00:04:49.970> add

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
developing the spacecraft is as you add

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.140 
developing the spacecraft is as you add
more<00:04:50.180> and<00:04:50.750> more<00:04:51.169> weight<00:04:51.650> to<00:04:51.680> the<00:04:52.039> plane<00:04:52.370> it<00:04:52.729> has

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
more and more weight to the plane it has

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.450 
more and more weight to the plane it has
hold<00:04:53.599> it<00:04:53.870> has<00:04:54.169> a<00:04:54.199> really<00:04:54.560> hard<00:04:54.860> time<00:04:55.070> getting

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
hold it has a really hard time getting

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.490 
hold it has a really hard time getting
off<00:04:55.580> the<00:04:55.729> runway<00:04:56.150> and<00:04:56.360> those<00:04:56.810> speeds<00:04:57.139> need<00:04:57.380> to

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
off the runway and those speeds need to

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.320 
off the runway and those speeds need to
be<00:04:57.650> really<00:04:58.070> high<00:04:58.280> and<00:04:58.550> it<00:04:58.729> you<00:04:59.000> know<00:04:59.090> get<00:04:59.240> to

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
be really high and it you know get to

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.430 
be really high and it you know get to
the<00:04:59.389> point<00:04:59.599> where<00:04:59.810> you're<00:04:59.930> you're<00:05:00.229> like

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
the point where you're you're like

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.370 
the point where you're you're like
running<00:05:01.250> off<00:05:01.669> the<00:05:01.940> end<00:05:02.030> of<00:05:02.300> the<00:05:02.360> runway<00:05:02.659> and<00:05:03.169> I

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
running off the end of the runway and I

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.379 
running off the end of the runway and I
don't<00:05:03.860> look<00:05:04.039> at<00:05:04.159> that<00:05:04.220> as<00:05:04.490> a<00:05:04.520> successful<00:05:05.150> plane

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
don't look at that as a successful plane

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:07.089 
don't look at that as a successful plane
when<00:05:05.599> the<00:05:05.690> plane<00:05:05.900> can't<00:05:06.199> take<00:05:06.289> off<00:05:06.620> on<00:05:06.860> its<00:05:07.039> own

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099 
when the plane can't take off on its own

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:09.339 
when the plane can't take off on its own
you<00:05:07.669> know<00:05:08.330> without<00:05:08.449> hitting<00:05:08.810> that<00:05:08.990> that

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:09.349 
you know without hitting that that

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:11.620 
you know without hitting that that
bottom<00:05:09.650> part<00:05:10.039> of<00:05:10.099> the<00:05:10.159> runway<00:05:10.460> and<00:05:10.909> you<00:05:11.510> know

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
bottom part of the runway and you know

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.540 
bottom part of the runway and you know
it<00:05:12.050> takes<00:05:12.289> off<00:05:12.500> successfully<00:05:12.979> after<00:05:13.340> that

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
it takes off successfully after that

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.080 
it takes off successfully after that
that<00:05:14.300> in<00:05:14.570> my<00:05:14.720> mind<00:05:14.990> is<00:05:15.139> a<00:05:15.169> failure<00:05:15.820> anyway<00:05:16.820> I'm

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
that in my mind is a failure anyway I'm

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.330 
that in my mind is a failure anyway I'm
still<00:05:17.539> tinkering<00:05:17.840> away<00:05:18.229> with<00:05:18.500> designs<00:05:18.889> will

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
still tinkering away with designs will

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.830 
still tinkering away with designs will
see<00:05:19.580> what<00:05:19.729> I<00:05:19.760> come<00:05:19.940> up<00:05:20.000> with<00:05:20.150> but<00:05:20.479> let's<00:05:20.690> go

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
see what I come up with but let's go

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.480 
see what I come up with but let's go
ahead<00:05:20.870> and<00:05:21.110> move<00:05:21.289> forward<00:05:21.650> here<00:05:22.070> and<00:05:22.250> take<00:05:22.460> a

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
ahead and move forward here and take a

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.580 
ahead and move forward here and take a
look<00:05:22.729> at<00:05:22.970> one<00:05:23.240> of<00:05:23.270> the<00:05:23.449> real<00:05:23.840> cool<00:05:24.169> things

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
look at one of the real cool things

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.710 
look at one of the real cool things
about<00:05:24.830> the<00:05:25.400> new<00:05:25.550> version<00:05:26.050> 0.19<00:05:27.050> and<00:05:27.590> that<00:05:28.070> is

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
about the new version 0.19 and that is

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.519 
about the new version 0.19 and that is
re-entry<00:05:29.720> heat

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:30.529 
re-entry heat

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:33.309 
re-entry heat
this<00:05:31.249> is<00:05:31.519> such<00:05:31.909> a<00:05:31.939> cool<00:05:32.269> thing<00:05:32.329> now<00:05:32.929> at<00:05:33.139> this

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:33.319 
this is such a cool thing now at this

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:35.289 
this is such a cool thing now at this
moment<00:05:33.649> I<00:05:34.099> don't<00:05:34.459> believe<00:05:34.789> that<00:05:35.029> the<00:05:35.119> heat

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:35.299 
moment I don't believe that the heat

00:05:35.299 --> 00:05:37.269 
moment I don't believe that the heat
does<00:05:35.509> any<00:05:35.749> damage<00:05:35.839> to<00:05:36.289> any<00:05:36.559> of<00:05:36.679> the<00:05:36.739> parts<00:05:37.069> but

00:05:37.269 --> 00:05:37.279 
does any damage to any of the parts but

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:39.879 
does any damage to any of the parts but
i<00:05:37.339> believe<00:05:37.399> probably<00:05:38.029> in<00:05:38.089> the<00:05:38.149> future<00:05:38.889> you

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889 
i believe probably in the future you

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:41.109 
i believe probably in the future you
know<00:05:39.979> we're<00:05:40.129> gonna<00:05:40.219> have<00:05:40.429> to<00:05:40.549> be<00:05:40.849> worried

00:05:41.109 --> 00:05:41.119 
know we're gonna have to be worried

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:42.669 
know we're gonna have to be worried
about<00:05:41.209> heat<00:05:41.629> shields<00:05:42.139> and<00:05:42.289> that<00:05:42.409> sort<00:05:42.619> of

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:42.679 
about heat shields and that sort of

00:05:42.679 --> 00:05:45.399 
about heat shields and that sort of
thing<00:05:42.739> but<00:05:43.609> for<00:05:43.669> now<00:05:44.119> we<00:05:44.509> just<00:05:44.539> get<00:05:44.869> a<00:05:44.899> really

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:45.409
