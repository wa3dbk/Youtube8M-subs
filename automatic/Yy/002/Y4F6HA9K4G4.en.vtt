understandable I am just redoing it here
the<00:00:36.329> second<00:00:36.690> reason<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.739> have<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.660> full

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
the second reason is that I have a full

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.660 
the second reason is that I have a full

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
HD camera now which doesn't leave room

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.729 
HD camera now which doesn't leave room
for<00:00:41.700> any<00:00:42.090> error<00:00:42.180> but<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.260> will<00:00:43.440> be<00:00:43.559> better

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
for any error but it will be better

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.119 
for any error but it will be better
quality<00:00:44.219> better<00:00:44.640> lips<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.800> easier<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.980> follow

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
quality better lips and easier to follow

loaded up on the brush there instead of

loaded up on the brush there instead of

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
in the inner corner where it looks messy

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.810 
in the inner corner where it looks messy
and<00:01:03.510> gloopy<00:01:03.780> I've<00:01:04.500> use<00:01:04.830> short<00:01:05.159> little<00:01:05.430> strokes

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
and gloopy I've use short little strokes

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.820 
and gloopy I've use short little strokes
to<00:01:06.210> build<00:01:06.420> up<00:01:06.630> both<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.049> color<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.560> line

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
to build up both the color and line

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.330 
to build up both the color and line
thickness<00:01:08.490> really<00:01:08.880> easily

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.330 

as<00:01:13.609> I<00:01:14.570> go<00:01:14.780> in<00:01:14.929> towards<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:15.439> inner<00:01:15.679> corner<00:01:15.710> I

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
as I go in towards the inner corner I

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.969 
as I go in towards the inner corner I
make<00:01:16.670> sure<00:01:16.880> that<00:01:17.149> I<00:01:17.179> use<00:01:17.270> much<00:01:17.750> softer<00:01:18.380> shorter

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
make sure that I use much softer shorter

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.859 
make sure that I use much softer shorter
strokes<00:01:19.399> so<00:01:19.939> that<00:01:20.090> I<00:01:20.149> can<00:01:20.329> get<00:01:20.479> a<00:01:20.509> really

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
strokes so that I can get a really

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:30.090 
strokes so that I can get a really
really<00:01:20.899> precise<00:01:21.560> thin<00:01:22.069> line

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:48.380 

you

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.050 

next<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.380> just<00:01:49.410> extend<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.310> thicken<00:01:50.760> the<00:01:50.850> line

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
next I just extend and thicken the line

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.420 
next I just extend and thicken the line
to<00:01:51.330> my<00:01:51.540> liking<00:01:51.870> and<00:01:52.440> towards<00:01:53.160> the<00:01:53.280> outer

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
to my liking and towards the outer

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.280 
to my liking and towards the outer
corner<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.210> can<00:01:54.450> get<00:01:54.600> ready<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:55.020> do<00:01:55.140> the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
corner so I can get ready to do the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:03.539 
corner so I can get ready to do the
perfect<00:01:55.530> flick

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.639 

many<00:02:04.549> tutorials<00:02:05.299> I've<00:02:05.479> seen<00:02:05.780> advise<00:02:06.140> to<00:02:06.409> line

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
many tutorials I've seen advise to line

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.350 
many tutorials I've seen advise to line
up<00:02:06.829> the<00:02:06.950> angle<00:02:07.280> of<00:02:07.369> the<00:02:07.490> wing<00:02:07.700> with<00:02:07.909> the<00:02:07.939> bottom

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
up the angle of the wing with the bottom

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.600 
up the angle of the wing with the bottom
eyelid<00:02:08.599> I<00:02:08.959> find<00:02:09.500> this<00:02:09.619> angle<00:02:09.800> too<00:02:10.130> harsh<00:02:10.399> for

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
eyelid I find this angle too harsh for

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.309 
eyelid I find this angle too harsh for
my<00:02:10.700> eye<00:02:10.729> shape<00:02:11.150> so<00:02:11.390> I<00:02:11.420> make<00:02:11.690> it<00:02:11.720> more<00:02:12.019> shallow

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
my eye shape so I make it more shallow

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.199 
my eye shape so I make it more shallow
and<00:02:12.440> then<00:02:12.769> I<00:02:12.800> use<00:02:13.099> the<00:02:13.280> brush<00:02:13.459> to<00:02:13.640> print<00:02:13.910> a<00:02:14.000> line

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
and then I use the brush to print a line

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.000 
and then I use the brush to print a line
or<00:02:14.420> template<00:02:14.900> so<00:02:15.200> that<00:02:15.230> I<00:02:15.380> can<00:02:15.590> follow<00:02:15.800> it

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
or template so that I can follow it

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.570 
or template so that I can follow it
later

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
later

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.610 
later
finding<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.390> perfect<00:02:17.569> angle<00:02:18.080> will<00:02:18.260> depend<00:02:18.560> on

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
finding the perfect angle will depend on

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.990 
finding the perfect angle will depend on
your<00:02:18.739> eye<00:02:18.860> shape<00:02:19.130> so<00:02:19.400> it's<00:02:19.519> always<00:02:19.730> good<00:02:19.880> to

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
your eye shape so it's always good to

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.360 
your eye shape so it's always good to
play<00:02:20.090> around

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.960 

you

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970
