00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
enough to use the hot glue gun and you

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.560 
enough to use the hot glue gun and you
should<00:01:55.380> have<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.560> parent<00:01:56.039> with<00:01:56.069> you

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.469 

you

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.460 

glue<00:02:07.469> gun<00:02:07.829> so<00:02:08.759> don't<00:02:09.450> get<00:02:09.629> electrocuted<00:02:09.929> if

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
glue gun so don't get electrocuted if

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.369 
glue gun so don't get electrocuted if
you're<00:02:10.860> using<00:02:11.220> tape<00:02:11.760> here<00:02:12.569> are<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.780> steps<00:02:13.050> for

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
you're using tape here are the steps for

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:19.160 
you're using tape here are the steps for
that<00:02:13.620> first<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.760> put<00:02:15.300> these<00:02:15.480> over<00:02:16.640> and<00:02:18.170> then

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
that first you put these over and then

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.070 
that first you put these over and then
you<00:02:19.470> get<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.550> tape<00:02:21.410> about<00:02:22.410> this<00:02:22.650> guy

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.630 

and<00:02:25.830> then<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.490> like<00:02:26.880> hold<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:28.080> up<00:02:28.740> so<00:02:28.800> the

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
and then you like hold it up so the

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.320 
and then you like hold it up so the
sticky<00:02:30.120> side

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
sticky side

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:39.490 
sticky side
right<00:02:32.830> and<00:02:33.830> then<00:02:34.190> you<00:02:34.730> get<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.630> eye<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:38.500> you

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
right and then you get the eye and you

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.930 
right and then you get the eye and you
would<00:02:39.830> tape<00:02:40.730> it<00:02:40.970> like<00:02:41.000> this<00:02:42.220> and<00:02:43.220> then<00:02:43.610> you<00:02:43.730> put

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
would tape it like this and then you put

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.740 
would tape it like this and then you put
it<00:02:44.030> on<00:02:44.240> the<00:02:45.850> then<00:02:46.850> you<00:02:46.940> put<00:02:47.120> it<00:02:47.210> on<00:02:47.330> the<00:02:47.450> eye<00:02:47.480> of

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
it on the then you put it on the eye of

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.980 
it on the then you put it on the eye of
that<00:02:47.870> you're<00:02:48.050> using<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:48.920> then<00:02:49.700> you<00:02:49.910> put<00:02:50.840> the

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
that you're using and then you put the

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.210 
that you're using and then you put the
white<00:02:51.200> part<00:02:51.530> over<00:02:51.980> it<00:02:53.500> then<00:02:54.500> you<00:02:54.530> do<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.010> same

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
white part over it then you do the same

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:05.920 
white part over it then you do the same
thing<00:02:55.430> with<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:55.730> next<00:03:02.530> step<00:03:03.610> 9<00:03:04.640> you<00:03:05.600> should

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
thing with the next step 9 you should

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.340 
thing with the next step 9 you should
cut<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.920> white<00:03:07.310> edges<00:03:07.550> around<00:03:07.910> here<00:03:08.390> so<00:03:08.600> the

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
cut the white edges around here so the

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:19.820 
cut the white edges around here so the
white<00:03:09.530> doesn't<00:03:09.770> show<00:03:10.130> out<00:03:10.340> up<00:03:10.670> in<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.030> front

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.880 

and<00:03:20.280> that<00:03:21.150> is<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.510> correct<00:03:21.780> way<00:03:21.990> of<00:03:22.020> hash<00:03:22.410> you

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
and that is the correct way of hash you

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:45.360 
and that is the correct way of hash you
should<00:03:23.190> make<00:03:23.340> a<00:03:23.370> new<00:03:23.610> bi<00:03:23.790> thank<00:03:24.450> you

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.430 

you
