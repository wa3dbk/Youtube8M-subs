00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.920

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.120

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.010

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.760

 much nice to actually have that after a while 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.500

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.540

 ok i hear it seems through to the 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.300
 following all your number all this so 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.760

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.340

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.860
 euros 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.450
 I think we should send direct 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.380
 yes because there are certainly other nexus 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.730
 Broken 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.920
 holy shit we rot our own cook 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.870
 ear-gate polydaun which was normal 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.340
 Always be with you after the fashion closets 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.540
 have to wait long that is no longer it 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.070
 case 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.260
 but what they have to lot and service 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.910
 was a very nice back and no we go 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.459
 death boys die yes we die 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.650
 ok a trail this kit maria thinks 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.239
 I just a little nicer I know but to the 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.890
 jobs that just try to get hold of 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.050
 hopefully we ca n't go that fast 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.640
 possible on trying to get it but 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.560
 bot I think it's hard to handle all those 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.970
 in the jobs that are therefore therefore me 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.410
 think it gets a little harder 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.780
 next gate then you will be me 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.370
 if you see names there i go in everyone 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.950
 case for sure so keep joining us 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.150
 until I am a grandmother and then yes 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.010
 you in any case sense and the 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.840
 nexus goes all the way down guys already 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.400
 damage own costs gate ever 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.560
 probably well that's just there 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.300
 and one time you have super bad 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.459
 afterwards another good china 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.260
 the other times viewers are super bad 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.720
 until then lies just pure and the people 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.310
 who are in the jar this time 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.750
 it seems that all good people 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.930
 put on my breath because i think i am 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.549
 now on malabar that audio 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.950
 where we just already have an excuse 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.599
 can get broken with five or with 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.799
 how many men we were so soon that sun 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.719
 pretty fat 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.310
 but well 2 boys in the setai 

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:32.959
 one of the arches is not ears but according to 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.760
 I sit there for you, father 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.799
 but I always take the back then what 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.420
 the before and then yes they are all 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:41.870
 to the ven de without knowing that 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.459
 here is an entry so yes I always 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.739
 I think good news is much smarter 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.930
 personal but look yes the ever 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.000
 one because they don't really succeed 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.120
 come because of your barrier to 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.669
 jobs or the glow 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.079
 no it looks bad guys 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:58.519
 and I think they are right there 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.919
 ten or so because I think is 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.540
 Grace those ten men have the tractors 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:04.170
