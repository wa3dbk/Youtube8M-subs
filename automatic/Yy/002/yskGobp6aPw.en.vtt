kind<00:01:04.299> of<00:01:04.330> eyeball<00:01:04.750> this<00:01:04.960> make<00:01:05.199> sure<00:01:05.379> I'm

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
kind of eyeball this make sure I'm

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.620 
kind of eyeball this make sure I'm
centered<00:01:06.159> up<00:01:07.770> with<00:01:08.770> the<00:01:09.330> shaft<00:01:10.330> of<00:01:10.600> the

centered up with the shaft of the
steering<00:01:10.900> column<00:01:11.049> I<00:01:11.430> get<00:01:12.430> that<00:01:12.580> as<00:01:12.729> tight<00:01:13.000> as<00:01:13.180> I

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
steering column I get that as tight as I

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.380 
steering column I get that as tight as I
can<00:01:13.330> by<00:01:13.900> hand<00:01:14.340> but<00:01:15.340> I<00:01:15.400> don't<00:01:15.580> use<00:01:15.790> any<00:01:16.000> actual

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
can by hand but I don't use any actual

can by hand but I don't use any actual
tools<00:01:16.720> on<00:01:16.990> the<00:01:17.110> forcing<00:01:17.530> screw<00:01:17.710> because<00:01:17.890> I

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
tools on the forcing screw because I

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.630 
tools on the forcing screw because I
don't<00:01:18.190> want<00:01:18.400> to<00:01:18.549> damage<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.960> shaft<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:21.430> the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
don't want to damage the shaft of the

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.219 
don't want to damage the shaft of the
steering<00:01:21.850> column<00:01:22.030> then<00:01:22.509> I'm<00:01:22.750> going<00:01:22.990> to<00:01:23.020> take<00:01:23.200> a

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
steering column then I'm going to take a

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.050 
steering column then I'm going to take a
big<00:01:23.470> puff<00:01:23.979> of<00:01:24.159> smoke<00:01:24.280> so<00:01:24.640> there's<00:01:24.820> probably

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
big puff of smoke so there's probably

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:32.190 
big puff of smoke so there's probably
going<00:01:25.180> to<00:01:25.240> be<00:01:25.330> a<00:01:25.390> big<00:01:25.600> cloud<00:01:25.840> coming<00:01:26.229> by<00:01:26.380> there

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.770 

don't<00:01:32.800> start<00:01:33.070> smoking<00:01:33.220> kids<00:01:33.790> it's<00:01:34.330> expensive

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
don't start smoking kids it's expensive

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:48.350 
don't start smoking kids it's expensive
and<00:01:35.110> bad<00:01:35.800> for<00:01:36.100> you

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.140 

okay<00:01:49.860> have<00:01:50.860> my<00:01:51.010> forcing<00:01:51.460> screw<00:01:51.670> tightened<00:01:52.090> up

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
okay have my forcing screw tightened up

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.270 
okay have my forcing screw tightened up
by<00:01:52.330> hand<00:01:52.660> I<00:01:52.980> had<00:01:53.980> these<00:01:54.190> two<00:01:54.390> side<00:01:55.390> screws

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
by hand I had these two side screws

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.030 
by hand I had these two side screws
tightened<00:01:57.280> up<00:01:57.370> by<00:01:57.520> hand<00:01:57.790> then<00:01:58.030> backed<00:01:58.720> off<00:01:59.040> one

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
tightened up by hand then backed off one

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.570 
tightened up by hand then backed off one
full<00:02:00.340> turn<00:02:01.410> now<00:02:02.410> I'm<00:02:02.500> just<00:02:02.680> going<00:02:02.890> to<00:02:03.100> start

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
full turn now I'm just going to start

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.530 
full turn now I'm just going to start
tightening<00:02:04.170> one<00:02:05.170> of<00:02:05.290> these<00:02:05.440> screws<00:02:06.480> kind<00:02:07.480> of

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
tightening one of these screws kind of

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.109 
tightening one of these screws kind of
keep<00:02:07.690> an<00:02:07.870> eye<00:02:07.990> on<00:02:08.290> the<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.490> forcing<00:02:09.910> screw

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
keep an eye on the the forcing screw

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.940 
keep an eye on the the forcing screw
make<00:02:10.300> sure<00:02:10.509> that<00:02:10.690> it's<00:02:10.950> centered<00:02:11.950> up<00:02:12.390> with<00:02:13.390> the

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
make sure that it's centered up with the

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.310 
make sure that it's centered up with the
shaft<00:02:14.950> of<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.220> steering<00:02:15.460> column<00:02:16.140> what<00:02:17.140> this

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
shaft of the steering column what this

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.590 
shaft of the steering column what this
does<00:02:17.530> is<00:02:17.710> it's<00:02:17.890> applying<00:02:18.220> kind<00:02:18.790> of<00:02:18.880> sideways

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
does is it's applying kind of sideways

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.820 
does is it's applying kind of sideways
pressure<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.110> it's<00:02:20.200> going<00:02:20.290> to<00:02:20.350> be<00:02:20.440> pulling

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
pressure and it's going to be pulling

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.110 
pressure and it's going to be pulling
this<00:02:21.010> side<00:02:21.250> of<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.490> steering<00:02:21.700> wheel<00:02:21.790> up

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
this side of the steering wheel up

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.840 
this side of the steering wheel up
instead<00:02:23.020> of<00:02:23.140> pulling<00:02:23.320> the<00:02:23.770> steering<00:02:24.550> wheel<00:02:24.700> up

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
instead of pulling the steering wheel up

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.590 
instead of pulling the steering wheel up
all<00:02:26.040> balanced<00:02:27.040> it's<00:02:27.850> kind<00:02:28.090> of<00:02:28.120> cocking

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
all balanced it's kind of cocking

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.280 
all balanced it's kind of cocking
sideways<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.610> that<00:02:30.610> little<00:02:30.910> trick<00:02:31.720> makes<00:02:32.170> it

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
sideways and that little trick makes it

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.290 
sideways and that little trick makes it
so<00:02:32.440> much<00:02:32.590> easier<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:33.250> stake<00:02:33.880> this<00:02:34.090> steering

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
so much easier to stake this steering

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:45.420 
so much easier to stake this steering
wheel<00:02:34.420> off<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.980> easy<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:44.170> I'm<00:02:44.740> sure<00:02:44.950> some<00:02:45.250> of

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
wheel off that easy and I'm sure some of

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.070 
wheel off that easy and I'm sure some of
you<00:02:45.580> that<00:02:45.760> have<00:02:45.850> done<00:02:45.880> this<00:02:46.180> by<00:02:46.510> trying<00:02:46.840> to<00:02:46.959> use

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
you that have done this by trying to use

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.920 
you that have done this by trying to use
the<00:02:47.260> forcing<00:02:47.709> screw<00:02:48.040> you've<00:02:48.880> used<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.300> impact

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
the forcing screw you've used a impact

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.630 
the forcing screw you've used a impact
wrench<00:02:50.260> you've<00:02:50.620> used<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:50.950> break<00:02:51.160> over<00:02:51.340> bar

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
wrench you've used the break over bar

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
wrench you've used the break over bar
you<00:02:52.030> use<00:02:52.390> giant<00:02:53.170> amounts<00:02:53.830> of<00:02:53.950> torque<00:02:54.250> on<00:02:54.459> that

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
you use giant amounts of torque on that

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.900 
you use giant amounts of torque on that
forcing<00:02:55.660> screw<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:57.280> pull<00:02:57.489> that<00:02:57.610> steering
