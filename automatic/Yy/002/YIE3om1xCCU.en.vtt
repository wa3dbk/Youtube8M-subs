00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.800
 awakening will know at the level 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.990
 first 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.509
 they want to know kelly before they arrive 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:12.509
 they want to have no surprises and especially apple vs 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.539
 so seeing all that prepare them in time to dream and 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.409
 screaming to visualize the pieces to see what sows he does not like 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:23.380
 it is divided the rooms 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.579
 what to choose to the advanced 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:27.720
 they want to know because we live 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.140
 it's true that we have customers who even start at 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.950
 the last hour of exchanged preference 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.820
 because yes the commitments of the votes with the om 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.090
 our report 14h30 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.090
 these are well illustrated in value 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.590
 all around and people see well at the beach me I feel 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.000
 that since we did the others 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.170
 it is certain that we feel that the customers 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.530
 they want to reassure themselves 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.990
 spart1e life in general from where they will go so steal their 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.170
 small holidays 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.320
 so you have to look for a peaceful environment with the victory at the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.330
 nobody 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.700
 yes the quality of the game of defeat in the rooms 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.390
 catch different weapons 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.450
 there is a city if you places them with their charm and that it appeals to girls 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.190
 once the selection is better 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.920
 we find it the most interesting because it's true that when we click 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.900
 cracks 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.430
 the situation is particularly by a maximum of people 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.320
 and for that people could 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.979
 how do we prepare earth faster is here it's done 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:33.980
 mostly 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.420
 the fact of properly locating both times to pay attention to everything that 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.330
 there is also a return not just to the craftsman of the years 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.500
 and when you take no pleasure watching you play and who was not having 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.220
 been driven a video and 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.820
 they would have passed the pipes 2 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.859
 dany andrÃ©ani heller 

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:52.060
 obviously this summer 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.679
 but there is the best luck for which he brings others the vacationer 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.979
 I think it's a great solution it's us 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.789
 this season was well done it's a good solution it's a good approach 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.310
 common percent despite a modern approach 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.009
 in addition to religion 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.239
 putting this market is to give questions actually I think that's it 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:15.279
 which is important 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:17.630
 what I found on all these few years 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.650
 the videos are of excellent quality with a musical background 

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:26.259
 and I find that the cameraman was a familiar of the gites de france 3 who knows 

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:29.519
 what is needed so it was 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.870
 to value music how to do close-ups 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:38.219
 and how not to align all the parts we can see the volumes 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:42.319
 in my opinion that it still gives you 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.659
 one more if you want 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:49.359
 for gays no longer able to play in his bed and breakfast it gives a plus 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:52.679
 in my opinion whitney mandated the videos m 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:57.069
 how not to be forced to come because it's all this at once 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.040
 and I think this as for the video at 0 really a big plus compared 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.200
 to this problem we see the video 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.369
 so that immediately puts in reinforcement 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:10.639
 in a holiday context I think it already allows others what 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:14.729
 is totally in the holidays it is very quickly amortized together more what 

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:15.839
 we can do for rent
