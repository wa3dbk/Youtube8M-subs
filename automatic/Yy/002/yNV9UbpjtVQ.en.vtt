interesting<00:02:52.220> also<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.549> fact<00:02:53.819> that<00:02:53.970> there<00:02:54.329> is

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
interesting also the fact that there is

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.199 
interesting also the fact that there is
only<00:02:54.450> about<00:02:54.989> five<00:02:55.650> mansions<00:02:56.310> I<00:02:56.430> can<00:02:56.849> clearly

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
only about five mansions I can clearly

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.259 
only about five mansions I can clearly
see<00:02:57.540> from<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.989> hub<00:02:58.170> world<00:02:58.470> well<00:02:59.370> who<00:02:59.940> knows<00:03:00.209> if

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
see from the hub world well who knows if

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.690 
see from the hub world well who knows if
there<00:03:00.750> are<00:03:00.959> actually<00:03:01.560> eight<00:03:01.739> or<00:03:01.980> even<00:03:02.010> seven

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
there are actually eight or even seven

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.350 
there are actually eight or even seven
or<00:03:02.910> six<00:03:03.150> but<00:03:04.079> five<00:03:04.739> I<00:03:05.130> guess<00:03:05.430> is<00:03:05.640> good<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.209> just

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
or six but five I guess is good it just

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.210 
or six but five I guess is good it just
depends<00:03:06.870> on<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.079> size<00:03:07.290> of<00:03:07.680> these<00:03:07.829> mansions

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
depends on the size of these mansions

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.240 
depends on the size of these mansions
and<00:03:08.760> it's<00:03:09.420> been<00:03:09.599> rumored<00:03:09.989> that<00:03:10.170> each<00:03:10.709> mansion

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
and it's been rumored that each mansion

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.850 
and it's been rumored that each mansion
is<00:03:11.400> about<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.269> same<00:03:12.510> size<00:03:12.569> of<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.620> first

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
is about the same size of the first

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.000 
is about the same size of the first
mansion<00:03:14.340> from<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.329> original<00:03:16.200> Luigi's

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
mansion from the original Luigi's

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.090 
mansion from the original Luigi's
Mansion<00:03:17.120> so<00:03:18.120> I<00:03:18.510> mean<00:03:18.989> it<00:03:19.290> has<00:03:19.500> all<00:03:19.829> its

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
Mansion so I mean it has all its

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.000 
Mansion so I mean it has all its
gimmicks<00:03:20.819> each<00:03:21.090> one<00:03:21.450> has<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.959> different<00:03:22.049> feel

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
gimmicks each one has a different feel

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.910 
gimmicks each one has a different feel
and<00:03:23.359> gimmicks<00:03:24.359> to<00:03:24.450> them<00:03:24.810> so<00:03:25.139> I<00:03:25.380> guess<00:03:25.680> that's

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
and gimmicks to them so I guess that's

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.610 
and gimmicks to them so I guess that's
enough<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.400> hold<00:03:26.579> this<00:03:26.730> over<00:03:27.030> or<00:03:27.389> maybe<00:03:28.200> some

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
enough to hold this over or maybe some

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.670 
enough to hold this over or maybe some
other<00:03:28.829> mansions<00:03:29.370> come<00:03:29.850> on<00:03:30.000> like<00:03:30.239> there's

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
other mansions come on like there's

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.120 
other mansions come on like there's
probably<00:03:31.680> six<00:03:32.280> that<00:03:33.120> we<00:03:33.359> can<00:03:33.569> get<00:03:33.810> one<00:03:34.200> we<00:03:34.889> see

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
probably six that we can get one we see

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.509 
probably six that we can get one we see
all<00:03:35.280> these<00:03:35.519> ones<00:03:35.910> these<00:03:36.540> are<00:03:36.600> these<00:03:37.500> five<00:03:38.069> and

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
all these ones these are these five and

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.309 
all these ones these are these five and
then<00:03:38.639> there's<00:03:38.850> probably<00:03:39.269> another<00:03:39.750> one<00:03:40.079> that

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
then there's probably another one that

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.430 
then there's probably another one that
unlocks<00:03:41.250> later<00:03:42.120> in<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.600> game<00:03:42.810> may<00:03:43.200> be<00:03:43.260> the

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
unlocks later in the game may be the

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.860 
unlocks later in the game may be the
final<00:03:43.920> mansion<00:03:44.310> where<00:03:44.519> King<00:03:45.239> Boo<00:03:45.540> is
