be if you understand the risk involved

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.189 
be if you understand the risk involved
and<00:00:59.219> there<00:00:59.820> really<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.270> not<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> better<00:01:00.870> option

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
and there really is not a better option

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.920 
and there really is not a better option
which<00:01:01.739> doesn't<00:01:02.280> involve<00:01:02.520> physical<00:01:03.390> contact

can tell these gloves are pretty thin

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.679 
can tell these gloves are pretty thin
they're<00:01:32.729> not<00:01:32.880> going<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.060> be<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.420> much

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
they're not going to be that much

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.749 
they're not going to be that much
protection<00:01:34.439> but<00:01:34.799> they're<00:01:35.250> gonna<00:01:35.369> offer<00:01:35.579> a

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
protection but they're gonna offer a

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.719 
protection but they're gonna offer a
high<00:01:35.970> level<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.390> dexterity<00:01:37.070> as<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.460> can<00:01:38.579> see

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
high level of dexterity as you can see

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.399 
high level of dexterity as you can see
right<00:01:38.909> here<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.240> already<00:01:39.450> has<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.810> penetration

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
right here it already has a penetration

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.870 
right here it already has a penetration
through<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.189> they're<00:01:41.310> not<00:01:41.340> foolproof

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
through it so they're not foolproof

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.120 
through it so they're not foolproof
they're<00:01:42.450> probably<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.930> least<00:01:43.439> protective<00:01:43.979> we

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
they're probably the least protective we

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.920 
they're probably the least protective we
have<00:01:44.310> out<00:01:44.520> there<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:45.000> definitely<00:01:45.450> not<00:01:45.780> going

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
have out there and definitely not going

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.870 
have out there and definitely not going
to<00:01:45.990> be<00:01:46.079> offering<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.649> much<00:01:46.890> protection<00:01:47.490> from

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
to be offering that much protection from

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.420 
to be offering that much protection from
impact<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.079> one's<00:01:49.290> lined<00:01:49.500> with<00:01:49.680> Kevlar<00:01:50.159> -

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.620 
it's only covering our hand but it's a
little<00:02:01.920> bit<00:02:02.009> higher<00:02:02.310> than<00:02:02.520> aged<00:02:02.640> leather<00:02:03.090> it

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
little bit higher than aged leather it

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.670 
little bit higher than aged leather it
probably<00:02:03.960> gives<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.200> little<00:02:04.409> bit

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
probably gives a little bit

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.010 
probably gives a little bit
more<00:02:04.800> padding<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:05.400> there<00:02:05.610> but<00:02:05.850> again<00:02:06.120> it<00:02:06.810> does

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
more padding in there but again it does

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.960 
more padding in there but again it does
offer<00:02:07.230> some<00:02:07.350> puncture<00:02:08.070> resistance<00:02:08.610> but<00:02:08.789> not

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
offer some puncture resistance but not

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:09.650 
offer some puncture resistance but not
bomb-proof

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
bomb-proof

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.750 
bomb-proof
okay<00:02:10.020> this<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.320> just<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.649> pair<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:10.860> gloves<00:02:11.160> it's

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
okay this is just a pair of gloves it's

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.890 
okay this is just a pair of gloves it's
not<00:02:11.970> something<00:02:12.330> that's<00:02:12.390> gonna<00:02:12.540> be<00:02:12.720> really

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
not something that's gonna be really

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.080 
not something that's gonna be really
really<00:02:13.440> high-tech<00:02:13.770> that<00:02:14.610> doesn't<00:02:14.940> that's

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
really high-tech that doesn't that's

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.510 
really high-tech that doesn't that's
better<00:02:15.570> than<00:02:15.780> nothing<00:02:15.930> that's<00:02:16.260> for<00:02:16.440> sure<00:02:16.620> then

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
better than nothing that's for sure then

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.860 
better than nothing that's for sure then
we<00:02:17.610> move<00:02:17.760> up<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:18.000> line<00:02:18.150> here<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.570> little<00:02:18.720> bit

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
we move up the line here a little bit

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.600 
we move up the line here a little bit
more<00:02:19.470> protection<00:02:19.890> than<00:02:20.070> just<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.460> actual

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
more protection than just the actual

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.310 
more protection than just the actual
hand<00:02:21.150> we<00:02:21.660> have<00:02:21.780> something<00:02:22.110> here<00:02:22.260> that

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
hand we have something here that

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.500 
hand we have something here that
actually<00:02:22.680> offers<00:02:22.980> like<00:02:23.130> a<00:02:23.160> some<00:02:24.000> upper<00:02:24.300> arm

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
actually offers like a some upper arm

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.510 
actually offers like a some upper arm
protection<00:02:24.990> you'll<00:02:25.709> see<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.070> does<00:02:26.310> have

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
protection you'll see that does have

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.280 
protection you'll see that does have
this<00:02:26.730> leather<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:27.660> actually<00:02:27.780> has<00:02:28.050> this

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
this leather and it actually has this

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.510 
this leather and it actually has this
cool<00:02:28.530> little<00:02:28.680> feature<00:02:29.010> which<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.490> the

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
cool little feature which is the

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.550 
cool little feature which is the
deflector<00:02:30.180> it's<00:02:30.660> what<00:02:30.870> made<00:02:31.020> a<00:02:31.050> leather<00:02:31.350> as

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
deflector it's what made a leather as

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.380 
deflector it's what made a leather as
well<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:32.100> sometimes<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.700> dogs<00:02:32.910> will<00:02:33.090> grab<00:02:33.240> on

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
well and sometimes the dogs will grab on

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.240 
well and sometimes the dogs will grab on
to<00:02:33.570> that<00:02:33.720> rather<00:02:34.080> than<00:02:34.320> your<00:02:34.410> actual<00:02:34.709> fingers

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
to that rather than your actual fingers

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.880 
to that rather than your actual fingers
up<00:02:35.580> here<00:02:35.940> on<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.480> forearm<00:02:36.989> we<00:02:37.170> do<00:02:37.380> have<00:02:37.620> some

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
up here on the forearm we do have some

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.550 
up here on the forearm we do have some
actual<00:02:38.220> built-in<00:02:39.120> padding<00:02:39.660> so<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.380> dog

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
actual built-in padding so that the dog

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.930 
actual built-in padding so that the dog
did<00:02:40.830> fight<00:02:41.100> it<00:02:41.280> it's<00:02:41.459> not<00:02:41.640> going<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.850> be

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
did fight it it's not going to be

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.080 
did fight it it's not going to be
lighting<00:02:42.150> for<00:02:42.510> our<00:02:42.780> flesh<00:02:43.280> again<00:02:44.280> I<00:02:44.610> wouldn't

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
lighting for our flesh again I wouldn't

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.310 
lighting for our flesh again I wouldn't
say<00:02:45.209> this<00:02:45.330> is<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.570> highest<00:02:45.810> level<00:02:46.050> of

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
say this is the highest level of

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.100 
say this is the highest level of
protection<00:02:46.530> but<00:02:46.980> it's<00:02:47.100> better<00:02:47.310> than<00:02:47.430> nothing

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
protection but it's better than nothing

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.290 
protection but it's better than nothing
we<00:02:49.110> keep<00:02:49.320> moving<00:02:49.440> up<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.860> ladder<00:02:50.180> we<00:02:51.180> got

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
we keep moving up the ladder we got

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.760 
we keep moving up the ladder we got
something<00:02:51.690> here<00:02:51.720> again<00:02:52.170> that's<00:02:52.380> offering

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
something here again that's offering

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.790 
something here again that's offering
something<00:02:53.040> for<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.489> hand<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.180> upper<00:02:54.480> arm

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
something for the hand and the upper arm

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.610 
something for the hand and the upper arm
it<00:02:55.800> has<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.250> little<00:02:56.489> bit<00:02:56.730> lower<00:02:57.110> gauge<00:02:58.110> leather

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
it has a little bit lower gauge leather

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.550 
it has a little bit lower gauge leather
so<00:02:59.040> it<00:02:59.130> increases<00:02:59.520> the<00:02:59.910> dexterity<00:03:00.570> level<00:03:01.200> it

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
so it increases the dexterity level it

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.470 
so it increases the dexterity level it
has<00:03:01.739> this<00:03:01.920> deflector<00:03:02.580> though<00:03:02.760> which<00:03:03.120> is<00:03:03.150> nice

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
has this deflector though which is nice

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.000 
has this deflector though which is nice
most<00:03:03.840> dogs<00:03:04.110> this<00:03:04.350> is<00:03:04.470> probably<00:03:04.770> a<00:03:04.830> better

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
most dogs this is probably a better

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.160 
most dogs this is probably a better
deflector<00:03:05.580> than<00:03:05.760> this<00:03:05.940> one<00:03:06.239> so<00:03:06.750> most<00:03:06.959> dogs

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
deflector than this one so most dogs

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.780 
deflector than this one so most dogs
will<00:03:07.380> grab<00:03:07.590> this<00:03:07.739> before<00:03:08.220> they<00:03:08.370> actually<00:03:08.459> grab

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
will grab this before they actually grab

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.850 
will grab this before they actually grab
your<00:03:08.970> fingers<00:03:09.390> you<00:03:09.930> can<00:03:09.959> see<00:03:10.260> here<00:03:10.620> it's

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
your fingers you can see here it's

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.580 
your fingers you can see here it's
gotten<00:03:11.220> quite<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.459> lot<00:03:11.640> of<00:03:11.790> use<00:03:12.030> actually<00:03:12.989> made

we still got still got pretty injured
there<00:03:45.090> we<00:03:45.239> use<00:03:45.360> that<00:03:45.510> those<00:03:45.750> kind<00:03:45.989> of<00:03:46.049> gloves<00:03:46.260> a

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
there we use that those kind of gloves a

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.870 
there we use that those kind of gloves a
lot<00:03:46.590> like<00:03:46.890> when<00:03:47.040> we're<00:03:47.220> when<00:03:47.519> it's<00:03:47.670> just<00:03:47.850> like

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
lot like when we're when it's just like

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.000 
lot like when we're when it's just like
we<00:03:48.060> want<00:03:48.239> to<00:03:48.329> be<00:03:48.420> bette<00:03:48.660> better<00:03:48.690> safe<00:03:49.440> than<00:03:49.739> and

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
we want to be bette better safe than and

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.130 
we want to be bette better safe than and
sorry<00:03:50.250> we<00:03:50.549> still<00:03:50.790> get<00:03:50.910> a<00:03:50.940> lot<00:03:51.150> of<00:03:51.420> lot<00:03:52.110> of

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
sorry we still get a lot of lot of

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.600 
sorry we still get a lot of lot of
dexterity<00:03:52.620> with<00:03:52.950> those<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.459> nice

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
dexterity with those the nice

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.490 
dexterity with those the nice
improvement<00:03:54.150> from<00:03:54.360> this<00:03:54.900> globe<00:03:55.170> to<00:03:55.350> this

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
improvement from this globe to this

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.050 
improvement from this globe to this
glove<00:03:55.829> is<00:03:55.860> over<00:03:56.280> here<00:03:56.489> we<00:03:56.640> actually<00:03:56.670> have<00:03:56.970> a

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
glove is over here we actually have a

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.360 
glove is over here we actually have a
fight<00:03:57.360> bar<00:03:57.660> in<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:58.470> actual<00:03:58.829> upper<00:03:59.160> arm

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
fight bar in the actual upper arm

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.310 
fight bar in the actual upper arm
protection<00:03:59.910> which<00:04:00.060> helps<00:04:00.360> disperse<00:04:00.810> some<00:04:01.260> of

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
protection which helps disperse some of

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.530 
protection which helps disperse some of
the<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.980> force<00:04:02.280> from<00:04:02.519> an<00:04:02.700> actual<00:04:03.000> bite<00:04:03.329> so

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
the the force from an actual bite so

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.630 
the the force from an actual bite so
it's<00:04:03.690> not<00:04:03.840> going<00:04:04.049> to<00:04:04.110> have<00:04:04.290> that<00:04:04.530> that<00:04:05.340> initial

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
it's not going to have that that initial

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.570 
it's not going to have that that initial
resistance<00:04:08.640> or<00:04:09.090> pressure<00:04:09.360> in<00:04:09.480> one<00:04:09.780> specific

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
resistance or pressure in one specific

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.460 
resistance or pressure in one specific
it<00:04:11.000> helps<00:04:11.240> disperse<00:04:11.630> it<00:04:11.840> through<00:04:12.020> the<00:04:12.170> actual

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
it helps disperse it through the actual

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.760 
it helps disperse it through the actual
on<00:04:12.740> bite<00:04:13.160> bar<00:04:13.430> going<00:04:14.240> up<00:04:14.480> another<00:04:14.720> level<00:04:14.990> here

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
on bite bar going up another level here

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.259 
on bite bar going up another level here
we<00:04:15.980> kind<00:04:16.130> of<00:04:16.220> have<00:04:16.280> a<00:04:16.400> much<00:04:16.640> heavier<00:04:17.060> gauge

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
we kind of have a much heavier gauge

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.080 
we kind of have a much heavier gauge
leather<00:04:17.600> okay<00:04:17.840> it's<00:04:18.530> got<00:04:18.680> actual<00:04:19.070> it's<00:04:19.910> made

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
leather okay it's got actual it's made

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.270 
leather okay it's got actual it's made
of<00:04:20.209> to<00:04:20.390> pick<00:04:20.630> two<00:04:21.019> different<00:04:21.049> parts<00:04:21.680> there's

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
of to pick two different parts there's

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.580 
of to pick two different parts there's
an<00:04:22.400> actual<00:04:22.640> insert<00:04:23.210> and<00:04:23.480> an<00:04:23.720> inner<00:04:24.110> and<00:04:24.230> outer

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
an actual insert and an inner and outer

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.740 
an actual insert and an inner and outer
part<00:04:24.710> of<00:04:25.010> this<00:04:25.100> glove<00:04:25.430> it's<00:04:26.000> definitely<00:04:26.540> one

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
part of this glove it's definitely one

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.080 
part of this glove it's definitely one
of<00:04:26.780> the<00:04:26.900> more<00:04:27.110> padded<00:04:27.680> gloves<00:04:27.830> but<00:04:28.700> as<00:04:28.850> you<00:04:29.000> can

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
of the more padded gloves but as you can

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.120 
of the more padded gloves but as you can
see<00:04:29.150> like<00:04:29.750> nothing<00:04:30.140> else<00:04:30.320> it's<00:04:30.680> not<00:04:30.770> going<00:04:31.040> to

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
see like nothing else it's not going to

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.950 
see like nothing else it's not going to
be<00:04:31.190> bomb-proof<00:04:31.430> it's<00:04:32.000> got<00:04:32.150> a<00:04:32.180> huge<00:04:32.420> puncture

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
be bomb-proof it's got a huge puncture

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.870 
be bomb-proof it's got a huge puncture
and<00:04:33.080> it<00:04:33.170> here<00:04:33.440> it<00:04:33.860> actually<00:04:34.190> got<00:04:34.280> a<00:04:34.340> bit<00:04:34.580> pretty

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
and it here it actually got a bit pretty

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.720 
and it here it actually got a bit pretty
well<00:04:35.210> writing<00:04:35.840> up<00:04:35.930> in<00:04:36.170> my<00:04:36.350> own<00:04:36.500> in<00:04:36.740> my<00:04:36.890> um<00:04:37.100> my

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
well writing up in my own in my um my

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.670 
well writing up in my own in my um my
knuckle<00:04:38.090> here<00:04:38.270> by<00:04:38.420> a<00:04:38.450> relatively<00:04:38.930> small<00:04:39.050> dog

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
knuckle here by a relatively small dog

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.700 
knuckle here by a relatively small dog
like<00:04:40.370> 40<00:04:40.820> pounds<00:04:41.000> yeah<00:04:41.420> isn't<00:04:42.080> that<00:04:42.110> but<00:04:42.590> he

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
like 40 pounds yeah isn't that but he

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.530 
like 40 pounds yeah isn't that but he
definitely<00:04:43.160> had<00:04:43.310> some<00:04:43.580> big<00:04:43.790> canines<00:04:44.270> and<00:04:44.450> a

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
definitely had some big canines and a

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.710 
definitely had some big canines and a
lot<00:04:44.720> of<00:04:44.750> fury<00:04:45.140> when<00:04:45.410> he<00:04:45.470> actually<00:04:45.890> fit<00:04:46.720> again

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
lot of fury when he actually fit again

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.540 
lot of fury when he actually fit again
not<00:04:48.110> much<00:04:48.320> dexterity<00:04:49.040> you<00:04:49.130> can<00:04:49.250> see<00:04:49.400> there's

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
not much dexterity you can see there's

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.190 
not much dexterity you can see there's
only<00:04:49.640> actually<00:04:49.880> four<00:04:50.330> slots<00:04:50.630> four<00:04:50.870> fingers

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
only actually four slots four fingers

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.290 
only actually four slots four fingers
here<00:04:51.530> because<00:04:52.250> they<00:04:52.610> don't<00:04:52.790> expect<00:04:53.000> you<00:04:53.120> to<00:04:53.150> be

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
here because they don't expect you to be

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.850 
here because they don't expect you to be
using<00:04:53.600> your<00:04:53.720> fingertips<00:04:54.020> and<00:04:54.410> really

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
using your fingertips and really

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.000 
using your fingertips and really
manipulating<00:04:55.550> things<00:04:55.700> when<00:04:55.940> you<00:04:56.060> use<00:04:56.270> these

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
manipulating things when you use these

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.160 
manipulating things when you use these
again<00:04:58.010> it<00:04:58.160> has<00:04:58.310> upper<00:04:58.760> arm<00:04:59.000> protection<00:04:59.450> but

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
again it has upper arm protection but

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.720 
again it has upper arm protection but
again<00:05:00.410> there's<00:05:00.620> no<00:05:00.740> bite<00:05:00.980> bar<00:05:01.190> in<00:05:01.340> this<00:05:01.520> one

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
again there's no bite bar in this one

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.960 
again there's no bite bar in this one
it's<00:05:01.910> mostly<00:05:02.270> padding<00:05:03.670> and<00:05:04.670> when<00:05:04.820> we're<00:05:04.940> going

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
it's mostly padding and when we're going

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.180 
it's mostly padding and when we're going
for<00:05:05.390> more<00:05:05.540> protection<00:05:05.750> for<00:05:06.260> the<00:05:06.350> upper<00:05:06.650> arm<00:05:06.920> we

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
for more protection for the upper arm we

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.670 
for more protection for the upper arm we
have<00:05:07.220> something<00:05:07.760> called<00:05:07.940> gauntlets<00:05:08.600> this<00:05:09.410> one

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
have something called gauntlets this one

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.650 
have something called gauntlets this one
would<00:05:09.860> be<00:05:09.890> a<00:05:09.980> Kevlar<00:05:10.490> line<00:05:10.730> gauntlet<00:05:11.300> and<00:05:11.480> it

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
would be a Kevlar line gauntlet and it

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.030 
would be a Kevlar line gauntlet and it
actually<00:05:11.960> does<00:05:12.200> have<00:05:12.350> a<00:05:12.410> little<00:05:12.950> bit

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
actually does have a little bit

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.500 
actually does have a little bit
neighbouring<00:05:13.730> on<00:05:13.880> the<00:05:13.970> inside<00:05:14.330> of<00:05:14.420> the

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
neighbouring on the inside of the

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.960

bomb-proof<00:05:17.300> this<00:05:17.960> is<00:05:18.110> politically<00:05:18.740> thin<00:05:19.190> but

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
bomb-proof this is politically thin but

actually put a jacket over it or

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.240 
actually put a jacket over it or
something<00:05:33.290> it<00:05:33.380> still<00:05:33.650> wouldn't<00:05:33.919> be<00:05:34.040> totally

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
something it still wouldn't be totally
