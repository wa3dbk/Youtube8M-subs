00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
I'll move the camera back a bit so we

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.760 
I'll move the camera back a bit so we
can<00:00:36.899> have<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.079> quick<00:00:37.230> look<00:00:37.320> at<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.530> product

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
that you cannot picture-in-picture we'll

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.270 
that you cannot picture-in-picture we'll
have<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> look<00:01:04.589> at<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.799> when<00:01:04.920> we<00:01:04.949> get<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.189> open

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
have a look at that when we get it open

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.030 
have a look at that when we get it open
look<00:01:05.970> around<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.240> side<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.540> packaging

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
look around the side of the packaging

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.260 
look around the side of the packaging
tells<00:01:08.040> us<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.340> same<00:01:08.549> thing<00:01:08.729> about<00:01:08.790> LED

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
tells us the same thing about LED

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.480 
tells us the same thing about LED
dynamic<00:01:09.720> contrast<00:01:09.960> ratio<00:01:10.170> tells<00:01:11.010> us<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.250> model

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
dynamic contrast ratio tells us a model

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.850 
dynamic contrast ratio tells us a model
number<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.850> color<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.290> the<00:01:13.290> back<00:01:13.470> we<00:01:13.710> got

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
number in the color that the back we got

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.679 
number in the color that the back we got
the<00:01:13.920> same<00:01:14.130> thing<00:01:14.430> on<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.060> side<00:01:15.240> we've<00:01:15.479> got<00:01:15.509> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
the same thing on the side we've got the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.359 
the same thing on the side we've got the
same<00:01:15.869> thing<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.590> that's<00:01:16.710> pretty<00:01:16.890> much<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.250> for

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
same thing so that's pretty much it for

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.800 
same thing so that's pretty much it for
the<00:01:17.460> packaging<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.119> we'll<00:01:18.240> move<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.570> camera

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
the packaging so we'll move the camera

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.740 
the packaging so we'll move the camera
about<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.020> bit<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.380> we'll<00:01:19.590> get<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.400> out<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.549> box

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
about a bit and we'll get it out the box

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.179 
about a bit and we'll get it out the box
right<00:01:21.750> guess<00:01:21.930> up<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.439> camera<00:01:22.710> now<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:22.979> we<00:01:23.040> can

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
right guess up the camera now so we can

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.710 
right guess up the camera now so we can
have<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> little<00:01:23.520> look<00:01:23.700> at<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.000> product

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
have a little look at the product

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
have a little look at the product
hopefully<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> little<00:01:25.140> bit<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.350> want<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.590> get<00:01:25.680> out

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
hopefully a little bit I want to get out

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.880 
hopefully a little bit I want to get out
of<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.950> box<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.610> let's<00:01:27.259> not<00:01:28.259> wasting<00:01:28.650> my<00:01:28.740> time

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
of the box so let's not wasting my time

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:36.590 
of the box so let's not wasting my time
it<00:01:29.100> up<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.340> bottom<00:01:33.890> nice<00:01:35.240> simple<00:01:36.240> offering

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
it up in the bottom nice simple offering

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.840 
it up in the bottom nice simple offering
mechanism<00:01:37.079> on<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.560> think<00:01:37.619> too<00:01:38.430> fancy

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
mechanism on this and I think too fancy

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.429 
mechanism on this and I think too fancy
or<00:01:38.880> overly<00:01:39.750> complicated<00:01:41.930> so<00:01:42.930> as<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.110> open<00:01:43.409> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
or overly complicated so as you open the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.380 
or overly complicated so as you open the
box<00:01:43.649> on<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.280> top<00:01:44.460> lip<00:01:44.670> you've<00:01:44.880> actually<00:01:45.000> got<00:01:45.360> a

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
box on the top lip you've actually got a

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.819 
box on the top lip you've actually got a
set<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.720> mountain<00:01:46.049> instructions<00:01:46.590> for

mounting the base their different pivot
options<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.290> can<00:01:49.380> have<00:01:49.439> but<00:01:49.619> also<00:01:49.770> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
options that you can have but also the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.639 
options that you can have but also the
wall<00:01:50.670> mounting<00:01:50.970> options<00:01:51.329> which<00:01:51.899> will<00:01:52.110> confirm

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
wall mounting options which will confirm

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.209 
wall mounting options which will confirm
whether<00:01:52.950> it's<00:01:53.159> got<00:01:53.280> all<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.490> open<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.759> up<00:01:55.219> so

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
whether it's got all the open it up so

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.359 
whether it's got all the open it up so
we've<00:01:56.549> got<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:57.360> user<00:01:58.200> manual<00:01:58.380> now<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.159> first

you've<00:02:50.459> got<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:51.769> chiral<00:02:52.769> power<00:02:53.250> cable<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:53.850> that

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
you've got a chiral power cable and that

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.790 
you've got a chiral power cable and that
is<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:55.489> standard<00:02:56.489> three-pin<00:02:56.910> cat<00:02:57.390> lady<00:02:57.570> style

is a standard three-pin cat lady style

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:06.380 
is a standard three-pin cat lady style
once<00:02:58.800> we<00:02:58.920> got<00:02:59.010> that<00:02:59.160> we<00:03:00.470> have<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.739> VGA<00:03:02.040> lead<00:03:05.390> that

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
once we got that we have a VGA lead that

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:16.789 
once we got that we have a VGA lead that
seems<00:03:06.600> to<00:03:06.690> fit<00:03:06.810> for<00:03:06.989> cables<00:03:07.319> so<00:03:15.799> everything

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
seems to fit for cables so everything

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.110 
seems to fit for cables so everything
there<00:03:16.950> in<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.100> packaging<00:03:17.459> we've<00:03:17.640> got<00:03:17.880> a

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
there in the packaging we've got a

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:40.830 
there in the packaging we've got a
little<00:03:19.019> bass<00:03:19.230> slice<00:03:20.160> foot

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.949 

we've<00:03:41.840> got<00:03:42.019> the<00:03:42.139> actual<00:03:42.439> screen<00:03:42.709> itself<00:03:42.769> a

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
we've got the actual screen itself a

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.899 
we've got the actual screen itself a
little<00:03:44.959> bit<00:03:45.049> of<00:03:45.109> packing<00:03:45.260> in<00:03:45.530> there<00:03:45.760> to<00:03:46.760> keep

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909 
little bit of packing in there to keep

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:48.640 
little bit of packing in there to keep
that<00:03:47.090> mixer<00:03:47.480> in<00:03:47.689> transit<00:03:48.079> so<00:03:48.230> as<00:03:48.379> we<00:03:48.469> can<00:03:48.590> see

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
that mixer in transit so as we can see

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.220 
that mixer in transit so as we can see
that<00:03:49.189> the<00:03:49.310> high<00:03:49.519> mirror<00:03:49.790> finish<00:03:50.019> tells<00:03:51.019> us

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
that the high mirror finish tells us

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.280 
that the high mirror finish tells us
that<00:03:51.379> it's<00:03:51.680> led-backlit<00:03:52.569> so<00:03:53.569> if<00:03:53.840> we<00:03:53.959> just<00:03:54.109> look

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
that it's led-backlit so if we just look

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.479 
that it's led-backlit so if we just look
at<00:03:54.409> mounting<00:03:54.799> actual<00:03:55.159> stand<00:03:57.069> you<00:03:58.069> can<00:03:58.280> see

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
at mounting actual stand you can see

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:05.860 
at mounting actual stand you can see
they're<00:03:58.760> basically<00:03:59.750> just<00:04:00.560> clips<00:04:00.859> on<00:04:02.349> says<00:04:04.870> so

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
they're basically just clips on says so

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.770 
they're basically just clips on says so
it<00:04:05.959> clips<00:04:06.200> on<00:04:06.409> and<00:04:06.680> then<00:04:07.280> locks<00:04:07.519> into<00:04:07.730> place<00:04:07.969> so

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
it clips on and then locks into place so

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.899 
it clips on and then locks into place so
to<00:04:08.989> remove<00:04:09.349> that<00:04:09.620> again<00:04:09.889> there's<00:04:10.639> a<00:04:10.699> little

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:10.909 
to remove that again there's a little

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:12.369 
to remove that again there's a little
push<00:04:11.060> button<00:04:11.299> in<00:04:11.480> there<00:04:11.659> so<00:04:11.870> you<00:04:11.989> pop<00:04:12.169> that

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
push button in there so you pop that

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.429 
push button in there so you pop that
slide<00:04:13.099> back<00:04:13.310> up<00:04:13.519> got<00:04:14.329> this<00:04:14.419> little<00:04:14.659> adjuster

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:15.439 
slide back up got this little adjuster

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:20.140 
slide back up got this little adjuster
here<00:04:16.449> so<00:04:17.449> you<00:04:17.539> can<00:04:17.660> adjust<00:04:17.859> natural<00:04:19.060> angle<00:04:20.060> of

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
here so you can adjust natural angle of

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.300 
here so you can adjust natural angle of
