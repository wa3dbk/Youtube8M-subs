00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
my opinion you know they could have a

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.389 
my opinion you know they could have a
lot<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.050> space<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.440> move<00:00:49.739> around<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.340> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
lot of space to move around in the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.790 
lot of space to move around in the
underbelly<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.750> airplane<00:00:52.170> kind<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.649> like

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
underbelly of the airplane kind of like

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.260 
underbelly of the airplane kind of like
where<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.129> luggages<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.730> everything

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
where the luggages and everything

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.630

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
should be new characters in the zombie

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.679 
should be new characters in the zombie
map<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.920> characters<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.850> are<00:01:24.060> going<00:01:24.360> to

there's<00:01:33.420> not<00:01:33.600> reason<00:01:34.229> for<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.770> last<00:01:35.040> three

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460

with<00:02:20.170> these<00:02:20.680> motherfucking<00:02:21.550> zombies<00:02:22.120> on<00:02:22.510> this

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
with these motherfucking zombies on this

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.680 
with these motherfucking zombies on this
motherfuckin<00:02:23.709> plane<00:02:25.410> okay<00:02:27.390> it's<00:02:28.390> all<00:02:28.540> so

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
motherfuckin plane okay it's all so

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.650 
motherfuckin plane okay it's all so
stupid<00:02:28.930> but<00:02:29.230> that<00:02:29.470> is<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:32.230> best<00:02:32.470> quote<00:02:32.920> ever

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
stupid but that is the best quote ever

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.949 
stupid but that is the best quote ever
ok<00:02:34.660> this<00:02:34.989> map<00:02:35.320> is<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.280> be<00:02:36.850> made<00:02:37.120> ever<00:02:37.480> that<00:02:37.810> will

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
ok this map is to be made ever that will

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.520 
ok this map is to be made ever that will
be<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.410> best<00:02:38.680> quote<00:02:39.070> ever<00:02:39.310> in<00:02:39.640> my<00:02:40.380> opinion<00:02:41.380> and

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
be the best quote ever in my opinion and

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.900 
be the best quote ever in my opinion and
I<00:02:41.590> know<00:02:41.650> a<00:02:41.800> lot<00:02:42.040> of<00:02:42.070> people<00:02:42.370> are<00:02:42.459> gonna<00:02:42.580> agree

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
I know a lot of people are gonna agree

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.050 
I know a lot of people are gonna agree
with<00:02:43.000> me<00:02:43.360> so<00:02:43.680> you<00:02:44.680> know<00:02:44.800> this<00:02:45.010> map<00:02:45.370> could<00:02:45.760> take

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
with me so you know this map could take

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.500 
with me so you know this map could take
place<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:47.890> you<00:02:48.220> know<00:02:48.250> widen<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.940> area<00:02:49.269> of<00:02:49.420> the

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
place to you know widen the area of the

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.810 
place to you know widen the area of the
map<00:02:49.720> more<00:02:50.019> you<00:02:50.200> can<00:02:50.380> fly<00:02:50.709> outside<00:02:51.459> of<00:02:51.700> the

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
map more you can fly outside of the

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.580 
map more you can fly outside of the
plane<00:02:52.120> with<00:02:52.480> a<00:02:52.510> jet<00:02:53.019> pack

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
plane with a jet pack

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.690 
plane with a jet pack
and<00:02:53.680> if<00:02:54.459> you<00:02:54.610> fall<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.570> your<00:02:55.690> death<00:02:56.489> you<00:02:57.489> would

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
and if you fall to your death you would

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.540 
and if you fall to your death you would
die<00:02:57.910> because<00:02:58.450> you're<00:02:58.569> falling<00:02:58.930> to<00:02:59.140> your<00:02:59.170> death

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
die because you're falling to your death

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:07.110 
die because you're falling to your death
it<00:03:00.550> is<00:03:00.610> pretty<00:03:01.090> obvious<00:03:01.269> and<00:03:05.820> you<00:03:06.820> know<00:03:06.940> how

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
it is pretty obvious and you know how

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.060 
it is pretty obvious and you know how
the<00:03:07.180> Havas<00:03:07.720> zombies<00:03:08.230> are<00:03:08.410> going<00:03:08.530> to<00:03:08.620> come<00:03:08.860> on

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
the Havas zombies are going to come on

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.420 
the Havas zombies are going to come on
to<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.459> plane<00:03:09.820> that<00:03:09.850> is<00:03:10.360> a<00:03:10.739> mystery<00:03:11.739> but<00:03:12.220> you

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
to the plane that is a mystery but you

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.270 
to the plane that is a mystery but you
know<00:03:12.840> it

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
know it

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.569 
know it
zombies<00:03:15.280> in<00:03:16.049> involves<00:03:17.049> magic<00:03:17.769> and<00:03:17.950> stuff<00:03:18.250> so<00:03:18.549> I

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
zombies in involves magic and stuff so I

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.490 
zombies in involves magic and stuff so I
think<00:03:18.790> that<00:03:19.209> they<00:03:19.329> can<00:03:19.480> magically<00:03:19.870> teleport

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
think that they can magically teleport

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.920 
think that they can magically teleport
there<00:03:20.650> or<00:03:20.829> they<00:03:21.430> it<00:03:22.030> just<00:03:22.299> came<00:03:22.450> to<00:03:22.630> me<00:03:22.750> right

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
there or they it just came to me right

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.580 
there or they it just came to me right
now<00:03:22.959> there<00:03:23.829> could<00:03:24.100> be<00:03:24.130> a<00:03:24.280> teleporter<00:03:25.120> on<00:03:25.590> the

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
now there could be a teleporter on the

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.590 
now there could be a teleporter on the
plane<00:03:26.890> that<00:03:26.920> actually<00:03:27.640> teleports<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.329> more

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
plane that actually teleports the more

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.319 
plane that actually teleports the more
multiple<00:03:29.110> teleporters<00:03:29.829> because<00:03:30.340> they<00:03:31.180> could

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
multiple teleporters because they could

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.500 
multiple teleporters because they could
spawn<00:03:31.660> in<00:03:31.959> different<00:03:32.380> areas<00:03:33.000> so<00:03:34.000> that<00:03:34.030> would

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
spawn in different areas so that would

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.120 
spawn in different areas so that would
make<00:03:34.660> it<00:03:34.720> you<00:03:35.049> know<00:03:35.200> more<00:03:37.829> differentiated<00:03:38.829> I

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
make it you know more differentiated I

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.330 
make it you know more differentiated I
guess<00:03:39.400> like<00:03:39.900> just<00:03:40.900> slaughter<00:03:41.620> that<00:03:41.890> word<00:03:42.130> but

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
guess like just slaughter that word but

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.810 
guess like just slaughter that word but
anyways<00:03:42.790> um<00:03:43.590> another<00:03:44.590> cool<00:03:45.010> idea<00:03:45.040> that<00:03:45.579> I<00:03:45.609> had

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
anyways um another cool idea that I had

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.300 
anyways um another cool idea that I had
in<00:03:46.000> mind<00:03:46.269> would<00:03:46.570> be<00:03:46.810> piloting<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.709> airplane

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
in mind would be piloting the airplane

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.960 
in mind would be piloting the airplane
and<00:03:49.620> you<00:03:50.620> know<00:03:50.709> I<00:03:50.769> don't<00:03:51.100> know<00:03:51.220> what<00:03:51.609> the<00:03:51.820> hell

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
and you know I don't know what the hell

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.229 
and you know I don't know what the hell
you<00:03:52.450> would<00:03:52.660> do<00:03:53.230> when<00:03:53.650> you<00:03:53.769> flew<00:03:54.519> the<00:03:54.700> airplane

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
you would do when you flew the airplane

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.490 
you would do when you flew the airplane
I<00:03:55.269> don't<00:03:55.480> know<00:03:55.570> where<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:55.900> hell<00:03:56.019> you<00:03:56.170> would<00:03:56.290> go

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
I don't know where the hell you would go

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.930 
I don't know where the hell you would go
but<00:03:56.769> you<00:03:57.579> know<00:03:57.640> possibly<00:03:58.510> it<00:03:58.810> could<00:03:58.840> be<00:03:59.440> a

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
but you know possibly it could be a

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.699 
but you know possibly it could be a
feature<00:04:00.940> like<00:04:01.239> transit<00:04:01.870> maybe<00:04:02.079> you<00:04:02.350> could<00:04:02.530> fly

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
feature like transit maybe you could fly

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.460 
feature like transit maybe you could fly
to<00:04:02.769> other<00:04:03.070> zombie<00:04:03.579> maps<00:04:03.820> and<00:04:04.109> that<00:04:05.109> doesn't

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
to other zombie maps and that doesn't

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.289 
to other zombie maps and that doesn't
mean<00:04:05.560> like<00:04:05.829> new<00:04:06.160> maps<00:04:06.609> that<00:04:06.940> you've<00:04:07.120> never

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
mean like new maps that you've never

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:08.729 
mean like new maps that you've never
seen<00:04:07.420> before<00:04:07.630> but<00:04:08.109> you<00:04:08.440> know<00:04:08.530> they<00:04:08.680> could

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
seen before but you know they could

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.289 
seen before but you know they could
implement<00:04:09.190> that<00:04:09.459> but<00:04:09.519> I'm<00:04:09.820> talking<00:04:10.239> about

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
implement that but I'm talking about

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:11.490 
implement that but I'm talking about
like<00:04:10.690> flying<00:04:11.049> to

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
like flying to

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.700 
like flying to
other<00:04:11.620> maps<00:04:12.010> that<00:04:12.340> you<00:04:12.400> know<00:04:12.640> exist<00:04:13.710> like

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
other maps that you know exist like

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.979 
other maps that you know exist like
maybe<00:04:15.040> you<00:04:15.340> could<00:04:15.490> fly<00:04:15.730> to<00:04:15.790> green<00:04:16.209> run<00:04:16.480> maybe

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
maybe you could fly to green run maybe

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.140 
maybe you could fly to green run maybe
you<00:04:17.320> you<00:04:17.950> know<00:04:18.070> it<00:04:18.220> could<00:04:18.340> be<00:04:18.459> a<00:04:18.489> transit

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
you you know it could be a transit

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.390 
you you know it could be a transit
within<00:04:19.420> a<00:04:19.510> transit<00:04:20.079> you<00:04:20.320> know<00:04:20.410> transection

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
within a transit you know transection

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.910 
within a transit you know transection
but<00:04:21.670> I<00:04:21.700> don't<00:04:22.030> know<00:04:22.150> so<00:04:22.690> you<00:04:23.500> know<00:04:23.590> that's<00:04:23.740> just

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:23.920 
but I don't know so you know that's just

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.880 
but I don't know so you know that's just
my<00:04:24.550> opinion<00:04:24.820> if<00:04:25.450> you<00:04:25.600> guys<00:04:25.750> think<00:04:26.050> that's<00:04:26.200> cool

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
my opinion if you guys think that's cool

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:32.520 
my opinion if you guys think that's cool
drop<00:04:27.460> this<00:04:27.640> video<00:04:27.970> alike<00:04:28.650> and<00:04:31.200> another<00:04:32.200> idea

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
drop this video alike and another idea

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.170 
drop this video alike and another idea
that<00:04:32.740> I<00:04:32.770> had<00:04:32.920> was<00:04:33.250> you<00:04:33.280> could<00:04:33.580> walk<00:04:33.850> on<00:04:34.120> the

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
that I had was you could walk on the
