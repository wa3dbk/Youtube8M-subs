 Ficus are very common plants in the apartment; there are several species, all originating from tropical forests 

00:00:21.584 --> 00:00:30.584
 some ficus have small delicate leaves, other very large and leathery leaves. In any case, the cultivation requirements are similar 

00:00:30.725 --> 00:00:38.725
 Surely the ficus love the climate present in the apartment, with mild temperatures and fairly constant throughout the year 

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:44.119
 they fear the cold, and need a minimum temperature higher than 12-15 Â° C 

00:00:45.531 --> 00:00:51.531
 they must therefore be grown at home, especially during the coldest months, from September to April-May 

00:00:51.912 --> 00:00:59.912
 They are positioned in a bright place in the house, but away from direct sunlight, which could damage the leaves 

00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:06.695
 they fear above all the changes in temperature, which can cause the sudden fall of the leaves 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:18.940
 they are therefore positioned far from direct heat sources, such as radiators or air conditioners, and even away from windows or doors, from which they could receive very damaging air blows 

00:01:20.865 --> 00:01:30.865
 The ficus are evergreen plants, so they need watering all year long, however it is advisable to intervene only when the soil is dry 

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:36.099
 then thinning out the waterings during the cooler months and intensifying them during the summer 

00:01:44.226 --> 00:01:51.230
 We also remember to increase the ambient humidity by sporadically spraying the foliage with demineralized water 

00:01:58.962 --> 00:02:08.960
 Every 2-3 years it is advisable to change the vase, replacing it with a slightly larger one, filling it with fresh soil, rich in organic matter 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:52.490
 in spring we spread on the ground at the foot of our ficus a slow release granular fertilizer, which will guarantee a continuous supply of mineral salts, every time we supply the waterings 

00:03:02.587 --> 00:03:07.590
 Towards the end of winter it is also important to shorten the longer branches of the ficus 

00:03:07.311 --> 00:03:16.310
 in order to favor a thicker crown and to avoid that with the passage of time the plant tends to "empty" itself in the lower part, leaving the bare stem.
