00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
the basis for this commentary basically

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.920 
the basis for this commentary basically
so<00:00:46.110> my<00:00:46.289> gamertag<00:00:46.530> now<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:47.039> 80<00:00:47.670> Berman<00:00:48.180> except

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
so my gamertag now is 80 Berman except

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.369 
so my gamertag now is 80 Berman except
the<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.469> isn't<00:00:50.280> an<00:00:50.370> eye<00:00:50.489> it's<00:00:50.730> an<00:00:50.850> X

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
the I isn't an eye it's an X

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.360 
the I isn't an eye it's an X
unfortunately<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.410> know<00:00:52.500> very<00:00:52.829> very<00:00:52.890> original

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
unfortunately I know very very original

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.639 
unfortunately I know very very original
but<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:54.149> really<00:00:55.140> didn't<00:00:55.320> have<00:00:55.379> too<00:00:55.559> many

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
but I really didn't have too many

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.799 
but I really didn't have too many
choices<00:00:55.949> on<00:00:56.280> what<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.430> could<00:00:56.610> have<00:00:56.640> done

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
choices on what I could have done

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.880 
choices on what I could have done
because<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.960> main<00:00:58.140> thing<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.440> wanted<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.739> do

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
because the main thing I wanted to do

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.099 
because the main thing I wanted to do
was<00:00:58.920> bring<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.460> back<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.940> roots<00:01:00.180> like<00:01:00.989> the

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
was bring it back to the roots like the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.080 
was bring it back to the roots like the
original<00:01:01.590> days<00:01:01.770> because<00:01:02.160> my<00:01:02.460> gamertag<00:01:02.789> did

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
original days because my gamertag did

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.090 
original days because my gamertag did
used<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.359> be<00:01:03.539> 80<00:01:03.750> Birdman<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.439> actual<00:01:04.890> like

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
used to be 80 Birdman the actual like

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.460 
used to be 80 Birdman the actual like
straight-up<00:01:05.760> 80<00:01:06.060> Birdman<00:01:06.540> back<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.170> black<00:01:07.260> ops

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
straight-up 80 Birdman back in black ops

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.280 
straight-up 80 Birdman back in black ops
1<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.549> changed<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.750> never<00:01:10.049> thought<00:01:10.260> I

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
1 and I changed it and I never thought I

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.990 
1 and I changed it and I never thought I
would<00:01:10.439> ever<00:01:10.560> bring<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:11.010> t-back<00:01:11.369> or<00:01:11.790> anything

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
would ever bring a t-back or anything

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.910 
would ever bring a t-back or anything
like<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.540> someone<00:01:13.260> took<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.560> and

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
like that and someone took it and

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.670 
like that and someone took it and
unfortunately<00:01:14.610> uh<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:16.200> know<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.320> can't<00:01:16.560> really

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
unfortunately uh you know I can't really

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.420 
unfortunately uh you know I can't really
get<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:16.920> back<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.549> due<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.479> um<00:01:18.900> that's<00:01:19.830> so

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
get it back so due to that um that's so

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.710 
get it back so due to that um that's so
basically<00:01:20.790> they<00:01:20.880> also<00:01:21.030> say<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
basically they also say that so the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.270 
basically they also say that so the
reasoning<00:01:22.020> for<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.200> was<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.950> was<00:01:23.009> the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
reasoning for that was the that was the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.520 
reasoning for that was the that was the
reason<00:01:23.430> why<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:24.060> put<00:01:24.570> 80<00:01:24.750> at<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.080> end<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.409> my

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
reason why I put 80 at the end of my

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.070 
reason why I put 80 at the end of my
name<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.979> because<00:01:26.250> my<00:01:26.790> name<00:01:27.479> was<00:01:27.689> already

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
name is because my name was already

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.810 
name is because my name was already
taken<00:01:28.409> at<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.619> front<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.520> was<00:01:29.759> the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
taken at the front so that was the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.670 
taken at the front so that was the
reason<00:01:29.850> for<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.240> but<00:01:30.600> now<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.750> don't<00:01:31.560> know<00:01:31.619> I

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
reason for that but now I don't know I

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.350 
reason for that but now I don't know I
liking<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.159> better<00:01:32.369> at<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.640> front<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:32.939> like<00:01:33.119> I

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
liking it better at the front I like I

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.090 
liking it better at the front I like I
think<00:01:33.960> clan<00:01:34.200> names<00:01:34.409> are<00:01:34.560> better<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.860> put<00:01:35.009> at

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
think clan names are better to put at

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.230 
think clan names are better to put at
the<00:01:35.130> front<00:01:35.220> than<00:01:35.579> they<00:01:35.640> are<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.970> put<00:01:36.090> at<00:01:36.210> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the front than they are to put at the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.480 
the front than they are to put at the
end<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.720> your<00:01:37.229> gamertag<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.770> just<00:01:37.920> matches<00:01:38.130> up

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
end of your gamertag it just matches up

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.890 
end of your gamertag it just matches up
better<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:39.299> know<00:01:39.420> when<00:01:39.540> you're<00:01:39.659> playing<00:01:39.810> with

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
better you know when you're playing with

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.810 
better you know when you're playing with
other<00:01:40.020> clan<00:01:40.439> members<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.070> stuff<00:01:41.640> like<00:01:41.759> that

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
other clan members and stuff like that

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.200 
other clan members and stuff like that
like<00:01:42.030> just<00:01:42.210> for<00:01:42.570> purely<00:01:43.200> like<00:01:44.090> you<00:01:45.090> know

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
like just for purely like you know

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.030

visual<00:01:45.659> reasons<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.229> like<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.560> better<00:01:46.770> at<00:01:46.950> the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
visual reasons I like it better at the
