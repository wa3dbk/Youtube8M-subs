00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.620
 pure life people that just like they are 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.169
 I hope very well here samic and ya 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.290
 I'm in an update for the channel 

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:12.330
 for what would not be a video of those that 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.970
 I upload casually but rather a video 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.700
 of informative nature on a 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.530
 project involving a friend 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.930
 one of the best known stories of 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:25.220
 sir ok with what used to be called 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.890
 moresco true this and it is a version 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:32.510
 cheer of my friend knicks sitaru that 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.510
 is here by the way viola 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.490
 sorry for the delay there is a bit of the 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.890
 that in the call and good she has gone up 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.350
 some publications to your facebook that 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.030
 they show more or less what the 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.310
 project as I tell you is an animal 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.250
 tec that is basically she plans 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.360
 encourage the story or the vast majority 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.840
 of history or decide us in the 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.460
 most important moments of it and 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.170
 well let's see like that for example 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.579
 some samples that you have already done 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.629
 animations of the beginning 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.629
 this is 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.119
 very cool guadalajara profile and 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.570
 this other one that made the intro and the 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.570
 quarter 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.010
 everything is betting that with the animation 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.530
 of the book and all good this the abies and 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.360
 I'm because she's in need of voices 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.160
 for the project she wants 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.830
 of course to put voices to all 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.270
 characters and that and of course it's very 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.660
 important that those who are going to get 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.720
 I think it's the main requirement that 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.520
 be well delivered because it is so that the 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.580
 support because this is something pretty 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.740
 long that does not become of the night to the 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.870
 tomorrow and we can not say give him the voice 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.060
 to a character that later the actor 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.800
 take us away I truly imagine casually 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.780
 he asked me for help for what would be the 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.640
 fucam character and if I'm going to do 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.830
 the voice of fucam already apparently or that 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.690
 I will try not to be insulting my 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:09.060
 teacher and you're a I can not forgive that 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.730
 says that I do it very well or something does not 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.909
 I know what a good pimp 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.560
 and then some detail that I have 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:21.150
 stayed in the inkwell or mick or 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:25.740
 I already mentioned that they have to be older 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:28.530
 of 15 years have to have the resources 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.540
 I'm not saying they have a super 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.990
 microphone and super computers 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:39.750
 simply that he also set the mood 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:41.880
 recording noise is the cleanest 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.850
 possible and be very careful at the time 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.980
 to bring it closer to the mouthpiece to the microphone 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.830
 so that this does not sound 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.200
 horrible truth that you hear the 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.020
 breath and all really good this kind of 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.120
 workshops and to make the one who then 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:01.380
 that the audio that is going to be 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.290
 would be the most important and that more something 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.590
 that has not stayed in the inkwell 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.079
 Well, apart from that if for example 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.959
 any of those who want to participate in 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:15.120
 the project does not have most of what 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.150
 that I implicitly say that they are 15 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.920
 I have a secondary project that is 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.340
 write the song to make a 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.049
 opening and an indie for this series 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.970
 then from that would be for those who 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:31.620
 they are 14 years old for retirement and then 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.810
 it would be like any other doubt what 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.120
 they could check on my facebook and there 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.120
 I do the update and like all 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.489
 other details certainly forgiveness 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.530
 for interrupting you but which voices and more 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.359
 or less are you already almost defined or 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.500
 right now they do not have any or that is 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:53.209
 already be occupied right now I have with 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.209
 what I have occupied are the and 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:06.880
 guadalajara this cut porn 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:12.160
 the princess tosatto of the princess are 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:15.160
 here and katsumi there and they are never all 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.470
 but even a person could not say 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.739
 audition for a voice that you already 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.270
 have but that maybe he wants 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.860
 try to overcome one that she 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.139
 currently or is that you already have them 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:31.060
 fully defined 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:32.740
 Well, I do not know, I think maybe if 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.889
 the surpasses maybe it is some change 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.199
 return 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:40.540
 until now we would see it more and 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:43.570
 when we are already in 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.730
 so to speak, inserting well the 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.620
 voices in what the project is because 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.050
 now he is not inserting the 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.000
 processes in 8 no video so it was 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.880
 a are already in the voices and areas that goes 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.650
 of billiards he had told me that for 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.690
 true the voices that were most needed 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.170
 they were from men who had pretty much 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.170
 of women 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.970
 and I was doing the propaganda of 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:11.100
 the male characters but there's no 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.570
 almost nobody and I'm not saying that the 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.820
 women not to participate or be able to 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.880
 participate but nobody is encouraged to do 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.870
 the voices of the male characters 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.060
 in fact I think I have one more 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:24.870
 propensity to busy culinos up 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:27.270
 right now then where do you 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.919
 can send very important audios 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.950
 to your facebook or to some page in 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.890
 specific 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:36.710
 it would not be my facebook by inbox and it has 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:39.170
 that he has to send me the audio in 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.990
 downloadable mode because if they do not send it 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:43.340
 as well as voice notes does not serve me anymore 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.680
 that nothing because later in the future 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.150
 imagine that you are chosen and 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.350
 then you can change the audio to 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.350
 insert it in the video 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.410
 preferably to record it on the pc 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.000
 calmly with making the file and 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.980
 everything and then I keep it so 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.930
 as a downloadable file is the most 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:04.340
 important 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:06.640
 and if this does not give them the option in Miami 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:09.620
 to download it from some platform 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.970
 also the facebook line I'm going to 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.260
 leave there in the description of the video 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.700
 although they are seeing it on the screen but 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.430
 likewise leave the link in the 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.770
 description of the video by that truth 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:21.550
 and since then I think that would be 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.550
 all true already 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:29.420
 well then nothing here we see people 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:32.420
 goodbye goodbye friend nixon 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.420
 bye
