00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 the colíder hydroelectric plant that is 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.350
 being built in the river 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.740
 should start to generate energy from 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.679
 by 2015 the plant will have installed power 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.340
 300 megawatts or more 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.830
 to meet the consumption of approximately 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.930
 850 thousand people and a reservoir that 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.810
 will cover areas of the municipality of nova 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.890
 canaã do norte colíder and itaúba and 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.900
 Claudia 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.570
 the wholly-owned subsidiary of 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.369
 Paraná energy company 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.680
 the concession to build and 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.260
 operate the plant in the auction conducted by 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.260
 national electric power agency 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.879
 annel on July 30, 2010 for 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.579
 to carry out the project's 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.559
 hydroelectric power plant was contracted 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.020
 formed by several companies 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.360
 the plant is one of the works of the program 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.530
 acceleration of government pac growth 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.079
 federal 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.809
 finished the year-end festivities the 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.449
 work has been yet taken up this 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.120
 structural concrete will be launched in the 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.409
 system for the transposition of fish and 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.720
 bases of the future substation 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.330
 power transformer the building 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.760
 of the dam should be resumed in mid- 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.479
 the end of the period of the 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.049
 rain 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.600
 the structure will have 1,560 meters of 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.820
 length and the height 40 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.150
 impounding of water will form a 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.549
 171.7 kilometers of reservoir 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.090
 which is considered small 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.729
 because at 1 o'clock and colíder will operate in 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.479
 water flow regime accompanied by flow 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.909
 From Rio 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.549
 The expectation is that the dam 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.710
 fully ready by November this year 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.689
 the governor of mato grosso silval 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.030
 who visited the work of the mill 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.130
 said that investments are 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.829
 important for the state we 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.299
 we are looking for competitiveness 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:56.460
 we seek to industrialize our production 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:59.070
 depends on sufficient energy to 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.250
 attract new ventures and here 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.140
 this project strengthens with the whole complex 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:09.209
 of the teles sails 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.970
 the stability of the generation of 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.590
 energy in the mato grosso state and also 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.590
 give us opportunity through 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.569
 the construction of the line stabilize the 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.129
 distribution of our state as well. 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.690
 government to pay from the 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.910
 The first moment in this work 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.800
 developed is to be a 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.470
