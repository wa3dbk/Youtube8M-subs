00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.190
 a tip right at the beginning when you 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.049
 the battery has changed or the device 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.519
 has been refurbished most of the time 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:08.900
 adjusted time that leads to that 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.290
 you look in some non wlans a 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.790
 that can be some synchronization 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.440
 do not work varied mistakes 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.630
 Unfortunately apps are not able to do that 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.240
 to fix but with apps like Ntt 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.590
 You can at least look at Klopp 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.529
 how the difference is and if that 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.500
 huge is the time of 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:30.980
 put hand once again 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:33.350
 this is about the attitude somewhere 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.820
 in this unsorted Buss has date 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.280
 and time and here you can then 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.020
 automatically manually your own values 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.100
 set the automatics to work 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.289
 at best in the car network unfortunately the 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.460
 exchange and imap settings of 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.010
 windows phone are pretty good 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.629
 what is not working are cloud and 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:56.649
 Call kall but you can get it yourself 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:59.180
 by creating an account 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.879
 icloud because icloud uses calder from 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.769
 card may be the trick now 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.570
 simply any invalid account name 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.160
 enter and any password 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.240
 hopefully heckmann will not do it 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.090
 be provided then you go on 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.250
 sign up that goes wrong now you can see 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.200
 an iCloud entry is not up to date 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.110
 there we go again clicks on the 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.120
 error message gone and now you have here 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.100
 below under advanced settings the 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.680
 possibility of own caldav un-charter 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.760
 register server for example that of 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.280
 one carries one's own cloud higher up 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.110
 then his any name 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.170
 the real user name then you 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.640
 in iCloud in in in 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.070
 has his own server and that 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.120
 password then you go ok and have 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.490
 a cold server entered 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.810
 a local sync without cloud is included 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.730
 Windows phone not provided 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.380
 how to use it with a windows pc 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.650
 sync outlook is there for it 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.720
 Battery sinks that sets an exchange 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.820
 server on the pc and you can then 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.990
 from windows phone is quite normal 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.970
 configure as an exchange account e mail 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.070
 contacts calendar tasks says windows 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.840
 but e-mail not only works 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.330
 contacts calendars and tasks can be 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.860
 with it 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.410
 pc sync the whole thing 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.540
 works pretty well too 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.980
 as long as you are in the same wlan 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.260
 You have to go outside your own apartment 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.300
 either apply tricks with the dns 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.300
 or you just leave it that way
