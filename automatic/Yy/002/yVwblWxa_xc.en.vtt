 add chicken broth 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.620
 ready let's liquefy it 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.460
 It is not a creampie 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.990
 and nutritious 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.180
 very well 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.760
 let's dissolve in a little water 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.060
 scene 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.780
 it must be cold if it is cold 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.780
 cornstarch 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.910
 you in the house dedicate about 30 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.610
 seconds more to liquefy the and the can 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.520
 go through a colander if you want to so 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.880
 it is very soft and stay 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.440
 a whole corn skin some 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.190
 seeds that could have escaped 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.610
 of chili as you prefer I like 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:09.180
 very quiet if you are or know what you can do 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.970
 most leave most outside and 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.090
 add a little bit more and that 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.460
 little bit will give you consistency 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.700
 then you can decide what kind of 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:23.370
 consistency wants your cream then 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.360
 let's add the cornstarch that already 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.360
 We dissolved in cold water 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:35.489
 so we go up to the fire and see nothing else what 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:38.400
 Cute color is a very subtle green color 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.620
 and now let's add the cream now 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.599
 we were talking about not eating fat 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.170
 saturated preferably your cream 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:48.180
 be light low fat then instead 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.200
 to put a cup just put it on 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:57.030
 half cup then well will you have a 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:04:00.180
 Delicious nutritious cream and very easy to 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:03.299
 do although you do not suffer from 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.970
 diabetes, it is important to take care of yourself and 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:08.310
 prevent one you never know 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.470
 we do not know what agents we have if 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.599
 we are predisposed or not so more 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.659
 It's worth taking good care of us eating healthy 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:18.780
 nothing costs us and you see that 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:21.570
 It has to be tasteless or it has to be 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.789
 bad or depriving yourself of what you like anything 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.949
 more be careful not to eat fat 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:30.120
 saturated then we will dissolve here 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:32.760
 our light cream 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.430
 If you want to save yourself 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.370
 grams of fat you can put milk 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.310
 evaporated the evaporated milk also 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.490
 It gives very good boulevard flavor both body 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:48.280
 but the cornstarch is going to be that 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:53.020
 trick for us then 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:56.080

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.169
