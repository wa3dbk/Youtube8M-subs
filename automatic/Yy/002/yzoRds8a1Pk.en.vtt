create<00:00:23.519> something<00:00:24.210> like<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.539> box<00:00:24.930> simple<00:00:25.920> box

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
create something like a box simple box

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.720 
create something like a box simple box
and<00:00:26.519> now<00:00:27.269> let's<00:00:27.689> proceed<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.429> animate<00:00:29.429> this

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
and now let's proceed to animate this

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.590 
and now let's proceed to animate this
box<00:00:30.289> well<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.619> basic<00:00:32.070> animation<00:00:32.730> itself<00:00:33.030> 4d

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
box well the basic animation itself 4d

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.630 
box well the basic animation itself 4d
means<00:00:35.989> moving<00:00:36.989> this<00:00:37.290> object<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.370> time

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
means moving this object to the time

means moving this object to the time
we're<00:00:39.360> taking<00:00:39.629> or<00:00:40.230> simply<00:00:41.219> changing<00:00:41.700> some<00:00:42.000> of

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
we're taking or simply changing some of

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.910 
we're taking or simply changing some of
its<00:00:42.480> parameters<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.850> for<00:00:44.850> example<00:00:45.590> here<00:00:46.590> is

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
its parameters of for example here is

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.450 
its parameters of for example here is
our<00:00:47.129> static<00:00:47.789> object<00:00:48.620> dragging<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:50.010> timeline

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
our static object dragging the timeline

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.439 
our static object dragging the timeline
cursor<00:00:51.360> we<00:00:51.629> see<00:00:51.930> it's<00:00:52.260> static<00:00:53.129> even<00:00:53.850> if<00:00:54.210> we

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
cursor we see it's static even if we

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.720 
cursor we see it's static even if we
move<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.110> another<00:00:55.289> frame<00:00:55.710> mode<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.250> we<00:00:56.489> move

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
move to another frame mode and we move

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.979 
move to another frame mode and we move
our<00:00:56.969> box<00:00:57.629> as<00:00:58.309> they<00:00:59.309> are<00:00:59.430> always<00:00:59.640> static<00:01:00.359> to

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
our box as they are always static to

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.709 
our box as they are always static to
change<00:01:01.620> its<00:01:02.190> position<00:01:02.520> for<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.239> time<00:01:03.449> to

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
change its position for the time to

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.800 
change its position for the time to
animate<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.170> box<00:01:04.610> we<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:06.299> must<00:01:06.570> use

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
animate this box we we must use

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.130 
animate this box we we must use
keyframes<00:01:07.610> keyframes<00:01:08.840> record<00:01:09.840> the

parameters of a frame or single frame

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.740 
parameters of a frame or single frame
and<00:01:13.110> then<00:01:13.920> interpolates<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:15.180> parameter

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
and then interpolates this parameter

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.749 
and then interpolates this parameter
with<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.140> D<00:01:16.320> parameters<00:01:16.580> recording<00:01:17.580> another

okay we are at frame 19 now let's move
to<00:04:24.460> frame<00:04:24.790> 30<00:04:26.400> we<00:04:27.400> can<00:04:27.700> scale<00:04:28.479> our<00:04:28.720> object<00:04:29.290> in

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
to frame 30 we can scale our object in

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:33.120 
to frame 30 we can scale our object in
our<00:04:30.130> viewport

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:40.860

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
and we can add a keyframe okay

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.780 
and we can add a keyframe okay
you<00:04:41.470> can<00:04:41.740> see<00:04:42.010> our<00:04:42.280> box<00:04:43.500> size<00:04:44.500> change<00:04:45.190> to<00:04:45.669> the

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
you can see our box size change to the

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.010 
you can see our box size change to the
time<00:04:46.090> just<00:04:47.020> because<00:04:47.199> we<00:04:48.449> set<00:04:49.449> keyframe

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
time just because we set keyframe

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.500 
time just because we set keyframe
directly<00:04:50.590> on<00:04:50.800> the<00:04:50.949> parameters<00:04:51.550> we<00:04:52.030> can<00:04:52.060> use

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
directly on the parameters we can use

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.629 
directly on the parameters we can use
this<00:04:52.750> very<00:04:52.990> narrow<00:04:53.380> in<00:04:53.560> every<00:04:53.949> parameter<00:04:54.280> we

animation we set so as you can see the

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:25.680 
animation we set so as you can see the
box<00:05:19.870> size<00:05:20.830> is<00:05:21.190> static<00:05:22.500> we<00:05:23.500> can<00:05:23.740> also<00:05:24.690> move

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
box size is static we can also move

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.800 
box size is static we can also move
through<00:05:26.169> the<00:05:26.500> keyframes<00:05:27.160> directly<00:05:27.970> without

bar just click on animation and go into

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.110 
bar just click on animation and go into
next<00:05:38.470> keyframe<00:05:38.800> as<00:05:39.340> you<00:05:39.729> can<00:05:39.910> see<00:05:40.060> it

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
next keyframe as you can see it

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.390 
next keyframe as you can see it
automatically<00:05:40.690> move<00:05:41.020> to<00:05:41.050> frame<00:05:41.560> 12<00:05:41.979> because

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
automatically move to frame 12 because

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.690 
automatically move to frame 12 because
there<00:05:42.639> are<00:05:42.760> a<00:05:42.970> new<00:05:43.600> keyframe<00:05:44.050> on<00:05:44.229> frame<00:05:44.289> 12<00:05:44.860> so

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
there are a new keyframe on frame 12 so

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.270 
there are a new keyframe on frame 12 so
then<00:05:46.240> say<00:05:46.510> thank<00:05:47.200> you<00:05:47.410> for<00:05:47.560> watching<00:05:48.100> and
