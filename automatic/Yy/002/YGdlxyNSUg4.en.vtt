 today we have got a little gas
turbine<00:00:14.429> engine<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:14.820> we<00:00:14.910> built<00:00:15.150> here<00:00:15.830> so

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
turbine engine that we built here so

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.890 
turbine engine that we built here so
decent<00:00:18.330> size<00:00:18.660> switch<00:00:19.170> your<00:00:19.199> turbo<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.900> we're

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
decent size switch your turbo and we're

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.380 
decent size switch your turbo and we're
going<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.050> fire<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.350> up<00:00:22.410> right<00:00:22.619> now<00:00:23.210> you<00:00:24.210> can't

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
going to fire it up right now you can't

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.839 
going to fire it up right now you can't
get<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.660> thing<00:00:24.720> going<00:00:25.460> just<00:00:26.460> do<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.670> little

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
get this thing going just do a little

00:00:26.849 --> 00:03:32.430 
get this thing going just do a little
test<00:00:27.210> from

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.790 

yeah<00:03:33.440> that<00:03:33.650> was<00:03:33.860> that<00:03:35.050> was<00:03:36.050> the<00:03:36.140> intermediate

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
yeah that was that was the intermediate

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.880 
yeah that was that was the intermediate
run<00:03:37.040> I<00:03:37.070> don't<00:03:37.460> know

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.080 

compressed<00:03:42.890> air<00:03:43.100> right<00:03:43.460> off<00:03:43.610> the<00:03:43.820> compressor

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
compressed air right off the compressor

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.700 
compressed air right off the compressor
to<00:03:44.630> the<00:03:44.960> pop<00:03:45.200> going<00:03:45.710> to<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:45.920> combustor

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:47.710 
to the pop going to the combustor

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.990 
to the pop going to the combustor
started<00:03:48.710> separate<00:03:49.100> off<00:03:49.250> I<00:03:49.400> have<00:03:49.550> that<00:03:49.700> clamp

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
started separate off I have that clamp

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.390 
started separate off I have that clamp
down<00:03:50.240> right<00:03:50.540> now<00:03:50.720> I<00:03:51.050> just<00:03:51.500> put<00:03:51.680> this<00:03:51.800> turbo<00:03:52.190> on

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
down right now I just put this turbo on

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.910 
down right now I just put this turbo on
this<00:03:52.790> setup<00:03:54.430> had<00:03:55.430> much<00:03:55.640> larger<00:03:56.060> V&amp;T<00:03:56.360> lint<00:03:56.960> but

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
this setup had much larger V&amp;T lint but

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.380 
this setup had much larger V&amp;T lint but
seems<00:03:58.460> to<00:03:58.550> work<00:03:58.670> really<00:03:58.700> well<00:03:58.970> with<00:03:59.120> this

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
seems to work really well with this

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.970 
seems to work really well with this
turbo<00:04:00.220> I<00:04:01.220> didn't<00:04:01.970> move<00:04:02.060> just<00:04:02.360> now<00:04:02.540> but<00:04:02.980> my

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
turbo I didn't move just now but my

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.460 
turbo I didn't move just now but my
first<00:04:04.190> test<00:04:04.490> run<00:04:04.670> it<00:04:04.970> to<00:04:05.270> shove<00:04:06.080> the<00:04:06.230> cart

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
first test run it to shove the cart

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.520 
first test run it to shove the cart
around<00:04:06.620> with<00:04:07.340> the<00:04:07.490> rust<00:04:07.700> and<00:04:08.120> have<00:04:09.050> you<00:04:09.260> set<00:04:09.440> it

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
around with the rust and have you set it

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.350 
around with the rust and have you set it
up<00:04:09.590> to<00:04:09.740> make<00:04:09.830> thrust<00:04:10.160> yet<00:04:10.400> so<00:04:10.730> I'm<00:04:11.240> pretty

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
up to make thrust yet so I'm pretty

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.480 
up to make thrust yet so I'm pretty
happy
