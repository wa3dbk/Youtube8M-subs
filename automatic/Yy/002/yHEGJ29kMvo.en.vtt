00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
making this car work now watches it this

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.870 
making this car work now watches it this
is<00:01:11.790> like<00:01:11.970> would<00:01:12.330> simulate<00:01:12.570> an<00:01:12.930> s-curve<00:01:13.470> and

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
is like would simulate an s-curve and

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.160 
is like would simulate an s-curve and
you<00:01:14.880> can<00:01:15.030> see<00:01:15.240> how<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.570> goes<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.990> how<00:01:16.049> the

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
you can see how it goes and how the

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.640 
you can see how it goes and how the
diaphragms<00:01:17.630> just<00:01:18.630> look<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:18.990> beautiful

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
diaphragms just look so beautiful

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.800 
diaphragms just look so beautiful
and<00:01:20.810> prototypical<00:01:22.850> now<00:01:23.850> here's<00:01:24.150> Bob<00:01:24.210> Gruber

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
and prototypical now here's Bob Gruber

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.390 
and prototypical now here's Bob Gruber
to<00:01:24.900> show<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.110> more<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.650> details<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.280> these

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
to show you more of the details of these

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.090 
to show you more of the details of these
wonderful<00:01:26.759> cars

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.980 

one<00:01:34.100> of<00:01:34.189> the<00:01:34.280> defining<00:01:34.640> features<00:01:34.820> of<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:35.600> SP

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
one of the defining features of the SP

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.020 
one of the defining features of the SP
daylight<00:01:36.380> train<00:01:36.799> are<00:01:37.100> the<00:01:37.520> full-width

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
daylight train are the full-width

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.749 
daylight train are the full-width
diaphragms<00:01:38.750> now<00:01:39.320> those<00:01:39.530> are<00:01:39.799> particularly

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
diaphragms now those are particularly

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.569 
diaphragms now those are particularly
difficult<00:01:41.000> to<00:01:41.450> model<00:01:41.929> because<00:01:42.590> relatively

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
difficult to model because relatively

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.929 
difficult to model because relatively
speaking<00:01:43.939> the<00:01:45.100> radius<00:01:46.100> of<00:01:46.250> curvature<00:01:46.460> on<00:01:46.909> a

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
speaking the radius of curvature on a

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.179 
speaking the radius of curvature on a
model<00:01:47.329> layout<00:01:47.600> is<00:01:47.810> much<00:01:48.170> much<00:01:48.530> tighter<00:01:48.860> than

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
model layout is much much tighter than

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.969 
model layout is much much tighter than
on<00:01:49.789> a<00:01:49.819> real<00:01:50.090> train<00:01:50.450> and<00:01:50.719> so<00:01:51.229> we<00:01:51.469> do<00:01:51.590> quite<00:01:51.860> a<00:01:51.890> few

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
on a real train and so we do quite a few

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.899 
on a real train and so we do quite a few
things<00:01:52.130> to<00:01:52.549> make<00:01:52.969> the<00:01:53.539> the<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:55.310> diaphragms

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
things to make the the the diaphragms

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.449 
things to make the the the diaphragms
still<00:01:56.600> look<00:01:56.869> right<00:01:57.170> yet<00:01:57.829> be<00:01:58.039> able<00:01:58.250> to<00:01:58.340> go

00:01:58.449 --> 00:01:58.459 
still look right yet be able to go

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:01.899 
still look right yet be able to go
around<00:01:58.579> a<00:01:59.090> 22<00:02:00.049> inch<00:02:00.229> radius<00:02:00.590> curve<00:02:00.860> now<00:02:01.610> one<00:02:01.789> of

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
around a 22 inch radius curve now one of

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.260 
around a 22 inch radius curve now one of
the<00:02:01.970> things<00:02:02.209> that<00:02:02.420> we<00:02:02.539> do<00:02:02.720> is<00:02:03.700> on<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:05.090> day

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
the things that we do is on the day

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.880 
the things that we do is on the day
light<00:02:05.479> cars<00:02:05.780> we<00:02:06.200> have<00:02:06.349> what<00:02:06.530> we<00:02:06.649> call<00:02:06.860> a

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
light cars we have what we call a

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.039 
light cars we have what we call a
kinematic<00:02:07.280> coupler<00:02:07.909> what<00:02:08.509> it<00:02:08.660> is<00:02:08.780> is<00:02:09.019> a

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.049 
kinematic coupler what it is is a

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:10.809 
kinematic coupler what it is is a
mechanism<00:02:09.500> we<00:02:09.890> don't<00:02:10.069> just<00:02:10.220> put<00:02:10.369> a<00:02:10.399> couple<00:02:10.579> on

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
mechanism we don't just put a couple on

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.759 
mechanism we don't just put a couple on
there<00:02:11.000> it's<00:02:11.120> a<00:02:11.180> mechanism<00:02:11.840> that<00:02:11.989> when<00:02:12.500> you<00:02:12.620> go

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
there it's a mechanism that when you go

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.470 
there it's a mechanism that when you go
around<00:02:12.799> a<00:02:13.069> curve<00:02:13.250> it<00:02:13.519> makes<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.970> couplers

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
around a curve it makes the couplers

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.559 
around a curve it makes the couplers
extend<00:02:15.019> slightly<00:02:15.349> and<00:02:16.220> what<00:02:16.400> that<00:02:16.579> does<00:02:16.819> is<00:02:17.180> it

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
extend slightly and what that does is it

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.110 
extend slightly and what that does is it
lets<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.989> cars<00:02:18.319> be<00:02:18.950> coupled<00:02:19.400> nice<00:02:19.579> and<00:02:19.819> close

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
lets the cars be coupled nice and close

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.440 
lets the cars be coupled nice and close
on<00:02:20.480> a<00:02:20.769> on<00:02:21.769> a<00:02:21.829> straight<00:02:22.519> but<00:02:23.090> when<00:02:23.209> they<00:02:23.299> go

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
on a on a straight but when they go

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.530 
on a on a straight but when they go
around<00:02:23.569> a<00:02:23.840> curve<00:02:24.079> they<00:02:24.769> start<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.400> they<00:02:26.239> start

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
around a curve they start to they start

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.430 
around a curve they start to they start
to<00:02:26.660> widen<00:02:26.930> ever<00:02:27.440> so<00:02:27.769> slightly<00:02:28.209> okay<00:02:29.440> another

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
to widen ever so slightly okay another

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.900 
to widen ever so slightly okay another
thing<00:02:30.560> that<00:02:30.829> we<00:02:30.890> spent<00:02:31.129> a<00:02:31.190> lot<00:02:31.310> of<00:02:31.370> effort<00:02:31.790> on

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
thing that we spent a lot of effort on

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.479 
thing that we spent a lot of effort on
is<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.510> diaphragms<00:02:33.049> themselves<00:02:33.680> now<00:02:34.280> what

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
is the diaphragms themselves now what

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.559 
is the diaphragms themselves now what
was<00:02:34.639> available<00:02:34.910> in<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.269> market<00:02:35.660> before<00:02:35.980> was<00:02:36.980> a

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
was available in the market before was a

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.090 
was available in the market before was a
flexible<00:02:38.569> diaphragm<00:02:38.900> but<00:02:39.260> you'll<00:02:39.410> notice<00:02:39.739> it

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
flexible diaphragm but you'll notice it

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.430 
flexible diaphragm but you'll notice it
didn't<00:02:40.519> have<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.209> little<00:02:41.690> stripes<00:02:42.049> on<00:02:42.290> it

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
didn't have the the little stripes on it

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.440 
didn't have the the little stripes on it
and<00:02:42.620> they're<00:02:42.709> also<00:02:42.859> they're<00:02:43.190> fairly<00:02:43.430> stiff<00:02:43.910> if

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
and they're also they're fairly stiff if

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.599 
and they're also they're fairly stiff if
you<00:02:44.630> put<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.900> paint<00:02:45.170> on<00:02:45.290> too<00:02:45.530> thick<00:02:45.560> it<00:02:46.310> makes

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:46.609 
you put the paint on too thick it makes

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:48.520 
you put the paint on too thick it makes
the<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.060> diaphragm<00:02:47.480> stiff<00:02:47.840> and<00:02:48.019> it'll<00:02:48.200> it'll

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
the the diaphragm stiff and it'll it'll

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.319 
the the diaphragm stiff and it'll it'll
tend<00:02:48.920> to<00:02:49.040> push<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.370> car<00:02:49.579> off<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.760> track<00:02:50.090> in

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
tend to push the car off the track in

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.740 
tend to push the car off the track in
the<00:02:50.420> curves<00:02:50.660> and<00:02:51.049> then<00:02:51.769> on<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.730> on<00:02:53.269> the

daylight trains these articulated cars

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:01.890 
daylight trains these articulated cars
there<00:02:59.569> are<00:02:59.630> two<00:02:59.840> and<00:03:00.049> three<00:03:00.260> car<00:03:00.530> sets<00:03:01.370> and

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
there are two and three car sets and

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.800 
there are two and three car sets and
they<00:03:02.900> are<00:03:03.170> permanently<00:03:03.739> coupled<00:03:04.280> and<00:03:04.810> they

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
they are permanently coupled and they

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.170 
they are permanently coupled and they
were<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:06.319> two<00:03:06.620> cars<00:03:06.889> ride<00:03:07.160> on<00:03:07.370> a<00:03:07.400> shared<00:03:07.760> truck

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
were the two cars ride on a shared truck

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.240 
were the two cars ride on a shared truck
and<00:03:08.420> there's<00:03:08.750> an<00:03:08.900> articulating<00:03:09.590> mechanism<00:03:10.160> in

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
and there's an articulating mechanism in

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.440 
and there's an articulating mechanism in
between<00:03:10.639> that<00:03:12.459> we<00:03:13.459> worked<00:03:13.700> quite<00:03:13.970> a<00:03:14.000> bit<00:03:14.269> on

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
between that we worked quite a bit on

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.250 
between that we worked quite a bit on
again<00:03:15.260> it's<00:03:15.620> got<00:03:15.829> in<00:03:16.269> internally<00:03:17.269> kinematic

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
again it's got in internally kinematic

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.900 
again it's got in internally kinematic
couplers<00:03:18.650> so<00:03:18.889> that<00:03:19.069> as<00:03:19.190> it<00:03:19.220> goes<00:03:19.489> around<00:03:19.669> a

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
couplers so that as it goes around a

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.050 
couplers so that as it goes around a
curve<00:03:20.319> the<00:03:21.319> cars<00:03:21.560> actually<00:03:22.489> separate<00:03:23.030> a

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
curve the cars actually separate a

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.479 
curve the cars actually separate a
little<00:03:23.329> bit<00:03:23.480> as<00:03:23.630> they<00:03:23.780> curve<00:03:24.130> and<00:03:25.130> what<00:03:25.310> that

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
little bit as they curve and what that

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.699 
little bit as they curve and what that
lets<00:03:25.639> us<00:03:25.880> do<00:03:26.120> is<00:03:26.389> have<00:03:27.019> the<00:03:27.260> full<00:03:27.530> width

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
lets us do is have the full width

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.059 
lets us do is have the full width
diaphragm<00:03:28.370> that<00:03:29.000> doesn't<00:03:29.599> have<00:03:29.840> a<00:03:29.870> gap<00:03:30.200> as<00:03:30.530> you

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
diaphragm that doesn't have a gap as you

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.460 
diaphragm that doesn't have a gap as you
go<00:03:31.190> around<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.549> curve<00:03:31.760> all<00:03:32.540> of<00:03:33.019> the<00:03:33.139> daylight

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
go around the curve all of the daylight

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.550 
go around the curve all of the daylight
cars<00:03:33.769> have<00:03:34.359> have<00:03:35.359> full<00:03:35.750> interior<00:03:36.109> lighting

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
cars have have full interior lighting

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.879 
cars have have full interior lighting
and<00:03:36.889> it's<00:03:37.459> it's<00:03:38.120> LED<00:03:38.690> lighting<00:03:39.139> there's<00:03:39.590> a<00:03:39.680> lot

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:39.889 
and it's it's LED lighting there's a lot

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:42.280 
and it's it's LED lighting there's a lot
of<00:03:40.040> lights<00:03:40.220> in<00:03:40.400> these<00:03:40.519> cars<00:03:40.790> so<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.900> use<00:03:42.079> of

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
of lights in these cars so the use of

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.810 
of lights in these cars so the use of
LEDs

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
draws less current so so most people are

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.100 
draws less current so so most people are
