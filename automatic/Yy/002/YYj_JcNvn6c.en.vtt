00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
half and letting piece overlap and it's

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.899 
half and letting piece overlap and it's
going<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.530> be<00:01:04.619> easier<00:01:04.860> for<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.400> open<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
going to be easier for you to open the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.149 
going to be easier for you to open the
tape<00:01:06.180> after<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.840> at<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.200> crease<00:01:07.680> like<00:01:07.950> this

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
tape after so at the crease like this

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.850 
tape after so at the crease like this
I'm<00:01:08.340> cutting<00:01:09.150> out<00:01:09.299> half<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.290> heart<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.710> that

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
I'm cutting out half of a heart so that

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.920 
I'm cutting out half of a heart so that
when<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.130> pull<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.460> open<00:01:11.640> just<00:01:11.880> like<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:12.720> it

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
when you pull it open just like this it

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.260 
when you pull it open just like this it
has<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.290> perfectly<00:01:13.830> symmetrical<00:01:14.760> hot<00:01:15.030> so

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
has a perfectly symmetrical hot so

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.999 
has a perfectly symmetrical hot so
that's<00:01:15.450> why<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.750> want<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.229> tape<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.710> be<00:01:16.830> not

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
that's why you want the tape to be not

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.460 
that's why you want the tape to be not
so<00:01:17.040> sticky<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.630> will<00:01:18.750> be<00:01:18.780> easy<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.439> I

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470

bit<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.610> makes<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.970> look<00:01:33.000> really<00:01:33.329> unique<00:01:33.780> so

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
bit and makes it look really unique so

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.780 
bit and makes it look really unique so
when<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.470> dry<00:01:34.710> I'm<00:01:34.770> gently<00:01:35.100> peeling<00:01:35.640> off

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
when that is dry I'm gently peeling off

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.520 
when that is dry I'm gently peeling off
the<00:01:35.820> tape<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.750> have<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:36.990> perfectly

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
the tape and you have a perfectly

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.499 
the tape and you have a perfectly
symmetrical<00:01:38.159> heart<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.610> course<00:01:38.970> because<00:01:39.329> that

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
symmetrical heart of course because that

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.719 
symmetrical heart of course because that
is<00:01:39.630> what<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.990> cut<00:01:40.200> out<00:01:40.439> but<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.310> doesn't<00:01:41.430> have

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
is what you cut out but it doesn't have

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.429 
is what you cut out but it doesn't have
to<00:01:41.880> be<00:01:41.909> perfect<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.540> can<00:01:42.750> make<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.020> any<00:01:43.229> way

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
to be perfect you can make it any way

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.080 
to be perfect you can make it any way
that<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.799> would<00:01:43.890> like<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.790> how<00:01:44.939> my

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
that you would like so this is how my

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.209 
that you would like so this is how my
first<00:01:45.420> tutorial<00:01:45.570> looks

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:53.469 

so<00:01:52.219> the<00:01:52.340> second<00:01:52.729> one<00:01:52.880> is<00:01:52.909> a<00:01:53.060> heart<00:01:53.360> attack

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
so the second one is a heart attack

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.050 
so the second one is a heart attack

sighs so you're gonna take a thin brush
and<00:02:05.179> start<00:02:05.390> making<00:02:05.569> a<00:02:05.869> horizontal<00:02:06.619> line<00:02:06.649> just

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
and start making a horizontal line just

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.550 
and start making a horizontal line just
like<00:02:07.250> this<00:02:07.579> and<00:02:07.789> then<00:02:07.970> extend<00:02:08.509> it<00:02:08.630> up<00:02:08.750> to<00:02:09.289> form

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
like this and then extend it up to form

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.620 
like this and then extend it up to form
a<00:02:09.709> peak<00:02:10.099> and<00:02:10.280> you're<00:02:10.459> bringing<00:02:10.729> it<00:02:11.000> down<00:02:11.390> in

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
a peak and you're bringing it down in

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.680 
a peak and you're bringing it down in
the<00:02:11.750> next<00:02:12.019> side<00:02:12.200> just<00:02:12.769> like<00:02:12.980> this<00:02:13.459> and<00:02:13.690> putting

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
the next side just like this and putting

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.690 
the next side just like this and putting
another<00:02:14.989> horizontal<00:02:15.410> line<00:02:15.920> to<00:02:16.099> close<00:02:16.370> it<00:02:16.580> off

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
another horizontal line to close it off

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.119 
another horizontal line to close it off
so<00:02:17.420> for<00:02:17.569> my<00:02:17.690> next<00:02:17.900> nail<00:02:18.140> i'm<00:02:18.319> doing<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.769> exact

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
same thing but i'm gonna do two peaks

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.500

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.960 
instead of once i'm doing a really tall
one<00:02:23.810> like<00:02:23.989> this<00:02:24.170> one<00:02:24.440> and<00:02:24.620> a<00:02:25.130> short<00:02:25.160> saw<00:02:25.610> one<00:02:25.790> on

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
one like this one and a short saw one on

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.180 
one like this one and a short saw one on
this<00:02:26.180> side<00:02:26.480> of<00:02:26.540> it<00:02:26.870> so<00:02:27.110> off<00:02:27.260> to<00:02:27.290> HP<00:02:27.920> you're

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
gonna put a horizontal line like this

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.550 
gonna put a horizontal line like this
and<00:02:31.480> you<00:02:32.480> just<00:02:32.660> really<00:02:32.930> need<00:02:33.049> to<00:02:33.170> know<00:02:33.290> which

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
and you just really need to know which

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.130 
and you just really need to know which
nail<00:02:33.920> has<00:02:34.549> the<00:02:34.880> most<00:02:35.090> space<00:02:35.450> so<00:02:35.690> you<00:02:35.780> can<00:02:35.810> do<00:02:36.019> as

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
nail has the most space so you can do as

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.080 
nail has the most space so you can do as
much<00:02:36.470> Peaks<00:02:36.860> as<00:02:37.099> possible<00:02:37.640> my<00:02:37.730> nails<00:02:37.940> are

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.339 
peak on one nail but this is how the
final<00:02:43.250> design<00:02:43.910> looks<00:02:44.510> and<00:02:44.750> I<00:02:44.810> really<00:02:45.200> really
