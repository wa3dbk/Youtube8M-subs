them like okay you're the second-best
team<00:03:58.420> in<00:03:58.719> Western<00:03:59.290> Conference<00:03:59.709> I<00:03:59.829> think<00:04:00.189> the

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
team in Western Conference I think the

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.800 
team in Western Conference I think the
summer<00:04:00.549> was<00:04:00.730> good<00:04:00.969> to<00:04:01.060> settle<00:04:01.329> them<00:04:01.420> down<00:04:01.450> they

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
summer was good to settle them down they

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.899 
summer was good to settle them down they
play<00:04:02.049> it<00:04:02.140> again<00:04:02.379> they<00:04:02.560> got<00:04:02.709> out<00:04:02.920> there<00:04:03.159> so

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:03.909 
play it again they got out there so

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:04.979 
play it again they got out there so
those<00:04:04.060> two<00:04:04.239> guys<00:04:04.359> will<00:04:04.569> be<00:04:04.659> in<00:04:04.750> great<00:04:04.959> shape

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
those two guys will be in great shape

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.470 
those two guys will be in great shape
ready<00:04:05.530> to<00:04:05.620> lead<00:04:05.769> the<00:04:05.920> team<00:04:06.099> but<00:04:06.310> why<00:04:06.819> I'm<00:04:07.120> still

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
ready to lead the team but why I'm still

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.059 
ready to lead the team but why I'm still
going<00:04:07.599> to<00:04:07.659> put<00:04:07.870> San<00:04:08.109> Antonio<00:04:08.680> and<00:04:08.739> probably

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
going to put San Antonio and probably

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.429 
going to put San Antonio and probably
Dallas<00:04:09.400> ahead<00:04:09.969> of<00:04:10.060> them<00:04:10.239> but<00:04:10.840> i<00:04:11.049> do<00:04:11.109> believe

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:11.439 
Dallas ahead of them but i do believe

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:12.989 
Dallas ahead of them but i do believe
they<00:04:11.739> can<00:04:11.859> get<00:04:11.950> home<00:04:12.129> court<00:04:12.340> advantage<00:04:12.400> i

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:12.999 
they can get home court advantage i

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:14.910 
they can get home court advantage i
think<00:04:13.450> the<00:04:13.540> biggest<00:04:13.719> question<00:04:14.200> for<00:04:14.379> me<00:04:14.469> now<00:04:14.650> is

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
think the biggest question for me now is

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.979 
think the biggest question for me now is
can<00:04:15.280> you<00:04:15.489> handle<00:04:15.519> everybody<00:04:16.359> coming<00:04:16.780> to<00:04:16.870> look

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
can you handle everybody coming to look

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.300 
can you handle everybody coming to look

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.980

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
difference between being the hunter and

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.830 
difference between being the hunter and
the<00:04:32.620> hunted<00:04:33.180> exactly<00:04:34.180> the<00:04:34.300> shot<00:04:34.510> clock<00:04:34.690> is

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
the hunted exactly the shot clock is

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.270 
the hunted exactly the shot clock is
winding<00:04:34.990> down<00:04:35.200> guys<00:04:35.530> Katie<00:04:35.860> MVP<00:04:37.770> no<00:04:38.770> but<00:04:39.130> he's

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
winding down guys Katie MVP no but he's

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.680

he'll<00:04:42.430> win<00:04:42.580> multiple<00:04:43.060> MVP<00:04:43.389> MVP<00:04:43.630> he<00:04:44.290> has<00:04:44.380> a

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
he'll win multiple MVP MVP he has a

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:45.930 
he'll win multiple MVP MVP he has a
better<00:04:44.680> chance<00:04:44.800> Colby<00:04:45.460> getting<00:04:45.700> off<00:04:45.760> to<00:04:45.910> a
