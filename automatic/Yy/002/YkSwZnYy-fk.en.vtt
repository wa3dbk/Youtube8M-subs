is just a little bit silly and plus he
comes<00:03:24.959> from<00:03:25.140> Dimension<00:03:25.620> X<00:03:25.739> I<00:03:25.950> mean<00:03:26.100> it's<00:03:26.250> silly

Dimension X and of course the

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.280 
Dimension X and of course the
Technodrome<00:03:37.650> okay<00:03:38.340> with<00:03:38.519> Tecna<00:03:38.970> dome<00:03:39.290> tecnico

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
Technodrome okay with Tecna dome tecnico

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.590 
Technodrome okay with Tecna dome tecnico
more<00:03:40.530> Technodrome<00:03:41.040> I<00:03:41.250> can<00:03:41.579> remember<00:03:41.790> but<00:03:42.269> one

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
more Technodrome I can remember but one

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.289 
more Technodrome I can remember but one
or<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.810> other<00:03:42.859> the<00:03:43.859> fact<00:03:44.070> is<00:03:44.220> that<00:03:44.280> if<00:03:44.730> kraang

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
or the other the fact is that if kraang

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.280 
or the other the fact is that if kraang
exists<00:03:45.840> then<00:03:46.230> Dimension<00:03:47.100> X<00:03:47.250> has<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:48.030> exist<00:03:48.450> but

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
exists then Dimension X has to exist but

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.259 
exists then Dimension X has to exist but
we<00:03:49.590> are<00:03:49.680> talking<00:03:50.130> about<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.459> Michael<00:03:51.000> Bay

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:42.969 
just do that but now here's the thing we

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:44.189 
just do that but now here's the thing we
are<00:05:43.090> talking<00:05:43.479> about<00:05:43.569> a<00:05:43.690> Michael<00:05:44.110> Bay

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:44.199 
are talking about a Michael Bay

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:45.839 
are talking about a Michael Bay
production<00:05:44.740> and<00:05:44.889> you<00:05:44.979> know<00:05:45.099> Michael<00:05:45.460> Bay<00:05:45.639> is

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:45.849 
production and you know Michael Bay is

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:47.850 
production and you know Michael Bay is
responsible<00:05:46.449> for<00:05:46.630> doing<00:05:46.870> for<00:05:47.139> making<00:05:47.620> a<00:05:47.710> lot

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
responsible for doing for making a lot

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.860 
responsible for doing for making a lot
of<00:05:47.889> changes<00:05:48.370> to<00:05:48.400> our<00:05:48.580> childhood<00:05:49.000> cartoons<00:05:49.569> gay

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
of changes to our childhood cartoons gay

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.019 
of changes to our childhood cartoons gay
now<00:05:50.349> it's<00:05:50.560> possible<00:05:51.159> and<00:05:51.340> this<00:05:51.490> is<00:05:51.669> just<00:05:51.789> my

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:52.029 
now it's possible and this is just my

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:53.760 
now it's possible and this is just my
personal<00:05:52.060> theory<00:05:52.810> I<00:05:52.960> just<00:05:53.199> came<00:05:53.349> up<00:05:53.500> with<00:05:53.650> this

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
personal theory I just came up with this

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.589 
personal theory I just came up with this
and<00:05:54.009> that<00:05:54.430> is<00:05:54.639> the<00:05:54.909> change<00:05:55.210> that<00:05:55.449> they're

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:55.599 
and that is the change that they're

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:59.459 
and that is the change that they're
gonna<00:05:55.719> make<00:05:55.990> is<00:05:56.199> that<00:05:56.409> kraang<00:05:56.860> is<00:05:57.900> also<00:05:58.900> the

00:05:59.459 --> 00:05:59.469 
gonna make is that kraang is also the

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:01.769 
gonna make is that kraang is also the
production<00:06:00.219> of<00:06:00.400> humans<00:06:01.029> like<00:06:01.300> he's<00:06:01.449> the<00:06:01.599> i

00:06:01.769 --> 00:06:01.779 
production of humans like he's the i

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:04.649 
production of humans like he's the i
create<00:06:02.409> he's<00:06:02.620> a<00:06:02.650> product<00:06:03.190> of<00:06:03.340> humans<00:06:04.029> he's<00:06:04.479> a

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:04.659 
create he's a product of humans he's a

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:08.430 
create he's a product of humans he's a
creation<00:06:05.590> of<00:06:06.000> of<00:06:07.000> some<00:06:07.719> intelligent

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 
creation of of some intelligent

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.249 
creation of of some intelligent
life-form<00:06:09.069> through<00:06:09.610> mutagen<00:06:10.300> which

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:11.259 
life-form through mutagen which

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:13.619 
life-form through mutagen which
essentially<00:06:11.949> comes<00:06:12.580> in<00:06:12.729> a<00:06:12.789> form<00:06:13.029> of<00:06:13.150> a<00:06:13.270> brain

00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:13.629 
essentially comes in a form of a brain

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:17.159 
essentially comes in a form of a brain
with<00:06:13.900> arms<00:06:14.830> again<00:06:15.520> that's<00:06:15.940> my<00:06:16.180> theory<00:06:16.539> because

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:17.169 
with arms again that's my theory because

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:18.600 
with arms again that's my theory because
you<00:06:17.199> know<00:06:17.379> how<00:06:17.560> Michael<00:06:17.919> Bay<00:06:18.039> is<00:06:18.099> known<00:06:18.370> for

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
you know how Michael Bay is known for

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.969 
you know how Michael Bay is known for
changing<00:06:19.150> things<00:06:19.449> and<00:06:19.750> I'm<00:06:20.469> just<00:06:20.740> praying

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:20.979 
changing things and I'm just praying

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:22.920 
changing things and I'm just praying
that<00:06:21.129> I'm<00:06:21.340> wrong<00:06:21.580> okay<00:06:22.330> because<00:06:22.599> if<00:06:22.719> they<00:06:22.870> do

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
that I'm wrong okay because if they do

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.080 
that I'm wrong okay because if they do
that<00:06:23.349> I<00:06:23.590> guess<00:06:23.979> I<00:06:24.009> suit<00:06:24.370> I<00:06:24.550> shouldn't<00:06:24.969> be

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
that I guess I suit I shouldn't be

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.719 
that I guess I suit I shouldn't be
surprised<00:06:25.539> but<00:06:26.229> still<00:06:26.560> it<00:06:26.770> changes<00:06:27.340> a<00:06:27.370> lot<00:06:27.580> of

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:27.729 
surprised but still it changes a lot of

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:30.899 
surprised but still it changes a lot of
the<00:06:27.819> mythos<00:06:28.210> and<00:06:28.539> well<00:06:29.310> it's<00:06:30.310> michael<00:06:30.610> bay<00:06:30.699> for

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:30.909 
the mythos and well it's michael bay for

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:33.329
