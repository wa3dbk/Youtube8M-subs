in this clip we're going to talk about

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.990 
in this clip we're going to talk about
the<00:00:14.179> different<00:00:14.539> sizes<00:00:14.839> of<00:00:15.369> granulation<00:00:16.369> that

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
the different sizes of granulation that

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.120 
the different sizes of granulation that
real<00:00:17.210> salt<00:00:17.539> comes<00:00:17.869> in<00:00:18.050> it's<00:00:18.470> all<00:00:18.770> the<00:00:18.920> same

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
real salt comes in it's all the same

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.920 
real salt comes in it's all the same
salt<00:00:19.490> that<00:00:19.939> we'll<00:00:20.119> talk<00:00:20.300> about<00:00:20.570> it's<00:00:20.750> just

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
salt that we'll talk about it's just

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.170 
salt that we'll talk about it's just
different<00:00:21.140> sizes<00:00:21.590> of<00:00:21.860> particle<00:00:22.490> the<00:00:22.970> most

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
different sizes of particle the most

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.359 
different sizes of particle the most
common<00:00:23.570> or<00:00:23.689> most<00:00:23.720> popular<00:00:24.259> size<00:00:24.500> is<00:00:24.860> our<00:00:25.070> fine

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
common or most popular size is our fine

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.640 
common or most popular size is our fine
size<00:00:25.699> this<00:00:26.329> is<00:00:26.390> the<00:00:26.570> size<00:00:26.689> that<00:00:26.900> is<00:00:27.289> typically

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
size this is the size that is typically

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.460 
size this is the size that is typically
found<00:00:27.920> as<00:00:28.189> a<00:00:28.220> table<00:00:28.670> salt<00:00:28.910> and<00:00:29.119> as<00:00:29.960> you<00:00:30.080> can<00:00:30.259> see

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
found as a table salt and as you can see

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.509 
found as a table salt and as you can see
here<00:00:31.059> it's<00:00:32.059> just<00:00:32.570> a<00:00:32.689> nice<00:00:32.930> fine<00:00:33.559> consistent

00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:34.519 
here it's just a nice fine consistent

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:38.829 
here it's just a nice fine consistent
flake<00:00:35.480> of<00:00:35.750> salt<00:00:36.910> so<00:00:37.910> this<00:00:38.089> is<00:00:38.239> the<00:00:38.300> most<00:00:38.480> common

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:38.839

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:41.680 
flake of salt so this is the most common
size<00:00:39.050> is<00:00:39.470> the<00:00:39.860> 26<00:00:40.280> ounce<00:00:40.460> pouch<00:00:40.790> of<00:00:41.269> the<00:00:41.449> fine

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
of crystal this particular size of

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.580 
of crystal this particular size of
crystal<00:01:27.830> is<00:01:27.920> known<00:01:28.070> as<00:01:28.220> kosher<00:01:28.640> salt<00:01:28.940> as<00:01:29.590> you

crystal is known as kosher salt as you

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.190 
crystal is known as kosher salt as you
can<00:01:30.800> see<00:01:31.040> this<00:01:31.280> salt<00:01:31.640> is<00:01:31.790> about<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:32.630> size<00:01:32.900> of<00:01:33.080> a

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
can see this salt is about the size of a

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.899 
can see this salt is about the size of a
crystal<00:01:33.590> that<00:01:33.620> you<00:01:33.770> might<00:01:33.980> see<00:01:34.310> on<00:01:34.340> top<00:01:34.670> of<00:01:34.850> a

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
crystal that you might see on top of a

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.350 
crystal that you might see on top of a
pretzel<00:01:35.210> or<00:01:35.570> that<00:01:36.560> you<00:01:36.680> might<00:01:36.890> see<00:01:37.280> on<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:38.180> rim

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
pretzel or that you might see on the rim

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.210 
pretzel or that you might see on the rim
of<00:01:38.540> a<00:01:38.600> margarita<00:01:38.630> glass<00:01:39.350> this<00:01:39.650> is<00:01:39.830> a<00:01:39.860> little

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
of a margarita glass this is a little

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.730 
of a margarita glass this is a little
bit<00:01:40.340> larger<00:01:40.820> flake<00:01:41.150> of<00:01:41.360> crystal<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:41.960> the

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
bit larger flake of crystal and the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.649 
bit larger flake of crystal and the
reason<00:01:43.070> this<00:01:43.220> size<00:01:43.550> is<00:01:43.880> known<00:01:44.030> as<00:01:44.180> koshering

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
reason this size is known as koshering

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.590 
reason this size is known as koshering
is<00:01:44.930> because<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:46.280> larger<00:01:46.700> crystal<00:01:47.180> will<00:01:47.330> suck

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
is because the larger crystal will suck

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.050 
is because the larger crystal will suck
blood<00:01:47.930> and<00:01:48.140> juice<00:01:48.380> out<00:01:48.620> of<00:01:48.800> meat<00:01:49.010> faster<00:01:49.580> than

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
blood and juice out of meat faster than

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.600 
blood and juice out of meat faster than
a<00:01:50.090> finer<00:01:50.450> crystal<00:01:51.020> without<00:01:51.470> making<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.370> meat

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
a finer crystal without making the meat

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.210 
a finer crystal without making the meat
overly<00:01:53.120> salty<00:01:53.600> so<00:01:54.200> again<00:01:54.560> when<00:01:54.710> a<00:01:54.740> recipe

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
overly salty so again when a recipe

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.490 
overly salty so again when a recipe
calls<00:01:55.490> for<00:01:55.610> kosher<00:01:55.970> salt<00:01:56.479> you're<00:01:57.020> not<00:01:57.170> looking
