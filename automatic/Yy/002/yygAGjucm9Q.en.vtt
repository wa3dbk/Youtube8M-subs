00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.580
 biosynthesis most acids 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.580
 fatty substances found in the body 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.379
 are admitted through the diet 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.419
 but generally when the amount of 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:17.360
 Fatty acids are higher than required 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:20.689
 it is said that there is an excess and it is stored 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:24.560
 in the form of triglycerides this occurs in 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:26.510
 the cells called adipocytes there is another 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.150
 molecule from which you can 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.000
 generate fatty acids this molecule is 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.400
 very important and it's glucose happens 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.590
 that glucose and other carbohydrates are 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.930
 can convert into fat but low 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.760
 certain conditions because at 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.670
 principle of glucose that is in 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.720
 excess is stored as glycogen that is 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.330
 mostly found in the liver 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.130
 when there is already excess of glycogen 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.100
 glucose starts to degrade by the 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:57.060
 process known as glycolysis the 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.860
 glycolysis finally generates pyruvate 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.980
 this is a molecule that enters between 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.540
 the cytoplasm and the membrane when the 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.870
 pyruvate is inside the membrane 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.370
 comes an enzyme called pyruvate 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.820
 dehydrogenase that makes it 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.350
 acetyl coenzyme this molecule is a 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.830
 intermediary in many routes 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.900
 biochemistry at this point the acetyl 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.690
 coenzyme is getting involved in a 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.030
 energetic process where he goes to 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.790
 enter what is known the cycle of 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.860
 citric acid and then here they go to 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.170
 generate several molecules that are going to 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.110
 move to what is called phosphorylation 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.410
 oxidative or conveyor chain 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:41.350
 electrons in this process is where it 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:44.410
 produces atp but when the cell does not 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.330
 is requiring so much energy that is not 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.090
 you need the atp 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.820
 then the acetyl coenzyme gives should 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.770
 stored and stored under the 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.619
 acid form 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.530
 this is what is known as 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.409
 lipogenesis and subsequently the acids 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.500
 fatty acids are converted into triglycerides 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.619
 as previously mentioned this is 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.530
 Repeat in several steps in the first step 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.780
 let's have acetyl coenzyme that will be 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.200
 our protagonist molecule in this 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.660
 process the acetyl coenzyme as it exists 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.940
 inside the mitochondria he must leave 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.280
 to the cytoplasmic space because the 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.130
 enzymes that are involved in it 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.770
 lipogenesis are only found in the 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.800
 cytoplasm 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.080
 then the aesthetic above has to 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.420
 be transformed into another molecule to 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.880
 that can easily go out to the 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.430
 cytoplasm this process happens from the 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.319
 Following way 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.110
 initially the acetyl coenzyme gives 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.640
 combines with the acetate lock salt and it 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.360
 turns into a molecule called 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.400
 citrate citrate is transported by 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.700
 a molecule that allows to cross the 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.800
 membrane since it is inside comes another 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.010
 enzyme and separate them again in acetyl 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.200
 and ox to acetate this one is needed 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.830
 recycle production of an enzyme 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:12.010
 xenon maika and you spend a nh and you 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.050
 becomes bad for the wrong act is re 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.269
 transformed into pyruvate and thanks to 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:20.610
 this reaction are occurring the 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:23.019
 molecules in the ph with h more 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.920
 again the pyruvate has the 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:29.380
 possibility of entering the mitochondria 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.360
 then it becomes exhales de tato and 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.820
 this cycle is repeated several times 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.130
 lipogenesis is the metabolic process 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.010
 by which it is synthesized in acids 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:43.240
 fatty acids from acetyl molecules 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.780
 with top this is a metabolic process 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:49.140
 anabolic 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.900
 this metabolic path extend agonizing already 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.760
 that requires the atp start at 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.520
 acetyl coenzyme gives and ends in 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:00.020
 palmitate the enzymes involved are 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:03.750
 acetyl transferase balloon and transferase 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:07.830
 hydroxyethyl dehydrated in oil 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:11.180
 reductase is easy without hedge rate so 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:14.560
 reductasa and you wait 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.840
 It has four condensation processes 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:22.250
 reduction dehydration and release of 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.889
 palmitate acetyl coenzyme acp by medium 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:28.160
 of the enzyme acetyl transferase form 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:31.130
 acetyl after the malon and the 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:35.180
 coenzyme by means of the wrong enzyme 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:38.090
 o'neal transferase forms acp after the 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.550
 acetyl acp and malone union and the cpe by 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:44.690
 half of the enzyme thus accepted the belt 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.660
 acp plus co2 is released to form acetyl 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.690
 acp 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.660
 once we have acetil acp by means 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:56.770
 of the concept enzyme so reductos to the 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:05:00.040
 Reduced pH enea will happen to be n 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:03.970
 oxidized adepe and hydroxy form bottura la 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:06.270
 cpe since we have hydroxybutyric acp 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.830
 by means of the hydroxyl enzyme 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.350
 dehydrated is going to consume a 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.650
 water molecule to thus form great 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.660
 useful acp once obtained and crotone the 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:20.950
 cpe by means of the enzyme in oil 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:24.610
 reductase the ph reduced enea happens to 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:27.940
 rusty ndp to form butter and the 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.190
 cpe since we have useful and the cpe is 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:33.160
 Repeat the cycle six times to form 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.939
 palmito and the acp that through uncles 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:39.189
 terrace releases pal half 

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:42.599
 oxidation by fat the first step is the 

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:45.699
 Oxidation of the fatty acid by the a-5 a 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:48.180
 dehydrogenase the enzyme catalyzes the 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:52.080
 formation of a double bond between c2 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:54.939
 carbon alpha and carbon beta c3 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.659
 hydration the next step is the 

00:05:54.939 --> 00:06:01.000
 hydration of the bond between c2 and c3 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:05.419
 this reaction is I hope specific 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:08.730
 forming only the hat 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:13.080
 oxidation by met the third step is the 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:15.479
 oxidation of the e3 hydroxy thus coa 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:19.110
 the nothing that turns the group 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:22.650
 hydroxyl in a seton group to dialysis 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:26.070
 the final step is the separation of 30 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:29.130
 so the coa by the group of all of another 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:32.289
 molecule of coa the uncle is inserted 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:35.050
 Between c2 and c3 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:36.849
 and with this we terminate some 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.119
 of the steps for the formation of 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:39.119
 lipids
