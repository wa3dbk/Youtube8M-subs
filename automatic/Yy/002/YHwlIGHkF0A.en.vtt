so<00:01:46.979> I'll<00:01:47.100> get<00:01:47.220> into<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.670> second<00:01:48.030> we<00:01:48.600> got

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
so I'll get into that in a second we got

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.600 
so I'll get into that in a second we got
a<00:01:48.899> rear<00:01:49.140> fender<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.920> actually<00:01:50.220> has<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.369> rear

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
accessory the front light however is

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.399 
accessory the front light however is
actually<00:01:56.460> wired<00:01:56.729> in<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.210> fairly<00:01:57.899> adjustable

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
actually wired in and fairly adjustable

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.440 
actually wired in and fairly adjustable
you<00:01:58.439> can<00:01:58.649> aim<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:58.920> it's<00:01:59.520> connected<00:02:00.210> right<00:02:00.420> to

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
you can aim it it's connected right to

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.660 
you can aim it it's connected right to
the<00:02:00.750> fork<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:01.350> it's<00:02:01.680> not<00:02:01.829> on<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.070> fender<00:02:02.520> it's

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
the fork so it's not on a fender it's

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.709 
the fork so it's not on a fender it's
not<00:02:02.759> going<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.939> be<00:02:03.000> bouncing<00:02:03.360> around<00:02:03.390> or

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
not going to be bouncing around or

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.649 
not going to be bouncing around or
anything<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.729> they've<00:02:05.729> got<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.030> set<00:02:06.240> up<00:02:06.270> so<00:02:06.540> it

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
anything and they've got it set up so it

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.630 
anything and they've got it set up so it
can<00:02:06.810> just<00:02:07.020> like<00:02:07.649> basically<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.129> plug<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.520> in

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
can just like basically you plug it in

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.510 
can just like basically you plug it in
here<00:02:09.000> this<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.840> same<00:02:10.080> port<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:10.950> plug

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
here this is the same port that you plug

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.280 
here this is the same port that you plug
the<00:02:11.640> whole<00:02:11.790> bike<00:02:11.970> in<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.300> charge<00:02:12.540> it

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
the whole bike in to charge it

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.750 
the whole bike in to charge it
or<00:02:13.379> you<00:02:13.530> can<00:02:13.680> take<00:02:13.799> the<00:02:13.950> battery<00:02:14.250> out<00:02:14.310> and

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
or you can take the battery out and

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.149 
or you can take the battery out and
charge<00:02:15.299> it<00:02:15.420> separately<00:02:15.870> so<00:02:16.829> that's<00:02:16.980> one<00:02:17.069> of

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
charge it separately so that's one of

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.709 
charge it separately so that's one of
the<00:02:17.219> cool<00:02:17.370> things<00:02:17.640> about<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:18.090> bike<00:02:18.299> and<00:02:18.510> some

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:18.719 
the cool things about this bike and some

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:21.020 
the cool things about this bike and some
others<00:02:19.019> you<00:02:19.650> can<00:02:19.799> take<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.129> battery<00:02:20.400> off<00:02:20.489> and

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
others you can take the battery off and

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.280 
others you can take the battery off and
that's<00:02:21.329> perfect<00:02:21.870> for<00:02:21.930> if<00:02:22.109> you're

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
that's perfect for if you're

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.170 
that's perfect for if you're
transporting<00:02:22.739> this<00:02:23.010> like<00:02:23.219> on<00:02:23.370> your<00:02:23.519> car<00:02:23.700> using

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
transporting this like on your car using

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.670 
transporting this like on your car using
a<00:02:24.269> car<00:02:24.480> rack<00:02:24.719> or<00:02:24.959> whatever<00:02:25.200> because<00:02:25.409> it<00:02:25.530> makes

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
a car rack or whatever because it makes

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.830 
a car rack or whatever because it makes
the<00:02:25.829> bike<00:02:25.980> lighter<00:02:26.310> easier<00:02:26.969> to<00:02:27.090> lift<00:02:27.269> of

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
the bike lighter easier to lift of

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.660 
the bike lighter easier to lift of
course<00:02:28.109> if<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:28.379> store<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.739> battery<00:02:29.069> inside

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
course if you store the battery inside

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.399 
course if you store the battery inside
with<00:02:30.329> like<00:02:30.480> neutral<00:02:30.870> temperatures<00:02:31.290> it's

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
with like neutral temperatures it's

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.740 
with like neutral temperatures it's
gonna<00:02:31.560> last<00:02:31.799> longer<00:02:32.159> that's<00:02:33.120> just<00:02:33.329> the<00:02:33.629> right

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
gonna last longer that's just the right

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.030 
gonna last longer that's just the right
way<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:33.989> do<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.200> but<00:02:34.470> it's<00:02:34.590> really<00:02:34.829> well

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
way to do it but it's really well

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.979 
way to do it but it's really well
concealed<00:02:35.579> I<00:02:35.790> mean<00:02:35.909> this<00:02:36.030> could<00:02:36.750> pass<00:02:36.959> for

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
concealed I mean this could pass for

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.830

which is pretty pretty sweet it's gonna

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.520 
which is pretty pretty sweet it's gonna
be<00:04:15.269> like<00:04:15.419> a<00:04:15.449> little<00:04:15.629> bit<00:04:15.810> of<00:04:15.870> a<00:04:15.930> shorter<00:04:16.289> frame

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
be like a little bit of a shorter frame

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.020 
be like a little bit of a shorter frame
easier<00:04:17.099> to<00:04:17.250> mount<00:04:17.400> like<00:04:17.729> if<00:04:17.880> you're<00:04:18.000> just

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
easier to mount like if you're just

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.749 
easier to mount like if you're just
someone<00:04:18.690> who's<00:04:18.870> not<00:04:19.049> as<00:04:19.199> tall<00:04:19.489> that<00:04:20.489> that

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:20.759 
someone who's not as tall that that

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:22.219 
someone who's not as tall that that
would<00:04:20.909> be<00:04:21.030> ideal<00:04:21.180> and<00:04:21.570> it<00:04:21.630> comes<00:04:21.840> in<00:04:22.019> sort<00:04:22.169> of

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
would be ideal and it comes in sort of

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.159 
would be ideal and it comes in sort of
like<00:04:22.409> a<00:04:22.440> dark<00:04:23.400> red<00:04:23.700> or<00:04:24.060> white<00:04:24.750> so<00:04:25.260> that

it's<00:04:38.889> a<00:04:39.009> good<00:04:39.189> setup<00:04:39.490> but<00:04:39.729> they've<00:04:39.819> been

00:04:39.929 --> 00:04:39.939 
it's a good setup but they've been

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:42.540 
it's a good setup but they've been
refining<00:04:40.629> and<00:04:40.779> tweaking<00:04:40.900> things<00:04:41.439> for<00:04:42.340> a<00:04:42.370> while

started<00:04:48.310> out<00:04:48.400> with<00:04:48.580> a<00:04:48.610> pretty<00:04:48.819> good<00:04:48.999> product

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.809 
started out with a pretty good product
too<00:04:49.509> and<00:04:49.719> so<00:04:49.870> now<00:04:50.199> it's<00:04:50.409> just<00:04:50.650> like<00:04:50.830> you<00:04:51.699> know

there<00:05:02.529> are<00:05:02.650> five<00:05:02.949> levels<00:05:02.979> of<00:05:03.430> pedal<00:05:03.580> assist

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
there are five levels of pedal assist

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.679 
there are five levels of pedal assist
and<00:05:04.389> what's<00:05:05.110> cool<00:05:05.379> is<00:05:05.409> in<00:05:05.919> zero<00:05:06.370> you<00:05:07.330> can<00:05:07.509> just

00:05:07.679 --> 00:05:07.689 
and what's cool is in zero you can just

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:09.600 
and what's cool is in zero you can just
go<00:05:07.840> throttle<00:05:08.229> mode<00:05:08.469> so<00:05:08.860> you<00:05:08.919> don't<00:05:09.099> need<00:05:09.279> to

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
go throttle mode so you don't need to

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.240 
go throttle mode so you don't need to
like<00:05:09.819> be<00:05:10.150> in<00:05:11.110> pedal<00:05:11.469> assist<00:05:11.710> and<00:05:12.009> then<00:05:12.099> have

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
like be in pedal assist and then have

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.950 
like be in pedal assist and then have
that<00:05:12.279> moment<00:05:12.639> where<00:05:12.879> you<00:05:13.330> forget<00:05:13.659> and<00:05:13.930> you

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
that moment where you forget and you

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.749 
that moment where you forget and you
pedal<00:05:14.379> and<00:05:14.439> you're<00:05:14.529> like<00:05:14.650> oh<00:05:14.919> and<00:05:15.279> it's<00:05:15.400> you

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:15.759 
pedal and you're like oh and it's you

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:17.519 
pedal and you're like oh and it's you
know<00:05:15.789> so<00:05:16.150> anyway<00:05:16.449> that's<00:05:16.719> like<00:05:16.930> a<00:05:16.960> minor<00:05:17.229> gripe

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:17.529 
know so anyway that's like a minor gripe

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:19.920 
know so anyway that's like a minor gripe
but<00:05:18.159> something<00:05:18.879> I<00:05:18.939> appreciate<00:05:19.389> check<00:05:19.839> this

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
but something I appreciate check this

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.839 
but something I appreciate check this
out<00:05:20.110> like<00:05:20.289> you<00:05:20.650> just<00:05:20.800> you're<00:05:21.279> on<00:05:21.400> it<00:05:21.550> I'm<00:05:21.699> in

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:21.849 
out like you just you're on it I'm in

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:27.909 
out like you just you're on it I'm in
zero<00:05:22.089> and<00:05:22.509> it<00:05:23.259> just<00:05:23.469> it<00:05:24.069> flies<00:05:25.259> alright

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
zero and it just it flies alright

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:32.230 
zero and it just it flies alright
we're<00:05:28.430> just<00:05:28.610> like<00:05:29.409> instantly<00:05:30.409> taking<00:05:31.099> off<00:05:31.250> I'm

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
we're just like instantly taking off I'm

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:59.150 
we're just like instantly taking off I'm
gonna<00:05:32.419> show<00:05:32.659> you<00:05:32.719> the<00:05:32.870> motor<00:05:36.250> there<00:05:37.250> we<00:05:37.400> go

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.399 

no<00:06:00.160> problem<00:06:00.759> no<00:06:01.330> peddling<00:06:01.780> we<00:06:01.960> were<00:06:02.080> like<00:06:02.229> up

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:02.409 
no problem no peddling we were like up

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:04.649 
no problem no peddling we were like up
to<00:06:02.440> 20<00:06:02.889> miles<00:06:03.039> per<00:06:03.190> hour<00:06:03.340> they're<00:06:03.759> climbing<00:06:04.449> a

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:04.659 
to 20 miles per hour they're climbing a

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:07.050 
to 20 miles per hour they're climbing a
little<00:06:04.900> incline<00:06:05.289> which<00:06:05.560> is<00:06:05.740> nice<00:06:05.970> now<00:06:06.970> I'm

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
little incline which is nice now I'm

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.540 
little incline which is nice now I'm
gonna<00:06:07.150> do<00:06:07.389> just<00:06:07.659> pedal<00:06:08.169> assist<00:06:08.470> its<00:06:09.190> got<00:06:09.370> like

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
gonna do just pedal assist its got like

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.969 
gonna do just pedal assist its got like
a<00:06:09.610> kind<00:06:10.240> of<00:06:10.300> a<00:06:10.360> basic<00:06:10.780> like<00:06:10.990> six<00:06:11.259> sensor<00:06:11.560> magnet

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:11.979 
a kind of a basic like six sensor magnet

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:15.240 
a kind of a basic like six sensor magnet
so<00:06:12.430> it<00:06:12.550> senses<00:06:13.000> when<00:06:13.030> when<00:06:13.720> you<00:06:13.870> pedal<00:06:14.080> and<00:06:14.409> it

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
so it senses when when you pedal and it

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.249 
so it senses when when you pedal and it
just<00:06:15.460> goes<00:06:15.789> on<00:06:15.840> anytime<00:06:16.840> your<00:06:16.960> feet<00:06:17.139> are

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:17.259 
just goes on anytime your feet are

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:19.980 
just goes on anytime your feet are
moving<00:06:17.289> it<00:06:17.740> goes<00:06:18.270> which<00:06:19.270> which<00:06:19.599> is<00:06:19.629> like<00:06:19.960> a

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
moving it goes which which is like a

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.990 
moving it goes which which is like a
positive<00:06:20.289> and<00:06:20.650> a<00:06:20.680> negative<00:06:20.789> like<00:06:21.789> it's<00:06:21.940> a

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
positive and a negative like it's a

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.240 
positive and a negative like it's a
little<00:06:22.240> less<00:06:22.389> responsive<00:06:23.110> when<00:06:23.409> you<00:06:23.560> stop<00:06:23.889> so

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250 
little less responsive when you stop so

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:33.100 
little less responsive when you stop so
I'm<00:06:24.340> gonna<00:06:24.430> show<00:06:24.669> that<00:06:24.849> real<00:06:25.060> quick

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.110 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.140 

so<00:06:33.620> you<00:06:33.710> can<00:06:33.800> see<00:06:33.949> how<00:06:34.069> the<00:06:34.129> bike<00:06:34.370> keeps<00:06:34.759> going

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150 
so you can see how the bike keeps going

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.409 
so you can see how the bike keeps going
even<00:06:35.629> though<00:06:35.750> I've<00:06:35.930> stopped<00:06:36.289> pedaling<00:06:36.680> but<00:06:37.639> at

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:38.419 
even though I've stopped pedaling but at

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:40.390 
even though I've stopped pedaling but at
the<00:06:38.599> same<00:06:38.810> time<00:06:39.050> I<00:06:39.379> don't<00:06:39.710> need<00:06:39.979> to<00:06:40.129> really

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 
the same time I don't need to really

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.300 
the same time I don't need to really
like<00:06:40.610> overexert<00:06:41.479> myself<00:06:41.509> to<00:06:42.379> activate<00:06:43.039> the

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:43.310 
like overexert myself to activate the

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.300 
like overexert myself to activate the
motor<00:06:43.690> so<00:06:44.690> it's<00:06:44.840> a<00:06:44.930> trade-off

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.310 
motor so it's a trade-off

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.339 
motor so it's a trade-off
compared<00:06:47.090> with<00:06:47.150> something<00:06:47.659> like<00:06:47.810> torque

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:48.349 
compared with something like torque

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:49.869 
compared with something like torque
sensing<00:06:48.680> assist<00:06:49.069> or<00:06:49.310> something<00:06:49.669> where<00:06:49.789> it's

00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:49.879 
sensing assist or something where it's

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:52.210 
sensing assist or something where it's
like<00:06:49.940> speed<00:06:50.330> torque<00:06:50.810> and<00:06:51.020> cadence<00:06:51.830> this<00:06:52.069> is

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:52.220 
like speed torque and cadence this is

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.279 
like speed torque and cadence this is
more<00:06:52.400> basic<00:06:52.639> but<00:06:53.360> you<00:06:53.629> know<00:06:53.720> this<00:06:53.870> is<00:06:54.050> that

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:54.289 
more basic but you know this is that

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:57.659 
more basic but you know this is that
more<00:06:54.650> affordable<00:06:55.069> price<00:06:55.129> point<00:06:55.580> as<00:06:55.759> well<00:06:55.970> me

00:06:57.659 --> 00:06:57.669 
more affordable price point as well me

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:00.249 
more affordable price point as well me
showed<00:06:58.669> little<00:06:58.909> magnetic<00:06:59.539> sensor<00:06:59.960> there<00:07:00.139> it

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:00.259 
showed little magnetic sensor there it

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:02.110 
showed little magnetic sensor there it
is<00:07:00.349> yeah<00:07:00.889> I<00:07:01.129> actually<00:07:01.520> I<00:07:01.550> think<00:07:01.639> it's<00:07:01.789> a<00:07:01.879> five

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:02.120 
is yeah I actually I think it's a five

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.189 
is yeah I actually I think it's a five
sensor<00:07:03.370> which<00:07:04.370> is<00:07:04.400> just<00:07:04.729> sort<00:07:04.909> of<00:07:05.080> you<00:07:06.080> know

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:06.199 
sensor which is just sort of you know

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:07.899 
sensor which is just sort of you know
that's<00:07:06.500> been<00:07:06.620> around<00:07:06.889> for<00:07:07.159> several<00:07:07.550> years

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:07.909 
that's been around for several years

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:09.309 
that's been around for several years
some<00:07:08.240> of<00:07:08.270> the<00:07:08.389> new<00:07:08.479> bikes<00:07:08.690> have<00:07:08.900> like<00:07:09.050> twelve

00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:09.319 
some of the new bikes have like twelve

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:11.020 
some of the new bikes have like twelve
sensor<00:07:09.680> and<00:07:09.830> they<00:07:09.919> I<00:07:10.159> don't<00:07:10.699> know<00:07:10.789> they<00:07:10.969> could

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:11.030 
sensor and they I don't know they could

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.330 
sensor and they I don't know they could
go<00:07:11.240> to<00:07:11.300> that<00:07:11.479> at<00:07:11.990> some<00:07:12.289> point<00:07:12.319> this<00:07:12.979> doesn't

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:13.340 
go to that at some point this doesn't

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.159 
go to that at some point this doesn't
work<00:07:13.460> too<00:07:13.699> bad<00:07:13.909> and<00:07:14.180> again<00:07:14.360> the<00:07:14.629> throttle<00:07:15.050> is

00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:15.169 
work too bad and again the throttle is

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:17.189 
work too bad and again the throttle is
like<00:07:15.349> instantaneous<00:07:15.949> very<00:07:16.370> responsive<00:07:16.909> and

00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:17.199 
like instantaneous very responsive and

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:19.480 
like instantaneous very responsive and
because<00:07:18.199> the<00:07:18.379> brake<00:07:18.590> levers<00:07:18.919> are<00:07:19.099> wired<00:07:19.280> in

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:19.490 
because the brake levers are wired in

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.100 
because the brake levers are wired in
any<00:07:19.789> time<00:07:20.060> you<00:07:20.180> pull<00:07:20.360> that<00:07:20.539> the<00:07:20.659> motor<00:07:20.840> will

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:21.110 
any time you pull that the motor will

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.939 
any time you pull that the motor will
will<00:07:21.590> cut<00:07:21.830> out<00:07:22.009> so<00:07:22.449> yeah<00:07:23.449> not<00:07:24.050> too<00:07:24.349> bad

00:07:24.939 --> 00:07:24.949 
will cut out so yeah not too bad
