 also the incentive for 12 dollars 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.159
 the narration of the game begins in the distant 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.990
 90s the main character mandus was archaeologists 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.880

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.710

 terrible fever he had a dream in

 huge zone this world she can 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.649
 accelerate the revolution however not in favor 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.909
 of humanity the destruction of this car 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:26.990
 protagonists are engaged throughout 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.880
 the whole game 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.250
 continue to tell something just not 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.560
 makes sense for the plot itself will reveal to you 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.630
 all the mysteries that this machine is hiding 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.909
 gameplay in the game has changed since 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.590
 The first part was removed inventory 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.299
 part there we can move items 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.560
 only in space however 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.240
 you can only interact with 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.280
 items you need to 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.800
 further passing the lantern there 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.390
 can conquer forever mind also removed 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.459
 now the player will not have to worry 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.440
 if he gets in the dark or starts 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:56.119
 look at enemies enemies also noticeably 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.369
 they have changed their goal too 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.440
 kill you artificial intelligence and clearly 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.509
 suffered not something that was very slow 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.280
 but I noticed he did not even see in the 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.560
 in front of him and goes right through 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.690
 the graphics in the game have changed however in general 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.470
 the picture looks almost the same as in 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.930
 the first part 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.000
 about fear 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.430
 Initially I had it however later 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.860
 you get used to and you're not scared anymore 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.810
 the creaks of the doors are not extraneous steps not 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.970
 cries of enemies however in some moments 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.440
 the game made me feel myself 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.440
 really tense 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:39.409
 total score if you compare first 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.900
 part and the second it seems to me that the first 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:43.760
 part was worse removal inventory 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.400
 parts do not particularly affect the gameplay 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.900
 mind removal somewhat eased 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.580
 passage because now is not necessary 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.379
 worry that your character will fall 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.379
 case of an unexpected appearance of the enemy 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:57.470
 the plot has a particular tragedy sometimes 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:59.660
 you start to sympathize with his heroes in this 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.040
 I advise the game to play to people who 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.440
 have not played horror 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.540
 as well as all fans of the series and even 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.470
 despite all my flaws I 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.750
 pleased with the passage approve on this 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.700
 perhaps all if you like this 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.340
