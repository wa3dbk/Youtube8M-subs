better about this training camp than
last<00:00:49.829> year<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.309> think<00:00:51.059> just<00:00:51.390> knowing<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.870> I

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
last year I think just knowing that I

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.380 
last year I think just knowing that I
have<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.280> know<00:00:53.370> everyone<00:00:53.640> being<00:00:54.000> healthy<00:00:54.329> and

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
have you know everyone being healthy and

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.330 
have you know everyone being healthy and
everything<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.989> BG<00:00:55.680> being<00:00:55.890> here<00:00:56.070> everything

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
everything and BG being here everything

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.619 
everything and BG being here everything
I<00:00:56.399> think<00:00:56.579> just<00:00:56.760> being<00:00:56.940> locked<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:57.390> each

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
I think just being locked in each

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.959 
I think just being locked in each
practice<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.289> think<00:00:58.530> um<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:59.309> takes<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.640> lot<00:00:59.670> so<00:00:59.879> in

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
practice I think um it takes a lot so in

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.910 
practice I think um it takes a lot so in
the<00:01:00.030> offseason<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.539> just<00:01:00.750> worked<00:01:01.230> hard<00:01:01.530> got<00:01:01.680> my

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
the offseason I just worked hard got my

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.260 
the offseason I just worked hard got my
mind<00:01:02.129> prepared<00:01:02.520> like<00:01:02.670> every<00:01:02.879> day<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.059> have<00:01:03.149> to

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
mind prepared like every day you have to

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
bring it because we have so many good

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.050 
bring it because we have so many good
people<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.100> got<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.309> compete<00:01:05.610> every<00:01:05.820> day

people so you got to compete every day

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.210 
people so you got to compete every day
so<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:07.229> was<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.439> main<00:01:07.619> thing<00:01:07.650> just<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.070> be

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
so that was the main thing just to be

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.789 
so that was the main thing just to be
locked<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.210> was<00:01:10.080> talking<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.380> crystal<00:01:10.740> i

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
locked in and I was talking to crystal i

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.289 
locked in and I was talking to crystal i
think<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.070> was<00:01:11.130> about<00:01:11.250> 45<00:01:11.700> minutes<00:01:12.030> into

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
think it was about 45 minutes into

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.640 
think it was about 45 minutes into
practice<00:01:12.720> where<00:01:12.869> he<00:01:12.930> finally<00:01:13.229> did<00:01:13.320> your<00:01:13.500> first

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
practice where he finally did your first

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.770 
practice where he finally did your first
half<00:01:13.890> court<00:01:14.189> drill<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.450> sounds<00:01:15.720> like

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
half court drill so it sounds like

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.080 
half court drill so it sounds like
you're<00:01:16.320> very<00:01:16.350> prepared<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.340> but<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.850> seems

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
you're very prepared and but it seems

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.310
