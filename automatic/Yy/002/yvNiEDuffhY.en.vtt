Moya here
and<00:00:17.699> we<00:00:18.029> got<00:00:18.380> one<00:00:19.380> zero<00:00:19.740> fortress<00:00:20.429> three

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:21.239 
and we got one zero fortress three

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:25.490 
and we got one zero fortress three
Zarek's<00:00:22.130> two<00:00:23.130> Enclave<00:00:23.669> warp<00:00:23.970> gates<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.779> war<00:00:25.259> boy

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
Zarek's two Enclave warp gates a war boy

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.499 
Zarek's two Enclave warp gates a war boy
fortress<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.630> two<00:00:27.630> upgraded<00:00:28.559> DFAS<00:00:29.519> or<00:00:30.000> death

fortress and two upgraded DFAS or death

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:31.939 
fortress and two upgraded DFAS or death
from<00:00:30.660> above<00:00:30.839> whatever<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.469> want<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.679> call<00:00:31.829> it

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
from above whatever you want to call it

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.329 
from above whatever you want to call it
and<00:00:32.930> here<00:00:33.930> we<00:00:34.019> go<00:00:34.260> we're<00:00:34.620> gonna<00:00:34.710> test<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.250> on

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:35.339 
and here we go we're gonna test it on

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:40.910 
and here we go we're gonna test it on
Sethos<00:00:36.379> again<00:00:37.379> I<00:00:38.030> changed<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.239> from<00:00:39.920> three

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
Sethos again I changed it from three

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.610 
Sethos again I changed it from three
warp<00:00:41.309> gates<00:00:42.350> because<00:00:43.399> the<00:00:44.899> that<00:00:45.899> third<00:00:46.260> warp

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
warp gates because the that third warp

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.200 
warp gates because the that third warp
gate<00:00:46.829> sometimes<00:00:47.129> messed<00:00:47.670> around<00:00:47.820> with<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
gate sometimes messed around with the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.490 
gate sometimes messed around with the
deck<00:00:48.449> and<00:00:49.939> it<00:00:50.939> lowered<00:00:51.330> my<00:00:51.479> success<00:00:51.989> rate<00:00:52.259> of

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
deck and it lowered my success rate of

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.380 
deck and it lowered my success rate of
winning<00:00:55.220> but<00:00:56.220> my<00:00:56.430> kill<00:00:56.670> rate<00:00:56.909> was<00:00:57.089> actually

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
winning but my kill rate was actually

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.859 
winning but my kill rate was actually
higher<00:00:57.600> than<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.140> rook<00:00:58.470> deck<00:00:58.769> is<00:00:59.040> but<00:00:59.869> the

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:00.869 
higher than this rook deck is but the

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:03.999 
higher than this rook deck is but the
fact<00:01:01.110> that<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.350> don't<00:01:01.470> even<00:01:01.769> win<00:01:02.070> as<00:01:02.570> much<00:01:03.570> as

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
fact that you don't even win as much as

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:08.260 
fact that you don't even win as much as
was<00:01:05.009> a<00:01:05.040> problem<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.820> changed<00:01:06.329> it<00:01:06.390> out

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
was a problem so I changed it out

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.139 
was a problem so I changed it out
and<00:01:09.200> I'm<00:01:09.710> going<00:01:09.920> to<00:01:09.979> pray<00:01:10.250> to<00:01:10.310> God<00:01:10.579> that<00:01:10.820> I<00:01:10.850> get

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
and I'm going to pray to God that I get

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:14.560 
and I'm going to pray to God that I get
a<00:01:11.180> DFA<00:01:11.659> right<00:01:11.899> now<00:01:12.079> or<00:01:12.790> another<00:01:13.790> DFA<00:01:14.270> because<00:01:14.509> I

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
a DFA right now or another DFA because I

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.380 
a DFA right now or another DFA because I
may<00:01:14.780> have<00:01:14.810> to<00:01:15.110> kill

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:24.890 

um<00:01:20.630> can<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.660> risk<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.940> no<00:01:23.940> I'm<00:01:24.150> not<00:01:24.450> going<00:01:24.750> to

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
um can I risk that no I'm not going to

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.719 
um can I risk that no I'm not going to
he's<00:01:25.350> got<00:01:25.530> another<00:01:25.710> some<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.100> right<00:01:26.250> there

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.219 

stupid<00:01:29.729> blood<00:01:29.969> pool<00:01:30.149> I<00:01:30.359> hate<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.810> card<00:01:31.049> so

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
stupid blood pool I hate that card so

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.419 
stupid blood pool I hate that card so
much<00:01:32.179> freakin<00:01:33.179> keeps<00:01:33.390> healing<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.869> shit<00:01:34.429> at

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
much freakin keeps healing a shit at

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:36.859 
much freakin keeps healing a shit at
least<00:01:35.490> I'll<00:01:35.729> kill<00:01:36.000> most<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.420> his<00:01:36.539> cards<00:01:36.780> right

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
least I'll kill most of his cards right

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.649 
least I'll kill most of his cards right
now<00:01:37.110> uh<00:01:40.219> I<00:01:41.219> wish<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.729> could<00:01:41.880> put<00:01:42.030> more<00:01:42.149> sage<00:01:42.450> in

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
now uh I wish I could put more sage in

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.450 
now uh I wish I could put more sage in
here<00:01:42.869> but<00:01:43.079> if<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.289> did<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.920> would<00:01:44.100> just<00:01:44.250> lower

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
here but if I did that would just lower

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.340 
here but if I did that would just lower
my<00:01:44.700> win<00:01:45.000> rate<00:01:45.030> even<00:01:45.450> more<00:01:45.689> than<00:01:46.079> what<00:01:46.229> it

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
my win rate even more than what it

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.120 
my win rate even more than what it
already<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:50.600> and<00:01:51.600> let's<00:01:52.140> see<00:01:52.350> if<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.679> do<00:01:52.740> full

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
already is and let's see if I do full

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.340 
already is and let's see if I do full
damage<00:01:53.310> I'm<00:01:53.520> gonna<00:01:53.700> win<00:01:54.000> but<00:01:54.569> full<00:01:54.869> damage

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
damage I'm gonna win but full damage

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.979 
damage I'm gonna win but full damage
let's<00:01:55.619> see<00:01:55.890> oh<00:01:57.799> no<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:58.950> did<00:01:59.219> do<00:01:59.340> full<00:01:59.520> damage

00:01:59.979 --> 00:01:59.989 
let's see oh no I did do full damage

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:04.040 
let's see oh no I did do full damage
let's<00:02:00.989> do<00:02:01.110> another<00:02:01.229> test

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:11.970 

you

let's<00:02:12.980> do<00:02:13.129> another<00:02:13.159> test<00:02:13.939> let's<00:02:14.780> see<00:02:15.140> let's

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
let's do another test let's see let's

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.429 
let's do another test let's see let's
see<00:02:15.409> if<00:02:15.680> see<00:02:15.980> oh<00:02:16.659> shit<00:02:17.689> probably<00:02:18.260> should<00:02:18.409> have

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:18.439 
see if see oh shit probably should have

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.570 
see if see oh shit probably should have
DFA<00:02:18.829> that<00:02:19.099> male<00:02:19.670> is

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
DFA that male is

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.610 
DFA that male is
yeah<00:02:22.580> I'm<00:02:22.730> gonna<00:02:22.880> lose<00:02:23.060> I<00:02:23.300> did<00:02:23.840> not<00:02:24.050> realize

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
dumb move on my part probably could have

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.890 
dumb move on my part probably could have
one<00:02:29.220> there<00:02:29.400> too

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.809 

yeah<00:03:01.900> this<00:03:02.170> deck<00:03:02.470> has<00:03:02.739> a<00:03:02.770> higher<00:03:03.160> win<00:03:03.489> rate<00:03:03.700> in

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.080 
yeah this deck has a higher win rate in
my<00:03:03.940> opinion<00:03:04.500> but<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.800> full<00:03:06.489> damage<00:03:06.760> rate

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
my opinion but the full damage rate

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.940 
my opinion but the full damage rate
seems<00:03:07.330> to<00:03:07.510> be<00:03:07.599> a<00:03:07.630> little<00:03:07.959> bit<00:03:08.080> lower<00:03:08.319> than<00:03:08.590> my

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
seems to be a little bit lower than my

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.790 
seems to be a little bit lower than my
