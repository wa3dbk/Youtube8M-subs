00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.490
 again we proceed to the bottom processing 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:17.130
 car wheel arches are not processed 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:20.310
 Now we continue further naturally 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.100
 we again need mastic 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.380
 You can also take a thinner to 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.699
 to dilute the mastic so that it does not 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.099
 was very thick 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.050
 also i'm using a hand like this 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.280
 cheek in hard to reach places 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.660
 i protect dust of dirt and this mastic 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:43.320
 which is already old cracked i am her 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.860
 I remove and also drill a brush nozzle so 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.930
 get down to work begin to defend 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.690
 rust rust book or also can 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.280
 use 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.039
 anti rust for pre 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.879
 having processed the bottom of the body and after that we 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:03.660
 can apply 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:06.960
 the mastiff here is noticeable and clearly visible where 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.000
 need to wear mastic in order to 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.720
 the body served us 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.720
 even longer 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.830
 We are not ashamed to clean because if 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.800
 bad we clean it then the old mastic 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:47.280
 together again broth lyceum and the body will be 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.009
 rise rust on that forward and with 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.110
 earned zeal and by the way do not forget 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.750
 that buying mastic must necessarily 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.420
 be bitumen-rubber because if 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.570
 the Turks will be bituminous then cracked 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.440
 and quickly fall away so I covered your bottom 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:09.149
 car part that is still 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:13.980
 work to be seen here as applied 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:16.110
 By the way, I recommend a layer of mastic after 5-6 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.910
 hours to put another layer 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.080
 this is for a long time 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:25.560
 preserved car body from 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:30.209
 rust formation and moisture ingress 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:34.070
 consequences of damage to the bottom of the car so 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.070
 what is in itself and the costs justify themselves
