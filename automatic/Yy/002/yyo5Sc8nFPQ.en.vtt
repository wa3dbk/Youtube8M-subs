the<00:00:53.039> left<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.850> then<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.840> Firefly<00:00:55.410> on<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
the left and then the Firefly on the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.650 
the left and then the Firefly on the
right<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.280> then<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.730> first<00:00:57.000> time<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.270> did<00:00:57.629> that

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
right and then the first time I did that

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.680 
right and then the first time I did that
it<00:00:58.199> works<00:00:58.640> but<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.699> already<00:01:00.000> tried<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.539> like

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
it works but I already tried to like

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.750

five<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.289> other<00:01:01.710> time<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.340> think<00:01:02.609> it

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
five of the other time so I think it

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.600 
five of the other time so I think it
took<00:01:02.940> me<00:01:03.149> like<00:01:03.300> six<00:01:03.809> times<00:01:04.280> to<00:01:05.280> get<00:01:05.430> the

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
it collects a lot of money so I knew I

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.319

here<00:03:28.810> if<00:03:29.049> you<00:03:29.949> don't<00:03:30.280> use<00:03:30.639> any<00:03:30.970> diamonds<00:03:31.569> at

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
here if you don't use any diamonds at

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.710 
here if you don't use any diamonds at
all<00:03:32.079> I'm<00:03:32.470> pretty<00:03:33.310> sure<00:03:33.579> it<00:03:33.639> will<00:03:33.909> take<00:03:34.269> four

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
all I'm pretty sure it will take four

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.830 
all I'm pretty sure it will take four
days<00:03:34.750> to<00:03:36.120> both<00:03:37.769> breed<00:03:38.769> them<00:03:39.340> and<00:03:39.639> to<00:03:40.359> hatch<00:03:40.569> the

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
days to both breed them and to hatch the

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.569 
days to both breed them and to hatch the
eggs<00:03:41.049> so<00:03:41.319> that's<00:03:41.500> four<00:03:41.889> days<00:03:42.040> total<00:03:43.229> and<00:03:44.579> what

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
eggs so that's four days total and what

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.210 
eggs so that's four days total and what
that<00:03:45.940> is<00:03:46.180> how<00:03:46.419> you<00:03:46.449> get<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:46.989> rainbow<00:03:47.829> dragon
