00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.180
 and hello to all and butten that he is 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.379
 today we find ourselves for the tutorial 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.990
 number 40 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:13.590
 it did what many 40 still it 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.150
 start to do 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.320
 and so today we will make a 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.720
 locking door a doors to 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.019
 auto lock so I'm going to you 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.460
 to see the system up is there 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:29.779
 so it's a small system that's for 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.009
 Christmas like this so we can open it 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.530
 you see there we can open the door 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.989
 return etc we have no problem 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.379
 this is here it means that the 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.760
 door the door to Lille not locked 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.680
 and there locks them after you can 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.510
 change the meaning but obviously I you 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.039
 will show how 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.870
 so here it is closed the door 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.129
 could have opened from the outside no 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.559
 inside the school a therapist 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.170
 always open up there if you want 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.609
 you can go back here so 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.739
 that's it can make a lock in 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:00.780
 houses in stuff like that in 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.629
 secure houses and there it becomes again 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.160
 open from the outside so look at it 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.170
 I press the plate it works 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:14.030
 so we're going to do this little system all 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:17.310
 immediately on the surface op here then 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.600
 so already we will be doing the door with my 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:25.829
 place and the door and the plates of 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:28.049
 pressure so here we're going to do with 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:30.509
 this block the up 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.140
 Here then already we will make the door is 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.060
 is going to do it a bit high like this 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.009
 we have room to do that well 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.170
 must you can I advise you to 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.780
 watch the tutorial for once already in 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.909
 whole and after doing it like that 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.810
 you will be a little where I am at each 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.049
 times that's it then this tutorial it will not last 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.049
 long time 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.850
 so here we will do so here at a 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.290
 garlic pressure plate is a block 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.910
 empty so check that you can 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.740
 put or remove a pressure plate 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.940
 here you obviously remove it here you 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.560
 put the intake so there you can not 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.330
 put pressure plates here you 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.550
 so put it in there that will be able 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.459
 always smile from the inside because 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.510
 that the simply the the plate of 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.760
 pressure it is connected to the door 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.420
 live and here she's not connected to the 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:24.090
 gate to a gap block so that's it then 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.980
 then we will place the little one 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.140
 little lock so will put a 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:34.170
 block like that button got stuck I do not 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:35.459
 do not know okay so here we go 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.410
 to do the system is that as soon as we 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.790
 press the button the lamp stays 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.130
 turned on as soon as you press the lamp 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.660
 goes off then it's very simple you 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:48.570
 go see up then already takes a 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.870
 little bit of reston anyway so here 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.330
 to power the lamp is here to 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.769
 feed the button so that's fine 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:01.110
 feed his is here when we are going to put 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.600
 a block of finally when we turn on the 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.769
 system here it 's going to stay on 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:11.070
 then we see then here you go 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.420
 put a repeater then we will make a 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.970
 tea flip flop system 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:19.830
 so that's right now toc 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:24.320
 was waiting for this block is useless just 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:26.900
 to arrive I dreamed or to mickey 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.950
 so that's the one of raids down 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.329
 then the one where I have to be there 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.180
 and this must go up etc 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:36.930
 and then after here just to put one or 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.730
 so that's actually the moment we press 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.690
 here is it going to feed these three blu 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.430
 c3 c3 2 wheels scared so this one of 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.750
 this one is going to be in that one and 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.209
 when the system will turn off this 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:52.220
 he'll throw in there because you 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:55.010
 know that opr it activates like that 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.890
 and when that turns off its momentum 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.659
 a drive in principle I can 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.430
 take that then you put an object 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:03.739
 heavy so you will be able to why 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.459
 you will put a heavy object that can 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:09.530
 to be swords or tools I believe 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:15.079
 here you put a heavy object for 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:17.000
 that the drive is two of type so 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:18.769
 it's not obliged after here it's 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.049
 for just that there are two of type so 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.699
 you put in this sector there put a 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.110
 compare all right here you put 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:26.240
 of powder here is that it makes a 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.150
 kind of loop so in principle as soon 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.280
 we activate the torch and a strong support 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.970
 the havas torch is finally lit the 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.889
 torch going here so if here you 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.060
 put a normal block for example we're going 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.690
 do it right away if you put a 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:44.960
 block of earth you'll see that hop that 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:49.610
 goes only to one of impulses so if I will do 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.750
 just put a 1-1 repeater good we 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.380
 we will leave payrolls like that 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.080
 faster 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.610
 it avoids both types duration peter for 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.180
 try the most instant care 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.370
 possible up then and if we put a 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.380
 torch and let you system there for 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.449
 now we are going to take care of 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.500
 this little pressure plate then 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.500
 already you are going m 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.660
 I'm trying to make compote signals from 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.030
 many others full of possibilities 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.580
 so here as soon as we press this 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.980
 pressure plate there everything comes on which 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.640
 feeds this block which is a hack the 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.090
 Torch rest simply must 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.420
 quite simply 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:29.370
 so here you go being your system 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.600
 end here it has to be it is a loan 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.430
 if you want a verse you just have 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.530
 to take back your sword which is there by 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.570
 example you give it the pop and the 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.740
 system it is reversed good that you 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.790
 can change it at the end of your 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.550
 system in this hour I have to be 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.780
 extinct did light up earlier and that's 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.420
 that I wanted to light 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:50.760
 So here you have it was 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:52.830
 then lit here I put the day here 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:56.280
 you have the door so the door is going 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.750
 connect it up to a powder you see here 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.900
 the door she is there there is her block in 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.510
 below and there is the powder and if we 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.400
 wants it to be well powered it takes 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.380
 that the powder goes straight but we 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:11.820
 system we will do it from a 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:14.430
 lower block here you connect these two 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.740
 torches so by any means 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.560
 I read them like that the torches 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.360
 that's where to connect them I miss you know 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.970
 it's not against this block or anything 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.280
 moment it's between the two torches 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:28.800
 all right then here you go 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:33.510
 put a torch that will reverse the 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:35.220
 system so basically it will take that then 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.570
 I quickly explained you there the plate 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.730
 pressure not activate the door 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:42.630
 activate door why because there is 

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:44.430
 this so that's a kind of two 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.110
 doors end so in fact it has to be that the 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.330
 two torches is disabled so that 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.190
 this torch is activated 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:53.070
 because there when I do that you see 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.420
 waited see that is one that goes out 

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.490
 and the other remains to him and so the cost 

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:59.130
 current stays on so that's what 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:01.470
 system there you have to know him and 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:04.320
 so there as soon as we press if the system 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:07.170
 he is affiliated disabled at the end of the year 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:12.330
 will do the opposite it will be easier 

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:14.770
 So here we are going to activate the system 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.180
 so there they can return so the 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.390
 door it is open on both sides 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:21.670
 here you can go as you but 

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:23.950
 here I support here up reverse the system 

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:26.260
 and there you can not go from that 

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.790
 side-there good only drawback is that 

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.540
 you risk getting stuck in 

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.790
 outdoors 

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.980
 obviously so after that you can 

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.030
 So connect this system from that 

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.320
 hour I wash or connect all the 

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.510
 doors that you want then here you are 

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:44.350
 are quiet and all the plates of 

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:46.300
 pressure after that's me it looks 

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:48.570
 to be finished here is good I hope 

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:51.610
 that this little system will have pleased you 

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:53.620
 do not hesitate to like I will close this 

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:55.450
 system this system there do not hesitate to 

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.580
 love the video is to subscribe to my 

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:59.110
 new chain that buzz prod so there 

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.860
 you will be you on if you 

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:02.920
 watch this video 

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:05.080
 So here we are, we say ourselves shaw and at the 

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:07.530
 next for a new thoré stone 

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.530
 ciao
