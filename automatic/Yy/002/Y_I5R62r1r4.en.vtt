00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:07.210
 and well we follow then the strap 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:10.590
 distribution to streets until it took everything out 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:13.830
 this one took off the strap 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:18.510
 the tensioners were removed the roller and the 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.660
 Tensioner and I put the first tensor 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.260
 Hydraulic working a shorcito 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.560
 hydraulic I get to see it 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.830
 and that hydraulic you see 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.820
 that one day do this 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.820
 it's the old 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:42.910
 this and what I always put it 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:47.590
 with this the two ministers a little button 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:54.020
 sometimes 10 mm agonal 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:56.960
 are you using this as a 6 screw 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.960
 It is simply a precaution for 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.410
 that they will not loosen anything else is a 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.379
 all thread lock 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.210
 and on the big screw of the tensioner that 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.070
 this is the old 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.840
 It is put again the same 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:17.210
 exactly the same always with him with 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:21.110
 loctite what you have at hand 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.290
 this important important is after 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.750
 that we put and tighten the screws 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:30.850
 verify the movement of this tensioner 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.850
 of all said this has to move 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:40.829
 19 there is something important abnormal behind 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:45.780
 this roller and is that the one that squeezes that 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:49.290
 it's a bolt of what's called d 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.390
 of these duties with allen key 10 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:56.400
 millimeters on the side of attraction 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.350
 you flag this I stuck it with 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.330
 let's practice with a little bit of 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.760
 silicone thing when it's not going to put 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.710
 Do not fall for practical advice 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.840
 nothing else but very important we do not 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.820
 in forgetting lounge of nothing because if not 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.310
 is going to stay fixed is this 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:15.020
 roller and it will not tighten the belts 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.020
 I'm going to make a mess 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.540
 good as you can see it is placed the 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.850
 belt 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.030
 the new belt 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:31.710
 getting everything as he had explained 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:35.780
 before important that everything matches 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:38.470
 down here also please 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.470
 ah 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.730
 and you can see 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:58.450
 already candle with the help of a small mirror 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:01.349
 it cleared something something like that friend 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.349
 to all 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.200
 when we are very sure that everything 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.200
 match 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.090
 we are the ring 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.790
 the ring 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:19.709
 and already according to how you can see 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.709
 I think it's good to think 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.370
 and can we all do to be 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.410
 insurance 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.660
 let's grab 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.620
 with a key of 22 a tube 22 of 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.690
 crankshaft we removed the engine what 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.850
 we turn a couple of times a couple of 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.630
 turns to be sure we do not bend 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.340
 a valve or something to do some damage 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:45.350
 if you normally rotate in engines already 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:50.450
 we can start and would be soon 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:52.780
 here is the old truth I have the 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.680
 roller 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.680
 and run 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:03.420
 and I'm hoping that the video will be 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.420
 useful we have to get here him 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:12.670
 of the call the potato nothing else is not 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.269
 nothing else I hope that the video has 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.269
 been useful 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.090
 and good many thanks
