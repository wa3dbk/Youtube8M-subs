 I think the agenda that you have had about 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.720

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.700

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.470

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:25.399
 of scoring a goal for his team but the 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.830
 other members of the 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:28.940
 selected Bolivian what yes it 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.770

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.100

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.490
 president juan manuel santos was like 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.460
 representation of the chief executive 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:02.780
 Colombian complicated I did not think that the 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.460
 Bolivians will play so much but good 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.900

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:15.740

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.660
 good game hopefully yes let's hope 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.420
 what to say because this can not be left 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.010
 in tie the universal.com point with the 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.490
 authors of the two points that marked 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.490
 Colombia 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.420
 to all victims of violence 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.840
 but also to the friendship that always 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:39.740
 endure between bolivia and colombia very 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.180
 well an immense joy to share these 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.330
 great moments with people so 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.000
 important as our president 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:50.600
 president evo is very happy the 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.440
 true clearly imagine a super goal 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.330
 important that is excellent or super 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.040
 well too good is part of the team 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.260
 Bolivian was given by a Chilean official 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.590
 of the United Nations - excellent me 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.410
 I think there was an important domain of 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.940
 President's team orally and for me 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.459
 It was a pride that invited me to 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.130
 play some minutes for your team I think 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.580
 that was a good team and it was also 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.580
 Colombia 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.840
 I do not know, I think that in these games 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.590
 friendly do not say if one was 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.160
 better than the other 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.490
 I think it was even 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.470
 maybe the last Colombian goal was not 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.480
 criminal in my opinion but these are 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.550
 friendly matches and the result 2 to 12 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.590
 other diplomat who could not start 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.300
 the friendly match left the way 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.400
 open for the topics that the 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.870

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.400
