00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.153
 Chunxiang's selection section - love song 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.137
 Dream Dragon-Wu Xinjie Chunxiang-Wu Huiling 

00:00:12.438 --> 00:00:16.395
 Malaysia Jinyulou Chunchao Theatre 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:29.880
 You see a round of the moon 

00:00:33.857 --> 00:00:43.325
 Illuminated garden outside the window 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:58.816
 If the moon is fascinating 

00:00:58.905 --> 00:01:09.870
 Ding you, I love you deeply 

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:18.081
 Deep love, deep love 

00:01:18.925 --> 00:01:27.481
 Stepping through iron shoes, nowhere to look 

00:01:30.251 --> 00:01:37.518
 Like a shadow 

00:01:37.713 --> 00:01:47.678
 Like a squat and headrest 

00:01:58.432 --> 00:02:07.092
 Itâ€™s like a flower 

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:20.377
 Like needlework dense weaving embroidery 

00:02:30.407 --> 00:02:37.537
 Kindness is like ocean water 

00:02:37.547 --> 00:02:47.761
 Love river is deeper than the ocean 

00:02:51.138 --> 00:02:57.095
 Chunxiang, why donâ€™t you book a hundred-year agreement? 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:02:59.987
 Hundred years of covenant 

00:03:00.336 --> 00:03:05.866
 Yes, after a hundred years, you and I have changed... 

00:03:06.176 --> 00:03:09.092
 What did it change? 

00:03:16.205 --> 00:03:22.514
 I became a dragon and phoenix drum in the Forbidden City. 

00:03:22.717 --> 00:03:28.872
 You become Changan Bell Tower Wanshou Clock 

00:03:30.464 --> 00:03:35.658
 Bell sounds like Dangdang 

00:03:35.346 --> 00:03:39.701
 Drums 

00:03:39.523 --> 00:03:45.000
 Bells wake up thousands of dreams 

00:03:47.005 --> 00:03:53.082
 Drums appeal to the people 

00:03:52.973 --> 00:03:57.328
 Others only hear the bells and rings 

00:03:57.214 --> 00:04:05.575
 Who knows that you and I are both 

00:04:07.153 --> 00:04:10.081
 Chunxiang Dangdang 

00:04:10.192 --> 00:04:12.869
 Dream dragon 

00:04:16.601 --> 00:04:21.977
 There are many changes in the sea and the sea. 

00:04:22.008 --> 00:04:30.507
 Bells and drums forever 

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:45.499
 I will change the water of the Milky Way again in the heavens 

00:05:09.922 --> 00:05:14.985
 You change to the river and the sea 

00:05:19.583 --> 00:05:24.621
 That is the millennium drought 

00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:26.755
 Also not drying 

00:05:26.783 --> 00:05:33.552
 Sea water comes from heaven 

00:05:37.824 --> 00:05:48.142
 You and I become a double-seat flying wingbird 

00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:58.329
 Flapping wings in the tourmaline 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:16.683
 Flying over the green hills 

00:06:16.687 --> 00:06:26.000
 Freedom and freedom 

00:06:33.732 --> 00:06:38.134
 I hope that a hundred years old is not old. 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.327
 I hope that night and night 

00:06:47.807 --> 00:06:50.665
 The month is always round, people are not old 

00:06:50.640 --> 00:07:05.646
 Today is a hundred years old
