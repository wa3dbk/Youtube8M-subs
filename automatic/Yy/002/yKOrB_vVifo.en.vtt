been contracted by the tendons drawing
up<00:00:34.650> it<00:00:34.980> has<00:00:35.250> actually<00:00:35.700> had<00:00:36.150> broken<00:00:36.540> one<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.230> the

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
up it has actually had broken one of the

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.720 
up it has actually had broken one of the
trochanter<00:00:37.800> x'<00:00:37.830> on<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.130> femur<00:00:38.370> from<00:00:38.640> the

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580 
other leg from the left leg it had two

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.430 
other leg from the left leg it had two
broken<00:00:41.850> legs<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.360> survived<00:00:42.750> those<00:00:43.050> two<00:00:43.230> broken

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
broken legs it survived those two broken

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.580 
broken legs it survived those two broken
legs<00:00:43.560> it<00:00:43.860> has<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.220> smashed<00:00:45.260> shoulder<00:00:46.260> girdle

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
legs it has a smashed shoulder girdle

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.980 
legs it has a smashed shoulder girdle
here<00:00:46.620> right<00:00:47.190> here<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.490> can<00:00:47.610> see<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.990> extra

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:48.990 
here right here you can see that extra

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.680 
here right here you can see that extra
bone<00:00:49.170> grown<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.800> shoulder<00:00:50.190> girdle<00:00:50.490> and

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
bone grown on that shoulder girdle and

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.030 
bone grown on that shoulder girdle and
when<00:00:51.690> we<00:00:51.840> were<00:00:51.960> working<00:00:52.290> on<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.560> fossil<00:00:52.950> a

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
when we were working on this fossil a

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.830 
when we were working on this fossil a
ninja<00:00:53.280> initially<00:00:54.060> cleaning<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.630> and

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
ninja initially cleaning it and

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.690 
ninja initially cleaning it and
preparing<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.680> we<00:00:55.800> started<00:00:56.130> noticing<00:00:56.280> all

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
preparing it we started noticing all

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.370 
preparing it we started noticing all
these<00:00:56.850> things<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.390> then<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.660> was<00:00:58.050> trying<00:00:58.230> to

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380 
these things and then I was trying to

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.290 
these things and then I was trying to
get<00:00:58.500> some<00:00:58.680> idea<00:00:59.010> because<00:00:59.880> I<00:00:59.970> studied

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
get some idea because I studied

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.790 
get some idea because I studied
Tyrannosaurus<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.350> looking<00:01:01.590> at<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
Tyrannosaurus and looking at the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.770 
Tyrannosaurus and looking at the
braincase<00:01:02.040> and<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.730> wanted<00:01:02.970> to<00:01:03.030> get<00:01:03.270> an<00:01:03.480> endo

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
braincase and I wanted to get an endo

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.270 
braincase and I wanted to get an endo
cast<00:01:04.049> from<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.440> brain<00:01:04.620> where<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.949> brain<00:01:05.100> was

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
cast from the brain where the brain was

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.460 
cast from the brain where the brain was
and<00:01:05.489> when<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:05.940> opened<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.360> brain<00:01:06.570> up<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:07.260> try

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
and when we opened the brain up to try

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.110 
and when we opened the brain up to try
to<00:01:07.530> get<00:01:07.680> an<00:01:07.770> endo<00:01:08.040> past<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.490> clean<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.790> matrix

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
to get an endo past and clean the matrix

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.570 
to get an endo past and clean the matrix
out<00:01:09.270> we<00:01:09.390> found<00:01:09.660> there's<00:01:09.960> actually<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.680> bony

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
out we found there's actually a bony

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.760 
out we found there's actually a bony
substance<00:01:12.240> within<00:01:12.690> that<00:01:12.900> brain<00:01:13.230> case<00:01:13.500> that

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
substance within that brain case that

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.310 
substance within that brain case that
grew<00:01:14.190> there<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.140> working<00:01:16.140> with<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.560> number<00:01:17.130> of

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
grew there and working with a number of

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.720 
grew there and working with a number of
pathologists<00:01:19.320> with<00:01:19.560> Eli<00:01:19.890> Lilly<00:01:20.130> veterinarian

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:20.730 
pathologists with Eli Lilly veterinarian

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.000 
pathologists with Eli Lilly veterinarian
pathologists<00:01:21.690> we<00:01:22.230> were<00:01:22.350> able<00:01:22.620> to<00:01:22.650> determine

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
pathologists we were able to determine

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.070 
pathologists we were able to determine
that<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.670> probably<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.390> first<00:01:24.570> evidence

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
that this is probably the first evidence

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.180 
that this is probably the first evidence
of<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:26.130> brain<00:01:26.880> tumor<00:01:26.930> preserved<00:01:27.930> as<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> fossil

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
of a brain tumor preserved as a fossil

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.270 
of a brain tumor preserved as a fossil
and<00:01:29.430> it's<00:01:29.940> a<00:01:30.150> bone<00:01:30.600> forming<00:01:31.110> meningioma<00:01:31.770> or

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
and it's a bone forming meningioma or

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.570 
and it's a bone forming meningioma or
perhaps<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.390> bone<00:01:33.570> forming<00:01:33.870> start<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.580> bone

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
perhaps a bone forming start a bone

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.360 
perhaps a bone forming start a bone
forming<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:36.090> cancer<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.140> grew<00:01:37.770> within<00:01:38.040> the

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
forming a cancer that grew within the

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.910 
forming a cancer that grew within the
cerebellum<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:40.200> animal<00:01:40.650> which<00:01:40.770> is

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
cerebellum of the animal which is

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.680 
cerebellum of the animal which is
responsible<00:01:41.400> for<00:01:41.640> balance<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.330> so<00:01:42.390> we<00:01:42.479> think

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
responsible for balance and so we think

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.390 
responsible for balance and so we think
all<00:01:42.810> these<00:01:42.960> other<00:01:43.200> injuries<00:01:43.799> were<00:01:43.950> probably<00:01:44.190> a

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
all these other injuries were probably a

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.950 
all these other injuries were probably a
result<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:45.120> this<00:01:45.750> brain<00:01:46.409> tumor<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.510> it's<00:01:48.510> it's

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
result of this brain tumor and it's it's

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.110 
result of this brain tumor and it's it's
it's<00:01:49.350> something<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.010> we'd<00:01:50.340> never<00:01:50.549> expected

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
it's something that we'd never expected

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.660 
it's something that we'd never expected
to<00:01:51.240> find<00:01:51.510> and<00:01:51.810> just<00:01:52.710> gives<00:01:52.890> us<00:01:53.040> another<00:01:53.340> new

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
to find and just gives us another new

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.330 
to find and just gives us another new
idea<00:01:54.120> of<00:01:54.420> what<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.930> possible<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:55.920> fossil

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
idea of what is possible in fossil
