question we've got is the fighting

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.429 
question we've got is the fighting
system<00:01:10.200> typically<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:12.330> SVR<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:12.960> really

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
system typically the the SVR and really

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.810 
system typically the the SVR and really
all<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.680> wrestling<00:01:14.040> games<00:01:14.189> have<00:01:14.400> been<00:01:14.490> very

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
all the wrestling games have been very

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.359 
all the wrestling games have been very
kind<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.869> deliberate<00:01:16.560> about<00:01:16.830> some<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
kind of a deliberate about some of the

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.859 
kind of a deliberate about some of the
stuff<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.820> did<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.119> terms<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.420> combos

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
stuff that you did in terms of combos

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.719 
stuff that you did in terms of combos
but<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.799> very<00:01:20.009> different<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.520> almost

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
but this is very different it almost

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.429 
but this is very different it almost
seems<00:01:21.000> much<00:01:21.240> more<00:01:21.299> faster<00:01:21.689> pace<00:01:22.020> what<00:01:22.259> can<00:01:22.380> you

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
seems much more faster pace what can you

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.410 
seems much more faster pace what can you
tell<00:01:22.560> us<00:01:22.619> about<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.070> system<00:01:23.400> correct<00:01:24.210> yeah

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
tell us about the system correct yeah

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.390 
tell us about the system correct yeah
our<00:01:24.840> fighting<00:01:25.140> style<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.770> fast<00:01:26.250> paced

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
our fighting style is fast paced

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.600 
our fighting style is fast paced

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
responsive high energy low down time

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.429 
responsive high energy low down time
gameplay<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.600> what<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.720> means<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.320> I'm

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
gameplay and what that means and I'm

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.130 
gameplay and what that means and I'm
less<00:01:31.950> than<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.130> mouthful<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:33.270> while

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
less than a mouthful is that while

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.990 
less than a mouthful is that while
you're<00:01:34.290> attacking<00:01:35.159> somebody<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.670> can<00:01:35.850> we

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
you're attacking somebody you can we

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.030 
you're attacking somebody you can we
have<00:01:36.180> predetermined<00:01:36.600> combos<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.770> can

break out of that and try something else

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.179 
break out of that and try something else
try<00:01:43.320> different<00:01:43.619> things<00:01:43.649> since<00:01:44.070> our

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
try different things since our
