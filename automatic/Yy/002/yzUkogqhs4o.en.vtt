00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.350
 hello youtube friends today I will teach you 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.300
 how to solve the problem in which 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.310
 the icons and the bar do not appear 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.439
 start at the desktop and practically 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.300
 you can not do anything in windows xp 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.580
 you will hardly see the image of 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.920
 desk and in windows 8 a screen 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.199
 black and I do not remember in windows 7 the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.300
 solution is the same for everyone first 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:43.080
 when they are on the desk they press 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.180
 the control keys when deleting and they give 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.900
 click on open task manager 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.000
 this way 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.940
 then they click on file and 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.660
 execute new task and we write 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.660
 explorer exe 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.380
 they click on accept and wait 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.500
 As you can see, the icons are already appearing 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.500
 and the start bar 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.610
 if they have windows 7 or windows 8 they leave it 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.260
 so if they have windows xp and they go to the link 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.860
 of the description give you file and 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.860
 to download 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.659
 Then they go to the place where 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.409
 downloaded they give right click and 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.409
 extract here 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.620
 now they open the folder that they had left and 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.510
 they execute the taskbar xp I do not do it 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.080
 because my system is not compatible with 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.510
 the xp 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.940
 Now I 'm going to show you the solution if 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.370
 when you run explorer.exe it appears that 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.500
 does not exist then they must download it 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.810
 according to your operating system but it 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.700
 they will ask how they will do it if they can not 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.700
 do almost nothing do it like this 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.280
 when they are on the desk without icons 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.260
 or the black screen give control to 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.270
 delete and open the administrator 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.410
 tasks give you in file and run 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:29.320
 new task now click on examine 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.270
 and will search your favorite browser in my 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.530
 case it would be google chrome that I can 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.900
 find easily on the desk 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.420
 they click on him in April and then they give him 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.020
 click on accept and as you will see it opens 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.020
 the explorer 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.739
 now go to the description link 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.840
 according to your operating system in my case it's 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:57.940
 windows 8 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.940
 they give him in file and in download 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.760
 I do not do it because I already have it 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:07.250
 Discharged 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.079
 then they close their browser and they will see that 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.450
 the task manager will have them 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:14.870
 minimized what they open they give in 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.090
 file and execute new task now you 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.250
 click on browse and search the folder 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.110
 where they have downloaded the explorer from their 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.420
 system then on the bottom 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.400
 right where it says programs click on it 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.319
 and they select all the files for 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.239
 that the RAR file appears 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.700
 right click and extract here I do not 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:35.040
 I do because I already have it removed 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.030
 then they will have a folder like 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.190
 this one that says explorer 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.620
 they give right click and copy 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.740
 then they go to the local disk and look for the 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:49.510
 windows folder and there in a space in 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.510
 white you right click and paste 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:56.730
 I do not do it because I already have it 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.730
 now they give you click cancel 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:05.519
 and in this part they write explorer.exe 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.519
 They give in to accept and wait 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.659
 and as you see, everything will charge you again 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.460
