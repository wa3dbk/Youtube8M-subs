00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
bags so this is what I have and I wasn't

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.120

for<00:01:26.400> one<00:01:26.640> reason<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.479> was<00:01:27.540> because<00:01:27.869> the

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
for one reason and that was because the

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.770 
for one reason and that was because the
inside<00:01:28.770> was<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> light<00:01:29.490> color<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.299> could<00:01:30.540> see

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
inside was a light color and I could see

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.749 
inside was a light color and I could see
what<00:01:30.930> was<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.229> there<00:01:31.259> easily<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.369> many<00:01:32.610> of

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
of the main reason I needed something

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.940

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
forever 21 I wore this with a black

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.770 
forever 21 I wore this with a black
dress<00:05:32.620> on<00:05:32.860> one<00:05:33.040> of<00:05:33.130> the<00:05:33.220> formal<00:05:33.670> night<00:05:33.850> so<00:05:34.270> it's

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
dress on one of the formal night so it's

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.580 
dress on one of the formal night so it's
very<00:05:35.110> heavy

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
very heavy

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.520 
very heavy
and<00:05:35.860> it<00:05:36.280> actually<00:05:36.490> takes<00:05:36.910> up<00:05:37.300> quite<00:05:38.170> a<00:05:38.200> bit<00:05:38.410> of

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
and it actually takes up quite a bit of

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.670 
and it actually takes up quite a bit of
space<00:05:38.800> so<00:05:39.070> this<00:05:39.910> came<00:05:40.180> in<00:05:40.330> handy<00:05:40.510> having<00:05:41.350> this

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680

extensive<00:06:21.340> but<00:06:21.580> this<00:06:21.700> really<00:06:22.090> worked<00:06:22.450> out

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 
extensive but this really worked out

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.940 
extensive but this really worked out
well<00:06:23.110> for<00:06:23.470> what<00:06:24.040> I<00:06:24.070> needed<00:06:24.400> to<00:06:24.640> take

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950 
well for what I needed to take

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.650

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:26.660 
and the length of vacation so I

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.660 
and the length of vacation so I
definitely<00:06:27.050> recommend<00:06:27.800> this<00:06:27.950> it<00:06:28.460> was<00:06:28.640> a

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:28.670 
definitely recommend this it was a

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.790 
definitely recommend this it was a
little<00:06:28.940> pricey<00:06:29.180> but<00:06:29.960> it<00:06:30.080> worked<00:06:30.290> out<00:06:30.440> so<00:06:30.500> well

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 
little pricey but it worked out so well

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.950
