00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.480
 all the guys with you health from another 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.549
 series 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.450
 mattress arrangements in this series I wanted 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:22.079
 show them automatically the armor slider 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:27.029
 it is very similar in its mechanics to 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:31.800
 armor warehouse but has one but stores in 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:35.790
 yourself three sets and allows you to change them 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.600
 see very nice well let's 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.900
 let's start building and so we begin 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.380
 5 digging pit construction 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.300
 blocks depth 8 blocks 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:52.560
 then we descend into it 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.040
 install 1 piston block red 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.450
 stone 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:00.149
 another piston it extends and block 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.590
 red stone further it is his doing with 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.750
 front side meaning we were watching 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.880
 on the mechanism from here here I am the mechanism 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.060
 specifically put above later show 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:13.350
 Why do we make three films? 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:19.670
 redstone put here any block i will 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:25.580
 use the stove and torch on it further 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:28.409
 so on we install the piston here 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.310
 set it up dig two here 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.380
 block finally to block slime here we are 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.780
 put the stove or stove guys or 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.180
 obsidian to block the mucus of it 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.200
 didn't cling here we dug two blocks 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.909
 too to put it and start 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.790
 use what I don't like 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.750
 use glowing stone 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:54.080
 but withdraw in another way 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:58.590
 we leave him like this 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.909
 have he climbed us to the top above 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.240
 it is not necessary that is, we understand it to 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:08.099
 level of this piston 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:10.569
 further at piston level here we set 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:16.459
 block 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:19.160
 on the hatch block so stop I'm sorry down on 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:25.730
 one block you have to go down here we are 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:29.230
 set the block hatch further up to 2 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.790
 2 blocks higher we put another glitch 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.250
 there are guys here we can close here 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.110
 we can close this block here 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.030
 the input of our scheme put the button here 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.459
 have now now we just need 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.349
 put here so here forms a genuine 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.019
 preferably guys make racks for armor 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:50.590
 to forever put only three pieces 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:53.510
 ready and now we see that when we 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.670
 Click on the past rack for 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.980
 armor following jump out i have one 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:02.299
 drops grass hi now i will show you 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.760
 how this scheme is arranged then 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:07.760
 there is why armor racks jump out and 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.370
 you will immediately understand that the circuit is very 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.630
 easily stacks us so abundantly for this 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.500
 reason to show how it works 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:20.780
 I dug a hole near and make a block 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:23.500
 above and so as you see the signal is sent to 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.660
 here is this block 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.459
 activates pistons higher further how 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.500
 way and our armor changes places 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.230
 the lowest armor of which is located 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.660
 below all 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.209
 jumps to the very top with this hatch 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:42.639
 open exactly half a second that 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:45.560
 allows armor to fall on top 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:48.049
 raft from the bottom of the selection which is 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.190
 at the meeting below where the gold is now 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:53.239
 falls on sticky blog 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.750
 just for this we raise here 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:04:00.109
 redstone on the stone to open here 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.910
 this hatch is parallel with this 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:03.019
 with this hatch here and also here are help frames 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.870
 1 tone 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.299
 After all, guys, the system is very simple . 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.299
 You can put next to right away 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:12.319
 put 2 3 pieces it should not friend 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.889
 other interfering strongly 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:18.169
 and should work quite well only 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.650
 guys, it is desirable to skip one block 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.930
 between 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.240
 and yet so that the diet was connected 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:29.470
 then you can make beautiful 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:32.000
 Warehouse elected bronik different and as 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.080
 joining different your friends you can 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.520
 change for different armor 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.169
 she turned them like this video 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:41.320
 subscribe to the channel join 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:41.320
 group vkontakte all good luck to all bye
