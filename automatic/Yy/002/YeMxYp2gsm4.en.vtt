 the new videos to my comment is 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.619
 asked for suggestions in the videos of 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.650
 applications in holes that I'm going to start 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.990
 Blue basically going to download 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.300
 application that phone has any 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.460
 problem and by memory has a lot 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.010
 memory so not now because 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.489
 worry and the game and well it fits or not 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.350
 we fit in the phone we will look for it 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.030
 quickly in the game where he writes 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.420
 well candy 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.629
 candy cross as it appears here above 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:56.120
 sweets that crash or collide 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:59.570
 basically it would be like in translation 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.270
 surely the first appears 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.280
 little pictures are for the sweets and coughs 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.650
 which there are sweet as are the 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.960
 of living more or less than in the USA 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.729
 we know as jelly bean and others that 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.650
 are I noticed pips and dashes that are 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.570
 sweet as well 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.510
 as you will see the game company only 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.810
 42 gigabytes this phone does not have 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:24.760
 no problem to install my home 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.920
 we will see it quickly 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.390
 while we wait for it to download 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.490
 so that an image where after 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.370
 apply more or less of what is the 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.250
 game massively the flight moves to 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.330
 through a map 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.760
 like the one that can be seen here 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.270
 where each map in each station is a 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.640
 level that has more than 100 levels and 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.950
 basically every screen similar to this one 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.810
 is very similar to what is the game of 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.450
 tetris for all that we play would have 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.570
 an occasion however in this case in 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.250
 tetris speak the chips and go down 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.530
 while here the fruit is already 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.420
 appears online also on the screen and 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.650
 as we go disappearing reviews 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.760
 they go down more fruits to the screen 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.780
 it basically consists of how I told you 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.660
 do three online for example 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.910
 or 4 in Libya to make four lines 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.190
 that wild fruits do not appear for him 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.690
 so to do three lines in this case 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.330
 we would have to exchange this 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.190
 yellow with this green basically the 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.459
 movements are made thus exchanging 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:33.160
 two fruits exchanging a colony of 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:36.340
 this way or so either vertical 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.400
 or horizontal and we do exchange 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:44.620
 fruits to make lines of three or 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:47.560
 four of tele5 the game consists of 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.690
 get a point goal in a 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.870
 determined number of movements in addition 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:56.280
 of that we are given other challenges as to 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.959
 see and then you're already installing 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.000
 very surely there will not be any 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.730
 inconvenience with the samsung galaxy fame 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.880
 It is a very good phone I would say 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:10.440
 would that if the 3000 s is the brother 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.870
 less than ls 3 and the cein of human beings 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.670
 and less twin more or less of that trans 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.670
 mini alone that has a little less than 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.560
 memory capacity and a little less 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.580
 of you can jauri ram 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.580
 we are going to open 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.690
 properly here is the we can 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.790
 loading 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.540
 we're going to let both of us walk in 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.590
 Your first start of Samsung Galaxy Fem 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.209
 I would think that generally the problem 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.189
 let's lower the volume let's 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.090
 enter the game as I said 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:44.530
 basically that is a map of stations 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.469
 when you have to go completely 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.180
 more than 100 levels the first five 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:50.660
 levels basically we are taught to 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.550
 to play 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.240
 although it is quickly the first game 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.130
 first level 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.440
 and here we are told what is the 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.840
 movement of the candy here says that 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.420
 I have to make an exchange between these 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.660
 two and in that way then do three in 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.660
 line 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.470
 and obviously as the day below we 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.459
 shows the number of movements that 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:19.000
 we have and the goal of points and the 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.410
 number of points we are already having 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.720
 we are looking for let's live here 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.720
 another do three others online and others 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.910
 three online 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.530
 and so simple we can go completing 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.630
 the levels especially for this video 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.890
