hello everyone NIF here and i wanted to

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.280 
hello everyone NIF here and i wanted to
make<00:00:04.770> a<00:00:04.830> quick<00:00:05.009> video<00:00:05.220> today<00:00:05.670> because<00:00:05.850> I<00:00:06.540> made

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
make a quick video today because I made

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.470 
make a quick video today because I made
a<00:00:07.319> video<00:00:07.440> in<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:07.680> last<00:00:07.770> few<00:00:08.010> days<00:00:08.099> but<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:09.360> one

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
a video in the last few days but the one

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.089 
a video in the last few days but the one
problem<00:00:09.630> is<00:00:09.960> it<00:00:10.290> was<00:00:10.410> all<00:00:10.500> about<00:00:10.650> biomes<00:00:10.980> in

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
problem is it was all about biomes in

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.320 
problem is it was all about biomes in
the<00:00:11.219> distribution<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:11.759> that<00:00:11.880> sort<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.059> thing

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
the distribution and that sort of thing

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.810 
the distribution and that sort of thing
funnily<00:00:13.200> enough<00:00:13.250> right<00:00:14.250> after<00:00:14.280> I<00:00:14.580> made<00:00:14.730> that

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
funnily enough right after I made that

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.700 
funnily enough right after I made that
video<00:00:14.910> I<00:00:15.299> completely<00:00:16.109> changed<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.619> whole

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
video I completely changed the whole

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.560 
video I completely changed the whole
system<00:00:17.070> for<00:00:17.190> biomes<00:00:17.520> so<00:00:17.970> yeah<00:00:18.090> it's<00:00:18.420> kind<00:00:18.480> of

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
system for biomes so yeah it's kind of

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.890 
system for biomes so yeah it's kind of
funny

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
funny

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.620 
funny
the<00:00:19.529> reason<00:00:19.859> being<00:00:20.010> in<00:00:20.310> like<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.910> simple<00:00:21.510> way<00:00:21.600> to

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
the reason being in like a simple way to

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.599 
the reason being in like a simple way to
do<00:00:21.779> biomes<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.199> with<00:00:22.350> noise<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:22.890> was<00:00:23.310> gonna<00:00:23.460> do

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
do biomes is with noise I was gonna do

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.580 
do biomes is with noise I was gonna do
that<00:00:23.730> originally<00:00:24.060> but<00:00:24.180> then<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:24.300> decided<00:00:24.660> not

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
that originally but then I decided not

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.870 
that originally but then I decided not
to<00:00:25.650> do<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:26.010> instead<00:00:26.310> do<00:00:26.550> this<00:00:26.699> really

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
to do that instead do this really

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.939 
to do that instead do this really
complicated<00:00:27.810> thing<00:00:28.050> using<00:00:28.470> like<00:00:28.590> variety

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
complicated thing using like variety

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.550 
complicated thing using like variety
graphs<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.340> stuff<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:30.199> I<00:00:31.199> thought<00:00:31.410> that

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
graphs and stuff and I thought that

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.069 
graphs and stuff and I thought that
would<00:00:31.650> work<00:00:31.679> that'd<00:00:32.009> be<00:00:32.130> good<00:00:32.219> idea<00:00:32.540> but<00:00:33.540> I

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
would work that'd be good idea but I

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.260 
would work that'd be good idea but I
tried<00:00:35.040> for<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> long<00:00:35.460> time<00:00:35.640> coding<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:35.940> working

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
tried for a long time coding it working

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.240 
tried for a long time coding it working
when<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.140> made<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.380> last<00:00:37.469> video<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.829> had<00:00:37.980> got<00:00:38.160> it

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
when I made the last video I had got it

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.680 
when I made the last video I had got it
working<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:38.790> thought<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.030> was<00:00:39.120> fine<00:00:39.360> but

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
working and I thought it was fine but

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.869 
working and I thought it was fine but
then<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.500> suddenly<00:00:40.649> realize<00:00:40.950> this<00:00:41.100> big<00:00:41.250> massive

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
then I suddenly realize this big massive

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.310 
then I suddenly realize this big massive
glaring<00:00:42.300> problem<00:00:42.600> at<00:00:42.690> had<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:42.960> it's<00:00:43.050> like<00:00:43.140> oh

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
glaring problem at had and it's like oh

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.549 
glaring problem at had and it's like oh
this<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.070> just<00:00:44.250> not<00:00:44.370> gonna<00:00:44.460> work<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:44.940> yeah<00:00:45.530> so<00:00:46.530> I

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
this is just not gonna work so yeah so I

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.660 
this is just not gonna work so yeah so I
mean<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.860> probably<00:00:46.980> could<00:00:47.190> have<00:00:47.280> worked<00:00:47.460> on<00:00:47.579> it

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
mean I probably could have worked on it

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.220 
mean I probably could have worked on it
for<00:00:47.730> Allah<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.300> know<00:00:48.390> why<00:00:48.690> longer<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.020> got<00:00:49.170> it

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
for Allah you know why longer I got it

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.049 
for Allah you know why longer I got it
working<00:00:49.410> but<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:50.399> got<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.760> point<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:51.000> was

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
working but it got to the point I was

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.279 
working but it got to the point I was
like<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.270> know<00:00:51.329> what<00:00:51.449> screw<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.079> let's<00:00:52.260> just

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
like you know what screw it let's just

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.279 
like you know what screw it let's just
do<00:00:52.500> noise<00:00:53.030> so<00:00:54.030> now<00:00:54.390> I'm<00:00:54.660> actually<00:00:54.780> using<00:00:54.989> like

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
do noise so now I'm actually using like

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.170 
do noise so now I'm actually using like
the<00:00:55.530> same<00:00:56.100> kind<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.370> noisy's<00:00:56.730> for<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.940> ground

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
the same kind of noisy's for the ground

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.910 
the same kind of noisy's for the ground
and<00:00:57.390> stuff<00:00:57.539> I'm<00:00:58.079> not<00:00:58.199> using<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.590> generate<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
and stuff I'm not using to generate the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.889 
and stuff I'm not using to generate the
biomes<00:00:59.250> as<00:00:59.370> well<00:00:59.489> and<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.359> advantage<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:00.809> this

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
biomes as well and the advantage of this

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.080 
biomes as well and the advantage of this
is<00:01:01.050> it's<00:01:01.199> number<00:01:01.590> one<00:01:01.739> very<00:01:01.920> fast<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.460> number

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
is it's number one very fast and number

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.729 
is it's number one very fast and number
two<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.480> gives<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.719> much<00:01:03.930> smoother<00:01:04.379> kind<00:01:04.680> of

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
two it gives you much smoother kind of

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.530 
two it gives you much smoother kind of
like<00:01:04.860> curves<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.670> like<00:01:05.760> edges<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.270> biomes

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
like curves and like edges to the biomes

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.750 
like curves and like edges to the biomes
which<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.900> nice<00:01:07.130> and<00:01:08.130> I've<00:01:08.430> made<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.610> bottom

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
which is nice and I've made the bottom

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.070 
which is nice and I've made the bottom
is<00:01:08.909> quite<00:01:09.060> small<00:01:09.360> just<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.689> kind<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:09.900> show<00:01:10.049> off

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
is quite small just to kind of show off

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.899 
is quite small just to kind of show off
you<00:01:10.590> know<00:01:10.650> different<00:01:11.310> biomes<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.700> video

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
you know different biomes in this video

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.940 
you know different biomes in this video
for<00:01:12.869> them<00:01:13.080> yet<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.500> future<00:01:13.680> they<00:01:13.770> can<00:01:13.799> be

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
for them yet in the future they can be

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.380 
for them yet in the future they can be
any<00:01:14.040> size<00:01:14.280> really<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:15.030> yeah<00:01:15.119> let's<00:01:15.270> have<00:01:15.360> a

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
any size really so yeah let's have a

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.060 
any size really so yeah let's have a
look<00:01:15.479> around<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:16.350> as<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.619> can<00:01:16.680> see<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.950> top

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
look around so as you can see in the top

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.160 
look around so as you can see in the top
left<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.549> grasslands<00:01:18.030> biome<00:01:18.330> this<00:01:19.049> is

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
left this is a grasslands biome this is

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.420 
left this is a grasslands biome this is
kind<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.380> like<00:01:19.500> your<00:01:19.590> standard<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:20.310> know

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
kind of like your standard you know

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.340 
kind of like your standard you know
Plains<00:01:20.729> just<00:01:21.210> plain<00:01:21.570> grass<00:01:21.780> nothing<00:01:22.170> special

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
a few trees here and there but if you go

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.319 
a few trees here and there but if you go
this<00:01:25.500> way<00:01:26.240> Tom<00:01:27.240> Chisum<00:01:28.759> we<00:01:29.759> pretty<00:01:30.240> much

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
this way Tom Chisum we pretty much

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.060 
this way Tom Chisum we pretty much
immediately<00:01:30.479> run<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:31.049> taiga<00:01:31.560> biome<00:01:31.680> and

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
immediately run to a taiga biome and

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.770 
immediately run to a taiga biome and
again<00:01:32.939> you'll<00:01:33.090> probably<00:01:33.119> familiar<00:01:33.450> with<00:01:33.659> this

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
again you'll probably familiar with this

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.020 
again you'll probably familiar with this
one<00:01:33.960> from<00:01:34.079> Minecraft<00:01:34.590> because<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.850> one's

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
one from Minecraft because this one's

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.469 
one from Minecraft because this one's
kind<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.240> like<00:01:36.650> it's<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.799> bit<00:01:38.159> colder<00:01:38.729> but<00:01:39.360> it's

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
kind of like it's a bit colder but it's

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.289 
kind of like it's a bit colder but it's
still<00:01:39.720> quite<00:01:39.930> wet<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.579> I<00:01:41.579> should<00:01:42.180> mention

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
still quite wet and I should mention

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.840 
still quite wet and I should mention
that<00:01:42.509> all<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.750> biomes<00:01:43.110> are<00:01:43.200> done<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.380> terms<00:01:43.560> of

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
that all the biomes are done in terms of

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.310 
that all the biomes are done in terms of
basically<00:01:44.850> just<00:01:45.110> precipitation<00:01:46.110> and

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
basically just precipitation and

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.770 
basically just precipitation and
temperature<00:01:46.820> so<00:01:47.820> that's<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.149> two<00:01:48.299> factors

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
temperature so that's the two factors

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.350 
temperature so that's the two factors
that<00:01:48.810> determine<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.729> so<00:01:50.729> like<00:01:51.000> whereas<00:01:51.270> the

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
that determine it so like whereas the

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.850 
that determine it so like whereas the
grasslands<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:51.990> kind<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.229> middle<00:01:52.439> ish<00:01:52.530> in<00:01:52.649> both

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
grasslands is kind of middle ish in both

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.370 
grasslands is kind of middle ish in both
if<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.700> go<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:54.240> little<00:01:54.390> bit<00:01:54.600> colder<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.079> get<00:01:55.200> to

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
if you go a little bit colder you get to

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.560 
if you go a little bit colder you get to
taiga<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.490> have<00:01:56.579> these<00:01:56.670> pine<00:01:56.969> trees<00:01:57.000> and

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
taiga and you have these pine trees and

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.300 
taiga and you have these pine trees and
some<00:01:57.689> snow<00:01:57.899> on<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.079> ground<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.380> stuff<00:01:58.560> so

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
some snow on the ground and stuff so

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.420 
some snow on the ground and stuff so
yeah<00:01:59.430> which<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.509> nice<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:01.130> then<00:02:02.130> if<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.310> keep

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
yeah which is nice and then if you keep

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.410 
yeah which is nice and then if you keep
going<00:02:03.229> you'll<00:02:04.229> notice<00:02:04.500> next<00:02:05.340> from<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.729> taiga

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
going you'll notice next from the taiga

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.380 
going you'll notice next from the taiga
we<00:02:06.509> go<00:02:06.659> into<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.930> tundra<00:02:07.740> biome<00:02:07.890> yeah<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:09.149> is

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
we go into a tundra biome yeah this is

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.510 
we go into a tundra biome yeah this is
the<00:02:09.509> coldest<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.379> driest<00:02:11.039> biome<00:02:11.340> ready

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
the coldest and the driest biome ready

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.230 
the coldest and the driest biome ready
and<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.750> can<00:02:12.930> be<00:02:13.020> quite

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
and it can be quite

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.660 
and it can be quite
wet<00:02:13.360> too<00:02:13.780> but<00:02:13.900> it's<00:02:14.020> usually<00:02:14.170> dry<00:02:14.670> but

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
wet too but it's usually dry but

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.010 
wet too but it's usually dry but
basically<00:02:16.000> this<00:02:16.180> is<00:02:16.270> just<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.510> massive<00:02:16.780> ice

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
basically this is just a massive ice

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.220 
basically this is just a massive ice
biome<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:19.600> thing<00:02:19.780> you'll<00:02:19.900> notice<00:02:20.080> is

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
biome and the thing you'll notice is

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.020 
biome and the thing you'll notice is
that<00:02:20.290> like<00:02:20.530> we<00:02:20.650> came<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.160> this<00:02:21.280> not<00:02:21.700> from<00:02:21.880> like

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
that like we came to this not from like

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.330 
that like we came to this not from like
a<00:02:22.060> hot<00:02:22.330> desert<00:02:22.540> but<00:02:23.230> from<00:02:23.530> an<00:02:23.740> actual<00:02:24.010> taiga

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
a hot desert but from an actual taiga

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.380 
a hot desert but from an actual taiga
biome<00:02:24.460> so<00:02:24.700> it<00:02:24.790> kind<00:02:24.910> of<00:02:24.940> makes<00:02:25.090> more<00:02:25.180> sense

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
biome so it kind of makes more sense

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.660 
biome so it kind of makes more sense
that<00:02:25.450> way<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.950> also<00:02:27.160> you<00:02:27.310> might<00:02:27.430> notice<00:02:27.640> that

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
that way and also you might notice that

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.950 
that way and also you might notice that
the<00:02:27.940> transition<00:02:28.480> between<00:02:28.540> them<00:02:28.780> is<00:02:28.870> quite

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
the transition between them is quite

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.020 
the transition between them is quite
nice<00:02:29.230> like<00:02:30.040> there's<00:02:30.220> no<00:02:30.280> smooth<00:02:30.610> kind<00:02:30.970> of

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
nice like there's no smooth kind of

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.910 
nice like there's no smooth kind of
transition<00:02:31.450> but<00:02:31.630> you<00:02:32.050> get<00:02:32.200> this<00:02:32.320> nice<00:02:32.530> kind<00:02:32.860> of

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
transition but you get this nice kind of

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.980 
transition but you get this nice kind of
like<00:02:33.010> smooth<00:02:33.790> curve<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.390> it's<00:02:34.480> just<00:02:34.630> looks

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
like smooth curve and it's just looks

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.120 
like smooth curve and it's just looks
good<00:02:35.140> yeah<00:02:35.740> indeed<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:38.650> in<00:02:38.770> the<00:02:38.860> bottom<00:02:38.980> we

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
good yeah indeed and in the bottom we

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.280 
good yeah indeed and in the bottom we
have<00:02:39.250> like<00:02:39.370> ice-covered<00:02:39.820> snow<00:02:40.210> or<00:02:40.870> snow<00:02:41.020> cored

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
have like ice-covered snow or snow cored

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.490 
have like ice-covered snow or snow cored
ice<00:02:41.520> and<00:02:42.520> just<00:02:42.700> moist<00:02:43.030> underneath<00:02:43.300> that<00:02:43.500> and

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
ice and just moist underneath that and

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.720 
ice and just moist underneath that and
also<00:02:44.650> this<00:02:44.890> kind<00:02:45.100> of<00:02:45.130> shows<00:02:45.280> off<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.520> fact

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
also this kind of shows off the fact

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.760 
also this kind of shows off the fact
that<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:46.000> biomes<00:02:46.390> kind<00:02:46.720> of<00:02:46.780> diff<00:02:47.020> like<00:02:47.200> when<00:02:47.740> I

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
that the biomes kind of diff like when I

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:48.930 
that the biomes kind of diff like when I
create<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.070> biome<00:02:48.310> I<00:02:48.370> can<00:02:48.490> just<00:02:48.610> define<00:02:48.820> the

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
create a biome I can just define the

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.610 
create a biome I can just define the
layers<00:02:49.120> and<00:02:49.810> they<00:02:49.900> can<00:02:50.020> go<00:02:50.080> down<00:02:50.230> as<00:02:50.320> far<00:02:50.350> as<00:02:50.500> I

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
layers and they can go down as far as I

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.350 
layers and they can go down as far as I
want<00:02:50.770> to<00:02:50.860> basically<00:02:51.250> but<00:02:51.430> I<00:02:51.670> mean<00:02:52.060> this<00:02:52.180> takes

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
want to basically but I mean this takes

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.730 
want to basically but I mean this takes
about<00:02:52.510> ten<00:02:52.750> blocks<00:02:52.870> to<00:02:53.050> hit<00:02:53.170> stone<00:02:53.440> but<00:02:53.710> I

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
about ten blocks to hit stone but I

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.930 
about ten blocks to hit stone but I
could<00:02:53.860> very<00:02:53.950> easily<00:02:54.070> me<00:02:54.340> to<00:02:54.430> go<00:02:54.520> down<00:02:54.670> 30

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
could very easily me to go down 30

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.310 
could very easily me to go down 30
blocks<00:02:55.120> and<00:02:55.300> have<00:02:55.390> different<00:02:55.570> types<00:02:55.990> of<00:02:56.110> rock

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
blocks and have different types of rock

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.950 
blocks and have different types of rock
and<00:02:56.500> stuff<00:02:56.680> you<00:02:56.740> know<00:02:57.150> ed<00:02:58.150> no<00:02:58.360> it's<00:02:58.510> cool

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
and stuff you know ed no it's cool

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.130 
and stuff you know ed no it's cool
but<00:02:59.830> yeah<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.730> sign<00:03:01.720> looks<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:01.990> bit<00:03:02.020> weird

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
but yeah the the sign looks a bit weird

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.870 
but yeah the the sign looks a bit weird
in<00:03:02.350> this<00:03:02.440> biome<00:03:02.590> but<00:03:02.770> again<00:03:03.010> I'm<00:03:03.130> just<00:03:03.250> right

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
in this biome but again I'm just right

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.310 
in this biome but again I'm just right
now<00:03:03.910> I<00:03:04.060> just<00:03:04.150> implemented<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.840> biomes<00:03:05.110> and

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
now I just implemented the biomes and

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.060 
now I just implemented the biomes and
I'm<00:03:05.380> just<00:03:05.470> trying<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:05.710> figure<00:03:05.800> out<00:03:05.920> what<00:03:06.040> I

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
I'm just trying to figure out what I

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.400 
I'm just trying to figure out what I
should<00:03:06.160> go<00:03:06.520> in<00:03:06.610> each<00:03:06.700> biome<00:03:06.990> so<00:03:07.990> similar<00:03:08.290> kind

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
should go in each biome so similar kind

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.710 
should go in each biome so similar kind
of<00:03:08.440> weird<00:03:09.000> but<00:03:10.000> yeah<00:03:10.150> so<00:03:10.300> if<00:03:10.360> we<00:03:10.420> move<00:03:10.570> on<00:03:10.690> from

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
of weird but yeah so if we move on from

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.250 
of weird but yeah so if we move on from
this<00:03:11.340> NYX<00:03:12.340> will<00:03:12.580> actually<00:03:12.910> hit<00:03:13.120> yeah<00:03:13.840> so<00:03:14.110> this

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
this NYX will actually hit yeah so this

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.230 
this NYX will actually hit yeah so this
biome<00:03:14.740> here<00:03:14.920> is<00:03:14.980> a<00:03:15.010> desert<00:03:15.370> but<00:03:15.970> it's<00:03:16.120> not<00:03:16.210> a

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
biome here is a desert but it's not a

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.880 
biome here is a desert but it's not a
hot<00:03:16.450> desert<00:03:16.630> this<00:03:16.900> is<00:03:16.960> a<00:03:17.080> temperate<00:03:17.470> desert<00:03:17.740> so

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
hot desert this is a temperate desert so

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.250 
hot desert this is a temperate desert so
it's<00:03:18.010> kind<00:03:18.160> of<00:03:18.190> like<00:03:18.570> you<00:03:19.570> know<00:03:19.600> in<00:03:19.750> America

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
it's kind of like you know in America

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.870 
it's kind of like you know in America
you'd<00:03:20.470> have<00:03:20.680> like<00:03:21.160> deserts<00:03:21.490> that<00:03:21.610> are<00:03:21.730> not

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
you'd have like deserts that are not

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.030 
you'd have like deserts that are not
like<00:03:22.210> scalding<00:03:22.690> hot<00:03:22.720> they'd<00:03:23.440> still<00:03:23.680> have<00:03:23.710> like

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
like scalding hot they'd still have like

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.860 
like scalding hot they'd still have like
you<00:03:24.100> know<00:03:24.190> just<00:03:24.370> kind<00:03:24.460> of<00:03:24.580> like<00:03:24.640> dirt<00:03:25.540> in<00:03:25.720> them

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
you know just kind of like dirt in them

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.410 
you know just kind of like dirt in them
little<00:03:26.080> bit<00:03:26.290> of<00:03:26.350> like<00:03:26.440> ghost<00:03:26.680> and<00:03:26.860> sand<00:03:27.070> on<00:03:27.160> top

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
little bit of like ghost and sand on top

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.580 
little bit of like ghost and sand on top
and<00:03:28.420> you<00:03:28.720> might<00:03:28.840> get<00:03:28.960> them<00:03:29.050> in<00:03:29.110> Australia<00:03:29.200> as

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
and you might get them in Australia as

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.490 
and you might get them in Australia as
well<00:03:30.030> but<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:31.870> these<00:03:31.960> are<00:03:32.110> kind<00:03:32.380> of<00:03:32.410> more

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
well but and these are kind of more

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.360 
well but and these are kind of more
common<00:03:32.860> these<00:03:32.950> deserts<00:03:33.310> I<00:03:33.520> think<00:03:34.510> anyway<00:03:34.780> and

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
common these deserts I think anyway and

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.470 
common these deserts I think anyway and
so<00:03:36.370> this<00:03:36.580> one<00:03:36.730> like<00:03:36.940> I<00:03:37.000> said<00:03:37.030> it<00:03:37.240> kinda<00:03:37.390> has

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
so this one like I said it kinda has

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.600 
so this one like I said it kinda has
this<00:03:37.600> kind<00:03:37.780> of<00:03:37.810> dirt<00:03:38.080> kind<00:03:38.410> of<00:03:38.470> like<00:03:38.610> covered

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
this kind of dirt kind of like covered

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.440 
this kind of dirt kind of like covered
in<00:03:39.700> dust<00:03:39.880> it<00:03:40.390> was<00:03:40.510> good<00:03:42.180> we<00:03:43.180> also<00:03:43.300> have

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
in dust it was good we also have

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.900 
in dust it was good we also have
cactuses<00:03:43.870> they<00:03:44.050> look<00:03:44.170> kind<00:03:44.320> of<00:03:44.380> terrible<00:03:44.910> but

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
cactuses they look kind of terrible but

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.050 
cactuses they look kind of terrible but
I'm<00:03:46.090> yeah<00:03:46.240> they're<00:03:46.390> a<00:03:46.420> thing<00:03:46.600> I<00:03:47.820> did<00:03:48.820> this<00:03:48.970> in

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
from that and so I mean again the way

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.190 
from that and so I mean again the way
these<00:04:00.460> are<00:04:00.640> done<00:04:00.730> now<00:04:00.880> is<00:04:01.060> like<00:04:01.660> beside<00:04:01.990> one<00:04:02.170> of

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
these are done now is like beside one of

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.360 
these are done now is like beside one of
these<00:04:02.350> we<00:04:02.470> can<00:04:02.590> have<00:04:02.680> a<00:04:02.710> hot<00:04:02.860> desert<00:04:03.010> but<00:04:03.280> we

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
these we can have a hot desert but we

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.560 
these we can have a hot desert but we
won't<00:04:03.490> have<00:04:03.550> a<00:04:03.640> hot<00:04:03.760> desert<00:04:03.940> beside<00:04:04.360> like<00:04:04.510> a

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
won't have a hot desert beside like a

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.350 
won't have a hot desert beside like a
tundra<00:04:04.870> biome<00:04:05.020> you<00:04:05.170> know<00:04:05.290> except<00:04:05.500> make<00:04:05.710> sense

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
tundra biome you know except make sense

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.900 
tundra biome you know except make sense
in<00:04:07.360> fact<00:04:07.690> even<00:04:07.900> here<00:04:08.590> this<00:04:09.459> Tundra

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
in fact even here this Tundra

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.370 
in fact even here this Tundra
technically<00:04:10.270> shouldn't<00:04:10.540> be<00:04:10.660> here<00:04:10.930> normally

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
technically shouldn't be here normally

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.650 
technically shouldn't be here normally
I'd<00:04:11.470> actually<00:04:11.740> have<00:04:11.830> a<00:04:11.860> cold<00:04:12.160> desert<00:04:12.400> here<00:04:12.700> but

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
I'd actually have a cold desert here but

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.060 
I'd actually have a cold desert here but
just<00:04:13.870> for<00:04:13.959> the<00:04:14.020> sake<00:04:14.230> of<00:04:14.260> a<00:04:14.560> messing<00:04:14.830> with<00:04:14.860> some

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
just for the sake of a messing with some

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.140 
just for the sake of a messing with some
stuff<00:04:15.220> right<00:04:15.310> now<00:04:15.459> I<00:04:15.490> had<00:04:15.640> that<00:04:15.790> said<00:04:15.970> to<00:04:16.030> the

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
stuff right now I had that said to the

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.500 
stuff right now I had that said to the
tundra<00:04:16.480> to<00:04:16.600> show<00:04:16.750> off<00:04:16.870> a<00:04:18.150> cold<00:04:19.150> desert<00:04:19.330> it's

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
tundra to show off a cold desert it's

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:20.699 
tundra to show off a cold desert it's
kinda<00:04:19.690> like<00:04:19.750> this<00:04:19.900> one<00:04:19.959> bahasa<00:04:20.320> Mike<00:04:20.560> it's

he's<00:04:37.069> savanna<00:04:37.550> biome<00:04:38.289> this<00:04:39.289> one's<00:04:39.470> also<00:04:39.740> quite

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
he's savanna biome this one's also quite

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.230 
he's savanna biome this one's also quite
common<00:04:40.190> as<00:04:40.280> well<00:04:40.370> but<00:04:40.580> this<00:04:40.669> is<00:04:40.819> kind<00:04:41.090> of<00:04:41.150> like

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
common as well but this is kind of like

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.499 
common as well but this is kind of like
a<00:04:41.479> drier<00:04:42.319> version<00:04:42.650> of<00:04:42.710> the<00:04:42.770> grasslands<00:04:43.509> kind

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:44.509 
a drier version of the grasslands kind

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:45.820 
a drier version of the grasslands kind
of<00:04:44.569> the<00:04:44.659> same<00:04:44.810> temperature<00:04:45.020> but<00:04:45.319> much<00:04:45.560> drier

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
of the same temperature but much drier

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.830 
of the same temperature but much drier
and<00:04:46.030> you<00:04:47.030> get<00:04:47.120> these<00:04:47.210> kind<00:04:47.419> of<00:04:47.479> like<00:04:47.569> trees

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
and you get these kind of like trees

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.379 
and you get these kind of like trees
these<00:04:47.990> are<00:04:48.139> based<00:04:48.319> off<00:04:48.440> acacia<00:04:48.770> trees<00:04:49.389> they

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
these are based off acacia trees they

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:51.909 
these are based off acacia trees they
are<00:04:50.419> very<00:04:50.870> very<00:04:51.139> basic<00:04:51.289> right<00:04:51.620> now<00:04:51.740> but

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
are very very basic right now but

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:53.770 
are very very basic right now but
they're<00:04:52.009> just<00:04:52.159> kind<00:04:52.280> of<00:04:52.310> placeholder<00:04:52.629> but<00:04:53.629> no
