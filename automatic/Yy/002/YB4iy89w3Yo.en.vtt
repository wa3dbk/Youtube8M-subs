00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.669
 I hope that it is all that is going on 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:20.729
 Visteon and insists on taking a break 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:26.409
 d 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.169
 on 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.140
 you can 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.840
 Pictures tell me in the city in the butt has pushed six days 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.500
 according to weather 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.200
 I can not go upstairs 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.860
 Hann put me in my position I'm from a group 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.410
 Scientists detained and out of shit all day 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.420
 Machine sit 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.949
 they do not want us to put them up as well as they need them but me 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.299
 should be grateful that they do not distract you that's crazy 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.770
 sorry but that's the way it is 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.500
 what do you say 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.289
 I do not want to know I do not know how SWR on 4 I can 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.450
 and that's better that way 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.340
 sure has 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.340
 provided safer 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.640
 he is a question that you can certainly answer 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.920
 why do people sometimes talk like they're coming out of there? 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.600
 Future the future I mean the present honored today she is herself 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.890
 surely they mean that there is the official language of the Holy Land 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.480
 that's what I wanted to say she has everything that seems important to him 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.200
 Consistent modern German expect a few anachronisms 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.790
 I think it is also for the city of Aachen you know Walter von der Vogelweide 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.000
 blow 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 then forget it 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.530
 can you tell me more bravely what is going on here apart from 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.080
 this whole kidnapping story 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.090
 Abs is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.979
 known for its antidepressants 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.799
 On the PC over there you will find them here but they already said that is not 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.069
 only medicine is what it is so also this development I do not like 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.150
 then I can assume that the Animals are not in their company profile 

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:23.429
 she laughs she does not know the advertisement Reinker 

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:25.669
 the good bike ride 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:27.809
 July has a lot to do 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:31.129
 As I said, if you want to know more about the company, go to the PC 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.359
 the telecommunications sector is particularly interesting 

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:20.409
 Next 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:22.309
 Dr 

00:04:22.309 --> 00:04:24.729
 Dr 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.729
 4 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.620
 the 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:22.409
 that is the time then pushes 

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:38.650
 Buslotsen 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.990
 do not worry she will be with us soon 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.620
 So why are you doing the Doc? What are you hoping to accomplish? 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.660
 they've been watching TV or reading a newspaper lately 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:51.349
 something never interested me 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:54.050
 then I give them the corner points 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.050
 the world is a mess he is inherited 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.029
 they saw it themselves 

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:03.639
 a thousand years lie between them and their ancestor but society 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:07.079
 is just as barbaric as dead 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.759
 What's your point 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:15.879
 Order is then the bank needs euros that's what we work towards 

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:18.830
 and that's it over it help us 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.180
 I should say that they want to build a better future 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.339
 that's exactly what we do 

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:29.379
 The human race Scheibner lead them wanting to know why they are here 

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:32.529
 what is expected of them 

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:37.339
 We will tell them and if they know how to lead their lives 

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:39.409
 everything will be better 

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:41.289
 better way 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:44.289
 the end of all conflicts big and small 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.090
 Half year's goal can not be fulfilled peace in all things 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:54.419
 I said I'm not an Assassin Admira not 

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:58.619
 I still see important as a pastor 

00:06:58.619 --> 00:06:59.430
 Forest 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:00.899
 until the 1st 

00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:04.169
 soon they will understand 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:05.430
 or not 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.069
 I do not care 

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:09.930
 "As long as we have time 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.149
 Flood is 

00:07:12.149 --> 00:07:15.529
 the ICW Tench ID is different 

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:16.699
 this is us 

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:17.819
 can 

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:20.819
 dpa 

00:07:22.619 --> 00:07:24.649
 Wiesbaden 

00:07:24.649 --> 00:07:27.649
 Not 

00:07:31.059 --> 00:07:34.059
 on 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:39.729
 to have 

00:07:39.729 --> 00:07:42.729
 we need money 

00:07:45.479 --> 00:07:48.619
 they always grab a head start they weather in their city 

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:51.680
