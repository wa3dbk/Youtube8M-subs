so what I have here are all my jigs that

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.970 
so what I have here are all my jigs that
I've<00:00:49.260> actually<00:00:50.360> organized<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.750> two<00:00:52.170> different

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
I've actually organized in two different

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.290 
I've actually organized in two different
groups<00:00:55.340> so<00:00:56.340> starting<00:00:57.300> here<00:00:58.790> right<00:00:59.790> here<00:01:00.060> I

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
groups so starting here right here I

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.100 
groups so starting here right here I
have<00:01:00.720> all<00:01:01.020> my<00:01:01.050> flipping<00:01:01.500> jigs<00:01:01.890> flipping<00:01:03.110> this

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
have all my flipping jigs flipping this

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.859 
have all my flipping jigs flipping this
is<00:01:04.549> determined<00:01:05.549> by<00:01:05.640> what<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.060> head<00:01:06.270> style<00:01:06.659> is

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
is determined by what the head style is

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.750 
is determined by what the head style is
the<00:01:07.590> shape<00:01:07.800> of<00:01:07.890> heads<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.159> these<00:01:08.370> are<00:01:08.520> flipping

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
the shape of heads so these are flipping

a combination of both

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.490 
a combination of both
I<00:01:56.580> don't<00:01:57.119> have<00:01:57.210> enough<00:01:57.420> jigs<00:01:57.720> to<00:01:57.869> be<00:01:58.080> really

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
I don't have enough jigs to be really

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.859 
I don't have enough jigs to be really
doing<00:01:58.650> that

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
doing that

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.260 
doing that
so<00:02:00.869> I'm<00:02:00.990> just<00:02:01.140> gonna<00:02:01.259> do<00:02:01.590> by<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.759> weight<00:02:03.030> of

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
so I'm just gonna do by the weight of

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.069 
so I'm just gonna do by the weight of
the<00:02:03.570> jig<00:02:03.840> once<00:02:04.649> so<00:02:05.299> for<00:02:06.299> example<00:02:06.719> like<00:02:06.869> when<00:02:06.960> I

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
the jig once so for example like when I

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.749 
the jig once so for example like when I
start<00:02:07.320> putting<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.649> flipping<00:02:08.009> jigs<00:02:08.250> in<00:02:08.429> I'll

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
start putting the flipping jigs in I'll

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.900 
start putting the flipping jigs in I'll
go<00:02:09.060> from<00:02:09.590> lightest<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.619> heaviest<00:02:10.979> flipping

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
go from lightest to heaviest flipping

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.270 
go from lightest to heaviest flipping
style<00:02:12.209> jeez<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:13.050> then<00:02:13.349> that<00:02:13.500> section<00:02:13.860> stops

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
style jeez and then that section stops

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.100 
style jeez and then that section stops
and<00:02:14.580> then<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.060> have<00:02:15.209> another<00:02:15.300> section<00:02:15.870> I'll<00:02:16.019> be

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
and then I have another section I'll be

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.259 
and then I have another section I'll be
foolish<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.860> say<00:02:16.980> football<00:02:17.400> head<00:02:17.550> jig<00:02:17.580> and

okay<00:02:18.569> from<00:02:19.260> lightest<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.800> heaviest<00:02:20.010> again<00:02:20.670> so

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
okay from lightest to heaviest again so

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.030 
okay from lightest to heaviest again so
I'll<00:02:21.750> show<00:02:21.959> you<00:02:22.019> how<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.319> put<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.680> jigs<00:02:22.920> in

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.740 
box looks like when you open it up and
you're<00:02:31.860> supposed<00:02:32.069> to<00:02:32.190> put<00:02:32.640> spinner<00:02:33.239> baits<00:02:33.510> in

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
you're supposed to put spinner baits in

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.270 
you're supposed to put spinner baits in
these<00:02:33.900> little<00:02:34.500> slots<00:02:34.680> right<00:02:34.890> here<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.190> then

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
these little slots right here and then

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.830 
these little slots right here and then
it<00:02:35.370> has<00:02:35.400> another<00:02:35.700> slot<00:02:36.030> for<00:02:36.239> buzzbaits<00:02:36.630> which

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
it has another slot for buzzbaits which

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.270 
it has another slot for buzzbaits which
should<00:02:36.930> look<00:02:36.989> a<00:02:37.049> little<00:02:37.110> different<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.890> that

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
should look a little different and that

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.430 
should look a little different and that
doesn't<00:02:38.819> work<00:02:38.910> for<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.209> jigs<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:40.200> have<00:02:40.290> to

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
doesn't work for the jigs you have to

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.960 
doesn't work for the jigs you have to
have<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.680> spinner<00:02:40.980> bait<00:02:41.190> part<00:02:41.519> for<00:02:41.819> it<00:02:41.880> to

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
have the spinner bait part for it to

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.880 
have the spinner bait part for it to
work<00:02:42.090> for<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.330> jigs<00:02:42.599> you<00:02:43.170> see<00:02:43.500> there's<00:02:43.709> these

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
work for the jigs you see there's these

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.610 
work for the jigs you see there's these
little<00:02:44.130> grooves<00:02:44.640> on<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.269> inside<00:02:45.660> what<00:02:46.590> you

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
little grooves on the inside what you

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.839 
little grooves on the inside what you
want<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:46.980> do

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
want to do

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.030 
want to do
let's<00:02:48.450> see<00:02:48.599> I'll<00:02:49.110> start<00:02:49.470> out<00:02:49.560> with<00:02:49.620> flipping

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
let's see I'll start out with flipping

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.860 
let's see I'll start out with flipping
jigs<00:02:50.489> and<00:02:50.760> we're<00:02:51.269> going<00:02:51.540> from<00:02:52.640> lightest<00:02:53.640> to

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
jigs and we're going from lightest to

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.600 
jigs and we're going from lightest to
heaviest<00:02:54.920> so<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:56.130> is<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.310> lightest

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
heaviest so this is the lightest

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.460 
heaviest so this is the lightest
flipping<00:02:56.940> jig<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.239> have<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:58.049> what<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.230> want<00:02:58.380> to

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
flipping jig I have and what you want to

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.580 
flipping jig I have and what you want to
do<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:58.860> take<00:02:59.579> this<00:02:59.940> head<00:03:00.900> part<00:03:01.170> right<00:03:01.319> here

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
do is take this head part right here

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.430 
do is take this head part right here
where<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.610> rubber<00:03:03.480> band<00:03:03.780> is<00:03:03.989> about<00:03:04.140> where<00:03:04.380> the

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
where the rubber band is about where the

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.500 
where the rubber band is about where the
rubber<00:03:04.620> band<00:03:04.890> is<00:03:05.069> fold<00:03:05.850> up<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.120> skirt<00:03:06.359> like

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
rubber band is fold up the skirt like

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.539 
rubber band is fold up the skirt like
this<00:03:06.780> so<00:03:07.109> it<00:03:07.470> doesn't<00:03:07.890> get<00:03:08.010> caught<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:08.930> then

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
this so it doesn't get caught and then

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:16.599 
this so it doesn't get caught and then
just<00:03:12.709> slide<00:03:13.709> it<00:03:13.890> on<00:03:14.010> in<00:03:14.220> just<00:03:15.150> like<00:03:15.269> that<00:03:15.329> and

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
just slide it on in just like that and

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:20.780 
just slide it on in just like that and
we'll<00:03:17.609> see<00:03:18.350> as<00:03:19.350> you<00:03:19.440> can<00:03:19.620> see<00:03:19.799> that<00:03:20.340> it's<00:03:20.579> just

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
we'll see as you can see that it's just

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.550 
we'll see as you can see that it's just
the<00:03:20.940> head<00:03:21.180> that's<00:03:21.420> caught<00:03:21.690> in<00:03:21.840> there<00:03:24.560> right

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
the head that's caught in there right

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.509 
the head that's caught in there right
and<00:03:25.709> so<00:03:25.950> my<00:03:26.250> next<00:03:26.280> heaviest<00:03:27.090> flipping<00:03:27.810> J<00:03:28.079> is

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
and so my next heaviest flipping J is

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:35.949 
and so my next heaviest flipping J is
this<00:03:29.519> guy<00:03:29.730> right<00:03:29.970> here<00:03:31.760> so<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:32.790> just<00:03:33.120> put<00:03:33.389> him<00:03:33.630> in

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.870 

and<00:03:36.959> then<00:03:37.709> I<00:03:37.950> got<00:03:38.160> this<00:03:38.370> guy

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.640 

make<00:03:41.880> sure<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.299> skirts<00:03:42.630> folded<00:03:43.049> back<00:03:43.260> so<00:03:43.500> it's

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
make sure the skirts folded back so it's

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.840 
make sure the skirts folded back so it's
not<00:03:43.799> a<00:03:43.829> mess<00:03:44.100> it's<00:03:44.910> a<00:03:44.970> little<00:03:45.180> harder<00:03:45.480> with<00:03:45.630> the

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
not a mess it's a little harder with the

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.460 
not a mess it's a little harder with the
silicone<00:03:47.850> cuz<00:03:48.180> it's<00:03:48.329> a<00:03:48.420> little<00:03:48.630> like<00:03:48.870> spongy

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
silicone cuz it's a little like spongy

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.170 
silicone cuz it's a little like spongy
and<00:03:49.500> floppy<00:03:49.859> but<00:03:50.400> it<00:03:50.519> still<00:03:50.730> works

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
and floppy but it still works

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.039 
and floppy but it still works
I'm<00:03:51.959> just<00:03:52.170> good<00:03:52.380> put<00:03:53.220> him<00:03:53.400> on<00:03:53.430> in<00:03:53.900> then<00:03:54.900> they

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
and so those are my flippin jigs I've

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.289 
and so those are my flippin jigs I've
gone<00:04:01.079> from<00:04:01.349> lightest<00:04:01.709> to<00:04:01.739> heaviest<00:04:01.880> now<00:04:02.880> I'll

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
gone from lightest to heaviest now I'll

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:10.250 
gone from lightest to heaviest now I'll
do<00:04:04.340> swim<00:04:05.340> jigs<00:04:07.009> so

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.509 

my<00:04:10.709> lightest<00:04:11.099> is<00:04:11.280> right<00:04:11.459> here<00:04:13.069> make<00:04:14.069> sure<00:04:14.310> the

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
my lightest is right here make sure the

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.170 
my lightest is right here make sure the
skirt<00:04:15.390> is<00:04:15.540> folded<00:04:15.840> back<00:04:15.870> and<00:04:16.730> put<00:04:17.730> him<00:04:17.910> on<00:04:18.000> in

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
skirt is folded back and put him on in

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:30.760 
skirt is folded back and put him on in
and<00:04:18.930> so<00:04:19.889> on<00:04:19.980> and<00:04:20.130> so<00:04:20.250> forth

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:45.460

tada

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.890 

just<00:04:51.060> like<00:04:51.210> that<00:04:51.510> I've<00:04:51.720> probably<00:04:52.320> had<00:04:52.650> about

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
just like that I've probably had about

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.950 
just like that I've probably had about
30<00:04:54.900> jigs<00:04:55.260> that<00:04:55.470> I<00:04:55.620> just<00:04:55.889> put<00:04:56.100> in<00:04:56.220> there<00:04:56.960> and

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
30 jigs that I just put in there and

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:04.190 
30 jigs that I just put in there and
look<00:04:58.110> how<00:04:58.260> compact<00:04:58.680> it<00:04:58.919> is<00:05:00.470> just<00:05:01.470> like<00:05:01.620> this<00:05:03.200> so

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
look how compact it is just like this so

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.050 
look how compact it is just like this so
I'd<00:05:04.800> like<00:05:04.980> to<00:05:05.040> thank<00:05:05.310> you<00:05:05.460> guys<00:05:05.490> for<00:05:05.880> watching
