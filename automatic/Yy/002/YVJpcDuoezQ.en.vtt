quite<00:00:01.469> a<00:00:01.500> common<00:00:01.920> training<00:00:02.310> exercise<00:00:02.909> with

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
quite a common training exercise with

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.230 
quite a common training exercise with
the<00:00:03.780> Arctic<00:00:04.230> is<00:00:05.009> basically<00:00:05.670> to<00:00:06.000> simulate

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
the Arctic is basically to simulate

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.000 
the Arctic is basically to simulate
pulling<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:07.020> pulp<00:00:07.259> which<00:00:07.529> is<00:00:07.710> that<00:00:07.859> the

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
pulling the pulp which is that the

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.339 
pulling the pulp which is that the
massive<00:00:08.309> sledge<00:00:08.550> that<00:00:08.580> we<00:00:08.820> have<00:00:09.080> and<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.110> do

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
massive sledge that we have and to do

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.060 
massive sledge that we have and to do
that<00:00:10.500> we<00:00:10.769> tend<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.099> use<00:00:11.160> tires<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:12.889> one<00:00:13.889> of<00:00:14.009> the

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
that we tend to use tires and one of the

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.660 
that we tend to use tires and one of the
ways<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.719> make<00:00:15.719> life<00:00:16.049> easier<00:00:16.500> is<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.430> pull<00:00:17.640> a

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
ways to make life easier is to pull a

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.340 
ways to make life easier is to pull a
much<00:00:17.970> heavier<00:00:18.420> load<00:00:18.690> than<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.080> will<00:00:19.230> be

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
much heavier load than you will be

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.740 
much heavier load than you will be
putting<00:00:19.560> out<00:00:19.770> there<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.310> these<00:00:20.750> tractor

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
putting out there and these tractor

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.109 
putting out there and these tractor
tires<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.230> suppose<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:23.490> weighs<00:00:23.699> about<00:00:23.939> the

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
tires I suppose it it weighs about the

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.060 
tires I suppose it it weighs about the
same<00:00:24.269> as<00:00:24.810> we're<00:00:25.080> gonna<00:00:25.199> be<00:00:25.380> pulling<00:00:25.619> in<00:00:25.980> the

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
same as we're gonna be pulling in the

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.040 
same as we're gonna be pulling in the
Arctic<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:26.730> it's<00:00:26.880> about<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.150> hundred<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.720> ten

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
Arctic so it's about a hundred and ten

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.529 
Arctic so it's about a hundred and ten
hundred<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.590> twenty<00:00:29.220> kilos<00:00:29.670> which<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.330> about

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
hundred and twenty kilos which is about

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.659 
hundred and twenty kilos which is about
the<00:00:30.689> same<00:00:30.869> way<00:00:31.140> obviously<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:32.219> doesn't<00:00:32.399> have

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
the same way obviously it doesn't have

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.170 
the same way obviously it doesn't have
nice<00:00:33.360> smooth<00:00:33.840> runners<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:35.190> feels<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:36.000> lot

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
nice smooth runners so it feels a lot

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.770 
nice smooth runners so it feels a lot
heavier<00:00:36.600> when<00:00:36.809> you're<00:00:36.960> dragging<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.010> that's

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
heavier when you're dragging it that's

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:47.600 
heavier when you're dragging it that's
makes<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.930> good<00:00:40.050> training<00:00:46.219> about<00:00:47.219> once<00:00:47.460> a

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
makes it a good training about once a

00:00:47.610 --> 00:01:06.860 
makes it a good training about once a
week

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:50.540 

I<00:01:38.750> want<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:48.530> today<00:01:49.530> was<00:01:49.800> my<00:01:49.950> first<00:01:49.980> day

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
I want you today was my first day

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.330 
I want you today was my first day
pulling<00:01:50.910> the<00:01:51.620> enormous<00:01:52.620> tractor<00:01:52.950> tire

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
pulling the enormous tractor tire

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.890 
pulling the enormous tractor tire
it<00:01:53.490> wasn't<00:01:53.730> considerably<00:01:54.180> better<00:01:54.360> than<00:01:54.660> it<00:01:54.720> is

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
it wasn't considerably better than it is

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.920 
it wasn't considerably better than it is
going<00:01:55.170> today<00:01:55.610> as<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.670> said<00:01:56.910> just<00:01:56.940> now<00:01:57.180> today<00:01:57.720> the

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
going today as I said just now today the

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.980 
going today as I said just now today the
year<00:01:58.340> it's<00:01:59.340> wet<00:01:59.580> on<00:01:59.610> the<00:02:00.000> tarmac<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.600> seems<00:02:00.810> to

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
year it's wet on the tarmac it seems to

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.030 
year it's wet on the tarmac it seems to
be<00:02:01.080> making<00:02:01.260> it<00:02:02.090> sticky<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.770> stopping<00:02:04.770> it

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
be making it sticky and stopping it

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.880 
be making it sticky and stopping it
although<00:02:05.550> I<00:02:06.000> know<00:02:06.330> nothing<00:02:06.870> about<00:02:06.960> physics

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
although I know nothing about physics

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.350 
although I know nothing about physics
but<00:02:08.130> personally<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:08.729> would<00:02:08.970> have<00:02:09.000> thought<00:02:09.179> the

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
but personally I would have thought the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.120 
but personally I would have thought the
water<00:02:09.510> would<00:02:09.750> make<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:10.140> smooth<00:02:10.679> slide

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
water would make it smooth slide

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.229 
water would make it smooth slide
smoothly<00:02:11.700> along<00:02:12.030> but<00:02:12.780> no<00:02:12.959> it<00:02:13.110> doesn't<00:02:13.140> so<00:02:13.800> I

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
smoothly along but no it doesn't so I

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.570 
smoothly along but no it doesn't so I
should<00:02:15.239> go<00:02:15.300> back<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.480> school<00:02:15.780> for<00:02:15.989> that<00:02:16.080> one

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
should go back to school for that one

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.190 
should go back to school for that one
but<00:02:18.800> I'm<00:02:19.800> hoping<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.340> like<00:02:21.030> talk<00:02:21.660> has<00:02:21.930> told

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
but I'm hoping that like talk has told

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.250 
but I'm hoping that like talk has told
me<00:02:22.410> that<00:02:22.440> putting<00:02:23.370> something<00:02:23.790> as<00:02:23.940> big<00:02:24.120> as<00:02:24.260> this

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
me that putting something as big as this

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.860 
me that putting something as big as this
will<00:02:26.010> make<00:02:26.040> life<00:02:26.190> a<00:02:26.459> little<00:02:26.610> bit<00:02:26.760> easier<00:02:26.870> next

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
will make life a little bit easier next

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.930 
will make life a little bit easier next
month<00:02:28.230> when<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.560> go<00:02:28.770> for<00:02:29.040> my<00:02:29.190> first<00:02:29.459> training

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
month when I go for my first training

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.580 
month when I go for my first training
session<00:02:30.060> on<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:31.140> Arctic<00:02:31.500> ice<00:02:32.510> so<00:02:33.510> we<00:02:34.350> bets

just pull a bit more the last part of
the<00:03:07.680> chapters<00:03:08.489> her<00:03:08.640> training<00:03:09.030> is<00:03:09.959> putting<00:03:10.350> it

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
the chapters her training is putting it

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.340 
the chapters her training is putting it
away<00:03:10.880> which<00:03:11.880> in<00:03:12.060> itself<00:03:12.360> is<00:03:12.480> not<00:03:12.660> easy<00:03:12.810> cuz<00:03:13.200> we

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
away which in itself is not easy cuz we

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.670 
away which in itself is not easy cuz we
do<00:03:13.470> that<00:03:13.650> by

flipping it which is apparently another
good<00:03:18.519> way<00:03:18.730> of<00:03:18.959> training<00:03:19.959> for<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.290> Arctic

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
good way of training for the Arctic

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.349 
good way of training for the Arctic
because<00:03:20.799> obviously<00:03:21.129> well<00:03:21.790> they<00:03:21.909> use<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.060> most

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
because obviously well they use the most
