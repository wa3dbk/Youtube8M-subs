00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:07.919
 Hello, today I want to show 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.690
 what paints do i use 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.230
 polycolor 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:21.590
 These are the paints I buy big cans 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:21.590
 and then their paint itself is capable 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.520
 like this 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.470
 i.e. she is not drying out here i'm 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.540
 all needles broke off 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.770
 so as not to inject so that it does not stick out 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.790
 and this is how to 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.870
 pimpochka closes paint as much as you 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.060
 need you brought 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.060
 if they took a lot 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.340
 here 140 milliliters is here in such 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.220
 tube 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:04.089
 I have worn out the whole tortured already 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:08.520
 long time ago and tearing me away 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.520
 gold color is very beautiful by the way color 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.120
 this 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:16.780
 I'll say number 144 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.960
 if anyone is interested in gold 144 very much 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.600
 cool golden color 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.950
 that is, there are more such tubes of ivans 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.860
 columns here you can see asterisks 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.340
 they denote ink density three 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.430
 the stars are very dense coloring two 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.850
 stars less dense on and so on 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:45.300
 me here we are watching 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:47.190
 paint number here also in tube 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.920
 painted ink density and 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:55.970
 asterisks and 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.970
 ken here 20 milliliters of paint 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.990
 still there is such paint but it 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.330
 chinese paint i have it very rarely 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.119
 use for 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:11.540
 on nails i use more for 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:15.459
 when I draw there I train I draw on 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:18.620
 paper gives red color took 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:21.409
 there are many who have such paint but 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.680
 I do not advise her to put on the nails because 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:28.930
 that she lies down transparent that is very 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.930
 many times you need to apply her nails
