00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.569
 Well 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.580
 one of the features probably our mentality 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.000
 our man is coming to be treated 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.370
 when already some body fell off when 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.800
 he fell off it 1 time he fell off 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.220
 you will come to be treated as they say bye 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.109
 thunder does not burst we say but I personally 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.449
 never came to me everything fell off 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.369
 when I basically feel 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.779
 normally seemed healthy 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.119
 man read that I'm fine 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.830
 well it came here of course not 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.460
 I opened up the problems that I myself 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.469
 knew i have problems with posture 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.239
 lie down and curves correctly with the liver due 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.920
 which my body is poisoning 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.570
 and so on yes I have a doctor to doctor 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.250
 It took 4 minutes to 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.250
 completely decompose all my problems 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.680
 put them and today is my fifth day 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.399
 workouts I can say that already for 5 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.350
 days I straightened a little back 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.770
 me and became a different construction 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.439
 to sleep differently that is and 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.340
 the first day of training for myself took 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.500
 decision I constantly stop all other types 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.600
 sports which is still engaged and accepted 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.240
 the decision is tightly dedicate yourself now 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.070
 muscle recovery find 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.540
 sometimes there are people for 3 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.909
 seconds do you understand what you want 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.500
 learn from him the next 10 years and here 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.240
 the doctor has become that person for me 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.920
 blue do you understand what depth of thought 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.570
 depth of mind is the mind mind of the body of this 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.420
 the person is simply amazed and the depth 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.979
 manufacturability and what he looks at 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.900
 The process does not fitter who repairs 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.150
 some particular detail is looking at 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.799
 the process is completely the same that is 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.549
 perceives a person as a single organism 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.140
 where his soul mind has a body and he 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.079
 knows clearly what he is pushing and what 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.060
 affects everything else so I would 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.979
 of course I really wanted many of ours 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.869
 people and citizens came into contact with it 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.969
 knowledge in general understood and erected for themselves 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:05.390
 health is still on the place where 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.390
 it should be exactly the first thanks
