maps from the initial launch of a game

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.160 
maps from the initial launch of a game
would<00:01:21.900> be<00:01:21.930> some<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.409> these<00:01:22.880> extravagant<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.170> I

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
would be some of these extravagant so I

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.530 
would be some of these extravagant so I
doubt<00:01:25.560> we'll<00:01:25.680> see<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:26.189> immediately<00:01:26.909> yeah

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
doubt we'll see that immediately yeah

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.310 
doubt we'll see that immediately yeah
and<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:28.110> mean<00:01:28.140> for<00:01:28.950> spec<00:01:29.759> ops<00:01:30.000> as<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.689> now<00:01:30.869> we

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
and I mean for spec ops as of now we

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.530 
and I mean for spec ops as of now we
have<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.829> decent<00:01:32.400> amount<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.880> maps<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.479> have

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
been released I I doubt these are all of

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.719 
been released I I doubt these are all of
them<00:01:36.030> but<00:01:36.509> um<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.020> as<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:38.070> guys<00:01:38.130> will<00:01:38.490> see<00:01:38.670> in

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
them but um and as you guys will see in

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.910 
them but um and as you guys will see in
the<00:01:38.790> article<00:01:39.210> there's<00:01:39.570> two<00:01:39.810> different<00:01:39.990> spec

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
the article there's two different spec

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.039

ops<00:01:41.040> mode<00:01:41.310> survival<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.119> mission<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.930> it

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
ops mode survival and mission so it

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.510 
ops mode survival and mission so it
looks<00:01:43.110> like<00:01:43.320> Infinity<00:01:43.799> Ward<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.159> it's<00:01:44.340> co

where<00:01:52.140> they<00:01:52.229> go<00:01:52.259> with<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.710> yeah<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.670> mean<00:01:54.000> you

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
where they go with that yeah I mean you

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.899 
where they go with that yeah I mean you
got<00:01:54.540> carbon<00:01:55.079> dome<00:01:55.619> ray<00:01:56.130> D'Arcy<00:01:56.549> town<00:01:56.729> and

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
got carbon dome ray D'Arcy town and

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.149 
got carbon dome ray D'Arcy town and
village<00:01:57.000> which<00:01:57.299> are<00:01:57.450> all<00:01:57.570> maps<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.649> another

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
village which are all maps so another

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.530 
village which are all maps so another
thing<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.520> can<00:01:59.640> probably<00:01:59.969> assume<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.509> that

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
thing you can probably assume is that

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.170 
thing you can probably assume is that
those<00:02:01.049> are<00:02:01.079> maps<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.590> are<00:02:01.729> gonna<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:03.060> are

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
those are maps that are gonna that are

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.670 
those are maps that are gonna that are

looks like some great some great quality
well<00:02:35.320> we'll<00:02:35.470> go<00:02:35.590> ahead<00:02:35.680> and<00:02:35.800> skip<00:02:36.100> skip<00:02:36.610> the

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
well we'll go ahead and skip skip the

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.580 
well we'll go ahead and skip skip the
first<00:02:36.910> year<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.330> first<00:02:37.450> viewer<00:02:37.750> just<00:02:37.990> shots

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
first year the first viewer just shots

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.010 
first year the first viewer just shots
of<00:02:38.800> looks<00:02:39.550> like<00:02:39.700> first<00:02:40.120> early<00:02:40.540> development

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
of looks like first early development

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.260 
of looks like first early development
the<00:02:41.230> Alpha<00:02:41.680> maps<00:02:41.950> then<00:02:42.820> you<00:02:42.910> have<00:02:43.030> some

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
the Alpha maps then you have some

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.780 
the Alpha maps then you have some
soldiers<00:02:43.690> and<00:02:44.050> then<00:02:44.770> this<00:02:45.340> is<00:02:45.400> something

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
soldiers and then this is something

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.160 
soldiers and then this is something
interesting<00:02:46.180> they<00:02:46.330> have<00:02:46.420> a<00:02:46.480> picture<00:02:46.780> of<00:02:46.810> it

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
interesting they have a picture of it

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.440 
interesting they have a picture of it
looks<00:02:47.380> like<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.560> helicopter<00:02:47.920> but<00:02:48.910> it<00:02:49.090> doesn't

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
looks like a helicopter but it doesn't

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.150 
looks like a helicopter but it doesn't
look<00:02:49.570> like<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:49.810> gunship<00:02:50.290> helicopter<00:02:50.920> it<00:02:51.010> looks

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
look like a gunship helicopter it looks

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.890 
look like a gunship helicopter it looks
more<00:02:51.310> of<00:02:51.430> like<00:02:51.580> a<00:02:51.610> transport<00:02:52.210> because<00:02:52.630> they

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
more of like a transport because they

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.270 
more of like a transport because they
said<00:02:53.140> that<00:02:53.170> they<00:02:53.380> want<00:02:53.560> to<00:02:53.650> want<00:02:54.100> it<00:02:54.160> to

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
said that they want to want it to

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.490 
said that they want to want it to
integrate<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.760> larger<00:02:55.150> Maps<00:02:55.360> so<00:02:56.020> maybe<00:02:56.320> this

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
integrate the larger Maps so maybe this

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.350 
integrate the larger Maps so maybe this
could<00:02:56.680> be<00:02:56.830> like<00:02:57.160> a<00:02:57.220> transport<00:02:57.760> vehicle<00:02:57.880> from

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
could be like a transport vehicle from

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.660 
could be like a transport vehicle from
point<00:02:58.630> A<00:02:58.720> to<00:02:58.750> point<00:02:58.930> B<00:02:59.140> and<00:02:59.470> then<00:03:00.100> you<00:03:00.220> also<00:03:00.400> see

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
point A to point B and then you also see

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.090 
point A to point B and then you also see
what<00:03:01.120> is<00:03:01.240> this<00:03:01.390> fish<00:03:01.750> I<00:03:02.500> don't<00:03:02.770> want<00:03:02.890> to<00:03:02.950> call

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
what is this fish I don't want to call

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.020 
what is this fish I don't want to call
it<00:03:03.130> tank<00:03:03.550> um<00:03:04.450> no<00:03:05.200> it's<00:03:05.470> a<00:03:05.710> it's<00:03:06.130> called<00:03:06.310> an<00:03:06.460> APC

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
it tank um no it's a it's called an APC

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.540 
it tank um no it's a it's called an APC
I<00:03:07.060> believe<00:03:07.830> pretty<00:03:08.830> much<00:03:08.980> what<00:03:09.160> they<00:03:09.250> are<00:03:09.400> is

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
I believe pretty much what they are is

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.820 
I believe pretty much what they are is
it<00:03:09.610> it's<00:03:10.180> somewhat<00:03:10.540> of<00:03:10.660> a<00:03:10.720> tank<00:03:10.990> but<00:03:11.380> I<00:03:11.410> lets

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
it it's somewhat of a tank but I lets

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.410 
it it's somewhat of a tank but I lets
you<00:03:11.890> transport<00:03:12.490> people<00:03:12.670> inside<00:03:13.060> and<00:03:13.270> has<00:03:13.390> a

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
you transport people inside and has a

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.360 
you transport people inside and has a
gunner<00:03:13.660> on<00:03:13.750> top<00:03:14.080> again<00:03:14.860> it<00:03:15.010> looks<00:03:15.100> like

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
gunner on top again it looks like

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.830 
gunner on top again it looks like
they're<00:03:15.520> taking<00:03:15.820> more<00:03:16.030> they've<00:03:16.270> taken<00:03:16.540> more

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
they're taking more they've taken more

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.840 
they're taking more they've taken more
of<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:17.050> battleship<00:03:17.709> I<00:03:17.920> mean<00:03:18.370> battlefield

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
of the battleship I mean battlefield

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.030 
of the battleship I mean battlefield
angle<00:03:19.300> and<00:03:19.510> trying<00:03:20.260> to<00:03:20.350> integrate<00:03:20.650> more

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
angle and trying to integrate more

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.949 
angle and trying to integrate more
vehicles<00:03:21.370> so<00:03:22.150> you<00:03:22.240> don't<00:03:22.390> know<00:03:22.450> how<00:03:22.660> many<00:03:22.810> are

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
vehicles so you don't know how many are

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.710 
vehicles so you don't know how many are
going<00:03:22.990> to<00:03:23.200> be<00:03:23.320> for<00:03:23.680> say<00:03:24.550> like<00:03:24.790> a<00:03:24.820> salt<00:03:25.180> but<00:03:25.540> it's

different<00:03:35.830> but<00:03:36.400> I'd<00:03:36.520> say<00:03:36.670> what<00:03:36.820> they<00:03:36.910> have

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
different but I'd say what they have

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.430 
different but I'd say what they have
done<00:03:37.060> is<00:03:37.450> they've<00:03:37.630> taken<00:03:37.660> a<00:03:37.990> couple<00:03:38.200> they're
