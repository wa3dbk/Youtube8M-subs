into<00:00:23.480> unlimit<00:00:24.480> build<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:26.390> here<00:00:27.390> they<00:00:27.570> are<00:00:27.980> and

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
into unlimit build so here they are and

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.859 
into unlimit build so here they are and
also<00:00:29.189> i'm<00:00:29.460> gonna<00:00:29.609> start<00:00:29.880> making<00:00:29.970> basic<00:00:30.510> stuff

pieces you go to 250 that's like how the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.680 
pieces you go to 250 that's like how the
speed<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.420> now<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.479> don't<00:00:54.960> get<00:00:55.170> eat<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.799> the

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
speed is now you don't get eat it the

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.840 
speed is now you don't get eat it the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
shortest one you can see which one's the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.590 
shortest one you can see which one's the
shortest<00:01:03.330> is<00:01:03.839> this<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.890> can<00:01:05.070> use<00:01:05.220> whatever

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
shortest is this you can use whatever

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.810 
shortest is this you can use whatever
but<00:01:06.600> i<00:01:06.630> recommend<00:01:07.049> using<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:08.100> shoulders<00:01:08.610> and

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
but i recommend using the shoulders and

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.940 
but i recommend using the shoulders and
not<00:01:08.970> too<00:01:09.090> long<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.480> this<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:10.410> can<00:01:10.470> be<00:01:10.680> for

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
not too long is this is this can be for

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.070 
not too long is this is this can be for
plague<00:01:11.220> planes<00:01:11.640> when<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.090> get<00:01:12.240> more<00:01:12.390> advanced

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
plague planes when you get more advanced

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.820 
plague planes when you get more advanced

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
you know maybe take a while maybe not

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.660 
you know maybe take a while maybe not
you<00:01:20.190> put<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.550> right<00:01:20.730> here<00:01:21.860> now<00:01:22.860> you'll<00:01:23.310> notice
