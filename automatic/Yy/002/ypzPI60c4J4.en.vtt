00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
printer then you want to go to just the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.640 
printer then you want to go to just the
regular<00:00:26.760> print<00:00:27.390> function<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:27.960> then<00:00:28.320> here<00:00:28.529> you

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
regular print function and then here you

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.470 
regular print function and then here you
have<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.800> variety<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.310> options<00:00:29.730> on<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.449> right

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.450 
have a variety of options on the right
for<00:00:31.109> instance<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.500> could<00:00:31.650> fill<00:00:31.890> each<00:00:32.130> page

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
for instance you could fill each page

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.930 
for instance you could fill each page
with<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.270> photo<00:00:33.530> you<00:00:34.530> fill<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.890> with<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.070> closer

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
with the photo you fill it with a closer

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.520 
with the photo you fill it with a closer
margin<00:00:36.420> right<00:00:36.510> there<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.809> one<00:00:36.989> will<00:00:37.110> fit<00:00:37.320> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
margin right there this one will fit the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.380 
margin right there this one will fit the
fit<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.100> fill<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.520> difference<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.149> that

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
fit and fill the difference is is that

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.030 
fit and fill the difference is is that
fit<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:39.989> going<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.410> make<00:00:40.590> sure<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
fit is going to make sure that the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.310 
fit is going to make sure that the
entire<00:00:41.340> photo<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.790> printed<00:00:41.910> even<00:00:42.390> if<00:00:42.510> there

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
entire photo is printed even if there

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.529 
entire photo is printed even if there
has<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.590> be<00:00:43.770> some<00:00:44.040> larger<00:00:44.550> margins<00:00:44.910> above<00:00:45.270> and

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
has to be some larger margins above and

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.180 
has to be some larger margins above and
below<00:00:46.079> or<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.500> left<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.800> right

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
below or to left and right

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.520 
below or to left and right
whereas<00:00:47.550> fill<00:00:47.820> might<00:00:48.329> crop<00:00:48.719> out<00:00:48.989> some<00:00:49.289> parts

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
whereas fill might crop out some parts

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.690 
whereas fill might crop out some parts
of<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.680> photo<00:00:49.890> like<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.250> left<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.579> right

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
of the photo like the left and right

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.029 
of the photo like the left and right
sides<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.750> always<00:00:52.020> fills<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.829> entire

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
sides so it always fills the entire

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.500 
sides so it always fills the entire
sheet<00:00:53.449> you<00:00:54.449> could<00:00:54.570> do<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.719> standard<00:00:55.230> 8<00:00:55.410> by<00:00:55.680> 10<00:00:56.070> or

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
sheet you could do a standard 8 by 10 or

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.150 
sheet you could do a standard 8 by 10 or
you<00:00:57.510> can<00:00:57.750> also<00:00:58.170> do<00:00:58.379> five<00:00:58.530> by<00:00:58.680> seven<00:00:58.739> two<00:00:59.039> four

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
you can also do five by seven two four

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.830 
you can also do five by seven two four
by<00:00:59.309> sixes<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.850> I'll<00:00:59.940> group<00:01:00.149> those<00:01:00.359> two<00:01:00.660> per

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
by sixes and I'll group those two per

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.529 
by sixes and I'll group those two per
page<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.770> can<00:01:01.949> also<00:01:02.039> choose<00:01:02.399> custom<00:01:03.359> and

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
page you can also choose custom and

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.660 
page you can also choose custom and
custom<00:01:04.350> then<00:01:04.500> will<00:01:04.680> allow<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.010> select

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
custom then will allow you to select

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.719 
custom then will allow you to select
aspect<00:01:06.510> ratios<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.229> case<00:01:07.520> I'm<00:01:08.520> just

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
aspect ratios in this case I'm just

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.250 
aspect ratios in this case I'm just
going<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.909> leave<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.270> there<00:01:09.450> on<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.900> custom

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
going to leave it there on the custom

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.440 
going to leave it there on the custom
effect<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.040> then<00:01:11.159> I'm<00:01:11.250> going<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.520> change<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
effect and then I'm going to change the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.539 
effect and then I'm going to change the
photo<00:01:12.600> size<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.229> can<00:01:13.350> shrink<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.680> down<00:01:13.830> or

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
photo size so you can shrink it down or

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.310 
photo size so you can shrink it down or
enlarge<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.119> if<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.299> gets<00:01:15.360> too<00:01:15.630> large<00:01:15.869> for

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.260 

for<00:01:19.320> one<00:01:19.439> page<00:01:19.680> it'll<00:01:19.920> go<00:01:20.070> here<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.310> 5<00:01:20.700> by<00:01:20.729> 2<00:01:20.939> is

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
for one page it'll go here so 5 by 2 is

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.410 
for one page it'll go here so 5 by 2 is
a<00:01:21.299> little<00:01:21.390> bit<00:01:22.040> too<00:01:23.040> long<00:01:23.340> let's<00:01:23.909> just<00:01:24.090> do<00:01:24.210> some

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
a little bit too long let's just do some

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.300 
a little bit too long let's just do some
sort<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.659> standard<00:01:25.020> or<00:01:25.140> like<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.290> 4<00:01:25.530> by<00:01:25.650> 3<00:01:25.680> and

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
sort of standard or like a 4 by 3 and

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.990 
sort of standard or like a 4 by 3 and
then<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.210> can<00:01:27.330> see<00:01:27.509> here<00:01:27.780> as<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.200> just<00:01:28.530> say<00:01:29.000> the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
then you can see here as I just say the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.120 
then you can see here as I just say the
width<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.780> height<00:01:30.810> automatically<00:01:31.680> adjusts

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
width the height automatically adjusts

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.249 
width the height automatically adjusts
to<00:01:32.189> fit<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.729> turned<00:01:33.090> out<00:01:33.210> at<00:01:33.329> 4<00:01:33.540> by<00:01:33.659> 3<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:33.960> can

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
to fit so I turned out at 4 by 3 I can

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.980 
to fit so I turned out at 4 by 3 I can
fit<00:01:34.470> all<00:01:34.650> 6<00:01:35.100> photos<00:01:35.430> here<00:01:35.640> on<00:01:35.820> one<00:01:36.180> page<00:01:36.420> now

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
fit all 6 photos here on one page now

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.330 
fit all 6 photos here on one page now
another<00:01:37.170> variation<00:01:37.500> on<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.189> go<00:01:38.280> to

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
another variation on this is to go to

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.100 
another variation on this is to go to
contact<00:01:38.880> sheet<00:01:39.090> well<00:01:39.450> contact<00:01:39.840> sheet<00:01:40.049> is

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
contact sheet well contact sheet is

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.870

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
think of creating these as things you

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.320 
think of creating these as things you
have<00:05:47.560> Apple<00:05:47.950> print<00:05:48.190> for<00:05:48.430> you<00:05:48.550> but<00:05:49.060> you<00:05:49.180> can

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
have Apple print for you but you can

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.070 
have Apple print for you but you can
create<00:05:49.600> a<00:05:49.810> book<00:05:50.530> here<00:05:50.890> and<00:05:51.070> just<00:05:52.060> select<00:05:52.750> any

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080

theme<00:05:53.170> you<00:05:53.470> want<00:05:54.450> create<00:05:55.450> it<00:05:55.630> and<00:05:55.840> you<00:05:56.350> end<00:05:56.500> up

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
theme you want create it and you end up

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.140 
theme you want create it and you end up
with<00:05:56.620> pages<00:05:57.250> in<00:05:57.400> the<00:05:57.640> book<00:05:57.820> that<00:05:58.440> you<00:05:59.440> can

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
with pages in the book that you can

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.780

print<00:06:01.150> you<00:06:02.080> don't<00:06:02.260> have<00:06:02.500> to<00:06:02.740> send<00:06:03.100> it<00:06:03.280> to<00:06:03.340> Apple

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
print you don't have to send it to Apple

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.680 
print you don't have to send it to Apple
so<00:06:03.940> you<00:06:04.120> can't<00:06:04.390> go<00:06:04.510> here<00:06:04.870> and<00:06:05.020> say<00:06:05.800> print<00:06:06.130> and

so you can't go here and say print and

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.350 
so you can't go here and say print and
you<00:06:07.690> get<00:06:07.930> the<00:06:08.350> pages<00:06:08.710> from<00:06:08.860> the<00:06:08.950> book<00:06:09.250> here<00:06:09.640> so
