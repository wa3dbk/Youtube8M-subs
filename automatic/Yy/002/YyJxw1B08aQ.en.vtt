don't know how to measure whether

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.840

they're<00:01:46.359> in<00:01:46.630> fact<00:01:47.049> really<00:01:47.530> louder<00:01:47.950> all<00:01:48.340> I

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
they're in fact really louder all I

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.980 
they're in fact really louder all I
noticed<00:01:49.270> is<00:01:49.929> do<00:01:50.859> they<00:01:51.159> have<00:01:51.189> a<00:01:51.460> unique<00:01:52.119> feel<00:01:52.659> to

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
noticed is do they have a unique feel to

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.529 
noticed is do they have a unique feel to
the<00:01:53.499> fingers<00:01:53.979> so<00:01:54.399> they<00:01:54.549> do<00:01:54.729> something<00:01:55.329> about

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
the fingers so they do something about

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.989 
the fingers so they do something about
them<00:01:56.079> that<00:01:56.109> makes<00:01:56.679> them<00:01:56.979> different<00:01:57.009> from<00:01:57.729> any

00:01:57.989 --> 00:01:57.999 
them that makes them different from any

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:00.419 
them that makes them different from any
other<00:01:58.240> string<00:01:58.600> I've<00:01:59.170> been<00:01:59.560> playing<00:01:59.859> good

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
other string I've been playing good

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:02.399 
other string I've been playing good
better<00:02:00.700> worse<00:02:01.030> I<00:02:01.270> don't<00:02:01.450> know<00:02:01.569> it's<00:02:01.810> just<00:02:02.109> it's

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
better worse I don't know it's just it's

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.029 
better worse I don't know it's just it's
different<00:02:03.039> I<00:02:03.420> happen<00:02:04.420> to<00:02:04.450> like<00:02:04.780> it<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:05.380> they

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
different I happen to like it and they

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.730 
different I happen to like it and they
seem<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:06.549> sound<00:02:07.329> louder<00:02:07.749> but<00:02:08.560> that's

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
seem to sound louder but that's

should<00:02:24.040> be<00:02:24.250> able<00:02:24.490> to<00:02:24.730> listen<00:02:25.390> very<00:02:25.420> closely

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
should be able to listen very closely

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.730 
should be able to listen very closely
how<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:28.060> strings<00:02:28.450> sound<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:29.080> then<00:02:29.320> hopefully

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
how the strings sound and then hopefully

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.370 
how the strings sound and then hopefully
you<00:02:30.730> can<00:02:30.910> make<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.120> decision<00:02:31.570> for<00:02:31.720> yourself<00:02:31.870> as

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
you can make a decision for yourself as

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.440 
you can make a decision for yourself as
to<00:02:32.440> whether<00:02:33.190> you<00:02:33.550> want<00:02:33.790> to<00:02:33.880> check<00:02:34.060> them<00:02:34.270> out<00:02:34.390> or

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
to whether you want to check them out or

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.830 
to whether you want to check them out or
not

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
article that I'm gonna write about the

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.920 
article that I'm gonna write about the
strings<00:02:53.470> so<00:02:53.680> this<00:02:53.980> is<00:02:54.130> how<00:02:54.250> they<00:02:54.400> look<00:02:54.610> like

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
strings so this is how they look like

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.700 
strings so this is how they look like
again<00:02:55.930> I<00:02:56.170> got<00:02:56.560> my<00:02:57.180> sample<00:02:58.180> here<00:02:58.210> for<00:02:58.630> free<00:02:58.960> they

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
again I got my sample here for free they

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.090 
again I got my sample here for free they
are<00:03:00.150> available<00:03:01.150> exclusively<00:03:01.360> through<00:03:02.110> Amazon

are available exclusively through Amazon

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.030 
are available exclusively through Amazon
and<00:03:03.400> I<00:03:03.970> believe<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.720> price<00:03:05.050> point<00:03:05.500> is<00:03:05.710> around

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
and I believe the price point is around

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.650 
and I believe the price point is around
thirteen<00:03:06.730> or<00:03:06.970> fourteen<00:03:07.030> dollars<00:03:07.960> and<00:03:08.940> um<00:03:09.940> yeah

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
thirteen or fourteen dollars and um yeah

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.760 
thirteen or fourteen dollars and um yeah
so<00:03:11.020> I<00:03:11.320> was<00:03:11.560> really<00:03:11.920> curious<00:03:12.220> to<00:03:12.460> see<00:03:12.930> how<00:03:13.930> they

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
so I was really curious to see how they

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:15.690 
so I was really curious to see how they
sound

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
sound

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.150 
sound
but<00:03:15.970> obviously<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.900> first<00:03:17.110> step<00:03:17.320> was<00:03:17.560> to<00:03:17.740> put

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
but obviously the first step was to put

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.310 
but obviously the first step was to put
them<00:03:18.310> on<00:03:18.370> my<00:03:18.430> guitar<00:03:18.970> which<00:03:19.300> was<00:03:19.330> easy<00:03:19.960> enough

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
them on my guitar which was easy enough

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.790 
them on my guitar which was easy enough
like<00:03:20.890> with<00:03:21.190> any<00:03:21.430> other<00:03:21.520> string<00:03:22.060> and<00:03:22.330> um<00:03:23.290> they

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
like with any other string and um they

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.750 
like with any other string and um they
come<00:03:23.980> individually<00:03:24.310> wrapped<00:03:24.820> let<00:03:25.780> me<00:03:26.760> show

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
come individually wrapped let me show

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.850 
come individually wrapped let me show

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
they ring with a lot of sustain and

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.110 
they ring with a lot of sustain and
another<00:04:30.080> thing<00:04:30.470> that<00:04:30.650> I<00:04:30.680> noticed<00:04:31.310> and<00:04:31.490> this<00:04:31.970> is

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
another thing that I noticed and this is

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.080 
another thing that I noticed and this is
highly<00:04:32.360> subjective<00:04:32.720> to<00:04:33.320> be<00:04:33.440> very<00:04:33.710> clear<00:04:34.100> they

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
highly subjective to be very clear they

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.890 
highly subjective to be very clear they
seem<00:04:35.600> to<00:04:35.960> be<00:04:36.170> a<00:04:36.380> little<00:04:36.980> thicker<00:04:37.490> or<00:04:37.910> stronger

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
seem to be a little thicker or stronger

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.380 
seem to be a little thicker or stronger
they<00:04:39.050> just<00:04:39.500> feel<00:04:39.920> different<00:04:40.340> when<00:04:40.880> you<00:04:41.090> play

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
they just feel different when you play

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.860 
they just feel different when you play
them<00:04:41.690> again<00:04:42.470> very<00:04:42.980> subjective<00:04:43.280> I<00:04:44.000> didn't<00:04:44.600> I

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
them again very subjective I didn't I

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.110 
them again very subjective I didn't I
don't<00:04:45.050> have<00:04:45.410> the<00:04:45.530> tools<00:04:45.830> to<00:04:45.980> you<00:04:46.550> know<00:04:46.670> measure

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
don't have the tools to you know measure

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.850 
don't have the tools to you know measure
the<00:04:47.570> thickness<00:04:47.870> of<00:04:48.230> the<00:04:48.350> strings<00:04:48.680> or

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
the thickness of the strings or

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:49.540 
the thickness of the strings or
whatsoever

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520
