00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
run as far as graphics goes it looks a

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.460 
run as far as graphics goes it looks a
bit<00:04:25.730> messy<00:04:26.090> but<00:04:26.120> it<00:04:26.330> really<00:04:26.510> was<00:04:26.750> just<00:04:27.050> a<00:04:27.230> short

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
bit messy but it really was just a short

future of the Bene marjan room and as

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.650 
future of the Bene marjan room and as
we've<00:04:31.430> mentioned<00:04:31.610> the<00:04:32.000> saturn<00:04:32.270> really<00:04:32.540> did

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
we've mentioned the saturn really did

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.560

have<00:04:32.870> issues<00:04:33.260> handling<00:04:33.740> 3d<00:04:34.180> so<00:04:35.180> with<00:04:35.330> that<00:04:35.450> in

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
have issues handling 3d so with that in

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.180 
have issues handling 3d so with that in
mind<00:04:35.600> I<00:04:35.930> think<00:04:35.990> the<00:04:36.230> developers<00:04:36.710> really<00:04:36.920> have

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
mind I think the developers really have

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.470 
mind I think the developers really have
managed<00:04:37.490> to<00:04:37.610> produce<00:04:37.760> something<00:04:38.150> pretty

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
managed to produce something pretty

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.680
