00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.100
- IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO FIND
POSITIVE STORIES

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.433
COMING OUT OF THE NFL LATELY,
WHICH IS WHY I LOVE

00:00:04.433 --> 00:00:06.833
THIS NEXT STORY
ABOUT TWO BROTHERS.

00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:10.200
- A PRO FOOTBALL STAR
GIVING UP HIS CAREER

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.633
TO GIVE HIS BROTHER
THE GIFT OF LIFE.

00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:14.900
- DEFENSIVE LINEMAN
MA'AKE KEMOEATU

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.700
HELPED THE RAVENS BRING HOME
THE LOMBARDI TROPHY.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.533
HIS LITTLE BROTHER CHRIS
DID THE SAME FOR THE STEELERS.

00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:23.433
- WHEN 31-YEAR-OLD CHRIS
HAD TO END HIS PLAYING CAREER

00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:25.033
BECAUSE HE NEEDED
A KIDNEY TRANSPLANT,

00:00:25.033 --> 00:00:27.433
IT WAS HIS OLDER BROTHER
WHO WAS READY TO HELP,

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:30.033
AND IN THE PROCESS,
ENDING HIS CAREER AS WELL.

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:31.733
- SOON AS MY BROTHER'S HEALTH
WAS AT RISK,

00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.200
I WANTED TO STOP EVERYTHING.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.200
I WANTED TO.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.633
- [singing]
ONE DAY TO GET IT ALL RIGHT

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:38.333
- EVERYBODY'S HERE.

00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:41.500
FAMILY'S HERE,
SO I GOT A LOT OF SUPPORT.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.533
- BENJI'S LIKE, "MAN,
YOU GONNA BE IN PAIN."

00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:44.700
LIKE, "PSSH, BENJI."

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.400
[clicks tongue]
- [laughing]

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.033
- I'M LIKE WOLVERINE.

00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:49.566
BUT IN THE BACK OF MY MIND,
I'M LIKE,

00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:50.966
"DANG, I HOPE
IT'S NOT GONNA HURT."

00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:51.966
[chuckles]

00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.133
- [singing]
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.600
- I DON'T WANT HIM TO FEEL
LIKE HE OWES ME ANYTHING.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.600
HE'S MY BROTHER.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.233
BUT WHAT I DO WANT IS A XBOX.

00:01:01.233 --> 00:01:02.466
SO THAT WOULD BE GOOD.

00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:03.466
A GOOD DEAL.

00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.666
A KIDNEY FOR A XBOX.

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:08.500
IT WAS MY RESPONSIBILITY
TO TAKE CARE

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.566
OF MY YOUNGER BROTHERS
AND SISTERS.

00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.933
IF ANY OF MY SIBLINGS
NEED BLOOD,

00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:14.400
IT WOULD BE MY BLOOD;

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.533
A KIDNEY,
IT WOULD BE MY KIDNEY.

00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:18.733
- [singing]
PICK YOU UP WHEN YOU FALL

00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:21.400
- I'M GONNA GO SEE
MY BROTHER.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.933
SEE HOW HE'S DOING
WITH HIS NEW KIDNEY.

00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:25.166
- [singing]
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME

00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:28.166
- [crying]

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.866
- NO BIGGER OR BETTER GIFT
YOU CAN GIVE A BROTHER.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.966
SO THANK YOU.

00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:45.866
[singing]
- A, B, C

00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:49.200
- YOU CAN COUNT ON ME

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.600
- PLEASE WELCOME
FORMER NFL PLAYERS,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.166
SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS,
MA'AKE AND CHRIS KEMOEATU.

00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:58.866
FIRST OF ALL, WHAT A BEAUTIFUL
AND TOUCHING STORY.

00:01:58.866 --> 00:02:00.166
YOU'RE MA'AKE, RIGHT?

00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:01.200
- YES.
- OKAY.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.000
AND, CHRIS, HOW ARE YOU FEELING,
FIRST OF ALL?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.766
- I'M FEELING GREAT.
- YEAH? YOU LOOK GREAT.

00:02:04.766 --> 00:02:06.200
- EVERY DAY.
- BOTH OF YOU LOOK GREAT.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.933
THIS IS AMAZING, THAT--

00:02:07.933 --> 00:02:10.133
HOW LONG AGO
DID THIS HAPPEN?

00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:11.133
- 3 1/2 WEEKS AGO.

00:02:11.133 --> 00:02:12.300
- YEAH, 3 1/2 WEEKS AGO.
- WOW.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.100
- BUT FIRST OF ALL,
THANK YOU FOR HAVING US.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.200
WE'RE SO GRATEFUL TO BE HERE.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.466
- WE LOVE YOU.
- YEAH.

00:02:18.466 --> 00:02:19.466
[cheers and applause]

00:02:19.466 --> 00:02:21.533
THANK YOU.
- HOW DO YOU FEEL?

00:02:21.533 --> 00:02:22.733
- WE ARE GREAT.

00:02:22.733 --> 00:02:24.733
WE ACTUALLY--
WHEN YOU GUYS CALLED, YOU KNOW,

00:02:24.733 --> 00:02:26.666
WE SAID YES BEFORE WE COULD
CHECK WITH OUR DOCTORS.

00:02:26.666 --> 00:02:28.100
WE COULDN'T EVEN TRAVEL.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.466
BUT WE WOULD, LIKE,
DO ANYTHING.

00:02:29.466 --> 00:02:31.566
WE'LL DRIVE HERE, WALK HERE,
RUN HERE.

00:02:31.566 --> 00:02:32.733
YOU KNOW, FIND A WAY DOWN HERE.

00:02:32.733 --> 00:02:33.900
- THANKS SO MUCH.
- THANK YOU.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.566
- WELL, I'M SO GLAD
THE DOCTOR SAID--

00:02:35.566 --> 00:02:37.466
I THINK THE DOCTOR DIDN'T
REALLY SAY IT WAS OKAY,

00:02:37.466 --> 00:02:39.033
BUT YOU TALKED THE DOCTOR
INTO IT, SO...

00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:40.033
[both chuckle]

00:02:40.033 --> 00:02:42.166
AND, OF COURSE, YOU COULD
TALK ANYBODY INTO ANYTHING.

00:02:42.166 --> 00:02:44.133
LOOK AT THE TWO OF YOU.

00:02:44.133 --> 00:02:45.566
WHAT HAS CHANGED ABOUT--

00:02:45.566 --> 00:02:47.933
OBVIOUSLY,
YOU BOTH PLAY FOOTBALL--

00:02:47.933 --> 00:02:49.766
WHICH IS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE,

00:02:49.766 --> 00:02:51.633
THAT YOU BOTH HAVE
SUPER BOWL RINGS.

00:02:51.633 --> 00:02:55.100
THAT'S CRAZY THAT TWO BROTHERS
HAVE SUPER BOWL RINGS, YOU KNOW?

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.100
[cheers and applause]

00:03:00.266 --> 00:03:02.533
AND NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE
WHO GET TO THAT POINT--

00:03:02.533 --> 00:03:05.333
NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE WOULD RISK--
JUST GIVING THAT UP,

00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:06.433
MAKE THAT CHOICE.

00:03:06.433 --> 00:03:09.000
SO AMAZING THAT YOU DID THAT.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.733
BUT WHAT HAS IT CHANGED
IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP?

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:14.700
- IT WAS THE FIRST TIME
FOR ME TO SAY, "I LOVE YOU"

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.700
TO MY BROTHER.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.300
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.200
AND, YOU KNOW, WE WERE RAISED
IN A REAL TOUGH-LOVE TYPE--

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.666
YOU KNOW,
IT'S KIND OF A TOUGH LOVE.

00:03:21.666 --> 00:03:23.666
WE DON'T REALLY SAY IT
TO EACH OTHER, 'CAUSE, LIKE,

00:03:23.666 --> 00:03:25.266
"OH, THAT'S HILARIOUS.
DON'T SAY THAT."

00:03:25.266 --> 00:03:26.800
BUT WHEN WE WERE IN THE HOSPITAL

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.633
AND I WAS WATCHING HIM
GO THROUGH EVERYTHING--

00:03:28.633 --> 00:03:29.900
GOT THE HOSES HANGING
OUT OF HIM

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.566
AND THE OXYGEN AND EVERYTHING--

00:03:31.566 --> 00:03:33.433
AND I DIDN'T KNOW
IF I WAS GONNA HAVE MY BROTHER

00:03:33.433 --> 00:03:35.100
THE NEXT DAY, YOU KNOW?

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.100
THEN I WANTED TO TELL HIM,
TO SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.066
CHRIS, I LOVE YOU."

00:03:39.066 --> 00:03:41.933
AND, YOU KNOW,
HE JUST LOOKED AT ME.

00:03:41.933 --> 00:03:45.800
HE JUST SMIRKED A LITTLE BIT
AND SAID, "YEAH," SO...

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.800
[laughter]

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.366
YOU KNOW,
HE HAD THE TUBES ON HIM,

00:03:48.366 --> 00:03:50.900
AND HE COULDN'T REALLY SAY MUCH,
SO...

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.866
- I WAS KIND OF NERVOUS.

00:03:52.866 --> 00:03:54.600
I'M JUST THANKFUL
HE WAS BRAVE ENOUGH

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.433
TO STEP UP
AND ACTUALLY SAY IT, YOU KNOW?

00:03:58.433 --> 00:04:00.466
- AND ONCE THE TUBES WERE GONE,

00:04:00.466 --> 00:04:02.033
WERE YOU ABLE TO SAY
"I LOVE YOU" TOO,

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:03.966
OR ARE YOU STILL JUST GOING,
"YEAH"?

00:04:03.966 --> 00:04:05.166
- [laughs]
- I SAID I LOVED HIM.

00:04:05.166 --> 00:04:07.100
- OH, GOOD, SO YOU'RE BOTH ABLE
TO SAY "I LOVE YOU."

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.866
VERY IMPORTANT TO SAY
"I LOVE YOU" TO PEOPLE,

00:04:08.866 --> 00:04:10.466
'CAUSE LIFE IS VERY PRECIOUS.

00:04:10.466 --> 00:04:13.233
WE'RE, YOU KNOW,
NOT GUARANTEED ANYTHING,

00:04:13.233 --> 00:04:14.566
AS YOU KNOW.

00:04:14.566 --> 00:04:17.566
AND DO YOU MISS
PLAYING FOOTBALL, EITHER OF YOU?

00:04:17.566 --> 00:04:20.333
- WELL, I THINK BECAUSE
WE'VE BEEN PLAYING FOOTBALL

00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:21.866
FOR SO LONG, YOU KNOW,
WE'VE MISSED OUT

00:04:21.866 --> 00:04:23.900
SPENDING TIME WITH FAMILY.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.833
YOU KNOW, FROM HIGH SCHOOL
TO NFL WE'VE PLAYED,

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:28.933
AND WE JUST WANT TO
GO BACK HOME AND BE WITH FAMILY.

00:04:28.933 --> 00:04:30.800
WE'VE--NOW, WE'VE--

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.533
THE STRUGGLES
THAT WE WENT THROUGH, AND--

00:04:32.533 --> 00:04:34.533
LIKE, WE NEED TO BE
AROUND FAMILY MORE OFTEN.

00:04:34.533 --> 00:04:36.733
ALL THE THANKSGIVINGS, YOU KNOW?
[cheers and applause]

00:04:36.733 --> 00:04:37.733
- I KNOW.

00:04:37.733 --> 00:04:39.733
WE ONLY SPEND CHRISTMAS
AND THANKSGIVING--

00:04:39.733 --> 00:04:40.966
I ALWAYS THINK ABOUT THAT.

00:04:40.966 --> 00:04:42.366
- YEAH, HALLOWEEN,
THANKSGIVING,

00:04:42.366 --> 00:04:44.100
YOU KNOW, HOLIDAYS, CHRISTMAS.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.700
WE JUST WANT TO GO HOME
AND BE WITH FAMILY.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.700
- YEAH, WELL, I'M SURE.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.700
NOW YOU GET TO DO THAT.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.200
SO YOU SAID IN THE TAPE--
IN THE PACKAGE--

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.200
THAT YOU WANTED AN XBOX.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.333
DID YOU GET YOUR XBOX?

00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:53.633
- I'M STILL WAITING
FOR THE XBOX.

00:04:53.633 --> 00:04:54.900
- I SEE.
- [laughs]

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.966
- WELL, WE--JUST IN CASE
HE DOESN'T GET AROUND TO IT,

00:04:56.966 --> 00:04:58.133
WE GOT YOU AN XBOX.

00:04:58.133 --> 00:05:00.100
- OH!

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.100
[cheers and applause]

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.900
- [grunts]

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.966
[cheers and applause]

00:05:09.966 --> 00:05:11.600
- THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.400
AND JUST IN CASE
YOU FORGET TO SAY "I LOVE YOU"--

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.966
WHICH YOU SHOULD SAY
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

00:05:17.966 --> 00:05:19.133
I WANT YOU ALL TO REMEMBER.

00:05:19.133 --> 00:05:21.266
IF YOU'RE NOT SAYING IT,
AT LEAST YOU SHOULD--

00:05:21.266 --> 00:05:24.266
[laughter]

00:05:24.266 --> 00:05:26.666
[cheers and applause]

00:05:26.666 --> 00:05:29.300
- OH, YEAH.
THANK YOU.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.266
[both laughing]

00:05:31.266 --> 00:05:34.700
- ALL RIGHT.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.033
[cheers and applause]
