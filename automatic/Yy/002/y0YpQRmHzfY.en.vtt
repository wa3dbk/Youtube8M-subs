00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.600 
the rationalizes somebody can spot a
sprinter<00:02:32.080> with<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.410> login<00:02:32.830> there<00:02:33.010> is<00:02:33.459> your

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
sprinter with the login there is your

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.220 
sprinter with the login there is your
legacy<00:02:34.000> that<00:02:34.270> we're<00:02:34.480> leaving<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:35.050> it's

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
legacy that we're leaving and it's

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.930 
legacy that we're leaving and it's
greater<00:02:35.530> than<00:02:35.650> night<00:02:36.010> cuz<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.520> truth<00:02:36.760> is<00:02:36.910> that

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
greater than night cuz the truth is that

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.809 
greater than night cuz the truth is that
we're<00:02:37.270> all<00:02:37.420> equal<00:02:37.540> an<00:02:37.930> answer<00:02:38.410> is<00:02:38.590> life

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:03:03.010 

see

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.240 

listen

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:19.180 

there's<00:03:07.489> always<00:03:07.700> room<00:03:07.970> for<00:03:08.000> change

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.250
