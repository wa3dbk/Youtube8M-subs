also<00:01:51.630> scared<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.290> lot<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.560> shots<00:01:52.770> because<00:01:53.009> the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
also scared a lot of shots because the

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.060 
also scared a lot of shots because the
power<00:01:53.850> seems<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.420> bit<00:01:54.509> with<00:01:54.720> as<00:01:54.899> well<00:01:55.079> like<00:01:55.920> you

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
power seems a bit with as well like you

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.660 
power seems a bit with as well like you
have<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:57.649> the<00:01:58.649> power<00:01:58.860> bar<00:01:59.070> seems<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.430> go<00:01:59.490> up<00:01:59.579> a

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
have to the power bar seems to go up a

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.480 
have to the power bar seems to go up a
lot<00:01:59.759> quicker<00:01:59.820> is<00:02:00.270> what<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.540> want<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.840> say<00:02:01.040> so<00:02:02.040> if

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
lot quicker is what I want to say so if

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.609 
lot quicker is what I want to say so if
you<00:02:02.850> go<00:02:03.060> slightly<00:02:03.450> too<00:02:03.719> powerful<00:02:04.170> it'll<00:02:04.469> go

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
you go slightly too powerful it'll go

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.319 
you go slightly too powerful it'll go
over<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.920> bar<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.250> mean<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.729> sounds<00:02:05.939> stupid

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
over the bar I mean that sounds stupid

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.690 
over the bar I mean that sounds stupid
to<00:02:06.540> say<00:02:06.750> like<00:02:06.990> like<00:02:07.350> like<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.429> wouldn't

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
to say like like like that wouldn't

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.660 
to say like like like that wouldn't
happen<00:02:08.879> but<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.450> does<00:02:09.959> it's<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:11.280> have<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.610> be

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
happen but it does it's you have to be

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.670 
happen but it does it's you have to be
so<00:02:11.849> exact<00:02:12.239> with<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.080> power

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
so exact with the power

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.890 
so exact with the power
worth<00:02:13.769> for<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.069> to<00:02:14.189> go<00:02:14.310> in<00:02:14.459> there<00:02:15.359> is<00:02:15.480> actually

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
worth for it to go in there is actually

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.509 
worth for it to go in there is actually
a<00:02:15.930> little<00:02:16.319> bit<00:02:16.560> annoying<00:02:16.769> so<00:02:17.069> I<00:02:17.099> don't<00:02:17.370> know<00:02:17.459> if

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
a little bit annoying so I don't know if

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:18.949 
a little bit annoying so I don't know if
they'll<00:02:17.700> carry<00:02:17.909> that<00:02:18.060> over<00:02:18.150> into<00:02:18.329> game<00:02:18.719> I'm

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
they'll carry that over into game I'm

they'll carry that over into game I'm
certainly<00:02:19.290> gonna<00:02:19.439> say<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.859> when<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.489> email<00:02:20.879> them

certainly gonna say it when I email them
at<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.239> end<00:02:21.329> of<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.599> to<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.019> know<00:02:22.140> what<00:02:22.469> tell

happy with the passing I'm yet to

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.479 
happy with the passing I'm yet to
concede<00:02:36.389> a<00:02:36.900> kickoff<00:02:37.739> glitch<00:02:38.010> so<00:02:38.219> maybe

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
concede a kickoff glitch so maybe

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:39.949 
concede a kickoff glitch so maybe
they've<00:02:38.760> side<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.299> out<00:02:39.359> maybe<00:02:39.540> they've<00:02:39.810> got

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
they've side that out maybe they've got

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.839 
they've side that out maybe they've got
rid<00:02:40.230> of<00:02:40.260> that<00:02:40.349> from<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.829> game<00:02:41.010> which<00:02:41.670> is<00:02:41.819> a

forms<00:02:42.209> up<00:02:42.299> in<00:02:42.420> my<00:02:42.569> book<00:02:42.810> because<00:02:42.989> every<00:02:43.560> knows

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
forms up in my book because every knows

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.960 
forms up in my book because every knows
how<00:02:44.010> annoying<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.939> kickoff<00:02:45.299> which<00:02:45.480> was

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
how annoying the kickoff which was

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.550 
how annoying the kickoff which was
defending<00:02:47.970> defending<00:02:48.450> seems<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:48.959> little<00:02:49.109> bit<00:02:49.260> a

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
defending defending seems a little bit a

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.640 
defending defending seems a little bit a
little<00:02:49.769> bit<00:02:50.040> harder<00:02:50.519> but<00:02:50.760> again<00:02:51.530> you<00:02:52.530> know

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
little bit harder but again you know

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.909 
little bit harder but again you know
still<00:02:52.980> usable<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:55.169> wall<00:02:55.319> had<00:02:55.500> ç<00:02:55.530> when<00:02:55.829> the

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:55.919 
still usable so the wall had ç when the

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:57.979 
still usable so the wall had ç when the
game<00:02:56.069> comes<00:02:56.189> out<00:02:56.370> again<00:02:56.669> what<00:02:57.239> that's<00:02:57.510> like<00:02:57.689> as

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
game comes out again what that's like as

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.050 
game comes out again what that's like as
we<00:02:58.139> actually<00:02:58.439> we<00:02:58.950> get<00:02:59.129> bail<00:02:59.370> in<00:02:59.549> a<00:02:59.639> pack<00:02:59.819> here

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
we actually we get bail in a pack here

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.420 
we actually we get bail in a pack here
which<00:03:00.269> is<00:03:01.049> quite<00:03:01.319> surprising<00:03:01.530> because<00:03:02.189> I

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
which is quite surprising because I

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.039 
which is quite surprising because I
didn't<00:03:02.909> expect<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.269> get<00:03:03.450> somebody<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:03.900> that

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
didn't expect to get somebody of that

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.409 
didn't expect to get somebody of that
caliber<00:03:04.530> so<00:03:04.889> I<00:03:04.919> was<00:03:05.189> like<00:03:05.310> yes<00:03:05.549> I've<00:03:05.819> got<00:03:06.150> bail

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:06.419 
caliber so I was like yes I've got bail

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:09.949 
caliber so I was like yes I've got bail
a<00:03:06.450> million<00:03:06.989> coins<00:03:07.230> yay<00:03:08.329> but<00:03:09.329> anyway<00:03:09.569> I<00:03:09.599> went<00:03:09.840> to

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
a million coins yay but anyway I went to

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.920 
a million coins yay but anyway I went to
do<00:03:10.109> list<00:03:10.859> market<00:03:11.370> compare<00:03:11.760> price<00:03:12.030> and<00:03:12.359> he

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
do list market compare price and he

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.599 
do list market compare price and he
actually<00:03:13.079> got<00:03:13.319> to<00:03:13.500> twelve<00:03:13.739> thousand<00:03:14.129> coins<00:03:14.280> so

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
actually got to twelve thousand coins so

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.490 
actually got to twelve thousand coins so
I<00:03:14.819> decided<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:15.569> keep<00:03:15.750> doing<00:03:16.019> my<00:03:16.139> appointment

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
I decided to keep doing my appointment

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.469 
I decided to keep doing my appointment

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
anyway because the the player ratings

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.259 
anyway because the the player ratings
are<00:03:44.639> actually<00:03:45.000> final<00:03:45.680> button<00:03:47.150> Noah<00:03:48.150> is

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
actually 90 rate which is justified I

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.309 
actually 90 rate which is justified I
suppose<00:03:51.419> because<00:03:51.629> he's<00:03:51.900> one<00:03:52.079> of<00:03:52.139> the<00:03:52.199> best

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
suppose because he's one of the best

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.809 
suppose because he's one of the best
keeps<00:03:52.590> in<00:03:52.769> the<00:03:52.829> world<00:03:53.009> but<00:03:53.250> that<00:03:53.310> blew<00:03:53.669> my<00:03:53.699> mind
