 hello very good everyone and here we go 37 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:11.890
 commenting on a good new video is like 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:16.270
 this video is going to be about how 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:17.539
 have the campaign pop up from 5 to 100% 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.570
 with 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.270
 and I think it's an editing car 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.490
 special 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.620
 money even weapons come 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.620
 with hay ammunition 1999 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.750
 good so that the campaign has not passed 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.320
 they do not finish completing and do not want 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.710
 simply form 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.190
 the 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.430
 they can do it how they have to do it 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.000
 well I will leave you a 22 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.000
 description 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.410
 the game blues and the departure bless 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.930
 good a rare file is downloaded 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.860
 Once downloaded it is decompressed 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.640
 decompress that says 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.310
 and that folder is going to understand 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.920
 then it gets on the ps3 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.370
 and a candle is created a tool of 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.370
 saved data 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.670
 run the shock I had in that what more 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.080
 I recommend and then paste the other 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.280
 use it government that was going to come out the 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.290
 option 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.440
 well you touch me at the beginning of the video 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.440
 comes out 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:27.689
 that young girl here I have 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.689
 this weapon indicated 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:38.240
 a giant was not very good all 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.240
 and well that was another 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.780
 without looking 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.580
 and 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.489
 the mind
