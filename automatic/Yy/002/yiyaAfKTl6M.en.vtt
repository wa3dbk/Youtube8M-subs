00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.139
 Hello everyone, lidar murtazin 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.450
 and in unusual incarnation today we speak 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:15.099
 about headphones when they turned to me 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:17.110
 guys from the moscow anders company me and 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.420
 offered to bring these headphones I even 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.010
 knew nothing about them but became their 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:26.039
 by fans in general, now you know 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:29.020
 why the french company and iodine 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.970
 made headphones made headphones 1 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.710
 the series is called here is directly written lunch 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.399
 edishan valkyrie 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.739
 wild van two years there is a roller in 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:41.140
 Internet from the company such a promotional video 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:45.219
 two years they created these headphones that 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.769
 I'm captivated in them here is this series she 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:50.409
 There are also carbon headphones available 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:52.449
 but they really are so big 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.399
 box they really come out 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.260
 in small quantities i.e. it is not 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:01.449
 such a full-scale industrial 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:05.100
 production of 400 pieces from June 2013 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:08.910
 years they are shipped well for those who 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:13.290
 wants to see what it is and now 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:17.250
 I show in principle to understand yes it is 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:21.280
 good expensive headphones 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:25.000
 it says what the message is 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:29.380
 for those who bought these headphones March 10 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.240
 March 10, 2013 Paris they are proud 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.870
 imagine blah blah blah and all that 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:38.470
 that is, this is the team that created 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:43.180
 These headphones are the first main box 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:45.520
 here is such a we will find a cable we 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.790
 find a description 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:52.990
 how to use everything done very 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:55.240
 right a and gave generally done that 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.040
 they created a story around these 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.300
 headphones and it seems to me a very story 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.400
 not bad because today 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.700
 here these headphones let them get 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:11.200
 but first see the card like this 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:13.230
 from aluminum and this is the number of these headphones 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.720
 wan you sit on 226 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.610
 so if we talk about headphones why 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.700
 aluminum used here on this thing 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:26.519
 because they also have headphones 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:28.830
 aluminum is leather 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:32.580
 Headphones are very, very not 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.989
 bad they bribe their own 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.760
 you know the qualities so stylishly 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.599
 minimalist and very very nice to me 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:47.129
 this is exactly what these headphones like 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:50.700
 if we talk about how they can 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:54.150
 use that there is another chip 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.160
 which I like very much usually 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.980
 frayed cables are very often 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.019
 happen here the cable is not only in 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.390
 sheathed metal she is inside but 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.180
 top still in the gum that is this cable 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.569
 more reliable than other options though 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.180
 On expensive headphones, usually to such 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.790
 little things 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:19.500
 attention is generally not very like 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:21.630
 right to say not very big here 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.319
 these headphones can be used in general 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:28.680
 use as you please and this is what 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.669
 you see in the box well, that is 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.889
 actually 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:34.230
 there are two wires here that have become good 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.959
 tradition one wire is a microphone 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.310
 the wire 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:42.630
 second wire just to 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:46.099
 listen to music what's the charm of these 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:50.099
 Headphones let's compare them with probably 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:52.590
 Monsters skims monsters skip more here 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:55.019
 there is noise cancellation in this model I have 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.190
 But the question is not even this soft for too 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.140
 nobody leather 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.920
 leather insert here this rate 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:05.040
 changing the question is not this they are grade 1 in 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:09.660
 Basically, but these ayahs have headphones 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.580
 valkyrie they are smaller and in general 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:15.829
 material really if here 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:18.930
 lining of aluminum metal and this 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:19.459
 everything is not metal plastic then 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.490
 here 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.500
 the whole metal is passive reinforcement 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.070
 bass 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:31.770
 if we talk about the reliability of the design 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.350
 it is completely safe that is not here 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.600
 no sound quality problems everybody 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:40.320
 evaluates on my own but I want to say 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.070
 that I like these headphones more than 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.960
 monsters ski 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.660
 oddly enough though masterfully very 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.729
 very good, these headphones are more pure 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.039
 sound will not go 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:52.680
 everyone has it all subjectively everyone 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:55.080
 its ear structure and stuff 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.330
 headphones are about 1 class with these 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.750
 In Europe, they are today if 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.820
 order from Europe their 350 euros if 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.430
 order out of europe then taxes 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:09.330
 taken away they will cost 270 euros without 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:12.210
 shipping accounting in general it turns out that 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:16.530
 they are in the same class as monsters 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:19.110
 even for the price and it seems to me these 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:22.229
 headphones they are real here are the french 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.010
 did a great job what they 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:25.560
 stylish 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:28.289
 They are a very good package. 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.830
 pleases and the main sound in general 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:33.990
 unexpectedly good i didn't expect from a newbie 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:39.750
 the fact that they will sound like this 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:42.389
 well with the fact that the cost is palpable 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.300
 generally not high for this class 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:46.460
 headphone 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:50.060
 I think this is a plus for them here 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:52.039
 Short impressions about pro and I gave more 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.020
 I donâ€™t know in detail what is being told 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:56.509
 tell tales about their impressions 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.080
 from music listening to them come 

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:01.039
 to the website 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:03.319
 it will be trio 226 or 227 I do not know 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:06.430
 still good luck good mood was with you 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:06.430
 liza rip taizen bye
