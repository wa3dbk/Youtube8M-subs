00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.249
 percent 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:10.779
 that 's how Dr 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:12.669
 Konwitschny lure 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:15.929
 So let's search for yourself 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.929
 Hessen is not so wrong 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.449
 No 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.499
 a striped top just times 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:34.590
 in the course of the developers also blue and nobody knows what you want to achieve you 

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:35.930
 the team 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.239
 Uwe 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.220
 I can not deliver it wear this 1 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.920
 blue jeans 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.240
 and this tends 1 2 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.580
 Let's talk too 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.060
 APA if you want you can also win with 2 0 and give our flights 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.060
 not to any law 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.140
 this mission I had never been afraid as in the East whole 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.820
 so that an influence does not seek a megatrend Schinzler son and on 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.020
 after the current 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.020
 I could do my part of the costs 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.770
 and then were missing 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.920
 he sees the recruitment street look and so on 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.440
 that a bit 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.030
 Miami is undressing so 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.340
 Langenalb staggered 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.360
 and the Peter Engesser respect the same too or so 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.360
 because just tingling influence 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.540
 now accept that or accept 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.700
 al-beltagi rule 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.270
 I just do not want to get in 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.640
 maybe it hangs like a factory bottle 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.640
 I write 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.320
 or decision maker is not quite finished maybe in the Big Kick to the Home 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.169
 in the 2nd 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.279
 but she also wins 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:24.849
 if she does that he will be the winner 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.849
 whence he comes the island 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.359
 we are looking for MSI Babbel 

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:37.239
 stormy before the second game 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.109
 really everything r 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.219
 as long as it is about a lot 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:45.489
 Only short that first comes to miss on a strike precision looks like 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:46.429
 has or something 

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:49.359
 then he could have been sitting a little lower down 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.869
 but this is now 

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:55.489
 pretty high up to be seen and where would I go now 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.489
 not to wear anymore because I believe that 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.379
 again worked a bit too much but it works out there 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.119
 would 

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:06.639
 AMEC has not really 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:09.159
 Colors paint this bit 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:12.499
 In court they go to brown Sonatine from a commission 

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:14.119
 pick up 

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:17.050
 but do not make a living that way because 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.039
 it is diving 

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:21.039
 can be pretty cool around 

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:26.369
 because it can be pretty cool 

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:29.449
 to take contrary colors or not to pick up the outfit 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:31.930
 APA 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.930
 I do not know file Merkel - on it 

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.679
 bypass
