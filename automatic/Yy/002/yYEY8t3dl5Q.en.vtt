00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:08.920
 Medellin in the black Castilian local 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.380
 arias is the defense of the neck enríquez 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.089
 and guillermo guillermo we know in 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.599
 argentina pardo hernandez skip and 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:15.599
 Perez 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.570
 we know here in Argentina one step 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.189
 for me 41 41 also 41 yes enchanted in 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.359
 envigado con soto 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:31.539
 Orozco every time speaks now with and 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:36.900
 stolen angle is shrill there is my 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.900
 friend morante slater carlos burbano 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.280
 I liked that they remembered 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.969
 rise up getting very well 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.219
 arias breaking down the sides see that 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.559
 they broke it again to the pan having 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.559
 the play and auction 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:07.950
 the wind in favor and when they start 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.649
 losing the matches and this time a 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.990
 little more lose the 50 sun ball 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:23.420
 this move the urban urban shot comes 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:23.420
 nobody can take it out without help 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:30.390
 and it passes in front of thinking a loss 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.149
 75 meters from the arch and at minute 2 the 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.860
 score a goal and from there also to 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:39.330
 paddling to try to get to the pattern 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.480
 and who was going to be able to endure the beating 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.680
 that we also think of cúcuta and finished 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.900
 winning 2 to 0 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.770
 today today is much more difficult 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:52.880
 but found the spaces but not 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.880
 finished defining 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.900
 the first clear goal I did not find if the 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.780
 local andrés for something the locale weighs 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.430
 just like when you make the first goal 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.000
 as a local forces the visitor to play 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.310
 otherwise 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.080
 Giovanni gave him space when he has 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.150
 space put the ball cute but so 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.660
 continued 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.660
 it was further back 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:28.140
 it seems to me that the referee hernandez 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.580
 he has a certain reason because he is stuck there 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.580
 a bear on the side 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:48.670
 that's what the ball throws a long time ago 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.189
 that the yellow card for the team 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.950
 with water in the neck attacking the 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:57.750
 mighty by god expelled they died of 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.090
 evidence scored goal and it goes like this 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.590
 in short you have a lot to learn 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.640
 trying to score the players 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.040
 young the things that have to 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.150
 learn the remarkable we see a great 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.150
 soccer player surely 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:20.820
 tranquility but also area of 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:23.150
 center into account everything that had 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.920
 medellin so that after the conclusion 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:29.510
 take out it is based on 90 minutes 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.510
 because we analyze results 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.570
 and that was close is another thing 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.000
 frank with playing with club law to 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.330
 go out with leader with the outgoing want 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.330
 return 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.980
 quiet is not that he does not understand but 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.440
 there is 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.640
 arias winning to the level fund pursues 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.400
 takes it out 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.550
 pulls in appears with many 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.550
 spaces 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.810
 working the thesis that you told me 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.610
 before with millionaires gets very good 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.310
 some defend so far back and do not win 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:14.360
 rebounds the doctor has his spaces by 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.250
 that is to defend yourself in the middle of the 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.459
 34 always tense look at each one there is 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.380
 look at the point element but in 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.630
 general is much better pressure 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.730
 advanced I looking for the ball with 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:31.919
 spaces because it always came out very 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:34.260
 back with panorama many asked there 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.840
 new from outside rebound or I asked you 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.760
 to hit him like inadvertently wanting 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.230
 I never understood the change because 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.570
 got rid of the injury due to 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.750
 Guillermo and then take out restrepo 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.220
 viáfara 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.950
 suddenly they change party via to 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.400
 frank auction and brown had one that I did not 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.050
 they put into the compact a very clear 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.040
 surely already by not going with the subject 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.380
 recurring poor 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.090
 but Medellin see everything he had had 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.310
 to see better yes yes it helped me a lot 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.440
 with still ball full movement 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.510
 by the sides filtering with giovanni 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.060
 Hernandez putting the ball and the 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.180
 force looking for me it has played or is 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.050
 had all the medellín because neither 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.330
 title you will be confused because 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.480
