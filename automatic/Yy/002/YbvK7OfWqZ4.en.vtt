00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:15.269
 i still cook like at omas times only 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:15.269
 just in something bigger 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.030
 In the middle, this is what this is like 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.940
 then stop with the vegetables boiled the 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.810
 are tubular bones are bones of the cattle 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.810
 from the upper shell 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.230
 what comes there all flew 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:58.909
 a little bit of smoke 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:02.359
 just enough for my rabbit 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:07.820
 I do not need much more 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:09.409
 he wants to be here already 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.759
 not even the same as everyone else 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.770
 search now as synonymous with the culture 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:16.509
 Great we have fresh carrots 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.509
 celery and goals 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.450
 originally this comes from turkey 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:28.640
 they eat a lot of good soup and then 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.429
 that's just about Europe 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.800
 but predominantly that will be in 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:36.250
 south germany in south european countries 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.250
 eaten 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.150
 I make about 200 kilos during the week 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.700
 So vegetables are now being cut 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:02:06.280
 by hand one day 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:06.700
 need so that's one now 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.710
 dome 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:14.520
 we are already precooked cut 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.520
 saves time saves money can start immediately 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.210
 daily is only if you have the im 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.130
 but it looks like it will stay that way 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.560
 not because as I said he will stop 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.660
 cooked cleaned is peeled and 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.030
 then he stands as without his golden yellow 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.160
 which was actually appetizing 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:55.650
 looks looks like saxony comparison 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:03:01.190
 always with tim fischer I think so 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.190
 would be about 45 against 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.819
 how meat sausage finished everything only 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:15.709
 fresh things beef bones vegetables 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.540
 tastes great with her, I have 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.470
 I think that's great from the cook 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.019
 will not be better 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.000
 he puts in the powder with what I do 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.660
 do not do it with me everything is very fresh 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.660
 cooked 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.569
 of course , no diet is super 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:56.260
 now my fat free what everyone needs 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:58.930
 not necessarily taste is just a stop 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.560
 You can not get any flavor from anything 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.560
 replace another 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:17.600
 that it just belongs to it 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.940
 It's an acid soup that gets it 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:24.610
 wanted to stop the taste of 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.610
 ball one more thing to take away 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.260
 really finished 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:57.890
 there is an assortment in the 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.120
 Romanian Transylvanian cuisine and 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.130
 meanwhile it has 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.070
 naturalized that easy to 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:07.120
 staple food already belongs 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.500
 everyone knows is widely used 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.620
 many do not like everyone but like that 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.620
 lots 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.010
 with this kind of cooking this 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.680
 high pressure cooking that is over 80 degrees 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.410
 we kill especially heat resistant km 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.480
 and this will be the things 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:41.110
 under exclusion for up to two years 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.110
 preserved
