guns<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.490> really<00:01:20.790> enjoy<00:01:20.820> using<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.510> iron

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
guns that I really enjoy using the iron

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.570 
guns that I really enjoy using the iron
sights<00:01:21.990> other<00:01:22.920> than<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.190> pretty<00:01:23.460> much

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
sights other than that I pretty much

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.550 
sights other than that I pretty much
just<00:01:23.670> slap<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> red<00:01:24.420> dot<00:01:24.600> scope<00:01:24.810> on<00:01:25.110> everything

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
just slap a red dot scope on everything

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.500 
just slap a red dot scope on everything
that<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.799> can't<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.610> know<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.970> don't<00:01:27.360> really

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
that I can't you know I don't really

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.910 
that I can't you know I don't really
like<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.870> iron<00:01:28.110> sights<00:01:28.320> as<00:01:28.470> much<00:01:28.650> because<00:01:28.799> it

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
like the iron sights as much because it

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.980 
like the iron sights as much because it
gives<00:01:29.010> you<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.159> lot<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.310> visibility<00:01:29.900> but<00:01:30.900> the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
gives you a lot of visibility but the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.020 
gives you a lot of visibility but the
ak-47<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:31.830> pretty<00:01:32.070> low<00:01:32.220> profile<00:01:32.700> as<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:32.940> can

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
ak-47 is pretty low profile as you can

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.120 
ak-47 is pretty low profile as you can
see<00:01:33.119> when<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.270> scope<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.750> there<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.799> gives<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.100> a

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
see when I scope in there it gives you a

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.640 
see when I scope in there it gives you a
lot<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.670> know<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.850> still<00:01:36.150> have<00:01:36.330> a<00:01:36.360> lot<00:01:36.570> of

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
predator missile so we're playing in

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.620 
predator missile so we're playing in
real<00:01:49.619> time<00:01:49.860> now<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.340> just<00:01:51.000> wanted<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.390> fast

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
real time now I just wanted to fast

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.760 
real time now I just wanted to fast
forward<00:01:51.869> through<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.140> beginning<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.650> get

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
forward through the beginning and get

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.429 
forward through the beginning and get
through<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.100> but<00:01:53.430> um<00:01:54.140> yeah<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.200> really

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
through that but um yeah I really

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.250 
through that but um yeah I really
enjoyed<00:01:55.650> using<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.130> ak-47<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.210> but<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.080> only

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
enjoyed using the ak-47 and but the only

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.050 
enjoyed using the ak-47 and but the only
time<00:01:58.439> we<00:01:58.530> really<00:01:58.560> use<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.220> on<00:01:59.400> a<00:01:59.430> mid-range

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
time we really use it is on a mid-range

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.690 
time we really use it is on a mid-range
maps<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.840> mid-range<00:02:01.740> maps<00:02:02.189> are<00:02:02.400> both<00:02:02.580> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
maps and mid-range maps are both the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.460 
maps and mid-range maps are both the
time<00:02:02.909> my<00:02:03.060> favorite<00:02:03.420> types<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.780> maps<00:02:03.930> sub<00:02:04.320> base

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
time my favorite types of maps sub base

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.640 
time my favorite types of maps sub base
is<00:02:04.680> one<00:02:04.830> of<00:02:04.860> my<00:02:05.009> favorites<00:02:05.840> and<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:07.110> like<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.530> use

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
is one of my favorites and I like to use

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.460 
is one of my favorites and I like to use
the<00:02:07.770> ak-47<00:02:08.549> on<00:02:08.640> these<00:02:08.759> types<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.149> maps<00:02:09.330> if<00:02:10.289> you

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
the ak-47 on these types of maps if you

the ak-47 on these types of maps if you
find<00:02:10.679> me<00:02:10.799> on<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.920> larger<00:02:11.310> map<00:02:11.489> like<00:02:11.730> afghan<00:02:12.209> i'll

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:12.389 
find me on a larger map like afghan i'll

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:14.209 
find me on a larger map like afghan i'll
be<00:02:12.510> using<00:02:12.659> something<00:02:12.959> like<00:02:13.049> the<00:02:13.260> vcr<00:02:13.799> which<00:02:14.099> i

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:14.219

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
last kill for that harrier when I just

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.080 
last kill for that harrier when I just
threw<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.090> syntax<00:02:21.660> got<00:02:21.960> a<00:02:21.990> hit<00:02:22.170> mark<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:22.620> then

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
threw a syntax got a hit mark and then

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.000 
threw a syntax got a hit mark and then
so<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.120> guy<00:02:24.390> got<00:02:24.660> it<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.050> see<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:25.710> really

enjoyed the ak-47 it's a really nice gun

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.140 
enjoyed the ak-47 it's a really nice gun
ultimately<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.310> would<00:02:29.730> say<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.030> best

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
ultimately I would say the best

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.850 
ultimately I would say the best
attachment<00:02:30.720> that<00:02:30.810> I<00:02:30.840> would<00:02:31.050> normally<00:02:31.170> use<00:02:31.380> is

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
attachment that I would normally use is

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.890 
attachment that I would normally use is
either<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.160> grenade<00:02:32.520> launcher<00:02:32.940> because<00:02:33.780> it

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
either the grenade launcher because it

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.170 
either the grenade launcher because it
does<00:02:34.080> pull<00:02:34.320> out<00:02:34.470> really<00:02:34.830> quickly<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.430> I

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
does pull out really quickly and I

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.970 
does pull out really quickly and I
reloads<00:02:36.660> very<00:02:36.900> quickly<00:02:37.170> with<00:02:37.440> sliding<00:02:37.680> hand

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
reloads very quickly with sliding hand

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.230 
reloads very quickly with sliding hand
and<00:02:38.190> slide<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.430> hand<00:02:38.490> grenade<00:02:38.730> launchers<00:02:39.210> a

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
and slide a hand grenade launchers a

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.080 
and slide a hand grenade launchers a
great<00:02:39.720> combination<00:02:40.520> see<00:02:41.520> I<00:02:41.640> really<00:02:41.880> enjoyed

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
great combination see I really enjoyed

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.420 
great combination see I really enjoyed
the<00:02:42.320> ak-47<00:02:43.320> but<00:02:43.500> I<00:02:43.530> wanted<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:43.920> also<00:02:44.100> talk

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
the ak-47 but I wanted to also talk

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.270 
the ak-47 but I wanted to also talk
about<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:45.060> ACR<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.230> scar<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:46.950> famas

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
about the ACR and the scar and the famas

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.320 
about the ACR and the scar and the famas
so<00:02:48.080> these<00:02:49.080> different<00:02:49.530> guns<00:02:50.030> like<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.150> mentioned

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
so these different guns like I mentioned

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.450 
so these different guns like I mentioned
the<00:02:51.510> ECR<00:02:51.930> I<00:02:52.170> pretty<00:02:52.320> much<00:02:52.440> use<00:02:52.530> this<00:02:52.860> on<00:02:53.070> maps

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
the ECR I pretty much use this on maps

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.280 
the ECR I pretty much use this on maps
that<00:02:53.700> are<00:02:53.760> pretty<00:02:54.180> open<00:02:54.630> like<00:02:54.930> for<00:02:55.260> example

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
that are pretty open like for example

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.560 
that are pretty open like for example
Afghan<00:02:56.160> if<00:02:56.310> I'm<00:02:56.430> not<00:02:56.580> sniping<00:02:57.060> i'm<00:02:57.180> using<00:02:57.480> the

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
Afghan if I'm not sniping i'm using the

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.410 
Afghan if I'm not sniping i'm using the
ACR<00:02:58.080> it<00:02:58.380> has<00:02:58.650> absolutely<00:02:59.000> pretty<00:03:00.000> much<00:03:00.120> no

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
ACR it has absolutely pretty much no

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.040 
ACR it has absolutely pretty much no
recoil<00:03:00.990> and<00:03:01.320> it's<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.770> really<00:03:02.190> great<00:03:02.820> gun<00:03:03.120> the

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
recoil and it's a really great gun the

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.480 
recoil and it's a really great gun the
iron<00:03:04.380> sights<00:03:04.590> are<00:03:04.740> too<00:03:04.890> bad<00:03:05.070> so<00:03:05.250> I<00:03:05.280> found

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
iron sights are too bad so I found

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.830 
iron sights are too bad so I found
myself<00:03:05.580> using<00:03:05.790> that<00:03:06.060> every<00:03:06.300> once<00:03:06.480> in<00:03:06.630> a<00:03:06.690> while

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
myself using that every once in a while

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.380 
myself using that every once in a while
you<00:03:07.680> know<00:03:07.800> on<00:03:07.980> short-range<00:03:08.370> maps<00:03:08.790> too<00:03:09.060> but

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
you know on short-range maps too but

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.300 
you know on short-range maps too but
mainly<00:03:09.870> pretty<00:03:10.620> much<00:03:10.710> all<00:03:10.890> time<00:03:11.130> on

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
mainly pretty much all time on

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.950 
mainly pretty much all time on
