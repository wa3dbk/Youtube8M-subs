Bluetooth and a 6 cell battery now it's
not<00:00:36.390> super<00:00:36.899> powerful<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.559> that's<00:00:37.680> why<00:00:37.860> I

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
not super powerful and that's why I

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.500 
not super powerful and that's why I
would<00:00:38.070> consider<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.610> more<00:00:38.850> like<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> netbook

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
but you're gonna be looking at a 6 cell

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.240 
but you're gonna be looking at a 6 cell
battery<00:00:42.030> with<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.840> relatively<00:00:43.469> low<00:00:44.010> power

holes that you can see some of the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.539 
holes that you can see some of the
components<00:01:16.650> inside<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:16.950> think<00:01:17.250> that's<00:01:17.430> our

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
and then your hard drive is in here so

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.929 
and then your hard drive is in here so
you've<00:01:22.380> got<00:01:22.560> an<00:01:22.680> easily<00:01:23.159> replaceable<00:01:23.520> hard

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
you've got an easily replaceable hard

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.210 
you've got an easily replaceable hard
drive<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.180> really<00:01:24.540> like<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.869> see<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.470> yeah

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
drive I really like to see that and yeah

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.160 
drive I really like to see that and yeah
actually<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.180> labeled<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.689> RAM<00:01:27.960> and

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
actually this is labeled to RAM and

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.600 
actually this is labeled to RAM and
network<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.799> looks<00:01:28.979> like<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.250> was<00:01:29.400> right

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
network so it looks like I was right

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.830 
network so it looks like I was right
about<00:01:29.640> what<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.030> was<00:01:30.210> able<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.479> see<00:01:30.689> through

there the battery slips in through the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.069 
there the battery slips in through the
back<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.030> something<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.509> sirs<00:01:33.689> been<00:01:33.869> doing

this<00:02:27.600> is<00:02:27.720> where<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:27.990> really<00:02:28.230> start<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.560> be

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
this is where you really start to be

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.400 
this is where you really start to be
able<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.610> tell<00:02:29.790> without<00:02:30.180> even<00:02:30.840> turning<00:02:31.050> it<00:02:31.260> on

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
able to tell without even turning it on

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.500 
able to tell without even turning it on
or<00:02:31.470> testing<00:02:32.130> anything<00:02:32.520> whether<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.210> notebook

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
or testing anything whether a notebook

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.960 
or testing anything whether a notebook
is<00:02:34.020> going<00:02:34.710> to<00:02:34.830> draw<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.070> lot<00:02:35.250> of<00:02:35.310> power<00:02:35.490> just<00:02:35.880> a

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
is going to draw a lot of power just a

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.400 
is going to draw a lot of power just a
little<00:02:36.180> bit<00:02:36.300> you<00:02:36.360> can<00:02:36.510> see<00:02:36.540> this<00:02:36.780> is<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.930> tiny

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
little bit you can see this is a tiny

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.310 
little bit you can see this is a tiny
tiny<00:02:38.100> AC<00:02:38.430> adapter<00:02:39.090> so<00:02:39.450> we<00:02:39.750> expect<00:02:40.080> this

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
tiny AC adapter so we expect this

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.170 
tiny AC adapter so we expect this
notebook<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.830> draw<00:02:41.010> very<00:02:41.370> little<00:02:41.700> power<00:02:41.850> it's

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
notebook to draw very little power it's

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.550 
notebook to draw very little power it's
not<00:02:42.360> much<00:02:42.510> bigger<00:02:42.690> than<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:43.020> ones<00:02:43.170> you'd<00:02:43.350> see

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
not much bigger than the ones you'd see

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:50.750 
not much bigger than the ones you'd see
on<00:02:43.740> a<00:02:43.890> typical<00:02:44.250> netbook<00:02:48.230> no<00:02:49.230> okay<00:02:50.130> then<00:02:50.580> we

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
on a typical netbook no okay then we

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.550 
on a typical netbook no okay then we
have<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.180> six<00:02:51.420> cell<00:02:51.600> battery<00:02:51.630> itself<00:02:52.320> so<00:02:52.470> why

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
have the six cell battery itself so why

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.080 
have the six cell battery itself so why
don't<00:02:52.710> we<00:02:52.740> clip<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.160> in<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.670> I'm<00:02:53.910> not

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
don't we clip that in and I'm not

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.400 
don't we clip that in and I'm not
actually<00:02:54.270> sure<00:02:54.510> if<00:02:54.720> this<00:02:54.960> thing<00:02:55.170> is<00:02:55.260> gonna

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
actually sure if this thing is gonna

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.890 
actually sure if this thing is gonna
boot<00:02:55.710> up<00:02:55.860> but<00:02:56.070> I<00:02:56.160> guess<00:02:56.220> it<00:02:56.670> might<00:02:57.030> so<00:02:57.600> we<00:02:57.720> could

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
boot up but I guess it might so we could

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.570 
boot up but I guess it might so we could
have<00:02:58.050> a<00:02:58.080> quick<00:02:58.410> look<00:02:58.590> at<00:02:58.800> boot<00:02:59.100> time<00:02:59.130> if

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
have a quick look at boot time if

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.510 
have a quick look at boot time if
nothing<00:03:00.120> else<00:03:00.420> on<00:03:00.870> this<00:03:01.050> quick<00:03:01.380> unboxing<00:03:01.620> I

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
nothing else on this quick unboxing I

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.250 
nothing else on this quick unboxing I
could<00:03:03.030> get<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.360> slide<00:03:03.570> in<00:03:03.720> there<00:03:03.900> there<00:03:04.050> we<00:03:04.140> go

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
could get to slide in there there we go

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.610 
could get to slide in there there we go
and<00:03:04.410> lock<00:03:04.590> that<00:03:04.740> into<00:03:04.950> place<00:03:05.250> and<00:03:06.200> here<00:03:07.200> we<00:03:07.410> go

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
and lock that into place and here we go

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.250 
and lock that into place and here we go
so<00:03:07.920> here<00:03:08.190> is<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.700> notebook<00:03:09.210> itself<00:03:09.810> let's

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
so here is the notebook itself let's

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.500 
so here is the notebook itself let's
make<00:03:10.470> some<00:03:10.710> room<00:03:11.010> on<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.220> table<00:03:11.520> so<00:03:12.120> it's<00:03:12.330> got

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
make some room on the table so it's got

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.900 
make some room on the table so it's got
a<00:03:12.540> chiclet<00:03:12.840> style<00:03:12.990> keyboard<00:03:13.500> which<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.400> lot<00:03:14.730> of

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910
