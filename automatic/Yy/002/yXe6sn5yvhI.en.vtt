00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.980 

I<00:01:19.190> think<00:01:19.790> when<00:01:19.940> if<00:01:20.150> you<00:01:20.270> reference<00:01:20.659> like<00:01:20.840> how

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
I think when if you reference like how

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.750 
I think when if you reference like how
it<00:01:21.110> was<00:01:21.229> in<00:01:21.409> the<00:01:21.500> 70s<00:01:21.680> and<00:01:22.100> 80s<00:01:22.159> and<00:01:22.490> especially

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
it was in the 70s and 80s and especially

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.460 
it was in the 70s and 80s and especially
like<00:01:23.060> when<00:01:23.150> hardcore<00:01:23.600> first<00:01:23.840> like<00:01:24.140> kind<00:01:24.380> of

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
like when hardcore first like kind of

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.310 
like when hardcore first like kind of
started<00:01:25.100> to<00:01:25.190> form<00:01:25.880> I<00:01:26.180> think<00:01:26.780> like<00:01:26.870> back<00:01:27.110> then

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
started to form I think like back then

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.900 
started to form I think like back then
you<00:01:27.500> could<00:01:27.650> there<00:01:27.890> was<00:01:27.979> an<00:01:28.100> air<00:01:28.370> of<00:01:28.400> activism

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
you could there was an air of activism

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.540 
you could there was an air of activism
and<00:01:29.210> like<00:01:29.720> a<00:01:29.900> different<00:01:30.320> like<00:01:30.500> a<00:01:30.770> different

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
and like a different like a different

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.650 
and like a different like a different
sort<00:01:32.240> of<00:01:32.300> like<00:01:32.450> platform<00:01:33.200> for<00:01:33.680> like<00:01:33.830> I<00:01:34.660> guess

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
sort of like platform for like I guess
