you get an 80 G power boost
so<00:06:20.919> 5<00:06:21.250> 70<00:06:21.759> plus<00:06:22.090> 80<00:06:22.419> equals<00:06:23.400> 650<00:06:24.400> now<00:06:24.819> put<00:06:25.509> this

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
so 5 70 plus 80 equals 650 now put this

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.659 
so 5 70 plus 80 equals 650 now put this
