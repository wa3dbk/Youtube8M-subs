racers work is they have a motor inside
them<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.810> then<00:01:25.590> rubber<00:01:26.130> tires<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.759> back

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
them and then rubber tires in the back

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.020 
them and then rubber tires in the back
and<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.600> helps<00:01:27.960> propel<00:01:28.439> them<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.430> forward
