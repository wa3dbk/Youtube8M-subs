00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.400
 Hello 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.680
 we like it or not, we have to start to mature 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.510
 It reaches a pinpoint where to start 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.440
 mature euphoria is fine but 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.170
 there comes a time when you know 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.940
 control it 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.270
 you're not going to say anything really you're not going to 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.270
 say nothing 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.710
 that if everything opine 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.770
 Last Saturday, Earth invited us to 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.290
 concert that justin timberlake gave in 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.300
 Paris were pretty good tickets 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.920
 and we were next to important people 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.530
 for earth they invited us because 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.970
 they considered that we were people 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.800
 responsible people who would know how to behave in 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.180
 the concert and they would give a good 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.180
 image to your company 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.720
 and I accepted and I accepted because I wanted 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.160
 that lara álvarez was a person who 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.160
 he knew how to behave in a tribune 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:05.080
 but it turns out that lara álvarez did not report 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:07.320
 what's wrong with the fucking head 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.320
 true 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.130
 lara álvarez was unable to behave 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.750
 in a normal way in no time 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.579
 of the concert and what surprised me most 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.469
 it was his attitude change when he justin 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:25.170
 timberlake sang his favorite song and 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:25.170
 what a surprise I do not dedicate 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.310
 I want to apologize to Earth so 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:41.640
 happened on Saturday I'm so sorry you 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:44.600
 do you want to say something lara álvarez 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.220
 my second last name is gonzález 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.860
 it seems fair to me that my parents 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:52.570
 distribute the fault equally 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.570
 álvarez gonzález 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.830
 right now you're going to give me a test 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.830
 mental age 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.180
 we feel 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.049
 ah
