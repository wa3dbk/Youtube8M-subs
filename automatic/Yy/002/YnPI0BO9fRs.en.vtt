those<00:01:45.299> trees<00:01:45.600> up<00:01:45.930> there<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.350> all<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.250> way<00:01:47.340> to

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
those trees up there and all the way to

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.630 
those trees up there and all the way to
the<00:01:47.579> reservoir<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.149> all<00:01:48.360> hers<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.259> she's<00:01:49.470> a

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
the reservoir is all hers and so she's a

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.160 
the reservoir is all hers and so she's a
means<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.759> space<00:01:50.970> for<00:01:51.090> like<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.509> couple<00:01:51.840> hundred

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
means of space for like a couple hundred

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.109 
means of space for like a couple hundred
bucks<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.380> month<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:53.189> anyway<00:01:53.430> we<00:01:53.549> got<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.790> solar

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
bucks a month so anyway we got the solar

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.690 
bucks a month so anyway we got the solar
panels<00:01:54.450> hooked<00:01:54.570> up<00:01:55.189> ran<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.340> conduit

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
panels hooked up ran the conduit

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.480 
panels hooked up ran the conduit
basically<00:01:58.539> I<00:01:58.570> just<00:01:58.780> used<00:01:59.020> a<00:01:59.170> I<00:01:59.619> used<00:01:59.979> a<00:02:00.100> really

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
basically I just used a I used a really

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.330 
basically I just used a I used a really
heavy<00:02:00.670> gauge<00:02:01.000> like<00:02:01.299> a<00:02:01.329> 12-gauge<00:02:03.930> electric<00:02:04.930> or

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
heavy gauge like a 12-gauge electric or

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.560 
heavy gauge like a 12-gauge electric or
what<00:02:06.340> am<00:02:06.429> I<00:02:06.490> thinking<00:02:06.520> of<00:02:06.789> extension<00:02:07.360> cord

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
what am I thinking of extension cord

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.389 
what am I thinking of extension cord
because<00:02:07.750> it<00:02:07.869> was<00:02:07.960> like<00:02:08.080> 44<00:02:08.530> bucks<00:02:08.709> for<00:02:08.979> 12<00:02:09.190> gate

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
because it was like 44 bucks for 12 gate

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.869 
because it was like 44 bucks for 12 gate
for<00:02:09.640> 50<00:02:09.910> feet<00:02:10.119> of<00:02:10.149> a<00:02:10.330> 12-gauge<00:02:11.050> extension<00:02:11.620> cord

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
for 50 feet of a 12-gauge extension cord

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.670 
for 50 feet of a 12-gauge extension cord
so<00:02:12.879> it<00:02:13.180> was<00:02:13.269> actually<00:02:13.569> more<00:02:14.110> expensive<00:02:14.230> than

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
so it was actually more expensive than

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.850 
so it was actually more expensive than
that<00:02:14.830> for<00:02:15.040> 12<00:02:15.280> gauge<00:02:15.550> wiring<00:02:16.300> wire<00:02:16.900> so<00:02:17.410> it's

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
that for 12 gauge wiring wire so it's

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.850 
that for 12 gauge wiring wire so it's
all<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.040> same<00:02:18.190> thing<00:02:18.430> basically<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:19.870> don't

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
all the same thing basically I don't

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.380 
all the same thing basically I don't
want<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.040> say<00:02:21.160> that<00:02:21.370> it's<00:02:21.550> not<00:02:21.610> exactly<00:02:22.180> all

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
want to say that it's not exactly all

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.870 
want to say that it's not exactly all
the<00:02:22.480> same<00:02:22.690> thing<00:02:22.900> but<00:02:23.590> close<00:02:24.430> enough<00:02:24.459> it's

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
the same thing but close enough it's

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.869 
the same thing but close enough it's
good<00:02:25.030> enough<00:02:25.180> for<00:02:25.239> my<00:02:25.480> purposes<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:26.560> anyway

get<00:02:32.799> to<00:02:32.950> it<00:02:33.069> I'm<00:02:33.130> going<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.280> need<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:34.080> use<00:02:35.080> a

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
get to it I'm going to need to use a

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.559 
get to it I'm going to need to use a
seal<00:02:35.709> like<00:02:36.250> basically<00:02:36.880> get<00:02:37.090> some<00:02:37.239> caulk

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
seal like basically get some caulk

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.479 
seal like basically get some caulk
around<00:02:37.599> there<00:02:38.079> so<00:02:38.380> that<00:02:38.410> water<00:02:38.950> doesn't<00:02:39.099> grow

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
around there so that water doesn't grow

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.460 
around there so that water doesn't grow
up<00:02:39.549> in<00:02:39.670> there<00:02:39.849> get<00:02:40.569> some<00:02:40.750> seal<00:02:40.959> around<00:02:41.110> here

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
up in there get some seal around here

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.069 
up in there get some seal around here
steel<00:02:42.010> around<00:02:42.250> here<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:42.579> then<00:02:42.750> kind<00:02:43.750> of<00:02:43.870> broke

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
steel around here and then kind of broke

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.630 
steel around here and then kind of broke
this<00:02:44.290> thing<00:02:44.560> here<00:02:44.829> because<00:02:45.069> I<00:02:45.160> was<00:02:45.280> drilling<00:02:45.519> a

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
this thing here because I was drilling a

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.270 
this thing here because I was drilling a
hole<00:02:45.670> from<00:02:46.420> here<00:02:46.720> to<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:46.989> inside<00:02:47.380> which<00:02:48.099> I'll

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
hole from here to the inside which I'll

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.400 
hole from here to the inside which I'll
show<00:02:48.459> you<00:02:48.489> in<00:02:48.579> just<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:48.849> second<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:49.299> then<00:02:49.420> keep

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
show you in just a second and then keep

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.530 
show you in just a second and then keep
this<00:02:50.620> in<00:02:50.799> mind<00:02:50.829> right<00:02:51.250> here<00:02:51.280> for<00:02:52.209> just<00:02:52.390> one

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
this in mind right here for just one

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.970 
this in mind right here for just one
second<00:02:52.920> ok<00:02:53.920> so<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.190> conduit<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:56.260> can<00:02:56.440> see<00:02:56.860> it

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
second ok so the conduit you can see it

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.030 
second ok so the conduit you can see it
right<00:02:57.160> there<00:02:57.510> comes<00:02:58.510> into<00:02:58.780> here<00:02:58.959> so<00:02:59.799> this<00:03:00.010> is

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
right there comes into here so this is

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.289 
right there comes into here so this is
the<00:03:00.280> cable<00:03:00.430> that's<00:03:00.730> coming<00:03:00.940> from<00:03:00.970> outside

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
the cable that's coming from outside

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:02.819 
the cable that's coming from outside
this<00:03:01.599> is<00:03:01.660> hooked<00:03:01.959> up<00:03:02.049> to<00:03:02.109> the<00:03:02.260> solar<00:03:02.470> panels

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
this is hooked up to the solar panels

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:07.379 
this is hooked up to the solar panels
and<00:03:03.209> runs<00:03:04.209> back<00:03:04.450> here<00:03:04.989> and<00:03:05.889> runs<00:03:06.700> from<00:03:06.970> there

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:07.389 
and runs back here and runs from there

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:11.039 
and runs back here and runs from there
to<00:03:08.639> here<00:03:09.639> so<00:03:10.060> this<00:03:10.209> is<00:03:10.269> my<00:03:10.359> charge<00:03:10.630> controller

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
to here so this is my charge controller

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.229 
to here so this is my charge controller
right<00:03:11.260> here<00:03:11.850> basically<00:03:12.850> this<00:03:12.970> charge

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
right here basically this charge

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.240 
right here basically this charge
controller<00:03:14.310> makes<00:03:15.310> it<00:03:15.549> so<00:03:15.880> get<00:03:16.269> your<00:03:16.450> light<00:03:17.250> it

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
controller makes it so get your light it

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.199 
controller makes it so get your light it
makes<00:03:18.430> it<00:03:18.549> so<00:03:18.730> that<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:21.400> that<00:03:21.430> your<00:03:21.760> batteries

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
makes it so that so that your batteries

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.539 
makes it so that so that your batteries
don't<00:03:22.359> overcharge<00:03:22.750> and<00:03:23.500> it<00:03:24.400> basically

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
don't overcharge and it basically

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.520 
don't overcharge and it basically
distributes<00:03:25.209> out<00:03:25.389> the<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:26.019> charge<00:03:26.260> that's

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
distributes out the the charge that's

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.720 
distributes out the the charge that's
coming<00:03:26.799> in<00:03:26.950> so<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.579> power<00:03:28.329> comes<00:03:28.690> in<00:03:29.730> the

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
coming in so the power comes in the

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.539 
coming in so the power comes in the
power<00:03:30.940> comes<00:03:31.269> in<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:31.889> if<00:03:32.889> the<00:03:33.160> batteries<00:03:33.519> are

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
power comes in and if the batteries are

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.970 
power comes in and if the batteries are
fully<00:03:33.850> charged<00:03:34.239> it<00:03:34.989> uses<00:03:35.350> the<00:03:35.380> power<00:03:35.620> directly

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
fully charged it uses the power directly

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.349 
fully charged it uses the power directly
from<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.489> solar<00:03:36.700> panels<00:03:37.090> goes<00:03:37.870> out<00:03:38.170> here<00:03:39.010> and

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
from the solar panels goes out here and

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.180 
from the solar panels goes out here and
this<00:03:40.359> wire<00:03:40.599> hooks<00:03:40.900> up<00:03:41.079> to<00:03:41.109> the<00:03:41.380> same<00:03:41.709> wire<00:03:41.950> or

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
this wire hooks up to the same wire or

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.420 
this wire hooks up to the same wire or
to<00:03:42.459> the<00:03:42.489> same<00:03:42.900> terminals<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:44.590> go<00:03:44.769> to<00:03:44.829> this<00:03:45.760> so

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
to the same terminals the go to this so

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.509 
to the same terminals the go to this so
so<00:03:48.430> basically<00:03:49.680> it<00:03:50.680> basically<00:03:50.980> makes<00:03:51.190> it<00:03:51.370> so

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
so basically it basically makes it so

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.580 
so basically it basically makes it so
that<00:03:51.670> it<00:03:52.239> uses<00:03:52.450> that<00:03:52.720> power<00:03:52.989> first<00:03:53.260> and<00:03:53.500> if

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
that it uses that power first and if

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.250 
that it uses that power first and if
that<00:03:53.889> power<00:03:54.160> is<00:03:54.280> not<00:03:54.459> going<00:03:54.700> out<00:03:55.000> as<00:03:55.239> much<00:03:56.079> as

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
that power is not going out as much as

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.349 
that power is not going out as much as
it's<00:03:56.380> coming<00:03:56.560> in<00:03:57.540> yeah<00:03:59.760> mirror<00:04:00.760> hold<00:04:01.150> on<00:04:01.239> was

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
it's coming in yeah mirror hold on was

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:04.680 
it's coming in yeah mirror hold on was
like<00:04:01.480> a<00:04:01.510> bed<00:04:02.040> so<00:04:03.040> then<00:04:03.250> yeah<00:04:04.030> they're<00:04:04.450> they're

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
like a bed so then yeah they're they're

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.720 
like a bed so then yeah they're they're
being<00:04:05.079> they're<00:04:05.650> being<00:04:06.159> charged<00:04:06.519> right<00:04:06.640> now

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
being they're being charged right now

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.550 
being they're being charged right now
because<00:04:07.120> all<00:04:07.239> I'm<00:04:07.420> all<00:04:07.689> I'm<00:04:07.750> using<00:04:08.049> the<00:04:08.290> spores

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
because all I'm all I'm using the spores

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.880 
because all I'm all I'm using the spores
that<00:04:08.680> is<00:04:09.040> the<00:04:09.250> EC<00:04:09.459> little<00:04:09.640> battery<00:04:09.879> packs

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
that is the EC little battery packs

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.680 
that is the EC little battery packs
get<00:04:11.160> those<00:04:11.250> charged<00:04:11.550> up<00:04:12.950> so<00:04:13.950> when<00:04:14.190> I<00:04:14.450> want<00:04:15.450> to

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
get those charged up so when I want to

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.080 
get those charged up so when I want to
plug<00:04:16.019> this<00:04:16.170> whole<00:04:16.380> house<00:04:16.590> in<00:04:16.890> to<00:04:17.790> the<00:04:17.910> power

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
plug this whole house in to the power

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.509 
plug this whole house in to the power
source<00:04:18.390> I'm<00:04:19.170> going<00:04:19.320> to<00:04:19.380> use<00:04:19.500> this<00:04:19.769> cable<00:04:20.040> right

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
source I'm going to use this cable right

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.570 
source I'm going to use this cable right
here<00:04:20.720> this<00:04:21.720> goes<00:04:21.959> in<00:04:21.989> here<00:04:22.470> and<00:04:22.620> then<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.400> one

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
here this goes in here and then the one

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.450 
here this goes in here and then the one
that<00:04:23.730> I<00:04:23.760> said<00:04:23.970> to<00:04:24.090> remember<00:04:24.420> outside<00:04:25.460> that's

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
that I said to remember outside that's

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.980 
that I said to remember outside that's
where<00:04:26.670> that<00:04:26.790> goes<00:04:27.000> right<00:04:27.240> there<00:04:28.610> so<00:04:29.610> and<00:04:30.060> it

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
where that goes right there so and it

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.050 
where that goes right there so and it
plugs<00:04:31.200> into<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:31.830> whole<00:04:32.370> power<00:04:32.580> source<00:04:32.880> and

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
plugs into the whole power source and

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.850 
plugs into the whole power source and
then<00:04:33.360> I<00:04:33.390> can<00:04:33.570> turn<00:04:33.660> the<00:04:33.810> lights<00:04:33.960> on<00:04:34.169> and<00:04:34.230> turn

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
then I can turn the lights on and turn

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.860 
then I can turn the lights on and turn
the<00:04:35.040> all<00:04:35.730> that<00:04:35.970> stuff<00:04:36.210> we<00:04:36.330> actually<00:04:36.630> try<00:04:36.810> it

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
the all that stuff we actually try it

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.270 
the all that stuff we actually try it
out<00:04:36.990> the<00:04:37.169> in-ceiling<00:04:37.500> speakers<00:04:38.010> and<00:04:38.220> they
