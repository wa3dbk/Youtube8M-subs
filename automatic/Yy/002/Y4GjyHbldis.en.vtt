00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
momentum I really don't think it's gonna

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.400 
momentum I really don't think it's gonna
take<00:01:53.080> away<00:01:53.320> from<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.590> exercise<00:01:54.070> too<00:01:54.310> much<00:01:54.520> and

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
take away from the exercise too much and

take away from the exercise too much and
as<00:01:56.410> I<00:01:56.620> said<00:01:56.830> before<00:01:56.980> Tara<00:01:57.550> is<00:01:57.820> still<00:01:58.120> working

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
as I said before Tara is still working

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.740 
as I said before Tara is still working

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.540 
on her form obviously still a beginner
but<00:02:01.750> hey<00:02:01.930> at<00:02:02.200> least<00:02:02.260> she's<00:02:02.590> in<00:02:02.800> the<00:02:02.950> gym<00:02:02.980> doing

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
work I mean nothing else you can really

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.670 
work I mean nothing else you can really
ask<00:02:05.980> for

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
ask for

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.990 
ask for
from<00:02:08.680> there<00:02:08.860> we<00:02:09.039> went<00:02:09.250> to<00:02:09.399> some<00:02:09.580> seeded

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
from there we went to some seeded

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.080 
from there we went to some seeded
lateral<00:02:10.390> raises<00:02:11.460> honestly<00:02:12.460> I<00:02:12.490> haven't<00:02:12.820> used

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
lateral raises honestly I haven't used

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.940 
lateral raises honestly I haven't used
this<00:02:13.180> machine<00:02:13.390> in<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.810> very<00:02:14.080> long<00:02:14.320> time<00:02:14.350> I

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
this machine in a very long time I

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.390 
this machine in a very long time I
usually<00:02:15.670> do<00:02:15.970> this<00:02:16.090> exercise<00:02:16.600> with<00:02:16.810> dumbbells

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
usually do this exercise with dumbbells

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.240 
usually do this exercise with dumbbells
but<00:02:18.400> I<00:02:18.430> really<00:02:18.910> do<00:02:19.060> like<00:02:19.240> this<00:02:19.450> machine<00:02:19.860> so<00:02:20.860> I

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
but I really do like this machine so I

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.100 
but I really do like this machine so I
figured<00:02:21.970> hey<00:02:22.180> why<00:02:22.330> not<00:02:22.360> mix<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:22.900> up<00:02:22.990> a<00:02:23.080> little

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
figured hey why not mix it up a little

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.420 
figured hey why not mix it up a little
bit<00:02:24.480> all<00:02:25.480> together<00:02:26.080> I<00:02:26.170> believe<00:02:26.320> we<00:02:26.830> did<00:02:27.010> three

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
bit all together I believe we did three

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.900 
bit all together I believe we did three
sets<00:02:27.760> of<00:02:28.470> ten<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:29.680> fifteen<00:02:30.220> reps<00:02:31.710> and<00:02:32.910> Terra

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
sets of ten to fifteen reps and Terra

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.650 
sets of ten to fifteen reps and Terra
showing<00:02:34.240> no<00:02:34.630> signs<00:02:35.020> of<00:02:35.230> struggle<00:02:35.500> with<00:02:35.920> this

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
showing no signs of struggle with this

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.000 
showing no signs of struggle with this
almost<00:02:37.660> makes<00:02:37.930> it<00:02:38.170> seem<00:02:38.320> like<00:02:38.530> she<00:02:38.680> didn't<00:02:38.890> go

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
almost makes it seem like she didn't go

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.800 
almost makes it seem like she didn't go
heavy<00:02:39.340> enough<00:02:39.630> COFF<00:02:40.630> COFF<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:43.480> next

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
heavy enough COFF COFF and the next

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.170 
heavy enough COFF COFF and the next
thing<00:02:43.930> we<00:02:44.050> did<00:02:44.230> was<00:02:44.430> shoulder<00:02:45.430> burn<00:02:45.640> outs<00:02:45.880> on

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
thing we did was shoulder burn outs on

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.380 
thing we did was shoulder burn outs on
the<00:02:46.239> calf<00:02:46.900> press<00:02:47.640> now<00:02:48.640> I<00:02:48.670> used<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.090> do<00:02:49.209> this

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
the calf press now I used to do this

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.990 
the calf press now I used to do this
exercise<00:02:49.959> all<00:02:50.200> of<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.680> time<00:02:50.890> it's<00:02:51.280> a<00:02:51.520> great

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
exercise all of the time it's a great

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.610 
exercise all of the time it's a great
way<00:02:52.300> to<00:02:52.330> burn<00:02:52.630> out<00:02:52.810> your<00:02:52.989> shoulders<00:02:53.410> at<00:02:53.590> the

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
way to burn out your shoulders at the

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.310 
way to burn out your shoulders at the
end<00:02:53.830> of<00:02:53.890> a<00:02:53.950> workout<00:02:54.310> and<00:02:54.900> overall<00:02:55.900> you<00:02:56.110> just

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
end of a workout and overall you just

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.140 
end of a workout and overall you just
feel<00:02:56.500> a<00:02:56.530> massive<00:02:57.130> pump<00:02:57.430> in<00:02:57.580> your<00:02:57.730> shoulders

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
feel a massive pump in your shoulders

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
feel a massive pump in your shoulders
and<00:02:58.480> your<00:02:58.630> traps<00:02:58.989> after<00:02:59.290> doing<00:02:59.739> this<00:03:01.020> this<00:03:02.020> is

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
and your traps after doing this this is

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.990 
and your traps after doing this this is
actually<00:03:02.530> one<00:03:02.680> of<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:02.830> exercises<00:03:03.489> that<00:03:03.520> Terra

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
actually one of the exercises that Terra

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.110 
actually one of the exercises that Terra
does<00:03:04.270> not<00:03:04.630> like<00:03:05.050> I'm<00:03:05.739> pretty<00:03:06.730> sure<00:03:06.970> it's

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
does not like I'm pretty sure it's

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.820 
does not like I'm pretty sure it's
because<00:03:07.180> of<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.600> reason<00:03:07.930> that<00:03:07.959> she's

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
because of the reason that she's

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.650 
because of the reason that she's
freaking<00:03:09.220> gassed<00:03:09.489> at<00:03:09.880> the<00:03:10.000> end<00:03:10.150> of<00:03:10.270> it<00:03:10.390> every

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
freaking gassed at the end of it every

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.720 
freaking gassed at the end of it every
single<00:03:10.870> time<00:03:11.230> I<00:03:11.530> mean<00:03:12.160> if<00:03:12.250> you<00:03:12.370> can't<00:03:12.580> already

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
single time I mean if you can't already

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.930 
single time I mean if you can't already
tell<00:03:12.850> she's<00:03:13.390> already<00:03:13.750> dead<00:03:14.049> tired<00:03:14.350> but<00:03:14.790> it's<00:03:15.790> a

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
tell she's already dead tired but it's a

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.259 
tell she's already dead tired but it's a
great<00:03:16.299> way<00:03:16.690> to<00:03:16.720> burn<00:03:16.959> out<00:03:17.140> your<00:03:17.320> shoulders<00:03:18.269> we

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
great way to burn out your shoulders we

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.310 
great way to burn out your shoulders we
then<00:03:19.510> did<00:03:19.780> four<00:03:20.320> sets<00:03:20.680> of<00:03:20.920> dumbbell<00:03:21.489> shrugs

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
then did four sets of dumbbell shrugs

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.940 
then did four sets of dumbbell shrugs
aiming<00:03:23.320> anywhere<00:03:23.860> from<00:03:23.980> 10<00:03:24.250> to<00:03:24.280> 15<00:03:24.730> reps

aiming anywhere from 10 to 15 reps

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.470 
aiming anywhere from 10 to 15 reps
really<00:03:26.950> concentrating<00:03:27.670> on<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:27.880> contraction

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
really concentrating on the contraction

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.070 
really concentrating on the contraction
of<00:03:28.660> those<00:03:28.840> traps<00:03:30.420> then<00:03:31.420> we<00:03:31.570> have<00:03:31.720> Terra

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
of those traps then we have Terra

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.190 
of those traps then we have Terra
shrugging<00:03:32.500> it<00:03:32.680> off<00:03:33.570> trying<00:03:34.570> to<00:03:34.630> pinch<00:03:34.989> her

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
shrugging it off trying to pinch her

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.580 
shrugging it off trying to pinch her
ears<00:03:35.530> with<00:03:35.739> her<00:03:35.890> shoulders<00:03:37.380> she<00:03:38.380> does<00:03:38.560> a

ears with her shoulders she does a

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.990 
ears with her shoulders she does a
really<00:03:38.799> good<00:03:38.980> job<00:03:39.040> of<00:03:39.220> getting<00:03:39.400> her<00:03:39.670> shoulders

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
really good job of getting her shoulders

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.199 
really good job of getting her shoulders
up<00:03:40.180> they're<00:03:40.360> really<00:03:40.840> hot<00:03:41.459> we<00:03:42.459> then<00:03:42.820> went<00:03:43.120> ahead

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
up they're really hot we then went ahead

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.220 
up they're really hot we then went ahead
and<00:03:43.510> did<00:03:43.600> some<00:03:43.900> plate<00:03:44.170> raises<00:03:45.390> no<00:03:46.390> I<00:03:46.420> honestly

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
and did some plate raises no I honestly

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.190 
and did some plate raises no I honestly
usually<00:03:47.680> do<00:03:47.920> like<00:03:48.850> 20<00:03:49.060> to<00:03:49.360> 30<00:03:49.630> reps<00:03:49.930> with<00:03:50.170> the

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
usually do like 20 to 30 reps with the

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.360 
usually do like 20 to 30 reps with the
45<00:03:50.709> pound<00:03:51.040> plate<00:03:51.510> but<00:03:52.510> 15<00:03:53.290> seems<00:03:53.680> suitable<00:03:54.160> for

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
45 pound plate but 15 seems suitable for

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.210 
45 pound plate but 15 seems suitable for
today<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:55.930> get<00:03:56.019> some<00:03:56.230> trap<00:03:56.470> action<00:03:56.890> up<00:03:57.010> there

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
today to get some trap action up there

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.509 
today to get some trap action up there
and<00:03:57.720> I<00:03:58.720> believe<00:03:58.780> Terra<00:03:59.350> used<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.739> 25<00:04:00.190> pound

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
and I believe Terra used the 25 pound

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.350 
and I believe Terra used the 25 pound
plate<00:04:00.820> I'll<00:04:01.239> see<00:04:01.780> her<00:04:01.870> in<00:04:01.900> a<00:04:02.019> second<00:04:02.380> but<00:04:03.360> still

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
plate I'll see her in a second but still

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.180 
plate I'll see her in a second but still
aiming<00:04:04.660> for<00:04:05.250> 15<00:04:06.250> reps<00:04:07.620> three<00:04:08.620> sets<00:04:08.650> of<00:04:09.010> this

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
aiming for 15 reps three sets of this

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.420 
aiming for 15 reps three sets of this
and<00:04:09.630> we<00:04:10.630> have<00:04:10.780> one<00:04:11.019> more<00:04:11.170> exercise<00:04:11.410> after<00:04:12.220> this

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
and we have one more exercise after this

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.199 
and we have one more exercise after this
and<00:04:12.850> it<00:04:13.269> is<00:04:13.450> a<00:04:13.480> row<00:04:13.980> where<00:04:14.980> we<00:04:15.250> concentrate<00:04:16.060> on

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
and it is a row where we concentrate on

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.420 
and it is a row where we concentrate on
getting<00:04:16.510> our<00:04:16.599> rear<00:04:16.870> doubts<00:04:17.140> as<00:04:17.470> well<00:04:17.859> as<00:04:18.160> the

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
getting our rear doubts as well as the

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.930 
getting our rear doubts as well as the
tops<00:04:18.669> of<00:04:18.880> our<00:04:19.000> traps

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
tops of our traps

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.630 
tops of our traps
and<00:04:21.060> honestly<00:04:21.630> we<00:04:21.989> did<00:04:22.170> not<00:04:22.320> do<00:04:22.710> a<00:04:22.740> lot<00:04:23.070> of<00:04:23.100> rear

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
and honestly we did not do a lot of rear

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.570 
and honestly we did not do a lot of rear
delt<00:04:23.940> movements<00:04:24.480> today<00:04:24.660> so<00:04:25.100> it<00:04:26.100> was<00:04:26.280> good<00:04:26.430> we

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
delt movements today so it was good we

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.280 
delt movements today so it was good we
got<00:04:26.700> this<00:04:26.910> in<00:04:27.060> at<00:04:27.210> the<00:04:27.300> end<00:04:27.450> I<00:04:27.600> guess<00:04:28.490> and<00:04:30.290> the

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
got this in at the end I guess and the

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.290 
got this in at the end I guess and the
most<00:04:31.500> important<00:04:32.010> aspect<00:04:32.490> of<00:04:32.610> this<00:04:32.760> exercise

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
most important aspect of this exercise

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.600 
most important aspect of this exercise
in<00:04:33.690> my<00:04:33.810> opinion<00:04:34.260> is<00:04:34.440> just<00:04:35.160> keeping<00:04:35.460> your

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
in my opinion is just keeping your

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.910 
in my opinion is just keeping your
elbows<00:04:35.940> high<00:04:36.180> and<00:04:36.450> really<00:04:37.200> squeezing<00:04:37.830> the

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
elbows high and really squeezing the

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.420 
elbows high and really squeezing the
traps<00:04:39.320> tara<00:04:40.320> does<00:04:40.530> a<00:04:40.560> much<00:04:40.830> better<00:04:40.860> job<00:04:41.190> of

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
traps tara does a much better job of

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.180 
traps tara does a much better job of
keeping<00:04:41.760> her<00:04:42.030> elbows<00:04:42.210> high<00:04:42.660> and<00:04:43.190> really

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
keeping her elbows high and really

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.740 
keeping her elbows high and really
getting<00:04:44.370> the<00:04:44.490> rear<00:04:44.640> delts<00:04:45.030> into<00:04:45.270> the<00:04:45.360> movement

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
getting the rear delts into the movement

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.780 
getting the rear delts into the movement
as<00:04:45.920> opposed<00:04:46.920> to<00:04:47.070> hitting<00:04:47.400> the<00:04:47.490> lat<00:04:47.670> muscles<00:04:47.700> so

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
as opposed to hitting the lat muscles so

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.880 
as opposed to hitting the lat muscles so
but<00:04:50.790> that<00:04:51.030> just<00:04:51.480> about<00:04:51.810> sums<00:04:52.170> it<00:04:52.440> up<00:04:52.530> you<00:04:52.710> guys

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890
