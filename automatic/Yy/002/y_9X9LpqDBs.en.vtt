00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.070 
first one he did over me and asked him
to<00:02:51.040> do<00:02:51.160> another<00:02:51.430> he<00:02:52.240> didn't<00:02:52.540> think<00:02:52.720> it<00:02:52.870> looked

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
to do another he didn't think it looked

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.600 
to do another he didn't think it looked
like<00:02:53.320> me<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:55.810> as<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:56.830> turned<00:02:57.040> out<00:02:57.220> it<00:02:57.430> looked

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
like me and as it turned out it looked

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.520 
like me and as it turned out it looked
like<00:02:57.760> me<00:02:57.940> as<00:02:58.060> an<00:02:58.210> older<00:02:58.510> person<00:02:58.960> and<00:02:59.080> he<00:02:59.230> wanted

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
like me as an older person and he wanted

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.290 
like me as an older person and he wanted
a<00:02:59.680> true<00:03:00.100> likeness<00:03:00.400> of<00:03:00.820> me

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
a true likeness of me

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.180 
a true likeness of me
so<00:03:03.840> schwitters<00:03:04.840> did<00:03:05.110> another<00:03:05.410> one<00:03:05.680> which<00:03:05.950> was

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
so schwitters did another one which was

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.820 
so schwitters did another one which was
the<00:03:06.340> sweet<00:03:06.550> little<00:03:06.730> girl<00:03:07.290> small<00:03:08.290> dress<00:03:08.620> or
