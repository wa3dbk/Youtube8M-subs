00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 and I'm going to show you how the 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.770
 symptoms the first step that you have to 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.710
 keep good as you decide if 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.130
 they want to open the first the simpsons 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.750
 springfield or game player 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.230
 so what I'm going to do is 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.990
 first the simpsons 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.410
 we hope it charges and you go to 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.900
 power 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.900
 green that this really is effective 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.680
 well I already have it in 38 and my 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.489
 city, it was already quite 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.489
 developed 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.480
 once following any of the 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:50.310
 two programs first to open it then 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.750
 it is otherwise easier 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.610
 Well you can see here that I 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.860
 I have a lot of money but I lost the donuts 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.860
 because I lost the donuts because I was 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.970
 reset the ipad 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:07.430
 then the game player was closed and 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.700
 consequence also closed the 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:14.150
 simpson and the zones were lost but the 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.420
 development and everything is as before 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:21.310
 Well right now I'm already in 38 and I 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.560
 it is more difficult to reach 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.110
 at a higher level already when one happens 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.350
 in 38 everything what when it happens to another 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.300
 level when it reaches another level it will already be 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.460
 plus 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.210
 easy to make donuts because they have you 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.510
 give three of a salary 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.300
 good in this case we are going to 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.690
 let's select this we're going to 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.660
 sell because the most expensive thing is going to 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.320
 buy this is in decorations is a 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.970
 Diamond 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.060
 that gives you enough points of 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.590
 experiences then makes it rise 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.560
 of fairly fast level 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.440
 now let's see 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.569
 in this door 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.569
 [Music] 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.140
 good here is 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.160
 here it costs 5 million what 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:16.970
 we build 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.280
 and we charge the experience points 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.180
 then as you see 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.370
 and reach the bonus during here 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.630
 you can win any if there is only 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.569
 one can you can go back to 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.670
 try it to find one of three 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:34.940
 I found the three then 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.700
 three donuts I automatically have 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:42.020
 four because he had one and if we follow the 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:47.540
 procedure then we go to someone 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:51.319
 player like I have four donuts then 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:54.550
 let's select the game here 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.230
 and let's put the value 4 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.030
 is the one that in this case we would be 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.650
 looking for it I will not find it because it is 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.750
 too much results then you have to 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.960
 be more specific why we're going to do 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.530
 a change we are going to buy an accessory 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.330
 that cost a dona or two in this case 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.730
 can buy one of two but we're going 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.640
 to do as one of three forgiveness with a 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.400
 of one and then let's see the 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.280
 difference here we are going to buy a 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.069
 fence truth that is the one that costs a 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.939
 Mrs 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:30.620
 that the bay exists we built it 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:33.920
 we come back to the game someone player 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.960
 and here we write the value 3 then 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.540
 what is going 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.480
 We will find several types of 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:45.120
 several values â€‹â€‹is very difficult 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.129
 locate it identify it but 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.770
 already with the next purchase then we are going to 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:54.960
 find the one that we are looking for 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.730
 we are going to buy again from a 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.450
 then already automatically we 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.450
 there would be 2 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.510
 a dessert heart a fence of a dollar 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:12.840
 we are going to install then we already have two 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:17.840
 zones we go to game player 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.840
 and we are going to look for the value that has 2 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.889
 let's find here the 2nd here is 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.889
 the 2's 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.650
 we will wait to pass the seven 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:32.689
 seconds that the example demands there the 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.909
 program and let's write the values 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:37.909
 such amounts as you want 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:41.150
 and we are going to give him modified in what 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:43.729
 modify let's give it more because 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.370
 there is probably another who has the 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:49.909
 same value that we would also have to 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:54.289
 modify the good in this case it seems 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:55.910
 it is not then we are going to go for the 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:59.050
 game 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.050
 and let's see 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.090
 the changes 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:13.689
 If we were successful then the donuts are going to 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:15.849
 be there 

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:18.780
 good as you can see the donut 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:21.580
 they are there you can 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:25.220
 and accelerate the processes 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:28.120
 in this case, I already had several 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.120
 finished 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:37.860
 Like these areas are used to stop 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.680
 play the also use them on the cross and 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.620
 you throw good here can see how to do 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.880
 the mission a mission 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.070
 We send them to do 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.860
 and we can make it gas and donuts 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.349
 look automatically under 2 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.539
 until they close the game player and do not 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:59.349
 they close in the game or in a way 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:06:01.900
 in which we do it to him then then no 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:03.820
 there will be problem 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:08.500
 this is all friends I hope there is 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:11.500
