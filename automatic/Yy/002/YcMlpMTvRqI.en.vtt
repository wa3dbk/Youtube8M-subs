00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
must ask why do you want to tell it is

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.150

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.400 
it to cultivate the weeds get rid of
them<00:00:14.400> then<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:15.509> need<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.780> be<00:00:15.900> careful<00:00:16.379> that

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
them then you need to be careful that

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.609 
them then you need to be careful that
you<00:00:17.369> don't<00:00:18.210> break<00:00:18.480> off<00:00:18.750> roots<00:00:19.080> because<00:00:19.500> the

you don't break off roots because the

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.590 
you don't break off roots because the
roots<00:00:19.859> will<00:00:20.130> stay<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.640> form<00:00:20.910> new<00:00:21.090> weeds<00:00:21.330> and

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
roots will stay and form new weeds and

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.170 
roots will stay and form new weeds and
come<00:00:21.750> back<00:00:21.930> up<00:00:21.990> if<00:00:22.769> you're<00:00:23.400> tilling<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.910> for<00:00:24.119> an

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
come back up if you're tilling it for an

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.050 
come back up if you're tilling it for an
installation<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:25.130> would<00:00:26.130> suggest<00:00:26.310> at<00:00:26.789> first

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
installation I would suggest at first

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.189 
installation I would suggest at first
you<00:00:27.570> use<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> shovel<00:00:28.580> dig<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.760> up<00:00:29.900> then<00:00:30.900> come

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
you use a shovel dig it up then come

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.340 
you use a shovel dig it up then come
back<00:00:31.230> with<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.740> tiller<00:00:32.009> such<00:00:32.610> as<00:00:32.790> this<00:00:33.059> and

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
back with the tiller such as this and

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.700 
back with the tiller such as this and
run<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.500> tiller<00:00:34.739> over<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:36.260> that<00:00:37.260> would<00:00:37.469> break

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
run the tiller over it that would break

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.569 
run the tiller over it that would break
everything<00:00:38.129> up<00:00:39.230> level<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.379> out<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.860> make<00:00:41.370> it

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
everything up level it out and make it

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.119 
everything up level it out and make it
easier<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.149> work<00:00:42.300> with<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.780> rake<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.920> get<00:00:44.100> a

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
easier to work with the rake to get a

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.540 
easier to work with the rake to get a
nice<00:00:44.719> bed<00:00:45.719> going<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.890> other<00:00:47.039> reason<00:00:47.309> that

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
nice bed going the other reason that

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.220 
nice bed going the other reason that
you're<00:00:47.700> going<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.940> tell<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.989> want<00:00:49.170> to

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
you're going to tell it is you want to

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.380 
you're going to tell it is you want to
incorporate<00:00:49.530> all<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.250> soil<00:00:50.550> together<00:00:50.879> and

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
incorporate all the soil together and

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.330 
incorporate all the soil together and
loosen<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.649> where<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:52.980> can<00:00:53.160> have

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
loosen it to where you can have

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.250 
loosen it to where you can have
something<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.850> work<00:00:54.059> with<00:00:54.090> at<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> depth<00:00:54.989> that

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
something to work with at a depth that

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.849 
something to work with at a depth that
the<00:00:55.530> plants<00:00:55.890> root<00:00:56.129> will<00:00:56.370> grow<00:00:57.440> you<00:00:58.440> want<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.739> be

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
the plants root will grow you want to be

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.450 
the plants root will grow you want to be
careful<00:00:59.300> when<00:01:00.300> doing<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.309> depending<00:01:02.309> on

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
careful when doing that is depending on

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.160 
careful when doing that is depending on
where<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.820> choose<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.359> put<00:01:03.570> your<00:01:03.780> garden

where you choose to put your garden

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.730 
where you choose to put your garden
there<00:01:04.979> may<00:01:05.159> be<00:01:05.189> rocks<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:06.229> as<00:01:07.229> you're<00:01:07.470> tilling

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
there may be rocks and as you're tilling

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.190 
there may be rocks and as you're tilling
and<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.100> come<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.580> rock<00:01:08.790> area<00:01:09.270> just<00:01:09.750> simply

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
and you come to a rock area just simply

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.390 
and you come to a rock area just simply
lift<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.010> up<00:01:12.140> and<00:01:13.140> you'll<00:01:13.770> be<00:01:13.890> fine<00:01:16.310> tilling<00:01:17.310> a

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
lift it up and you'll be fine tilling a

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.100 
lift it up and you'll be fine tilling a
garden<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:17.970> something<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.509> doesn't<00:01:18.930> need<00:01:19.049> to

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
garden is something that doesn't need to

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
tiller we keep in mind one thing too as

tiller we keep in mind one thing too as
far<00:01:39.420> as<00:01:39.570> chilling<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.049> garden<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.470> concerned

far as chilling and garden is concerned

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.429 
far as chilling and garden is concerned
with<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.270> droughts<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.720> we've<00:01:42.930> had<00:01:43.140> across

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
with the droughts that we've had across

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.280 
with the droughts that we've had across
the<00:01:43.500> country<00:01:44.130> we<00:01:45.000> need<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.360> think<00:01:45.720> about<00:01:45.930> ways

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
the country we need to think about ways

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.410 
the country we need to think about ways
of<00:01:46.619> keeping<00:01:46.860> as<00:01:47.189> much<00:01:47.369> moisture<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.240> soil

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
of keeping as much moisture in the soil

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.100 
of keeping as much moisture in the soil
as<00:01:48.659> possible<00:01:49.430> when<00:01:50.430> we<00:01:50.549> run<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.820> tiller<00:01:51.149> across

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
as possible when we run a tiller across

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.889 
as possible when we run a tiller across
the<00:01:52.350> surface<00:01:52.729> we're<00:01:53.729> opening<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.299> ground<00:01:54.630> up

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
the surface we're opening that ground up

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.899 
the surface we're opening that ground up
then<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.350> carbon<00:01:55.740> dioxide<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.490> stuff<00:01:56.729> is

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
then the carbon dioxide and stuff is

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.330 
then the carbon dioxide and stuff is
coming<00:01:57.149> out<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.719> what<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.469> does<00:01:58.710> tend<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.130> do

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
coming out and what that does tend to do

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.510 
coming out and what that does tend to do
is<00:01:59.369> dry<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.000> soil<00:02:00.920> so<00:02:01.920> if<00:02:02.070> you're<00:02:02.219> going<00:02:02.399> to

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
is dry the soil so if you're going to
