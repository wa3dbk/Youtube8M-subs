00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:51.929
 balanced 1 when you see there is 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.970

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.400
 France do not have the names it's I 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.900
 not fluent English llop looking for 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.889
 hockey put back a month and his two 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.740
 beasts the best player at the level 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:20.710

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:22.990
 do not put yourself in the team 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.910
 in any case the most beautiful is really 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.050
 very fluid so connect to it 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.910
 it is true that it was I had trouble in 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.300
 anyway swallowing the app is really 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.880
 fluid 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.120
 So here we are at the club we have milk l 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:38.960
 love vérines to valera ireland Perrin

 scene edern jean edern altintop music 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.639
 all this amalfitano pressed by the standards 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.199
 a colt of hummus ban soon where we go 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.509
 rather put all players before 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:49.639
 I think because his hand is only used to 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:53.060
 nothing we will put them in they are 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:55.220
 marked transfer to the quick vote they 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.900
 are worth how much does it cost 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.770
 so we will put them I advise you 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.160
 to put them at 400h immediate except that 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.710
 can pass 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.180
 you days like that we go it's 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.740
 like that we have to make choices that 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.310
 do not make so we will put 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.020
 at 400 it's typically the kind of 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.340
 player not a big value his markets 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.590
 transparencies do not know much 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.849
 obi mikel hamouma for example it's a 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.300
 player who has good value so we 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:23.720
 can list to go we 're fine for 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.490
 him without too much trouble the verrine 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.310
 device you see you put them to 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.979
 650 the big players 150m this movie was 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.729
 in 1950 that's if you also try to 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:37.039
 the baton test having good credit 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:38.150
 here guys put bigjean dear the 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:39.680
 people will buy is to force people 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.100
 want to have a team the Bible 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.930
 went out she did not ruin their chances 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.970
 tac you see 800 otherwise landes 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.590
 people often give up sophie giquel 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:51.480
 him by cons 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.500
 do not do like this one looking for 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.810
 I did something 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.940
 see that I still believe player 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.040
 look for michael if i type miquette that 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.620
 not even backgammon or keyboard 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.360
 no it does not work do not know what it is 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.610
 serves the typical on the right muscle side 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.320
 it creates Cavalli is secure market 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.840
 transport list went thousand thousand 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:14.470
 five hundred thousand 500 hockey 2006 have 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:17.020
 not still realistic and at Lille3000 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.270
 right way will not hurt for the little 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.830
 obi mikel the rest we take after we go 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.510
 see what the market looks like 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.040
 player level transfers 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.780
 French it's true that I would be 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.340
 interested in doing it a team 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.660
 French and the beginning I believe for 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:33.100
 think good level up paste them 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:35.140
 guy but I would really have fluid in 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:40.500
 I also have a very good pc but it's 

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:44.260
 with the hen the more the more effort 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.880

 Guys do not hide that bayonetta 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.919
 copponi flaw before is not very 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.320
 modest 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:52.690
 so here we are going to remove that all from 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:55.990
 suite movies and web applications 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:57.130
 rather nice to play in Marseille and so 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.070
