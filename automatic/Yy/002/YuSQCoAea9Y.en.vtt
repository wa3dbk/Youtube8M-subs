00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.939
 in the leg 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.100
 hello to all guys welcome back here on 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.720
 self check in 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.430
 hi we are back today that a new one 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.350
 video with a video that they now have 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.970
 spoken we all say except us 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.439
 finally we also talked 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.939
 what is a nuclearization? 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.860
 so for those who didn't know one 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:33.370
 nuclear on tct then 30 kill with 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:36.100
 the weapon you do on pct to do it e 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.720
 it is not necessary to do 30 0 for strength but 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.670
 you can even die a hundred times enough 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.210
 that the kills are 30 in a row made with 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.859
 arms then what can be said in 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.270
 this of this nuclearized let's say 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:48.460
 not of mine in general because mine 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.230
 they believed it was perfectly normal to say 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.239
 of the denuclearized challenge e 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.640
 we say that in my opinion it is all cube ie 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.079
 because it's just luck it's luck because 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.420
 one can also be the best at 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.179
 world but 15 who are the nuptials 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.219
 that one can be very good but 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:04.360
 he is shooting an enemy at yen exposes a 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.040
 other behind that can not do anything 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.950
 then and then the spots are really i 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.320
 worst of the day if the delta with i 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.290
 professors there is no sense 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.720
 just like you kill yourself 1 will be 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.390
 immediately immediately forward 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.970
 forward atheist or you don't have it behind you 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.990
 that I stab you a lot of times for me 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.530
 it's really a thing 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.540
 it's bad I don't know how they did it 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.009
 for these I expose acea name so random o 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.049
 maybe but not even random because it is 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:35.470
 impossible that I do not idf the eye shadow 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.060
 running alone to kill must 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.100
 come out on purpose to speed up the game 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.810
 so that to get back closer 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.670
 with the game it becomes faster than it is 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.250
 i though you still asleep is 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.049
 devastating as a thing then what advice 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.520
 we can give you first the 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.530
 main advice various luck that 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.630
 they needed something your choice of hello 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.860
 it takes ass just opens spawn 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.840
 both for opponents who are not 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.369
 too vindictive because anyone if i 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.470
 volumes you have to go out guys even the most 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.659
 poor in the world 6 wants to kill basketball 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.670
 it is stated that you cannot pass 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.080
 in front of two then he will kill first 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.610
 of all the ass then you always have to 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.200
 move and have control of 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.149
 situation so you need to know a 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.709
 mini does not tell you know a 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.209
 memory etc. but still minimal 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.160
 where they can shoot enemies that way 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.350
 that does not prohibit behind the os 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.799
 he asked him to die for the myths 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.599
 that they marry behind then finding one 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.160
 good area and stationary that area there 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.080
 it means to camper but it means 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.049
 just check a zone that is have 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.190
 always under control that is 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.079
 you would know enemies coming from right to 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.090
 left to be repaired so if you 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.470
 they stick in mass to the molite that 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.079
 you need to have it under control 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.820
 then everything else you need to have goes 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.000
 well a strong rome is in my opinion is the 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.500
 first time I say it indeed as 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.330
 the army using silenced I never have 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.160
 used silenced weapons and this time there 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.170
 I invite you to use it because they have realized 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.690
 because otherwise it is impossible because 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.250
 being eight played in a map and if 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.989
 he was given by raids is given without seeing 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.090
 nothing the first that shoots is the first one that 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.349
 he is killed because everyone is based on 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.239
 the one that fired at cannes then 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.910
 stop come to make even the proud 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.920
 use the silencer however it is a weapon 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.400
 it's a shitty accessory though in this one 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.379
 case you are really the ass then me 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.700
 as you can see used a pump like 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.620
 secondary these when but how 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.540
 secondary ones that never really come out of one 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.239
 devastating thing because most 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.390
 sometimes wanted to move up to 12 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.910
 years 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.410
 olive tree for sports because neither 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:28.530
 killing one I want another behind 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:31.599
 emil most enemy areas leading shortly 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.890
 at least with the one you let go and then you must not 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.019
 even they put me out loved them 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.549
 all or can switch areas when 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.870
 you are entering the houses and you are 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.579
 just sure he rewarded us 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.959
 impossible to die first thing than the 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:47.560
 not very reliable time very often 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.989
 under 15 km ago other times metz 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.049
 elected head of bond fight brands also 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.910
 hardly scandalous, it is not clear how 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.799
 it works by dying however there is a clip 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.540
 ethics that we will put at the end of the child 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.769
 from the gameplay I see myself in 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.780
 inside the proper of this 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.459
 gameplay some and why nothing more 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.739
 to fall into the void before the series when 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.769
 the lesson measures 16 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:10.120
 involuntarily practically remained 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.400
 he was practically exploiting in the air 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.790
 it was right on the edge of the top and edge 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.829
 you won't see it let's say until the end of the video 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.359
 what we say his part of the ass or 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.100
 other enemies who shot me from 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.470
 far away and they touched my head 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.800
 also to people as you have already seen a 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.120
 previous one 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.190
 we should already be there you should already have 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.110
 past the point where you see the type 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.700
 there is one who shoots from the world does not 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.919
 understands well to do what they try 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.000
 to catch someone and that summer who 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.590
 it's raining there 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.690
 we do not think so short if someone from 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.130
 you want to go this gameplay 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:43.479
 we suggest what we already have 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:46.150
 said maybe the help of the claymore 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:48.910
 those bastard claymore vi 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.700
 agrees music is used because 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.860
 in short, in addition to stopping the sport, it is 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.550
 put it close because you don't put it 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.530
 they can also create one 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.930
 barrier a cover behind I say not 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:05.770
 you can turn quietly let's say between 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.360
 the uninitiated ones that just goes well we don't 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.070
 we used to still have a gap from 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.110
 load with claymore is not to say 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.229
 the best even if someone does it 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.460
 he did on youtube 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:17.260
 they used it anyway as lawful as 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.909
 what to see such a challenge is not 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.020
 easy so the claymore are scanu ma 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:21.849
 illicit even if we still have 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.140
 I chose not to use the advice 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.700
 guys were these hopefully not be 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.159
 been much better on the video but five 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.810
 minutes after attempts we have 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:30.760
 made for this gameplay we were there 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.360
 to spend it we say in advice and things 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.789
 such 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.060
 so nothing the video ends here 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:38.160
 you have already seen the clip that 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.360
 I announced a few seconds ago and then 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.050
 we get the next video that 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.669
 they will know 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.810
 in the next week so we 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.810
 we'll see you all next time
