think<00:03:37.250> that's<00:03:37.520> so<00:03:37.790> important<00:03:38.330> and<00:03:38.420> wonderful

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
think that's so important and wonderful

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.750 
think that's so important and wonderful
because<00:03:39.440> there's<00:03:39.740> such<00:03:40.010> an<00:03:40.130> important<00:03:40.550> part

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
because there's such an important part

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.300 
because there's such an important part
of<00:03:40.850> these<00:03:41.030> real-life<00:03:41.300> disasters<00:03:42.140> to<00:03:43.130> give

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
of these real-life disasters to give

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.140 
of these real-life disasters to give
them<00:03:43.520> the<00:03:44.240> heroic<00:03:44.750> position<00:03:45.350> in<00:03:45.440> a<00:03:45.530> movie<00:03:45.920> is

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
them the heroic position in a movie is

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.090 
them the heroic position in a movie is
really<00:03:47.150> a<00:03:47.270> great<00:03:47.540> thing<00:03:47.750> to<00:03:47.930> do<00:03:48.110> but<00:03:48.800> then<00:03:48.920> also

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
really a great thing to do but then also

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.670 
really a great thing to do but then also
you'll<00:03:49.940> what<00:03:50.090> you<00:03:50.240> I'm<00:03:50.480> sure<00:03:50.750> you<00:03:50.870> I<00:03:50.990> hope<00:03:51.530> you

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
you'll what you I'm sure you I hope you

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.380 
you'll what you I'm sure you I hope you
notice<00:03:51.980> this<00:03:52.130> in<00:03:52.340> the<00:03:52.430> trailer<00:03:52.610> there's<00:03:53.150> a<00:03:53.210> lot

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
notice this in the trailer there's a lot

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.390 
notice this in the trailer there's a lot
of<00:03:53.450> different<00:03:53.770> ethnicities<00:03:54.770> represented

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
of different ethnicities represented

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.010 
of different ethnicities represented
here<00:03:55.640> now<00:03:55.970> America<00:03:56.450> is<00:03:56.480> becoming<00:03:56.870> pretty

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
here now America is becoming pretty

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.350 
here now America is becoming pretty
diverse<00:03:57.500> across<00:03:57.800> the<00:03:58.100> board<00:03:58.310> but<00:03:58.580> California

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
diverse across the board but California

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.680 
diverse across the board but California
is<00:03:59.570> particularly<00:04:00.410> diverse<00:04:01.100> so<00:04:02.030> you<00:04:02.090> saw<00:04:02.420> all

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
is particularly diverse so you saw all

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.020 
is particularly diverse so you saw all
different<00:04:03.080> types<00:04:03.260> of<00:04:03.410> ethnicities

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
different types of ethnicities

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.950 
different types of ethnicities
represented<00:04:05.030> there<00:04:05.150> and<00:04:05.330> not<00:04:05.480> just<00:04:05.510> the<00:04:05.810> usual

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960 
represented there and not just the usual

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.140 
represented there and not just the usual
ones<00:04:06.440> you<00:04:06.950> know<00:04:07.070> I<00:04:07.100> believe<00:04:07.520> you<00:04:07.640> had<00:04:07.850> an

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
ones you know I believe you had an

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.120 
ones you know I believe you had an
african-american<00:04:09.020> woman<00:04:09.440> you<00:04:09.740> had<00:04:09.860> an<00:04:09.980> Asian

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
african-american woman you had an Asian

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.700 
african-american woman you had an Asian
guy<00:04:10.490> and<00:04:11.450> of<00:04:11.540> course<00:04:11.750> you've<00:04:11.870> got<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:12.050> ROC<00:04:12.380> and

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
guy and of course you've got the ROC and

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.430 
guy and of course you've got the ROC and
so<00:04:13.460> I<00:04:13.490> just<00:04:13.730> think<00:04:13.940> that's<00:04:14.060> really<00:04:14.240> nice<00:04:14.780> to

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
so I just think that's really nice to

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.560 
so I just think that's really nice to
see<00:04:15.680> I<00:04:15.860> think<00:04:15.920> it's<00:04:16.310> very<00:04:16.520> important<00:04:17.030> I<00:04:17.210> mean

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
see I think it's very important I mean

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.130 
see I think it's very important I mean
she<00:04:18.470> will<00:04:18.680> refer<00:04:19.130> was<00:04:19.340> in<00:04:19.489> 2012<00:04:20.180> so<00:04:20.479> to<00:04:20.840> Roland

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
she will refer was in 2012 so to Roland

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.860 
she will refer was in 2012 so to Roland
Emmerich's<00:04:21.440> cred

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
Emmerich's cred

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.060 
Emmerich's cred
I think<00:04:22.079> you<00:04:22.139> also<00:04:22.440> does<00:04:22.590> work<00:04:22.770> towards

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
I think you also does work towards

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.740 
I think you also does work towards
diversity<00:04:23.669> but<00:04:24.030> that's<00:04:24.180> more<00:04:24.389> than<00:04:24.570> you<00:04:24.630> know

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
diversity but that's more than you know

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.480 
diversity but that's more than you know
you<00:04:25.110> have<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.380> token<00:04:25.620> character<00:04:26.310> a<00:04:26.340> little

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
you have the token character a little

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.700 
you have the token character a little
bit<00:04:26.639> more<00:04:27.449> with<00:04:27.630> what<00:04:27.810> roland<00:04:28.229> emmerich<00:04:28.380> has

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
bit more with what roland emmerich has

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.650 
bit more with what roland emmerich has
done<00:04:28.919> this<00:04:29.370> just<00:04:29.699> seemed<00:04:29.880> organically

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
done this just seemed organically

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.870 
done this just seemed organically
diverse<00:04:31.050> which<00:04:31.380> I<00:04:31.530> really<00:04:32.010> really<00:04:32.340> appreciate

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
diverse which I really really appreciate

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.129 
diverse which I really really appreciate
it<00:04:32.910> and<00:04:33.360> I<00:04:33.419> think<00:04:33.479> it<00:04:33.690> makes<00:04:33.840> it<00:04:33.960> more

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
it and I think it makes it more

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:35.750 
it and I think it makes it more
representative<00:04:34.979> what<00:04:35.400> the<00:04:35.520> state<00:04:35.729> is

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
representative what the state is

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.540 
representative what the state is
actually<00:04:36.300> like<00:04:36.510> now<00:04:37.350> as<00:04:37.620> for<00:04:38.130> being

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
actually like now as for being

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.550 
actually like now as for being
representative<00:04:39.300> of<00:04:39.449> what<00:04:39.630> these<00:04:39.780> disasters

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
representative of what these disasters

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.409 
representative of what these disasters
are<00:04:40.740> actually<00:04:41.190> like<00:04:41.400> you<00:04:42.180> know<00:04:42.210> I<00:04:42.330> think

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
are actually like you know I think

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:43.909 
are actually like you know I think
that's<00:04:42.660> the<00:04:42.810> only<00:04:42.900> thing<00:04:43.380> that's<00:04:43.560> not<00:04:43.710> great

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
that's the only thing that's not great

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.710 
that's the only thing that's not great
here<00:04:44.070> is<00:04:44.190> that<00:04:44.310> I<00:04:44.400> think<00:04:44.850> the<00:04:44.940> science<00:04:45.330> is<00:04:45.449> kind

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
here is that I think the science is kind

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.439 
here is that I think the science is kind
of<00:04:45.900> wonky<00:04:46.350> you<00:04:46.979> could<00:04:47.190> not<00:04:47.400> I<00:04:47.580> think<00:04:47.820> ride<00:04:48.030> that

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
of wonky you could not I think ride that

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:50.689 
of wonky you could not I think ride that
boat<00:04:48.840> over<00:04:49.050> the<00:04:49.350> top<00:04:49.620> of<00:04:49.650> the<00:04:49.919> wave<00:04:50.100> especially

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 
boat over the top of the wave especially

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:51.950 
boat over the top of the wave especially
when<00:04:50.820> you<00:04:50.880> saw<00:04:51.000> that<00:04:51.120> other<00:04:51.300> one<00:04:51.540> in<00:04:51.660> front<00:04:51.870> of

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
when you saw that other one in front of

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.719 
when you saw that other one in front of
it<00:04:52.050> wipe<00:04:52.229> out<00:04:52.440> I'll<00:04:52.830> be<00:04:52.949> like<00:04:53.160> why<00:04:53.340> is<00:04:53.400> your

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
it wipe out I'll be like why is your

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.820 
it wipe out I'll be like why is your
boat<00:04:53.970> doing<00:04:54.150> so<00:04:54.389> much<00:04:54.539> better<00:04:54.810> the<00:04:55.020> rock<00:04:55.229> and<00:04:55.770> I

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
boat doing so much better the rock and I

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:56.810 
boat doing so much better the rock and I
think<00:04:56.039> they're<00:04:56.160> like<00:04:56.310> because<00:04:56.400> the<00:04:56.580> rocks

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
think they're like because the rocks

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.820 
think they're like because the rocks
better<00:04:57.090> driving<00:04:57.720> his<00:04:57.870> boat<00:04:58.050> but<00:04:58.320> I'm<00:04:58.410> like<00:04:58.620> no

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
better driving his boat but I'm like no

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.350 
better driving his boat but I'm like no
I<00:04:58.860> think<00:04:59.310> it's<00:04:59.430> just<00:04:59.520> because<00:04:59.669> the<00:04:59.880> rocks<00:05:00.090> in

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
I think it's just because the rocks in

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.200 
I think it's just because the rocks in
this<00:05:00.660> boat<00:05:00.900> and<00:05:01.080> he's<00:05:01.199> the<00:05:01.350> star<00:05:01.590> of<00:05:01.620> the<00:05:01.830> movie

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
this boat and he's the star of the movie

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.300 
this boat and he's the star of the movie
and<00:05:03.210> on<00:05:03.690> a<00:05:03.810> side<00:05:04.080> note<00:05:04.110> one<00:05:04.740> of<00:05:04.800> the<00:05:04.949> fun<00:05:05.130> things

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
and on a side note one of the fun things

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.189 
and on a side note one of the fun things
about<00:05:05.490> these<00:05:05.910> disaster<00:05:06.479> movies<00:05:06.750> is<00:05:06.960> when<00:05:07.110> you

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
about these disaster movies is when you

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:08.330 
about these disaster movies is when you
watch<00:05:07.410> them<00:05:07.650> you're<00:05:07.770> not<00:05:07.830> only<00:05:08.070> on<00:05:08.130> the<00:05:08.220> edge

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
watch them you're not only on the edge

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.159 
watch them you're not only on the edge
of<00:05:08.550> your<00:05:08.669> seat<00:05:08.940> like<00:05:09.090> a<00:05:09.120> fun<00:05:09.419> ride<00:05:09.690> and<00:05:09.750> that's

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120

they showed a black hole opening up on
the<00:06:18.210> side<00:06:18.419> of<00:06:18.449> the<00:06:18.599> earth<00:06:18.630> and<00:06:19.020> everything

doomed you can't escape it so you know

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:43.470 
doomed you can't escape it so you know
then<00:06:42.280> it<00:06:42.400> becomes<00:06:42.670> more<00:06:42.850> of<00:06:42.910> an<00:06:43.090> end<00:06:43.240> of<00:06:43.390> the

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:43.480

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.810 
then it becomes more of an end of the
world<00:06:43.690> movie<00:06:44.110> say<00:06:44.830> your<00:06:44.980> good-byes<00:06:45.160> and<00:06:45.310> your

course in these movies everybody at the
end<00:06:50.680> of<00:06:50.860> the<00:06:50.950> day<00:06:51.100> there<00:06:51.790> are<00:06:51.910> stars<00:06:52.270> or<00:06:52.540> most

of<00:06:52.900> them<00:06:53.050> will<00:06:53.440> be<00:06:53.470> able<00:06:53.770> to<00:06:53.890> start<00:06:54.130> anew<00:06:54.460> maybe

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:54.940 
of them will be able to start anew maybe

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.540 
of them will be able to start anew maybe
before<00:06:55.270> the<00:06:55.450> sequel<00:06:55.960> but<00:06:56.740> I<00:06:56.800> like<00:06:57.160> it<00:06:57.370> I<00:06:57.400> think

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.550 
before the sequel but I like it I think

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:58.860 
before the sequel but I like it I think
it's<00:06:57.820> a<00:06:57.880> lot<00:06:57.970> of<00:06:58.090> fun<00:06:58.270> I<00:06:58.300> think<00:06:58.450> the<00:06:58.660> rocks

00:06:58.860 --> 00:06:58.870 
it's a lot of fun I think the rocks

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.110 
it's a lot of fun I think the rocks
pretty<00:06:59.260> reliable<00:07:00.130> at<00:07:00.340> least<00:07:00.520> in<00:07:00.670> these<00:07:00.790> kind

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 
pretty reliable at least in these kind

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.810 
pretty reliable at least in these kind
of<00:07:01.180> movies<00:07:01.510> and<00:07:02.320> I<00:07:02.410> just<00:07:02.770> again<00:07:03.010> I<00:07:03.250> have<00:07:03.580> a<00:07:03.610> good

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:03.820 
of movies and I just again I have a good

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.850 
of movies and I just again I have a good
time<00:07:03.940> with<00:07:04.120> disaster<00:07:04.660> porn<00:07:04.900> so<00:07:05.500> what<00:07:05.680> do<00:07:05.770> you

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:05.860 
time with disaster porn so what do you

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.200 
time with disaster porn so what do you
think<00:07:06.160> what<00:07:06.370> do<00:07:06.430> you<00:07:06.460> think<00:07:06.670> of<00:07:06.790> the<00:07:06.850> film<00:07:07.030> I

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:07.210 
think what do you think of the film I

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:08.520 
think what do you think of the film I
think<00:07:07.240> this<00:07:07.450> is<00:07:07.540> a<00:07:07.570> much<00:07:07.810> better<00:07:07.960> trailer<00:07:08.320> than

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:08.530 
think this is a much better trailer than

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.410 
think this is a much better trailer than
the<00:07:08.620> first<00:07:08.830> one<00:07:09.100> and<00:07:09.820> I<00:07:09.910> think<00:07:09.970> because<00:07:10.300> it

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:10.420 
the first one and I think because it

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.270 
the first one and I think because it
plays<00:07:10.600> with<00:07:10.750> the<00:07:10.870> ride<00:07:11.050> qualities<00:07:11.710> and<00:07:12.040> also

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:12.280 
plays with the ride qualities and also

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.530 
plays with the ride qualities and also
what<00:07:12.400> do<00:07:12.460> you<00:07:12.520> think<00:07:12.670> of<00:07:12.760> the<00:07:12.820> funky<00:07:13.150> science

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:13.540 
what do you think of the funky science

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.810 
what do you think of the funky science
does<00:07:13.750> that<00:07:13.900> bother<00:07:14.080> you<00:07:14.260> at<00:07:14.410> all<00:07:14.620> or<00:07:14.860> you<00:07:15.430> like

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:15.820 
does that bother you at all or you like

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.370
