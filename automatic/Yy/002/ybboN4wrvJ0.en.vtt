00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
myself in the position of other people

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.030 
myself in the position of other people
around<00:03:15.750> me<00:03:16.049> watching<00:03:16.410> me<00:03:16.500> just<00:03:16.680> constantly

around me watching me just constantly

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.110 
around me watching me just constantly
like<00:03:17.989> so<00:03:18.989> I<00:03:19.019> think<00:03:19.139> I<00:03:19.350> finally<00:03:19.560> decided<00:03:20.090> that<00:03:21.090> I

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
like so I think I finally decided that I

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.520 
like so I think I finally decided that I
need<00:03:21.359> to<00:03:21.389> just<00:03:21.510> get<00:03:21.810> rid<00:03:21.870> of<00:03:22.079> that<00:03:22.230> screwed

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
need to just get rid of that screwed

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.270 
need to just get rid of that screwed
because<00:03:23.160> it's<00:03:23.430> never<00:03:24.260> it<00:03:25.260> used<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.709> fit<00:03:25.889> me<00:03:26.069> and

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
because it's never it used to fit me and

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.220 
because it's never it used to fit me and

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
it doesn't fit me anymore and I'm okay

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.120 
it doesn't fit me anymore and I'm okay
with<00:03:28.410> that<00:03:28.590> it's<00:03:29.430> just<00:03:29.819> it's<00:03:30.090> hard<00:03:30.269> to<00:03:30.569> let<00:03:30.690> go
