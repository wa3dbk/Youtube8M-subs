00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.469 
positional sensor so who knows what kind
of<00:01:35.310> apps<00:01:35.490> are<00:01:35.670> going<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.850> come<00:01:36.030> out<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.360> will

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
of apps are going to come out that will

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.569 
of apps are going to come out that will
allow<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.290> interact<00:01:37.590> with<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.400> have

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
allow you to interact with it and have

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.490 
allow you to interact with it and have
you<00:01:38.670> guys<00:01:38.790> built<00:01:39.090> some<00:01:39.270> functionality<00:01:39.869> into

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
you guys built some functionality into

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.289 
you guys built some functionality into
the<00:01:40.979> box<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.430> takes<00:01:41.610> advantage<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:42.240> that

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
the box that takes advantage of that

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.450 
the box that takes advantage of that
already<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.840> box<00:01:43.049> actually<00:01:43.409> talks<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.220> this

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
already the box actually talks to this

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.580 
already the box actually talks to this
through<00:01:44.700> bluetooth<00:01:45.119> okay<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:46.020> allows<00:01:46.259> you

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
through bluetooth okay so it allows you

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.950 
through bluetooth okay so it allows you
wirelessly<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.759> do<00:01:47.939> whatever<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.420> want

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
wirelessly to do whatever you want

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.899 
wirelessly to do whatever you want
remote<00:01:49.320> wise<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.979> without<00:01:50.369> having<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.729> worry

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
remote wise and without having to worry

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.580 
remote wise and without having to worry
about<00:01:51.000> keeping<00:01:51.360> line-of-sight<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.200> keeping

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
about keeping line-of-sight and keeping

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.440 
about keeping line-of-sight and keeping
your<00:01:52.710> eye<00:01:52.890> are<00:01:53.100> straight<00:01:53.430> ahead<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.270> let's

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
your eye are straight ahead and so let's

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.060 
your eye are straight ahead and so let's
talk<00:01:54.540> about<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.869> form<00:01:55.110> factor<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.470> this<00:01:55.740> then

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
talk about the form factor of this then

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.959 
talk about the form factor of this then
sure<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.500> very<00:01:58.860> obviously<00:01:59.610> small

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
sure so this is a very obviously small

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.209 
sure so this is a very obviously small
box<00:02:00.210> there<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.110> no<00:02:01.259> blu-ray<00:02:01.590> player<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:02.040> here

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
box there is no blu-ray player in here

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.940 
box there is no blu-ray player in here
but<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.759> does<00:02:03.000> have<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.630> HDMI<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.680> out<00:02:04.829> so

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
but it does have the HDMI in and out so

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.499 
but it does have the HDMI in and out so
you<00:02:05.009> plug<00:02:05.250> your<00:02:05.280> cable<00:02:05.520> box<00:02:05.820> directly<00:02:06.270> into

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
you plug your cable box directly into

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.360 
you plug your cable box directly into
the<00:02:06.600> back<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.930> any

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
the back of any

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.310 
the back of any
and<00:02:07.460> then<00:02:07.970> this<00:02:08.150> into<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.510> TV<00:02:08.780> it<00:02:08.960> has<00:02:09.140> optical

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
and then this into the TV it has optical

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.230 
and then this into the TV it has optical
out<00:02:09.800> so<00:02:10.100> if<00:02:10.220> you<00:02:10.310> want<00:02:10.490> good<00:02:10.580> sound<00:02:10.850> quality

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
out so if you want good sound quality

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.020 
out so if you want good sound quality
you<00:02:11.270> can<00:02:11.570> also<00:02:12.110> has<00:02:12.260> an<00:02:12.350> IR<00:02:12.590> emitter<00:02:13.550> that

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
you can also has an IR emitter that

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.090 
you can also has an IR emitter that
plugs<00:02:14.420> right<00:02:14.510> into<00:02:14.780> here<00:02:15.050> and<00:02:15.230> control<00:02:15.830> either

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
plugs right into here and control either

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.120 
plugs right into here and control either
your<00:02:16.220> set-top<00:02:16.580> box<00:02:16.820> your<00:02:17.150> TV<00:02:17.540> or<00:02:18.290> your<00:02:18.800> cable

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
your set-top box your TV or your cable

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.040 
your set-top box your TV or your cable
box<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:19.670> one<00:02:19.820> remote<00:02:20.120> will<00:02:20.360> control<00:02:20.690> just

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
box so one remote will control just

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.930 
box so one remote will control just
about<00:02:21.140> everything<00:02:21.620> you've<00:02:21.740> got<00:02:21.920> exactly

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
about everything you've got exactly

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.100 
about everything you've got exactly
also<00:02:23.900> land<00:02:24.590> but<00:02:25.250> also<00:02:25.610> built<00:02:25.790> in<00:02:25.940> is<00:02:26.120> Wi-Fi<00:02:26.480> so

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
also land but also built in is Wi-Fi so

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.230 
also land but also built in is Wi-Fi so
connect<00:02:27.950> it<00:02:28.070> any<00:02:28.190> way<00:02:28.340> you<00:02:28.370> want<00:02:28.490> and<00:02:28.820> also<00:02:29.180> to

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
connect it any way you want and also to

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.930 
connect it any way you want and also to
a<00:02:29.360> USB<00:02:29.780> s<00:02:30.020> so<00:02:30.530> you<00:02:30.620> have<00:02:30.800> a<00:02:31.070> lot<00:02:31.490> of<00:02:31.640> growth

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
a USB s so you have a lot of growth

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.030 
a USB s so you have a lot of growth
capabilities<00:02:32.720> built<00:02:32.990> into<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.320> box<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:33.680> it

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
capabilities built into the box and it

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.740 
capabilities built into the box and it
when<00:02:34.490> you're<00:02:34.700> setting<00:02:35.150> this<00:02:35.270> up<00:02:35.330> and<00:02:35.630> it'll

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
when you're setting this up and it'll

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.450 
when you're setting this up and it'll
actually<00:02:36.140> ask<00:02:36.320> you<00:02:36.470> if<00:02:36.680> you're<00:02:36.860> connecting<00:02:37.340> it
