00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
a bunch of these so what these are are

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:55.639 
a bunch of these so what these are are
basically<00:00:50.390> seas<00:00:51.710> cafe<00:00:52.710> latte<00:00:53.610> crispy<00:00:54.649> now

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
these are basically um these are loaded

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.830

with<00:00:58.559> caffeine<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.550> cat<00:01:00.180> wit<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.600> we<00:01:00.690> all

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
with caffeine and cat wit and we all

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.020 
with caffeine and cat wit and we all
know<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.079> caffeine<00:01:01.649> helps<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.190> stay<00:01:03.000> awake
