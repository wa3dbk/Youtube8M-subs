00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.009
 hi friends my name is Misha and today 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.930
 we will have another video from the category 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.710
 how to do certain things in 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.230
 battlefield 3 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.900
 and first I want to ask you one 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.670
 question how often you have been such 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.279
 situations when I play any 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.840
 city ​​map 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.640
 you kill any of their heifers Snyder 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.980
 have you seen this guy just stand 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.730
 on any of the roofs even on this 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.830
 let's say even on this one seeing chicks like 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.410
 he stands right here from time to time 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.340
 stick out your nose and kill one by one 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:40.170
 a person a few minutes is usually not 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:46.170
 more because its pretty fast 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:47.850
 watering and he hides so here's how to smoke 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.200
 such a sniper there and make it up in 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.050
 next time do not sit anywhere on 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:57.180
 the roof is likely to at least take part 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:01:01.760
 in battle yes and so how to call reception I am not 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:07.500
 know the name decide yourself I'll show you 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:10.740
 as I often do and this technique 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.750
 in principle, already enjoys a long time 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.030
 very popular players and he 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.440
 quite effective and so we just 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:24.990
 stood by the wall on a little by him 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:31.820
 distance we raise our sight as much as possible 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.820
 higher all the way and throw a grenade 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.050
 In principle, the exact goal in what 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.340
 the advantage of such a reception of course can 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.630
 climb the stairs we can throw 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.720
 a grenade right from here but when we throw 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.310
 a grenade in the same way as I threw it now 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.980
 grenade makes a long way up and 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.810
 then some more time flies down and 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.240
 breaks down almost immediately after 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.650
 how to touch the roof that is 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.890
 literally on landing therefore 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:10.180
 to run away from such a grenade the chances are almost 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:13.090
 No, if you grant Grant successfully under 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:16.540
 naked almost right under the legs then 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.660
 most likely you will succeed and more 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.750
 This technique works great as 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:26.560
 at least in one situation I have it for you now 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.120
 I'll show you back in a second so 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.030
 now we are on the map 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.000
 top of the vanda house in what mode 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.970
 defensive side is very popular 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.510
 the card I myself adore the assault on this particular 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.440
 picture 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:45.510
 perhaps even my favorite, and that so 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:49.750
 going on here this is first base 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:52.950
 the attacker flees from the hills and often 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:56.430
 many of them running right over here 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:00.670
 jump over this wall to hide 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:04.730
 actually from you if you know 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:09.489
 that someone jump off this hill 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.489
 and sat behind a wall somewhere around here let's say 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.459
 or see just on the minimap 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.959
 that here behind the wall is the enemy 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.360
 reception about which I told you 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:24.019
 few seconds earlier wonderful 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.519
 works and here let me try right now 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.390
 the wall that there will be able to quickly 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.390
 follow the words 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.420
 so 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:40.970
 let's say behind this wall around here 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:44.280
 one or more enemies are not important 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:49.610
 as usual we lift up our head 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.610
 high up in the sky we throw a grenade 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.460
 almost killed me if we moved away 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.460
 even a bit further because their business impact and 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.090
 by Kant, that is, moved somewhere by meter 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.050
 walls 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:08.340
 the grant fell butorin somewhere here and killed 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.340
 one or even two of their enemies 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.340
 I hope this advice will be useful to you. 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.670
 thank you very much for watching and to 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.670
 soon
