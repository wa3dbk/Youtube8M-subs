00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
mixed up with my stabilization phase but

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.840 
mixed up with my stabilization phase but
so<00:00:35.739> strengthened<00:00:36.220> during<00:00:36.400> screening<00:00:36.550> what

standpoint as well the core training

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.020 
standpoint as well the core training
part<00:00:52.960> is<00:00:53.170> going<00:00:53.320> to<00:00:53.379> be<00:00:53.440> like<00:00:54.280> a<00:00:54.309> good<00:00:54.580> mix<00:00:54.879> of

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
part is going to be like a good mix of

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.380 
part is going to be like a good mix of
like<00:00:55.239> total<00:00:55.540> body<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:57.250> then<00:00:57.610> like<00:00:58.000> I<00:00:58.120> said<00:00:58.150> I'm

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
like total body and then like I said I'm

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.759 
like total body and then like I said I'm
a<00:00:58.449> workout<00:00:58.720> endurance<00:00:59.199> and<00:00:59.470> that<00:00:59.559> I'm<00:00:59.650> going

workout you know just as it has been I'm
working<00:01:04.659> on<00:01:05.490> core<00:01:06.490> exercises<00:01:07.240> I'm<00:01:07.659> actually

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
working on core exercises I'm actually

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.760 
working on core exercises I'm actually
doing<00:01:08.170> a<00:01:08.350> circuit<00:01:09.070> of<00:01:09.190> core<00:01:09.520> and<00:01:10.770> reactive

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
doing a circuit of core and reactive

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.550 
doing a circuit of core and reactive
training<00:01:12.159> so<00:01:13.150> this<00:01:13.810> first<00:01:13.990> one<00:01:14.140> this<00:01:14.350> is<00:01:14.530> a

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
training so this first one this is a

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.620 
training so this first one this is a
great<00:01:14.799> abdominal<00:01:15.580> strength<00:01:15.880> exercise<00:01:16.360> but<00:01:16.540> it

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
great abdominal strength exercise but it

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.270 
great abdominal strength exercise but it
kind<00:01:16.810> of<00:01:16.840> becomes<00:01:17.140> more<00:01:17.800> than<00:01:17.980> just<00:01:18.160> some

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
kind of becomes more than just some

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.700 
kind of becomes more than just some
diagonals<00:01:18.730> it's<00:01:18.940> gonna<00:01:19.060> really<00:01:19.240> get<00:01:19.450> my

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
diagonals it's gonna really get my

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.520 
diagonals it's gonna really get my
shoulders<00:01:20.710> my<00:01:20.890> lats<00:01:21.160> chest<00:01:22.150> triceps<00:01:22.540> it's<00:01:23.470> a

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
shoulders my lats chest triceps it's a

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.050 
shoulders my lats chest triceps it's a
lot<00:01:23.680> about<00:01:23.860> per<00:01:24.040> extremity<00:01:24.490> in<00:01:24.580> this<00:01:24.730> exercise

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
lot about per extremity in this exercise

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.000 
lot about per extremity in this exercise
as<00:01:25.390> well<00:01:25.600> so<00:01:26.110> I'm<00:01:26.200> going<00:01:26.320> to<00:01:26.380> use<00:01:26.470> this<00:01:26.740> as<00:01:26.950> kind

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
as well so I'm going to use this as kind

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.780 
as well so I'm going to use this as kind
of<00:01:27.220> a<00:01:27.340> actually<00:01:27.670> like<00:01:28.630> an<00:01:28.780> older<00:01:29.140> on<00:01:29.790> training

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
of a actually like an older on training

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.040 
of a actually like an older on training
the<00:01:30.910> apparatus<00:01:31.420> has<00:01:31.540> been<00:01:31.690> around<00:01:31.870> a<00:01:32.020> long

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
the apparatus has been around a long

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.350 
the apparatus has been around a long
time<00:01:32.230> but<00:01:32.740> it's<00:01:33.010> like<00:01:33.100> you<00:01:34.030> know<00:01:34.060> it<00:01:34.210> has<00:01:34.330> a

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
time but it's like you know it has a

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.120 
time but it's like you know it has a
great<00:01:34.630> application<00:01:35.290> for<00:01:35.320> training<00:01:35.800> today<00:01:35.920> of

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
great application for training today of

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.540 
great application for training today of
course<00:01:36.600> it's<00:01:37.600> timeless<00:01:38.080> so<00:01:38.920> I'm<00:01:39.040> going<00:01:39.190> to<00:01:39.250> get

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
course it's timeless so I'm going to get

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.310 
course it's timeless so I'm going to get
in<00:01:39.640> a<00:01:39.730> kneeling<00:01:39.940> position<00:01:40.090> and<00:01:40.870> get<00:01:40.990> my<00:01:41.110> weight

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
in a kneeling position and get my weight

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.410 
in a kneeling position and get my weight
bear<00:01:41.770> my<00:01:41.950> weight<00:01:42.130> on<00:01:42.280> this<00:01:42.460> wheel<00:01:42.730> I'm<00:01:43.210> gonna

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
bear my weight on this wheel I'm gonna

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.660 
bear my weight on this wheel I'm gonna
roll<00:01:43.570> myself<00:01:43.990> out<00:01:44.170> just<00:01:44.440> like<00:01:44.620> this<00:01:44.860> I'm

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
roll myself out just like this I'm

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.880 
roll myself out just like this I'm
really<00:01:45.730> gonna<00:01:46.030> work<00:01:46.240> on<00:01:46.420> bracing<00:01:46.840> myself<00:01:46.890> and

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
really gonna work on bracing myself and

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.550 
really gonna work on bracing myself and
then<00:01:48.010> I'm<00:01:48.070> gonna<00:01:48.160> come<00:01:48.400> back<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:49.570> obviously<00:01:50.470> it

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
then I'm gonna come back so obviously it

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.950 
then I'm gonna come back so obviously it
takes<00:01:50.650> a<00:01:50.830> lot<00:01:50.950> of<00:01:50.980> arm<00:01:51.220> strength<00:01:51.630> but<00:01:52.630> as<00:01:52.750> well

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
takes a lot of arm strength but as well

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.410 
takes a lot of arm strength but as well
a<00:01:53.230> lot<00:01:53.410> of<00:01:53.530> course<00:01:53.800> we<00:01:53.980> need<00:01:54.100> to<00:01:54.160> keep<00:01:54.340> to<00:01:55.240> keep

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.119 
chop so this is a great total body
exercise<00:02:07.180> but<00:02:07.900> I'm<00:02:08.019> kind<00:02:08.289> of<00:02:08.349> folk<00:02:08.530> using<00:02:09.009> it

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
exercise but I'm kind of folk using it

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.990 
exercise but I'm kind of folk using it
to<00:02:09.250> focus<00:02:09.580> on<00:02:09.729> the<00:02:09.819> core<00:02:10.119> on<00:02:10.539> the<00:02:10.869> lower<00:02:11.050> back

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
to focus on the core on the lower back

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.670 
to focus on the core on the lower back
so<00:02:13.000> I<00:02:13.269> grab<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.690> cable<00:02:14.110> hold<00:02:14.440> it<00:02:14.530> with<00:02:14.650> two

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
so I grab the cable hold it with two

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.949 
so I grab the cable hold it with two
hands<00:02:15.099> so<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.760> first<00:02:15.970> part<00:02:16.120> of<00:02:16.269> it<00:02:16.390> is<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.569> squat

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
hands so the first part of it is a squat

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.479 
hands so the first part of it is a squat
and<00:02:17.680> then<00:02:17.800> what<00:02:17.890> I'm<00:02:17.950> going<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.129> do<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.370> I'm

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
and then what I'm going to do it I'm

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.009 
and then what I'm going to do it I'm
keeping<00:02:18.879> good<00:02:19.000> pasture<00:02:19.450> but<00:02:19.629> what<00:02:19.840> I'm<00:02:19.930> going

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
keeping good pasture but what I'm going

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.619 
keeping good pasture but what I'm going
to<00:02:20.109> do<00:02:20.200> is<00:02:20.319> explode<00:02:20.829> up<00:02:21.069> and<00:02:21.849> I<00:02:22.060> rotate<00:02:22.450> the

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
to do is explode up and I rotate the

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:23.980 
to do is explode up and I rotate the
cable<00:02:22.959> like<00:02:23.139> this<00:02:23.349> and<00:02:23.620> can

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
cable like this and can

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.190 
cable like this and can
see<00:02:24.170> how<00:02:24.320> I'm<00:02:24.380> pivoting<00:02:24.620> at<00:02:25.520> my<00:02:25.930> feet<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.050> at

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
see how I'm pivoting at my feet and at

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
see how I'm pivoting at my feet and at
my<00:02:27.320> hip<00:02:27.560> as<00:02:27.740> well<00:02:28.120> rotating<00:02:29.120> my<00:02:29.210> torso<00:02:29.420> and<00:02:30.220> it

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
my hip as well rotating my torso and it

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.830 
my hip as well rotating my torso and it
starts<00:02:31.550> with<00:02:31.610> my<00:02:31.790> lower<00:02:31.970> body<00:02:32.270> goes<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:32.720> my

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
starts with my lower body goes to my

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.290 
starts with my lower body goes to my
core<00:02:33.140> and<00:02:33.440> then<00:02:33.860> finishes<00:02:34.430> with<00:02:34.610> my<00:02:34.790> arms<00:02:35.120> so

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
core and then finishes with my arms so

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.910 
core and then finishes with my arms so
our<00:02:35.930> whole<00:02:36.050> body<00:02:36.260> is<00:02:36.380> kind<00:02:36.500> of<00:02:36.590> working

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
our whole body is kind of working

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.220 
our whole body is kind of working
together<00:02:37.070> with<00:02:37.310> this<00:02:37.660> so<00:02:38.660> this<00:02:38.840> is<00:02:38.990> how<00:02:39.140> it

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
together with this so this is how it

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.040 
together with this so this is how it
looks<00:02:39.440> kind<00:02:39.830> of<00:02:39.890> real-time<00:02:43.660> ok<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:44.810> next

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
looks kind of real-time ok the next

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.900 
looks kind of real-time ok the next
exercise<00:02:45.290> I'm<00:02:45.710> gonna<00:02:45.830> use<00:02:45.950> a<00:02:45.980> dumbbell<00:02:46.310> what

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
exercise I'm gonna use a dumbbell what

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.180 
exercise I'm gonna use a dumbbell what
I'm<00:02:47.000> going<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.180> do<00:02:47.240> is<00:02:47.360> a<00:02:47.390> total<00:02:47.780> body<00:02:47.870> movement

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
I'm going to do is a total body movement

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.710 
I'm going to do is a total body movement
I'm<00:02:49.190> going<00:02:49.460> to<00:02:49.520> do<00:02:49.580> a<00:02:49.610> reverse<00:02:49.940> lunge<00:02:50.300> into<00:02:50.600> a

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
I'm going to do a reverse lunge into a

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.740 
I'm going to do a reverse lunge into a
shoulder<00:02:50.990> press<00:02:51.140> so<00:02:52.300> I'm<00:02:53.300> going<00:02:53.420> to<00:02:53.480> hold<00:02:53.600> the

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
shoulder press so I'm going to hold the

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.990 
shoulder press so I'm going to hold the
weight<00:02:53.870> just<00:02:54.200> like<00:02:54.380> this<00:02:54.620> come<00:02:55.400> and<00:02:55.520> step<00:02:55.790> back

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
weight just like this come and step back

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.890 
weight just like this come and step back
into<00:02:56.270> the<00:02:56.510> lunge

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
into the lunge

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.990 
into the lunge
I'm<00:02:57.680> going<00:02:57.830> to<00:02:57.920> do<00:02:58.040> a<00:02:58.070> whole<00:02:58.340> shoulder<00:02:58.670> press

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
I'm going to do a whole shoulder press

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.230 
I'm going to do a whole shoulder press
and<00:02:59.500> I'm<00:03:00.500> gonna<00:03:00.620> come<00:03:00.830> back<00:03:01.010> out<00:03:01.220> of<00:03:01.250> it<00:03:01.550> okay

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
and I'm gonna come back out of it okay

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.930 
and I'm gonna come back out of it okay
so<00:03:02.330> I'm<00:03:02.510> combining<00:03:02.690> lower<00:03:03.110> body<00:03:03.350> strength

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
so I'm combining lower body strength

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.060 
so I'm combining lower body strength
core<00:03:04.940> stability<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:05.750> upper<00:03:06.500> body<00:03:06.680> strength

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
core stability and upper body strength

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:12.160 
core stability and upper body strength
as<00:03:07.250> well<00:03:08.200> so<00:03:09.700> this<00:03:10.700> is<00:03:10.880> how<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.090> how<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:11.840> human

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
as well so this is how the how the human

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.760 
as well so this is how the how the human
body<00:03:12.260> works<00:03:12.590> are<00:03:12.920> her<00:03:13.340> legs<00:03:13.580> and<00:03:13.940> core<00:03:14.180> and

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
body works are her legs and core and

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.550 
body works are her legs and core and
upper<00:03:15.770> body<00:03:15.950> work<00:03:16.220> together<00:03:17.110> ok<00:03:18.110> so<00:03:18.170> the<00:03:18.410> next

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
upper body work together ok so the next

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.360 
upper body work together ok so the next
part<00:03:18.770> of<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.100> of<00:03:19.940> this<00:03:20.860> particular<00:03:21.860> circuit

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
part of the of this particular circuit

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.940 
part of the of this particular circuit
is<00:03:23.090> a<00:03:23.150> reactive<00:03:23.840> part<00:03:24.110> so<00:03:24.350> what<00:03:24.500> I'm<00:03:24.620> choosing

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
is a reactive part so what I'm choosing

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.840 
is a reactive part so what I'm choosing
to<00:03:24.980> do<00:03:25.190> is<00:03:25.400> jump<00:03:26.270> rope<00:03:26.890> with<00:03:27.890> a<00:03:27.920> heavy<00:03:28.190> rope<00:03:28.490> so

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
to do is jump rope with a heavy rope so

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.550 
to do is jump rope with a heavy rope so
what<00:03:29.510> it's<00:03:29.630> going<00:03:29.750> to<00:03:29.810> do<00:03:29.960> is<00:03:30.110> obviously<00:03:30.290> I'm

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
what it's going to do is obviously I'm

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.680 
what it's going to do is obviously I'm
working<00:03:30.860> on<00:03:30.920> like<00:03:31.610> lower<00:03:31.850> body<00:03:32.090> speed<00:03:32.510> and

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
working on like lower body speed and

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.300 
working on like lower body speed and
power<00:03:32.840> with<00:03:33.080> the<00:03:33.200> jumping<00:03:33.560> but<00:03:33.800> also<00:03:33.950> upper

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
power with the jumping but also upper

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.430 
power with the jumping but also upper
body<00:03:34.490> cuz<00:03:34.700> I'm<00:03:34.850> I<00:03:35.180> got<00:03:35.870> it<00:03:35.990> really<00:03:36.110> kind<00:03:36.380> of

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
body cuz I'm I got it really kind of

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.260 
body cuz I'm I got it really kind of
muscle<00:03:37.070> up<00:03:37.220> a<00:03:37.310> little<00:03:37.490> bit<00:03:37.700> and<00:03:37.880> swing<00:03:38.150> this

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
muscle up a little bit and swing this

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.060 
muscle up a little bit and swing this
rope<00:03:38.510> around<00:03:38.660> so<00:03:39.560> there's<00:03:39.710> a<00:03:39.740> lot<00:03:39.890> of<00:03:39.980> momentum

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
rope around so there's a lot of momentum

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.710 
rope around so there's a lot of momentum
going<00:03:40.370> through<00:03:40.700> my<00:03:40.790> shoulders<00:03:41.180> my<00:03:41.390> upper<00:03:41.420> body

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
going through my shoulders my upper body

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.190 
going through my shoulders my upper body
so<00:03:42.550> it's<00:03:43.550> good<00:03:44.390> for<00:03:44.420> building<00:03:44.810> strength<00:03:44.990> and

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
so it's good for building strength and

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.890 
so it's good for building strength and
upper-body<00:03:45.290> it<00:03:45.800> as<00:03:45.980> well

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.780 

okay<00:03:52.900> so<00:03:53.410> this<00:03:53.650> next<00:03:53.830> part<00:03:53.920> is<00:03:54.250> is<00:03:54.520> basically

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
okay so this next part is is basically

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.970 
okay so this next part is is basically
the<00:03:55.090> signature<00:03:55.540> part<00:03:55.810> of<00:03:55.990> the<00:03:56.170> strength

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
the signature part of the strength

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
the signature part of the strength
endurance<00:03:57.820> training<00:03:58.180> phase<00:03:59.670> what<00:04:00.670> I<00:04:00.700> do<00:04:00.790> with

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
endurance training phase what I do with

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.790 
endurance training phase what I do with
this<00:04:01.180> I'm<00:04:01.420> going<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.630> take<00:04:01.780> three<00:04:02.200> strength

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
this I'm going to take three strength

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.890 
this I'm going to take three strength
exercises<00:04:03.370> and<00:04:03.940> what<00:04:04.360> I'm<00:04:04.480> going<00:04:04.630> to<00:04:04.660> do<00:04:04.780> with

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
exercises and what I'm going to do with

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.230 
exercises and what I'm going to do with
each<00:04:05.050> exercise<00:04:05.590> start<00:04:05.860> with<00:04:05.980> 21<00:04:06.280> wraps<00:04:06.610> so<00:04:07.180> I'm

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
each exercise start with 21 wraps so I'm

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.420 
each exercise start with 21 wraps so I'm
gonna<00:04:07.360> do<00:04:07.450> 21<00:04:07.900> wraps<00:04:08.140> of<00:04:08.350> each<00:04:08.500> now<00:04:09.250> I'm<00:04:09.310> going

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
gonna do 21 wraps of each now I'm going

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.190 
gonna do 21 wraps of each now I'm going
to<00:04:09.490> work<00:04:09.610> it<00:04:09.850> work<00:04:10.150> it<00:04:10.270> down<00:04:10.420> by<00:04:10.630> three<00:04:10.930> wraps

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
to work it work it down by three wraps

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.200 
to work it work it down by three wraps
until<00:04:11.650> I<00:04:11.890> get<00:04:12.130> down<00:04:12.160> you<00:04:12.610> know<00:04:12.700> the<00:04:12.820> last<00:04:12.970> set

until I get down you know the last set

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:18.660 
until I get down you know the last set
is<00:04:13.360> three<00:04:13.630> so<00:04:13.840> I<00:04:13.870> would<00:04:14.080> do<00:04:14.170> 21<00:04:14.820> 18<00:04:16.200> 15<00:04:17.200> 12<00:04:17.709> 9<00:04:18.100> 6
