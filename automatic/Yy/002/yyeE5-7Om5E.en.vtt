Labonte and Ken Schrader

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.199 
Labonte and Ken Schrader
I<00:01:46.500> think<00:01:46.830> Schrader<00:01:47.099> was<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.459> the<00:01:47.580> grass<00:01:47.849> and<00:01:48.090> he

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:48.209 
I think Schrader was in the grass and he

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:49.790 
I think Schrader was in the grass and he
was<00:01:48.300> going<00:01:48.509> down<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.929> here<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.289> he<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.649> think

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
was going down to here and he I think

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.469 
was going down to here and he I think
his<00:01:50.069> car<00:01:50.280> must<00:01:50.520> have<00:01:50.640> gotten<00:01:50.819> out<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.090> control

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
his car must have gotten out of control

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.029 
his car must have gotten out of control
and<00:01:51.660> Bobby<00:01:51.840> Labonte<00:01:52.289> was<00:01:52.410> coming<00:01:52.679> along<00:01:52.890> and
