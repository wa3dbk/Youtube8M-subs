00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.869

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.600

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.990
 what does it currently time 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.420
 really good action with a long degree 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.009
 Another cursed tricks 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.590
 cardboard displays actions for the video 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.720
 make games and giant cardboard displays 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.210
 want from a few people of the 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.710
 glacier with which everyone takes pictures 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.299
 can and want to give away the parts 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.799
 but currently there are huge problems with 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.240
 the printers and should now stand 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.000
 not sure if all that anymore 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.960
 works at all and so and video days 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.420
 orga is really the horror is there all 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.910
 pretty much none of them pretty well distributed 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.910
 what's up is moving and you have to leave 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.920
 also kept relatively in the dark 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.780
 and that is relatively exhausted right now 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.069
 for you was very interesting the channel 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.920
 to subscribe 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.079
 that's how much the omitted channel costs 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.319
 you always follow one after another 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:29.999
 Video from the directors get on 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.790
 our channel where we again on the 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:34.049
 Follow talk about the origination process 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.730
 what are we talking at which 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:39.569
 scene imaginary art audio commentary only 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.189
 somehow a bit more exciting and 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.780
 fun and exciting on everyone 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.430
 case will probably be 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.840
 once extra material show what you are 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.030
 after not get to see so 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.739
 something like the first sketches and so on 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.469
 and how does it look at all 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:55.169
 before she goes online and that's me 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:57.090
 really excited and looking forward to it 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:03:01.079
 that you are all there and apparently 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.120
 just as flower house since I joined 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.650
 no matter what video I'm uploading 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.510
 everywhere is always only when 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.980
 Computers Stank is already here 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.560
 do you know it on 22 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.359
 computer sixteenth video days 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.889
 seventeenth exclusive preview from 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.900
 main channel says victoria is also yes 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:18.810
 and then every seven days 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.489
 every week friday at 17h30 comes 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.560
 only new episode and thus ten weeks 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.359
 long to unity months will be every 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.949
 friday clash and you can do the whole 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:27.750
 time to vote and decide what 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:29.310
 this is happening in the next episode 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.590
 video will be with the lead for far too long 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.909
 That's why I gave that and ended it 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.530
 why probably everyone has user 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:37.489
 values ​​and you need a dictionary 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.489
 to understand me at all 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:42.569
 I finish glass and get a letter 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.459
 is viewed by me and am 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.599
