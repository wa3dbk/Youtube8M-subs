it's a lot easier to ride than a bicycle
and<00:01:56.910> for<00:01:57.720> someone<00:01:57.990> my<00:01:58.320> age<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.890> think<00:01:59.670> that<00:02:00.000> it's

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
and for someone my age I think that it's

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.940 
and for someone my age I think that it's
a<00:02:00.330> great<00:02:00.900> way<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.110> exercise<00:02:01.440> without

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
overdoing it I find that I can do it and

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.190 
overdoing it I find that I can do it and
it<00:02:05.610> doesn't<00:02:05.820> hurt<00:02:05.880> my<00:02:06.030> back<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.420> bicycle<00:02:06.990> 10
