00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 hi my name is bad fame and good 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.069
 let's play here a live game 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.509
 you did not see it you missed the 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.710
 message that you just put me but 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.200
 well I was when with all this 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.809
 people who are here when three games 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.000
 and it put me jumped the message the typical 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.180
 juice gleeks as you want to call the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.449
 lies that puts vouchers without the help of a 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.220
 shot that puts that in my character that 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.720
 the game was already heavy and not 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.470
 I can have in the character that I 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.320
 I want is something that seems very bad to me already 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.730
 I do not like marcus skin, I do not like 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.620
 like nothing was with the frame I do not know by 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.000
 what is it to me I like but it is not 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.489
 that I fall prettier but I do not know I do not 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.430
 like to move with the character so 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.540
 well let's hope this game goes 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.310
 in which you can go 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.020
 we have 10 and we have 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.600
 our new money that maybe 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.460
 he confided to me yes I think life is going to 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.050
 try to help you a little bit here no longer 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.260
 I think they move forward because of the smoke issue 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.300
 ok here comes a pim pam I'm not sorry 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.540
 I had to put myself in the case because I did not 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.449
 fell 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.960
 it's not my fault I have to say it like that 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.960
 what good 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.640
 or what there is 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.540
 I'm going, my mother, it was quite 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.540
 this darling 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.120
 and murderous rage beware of the 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.890
 murderous fury of the marcus in any 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.750
 moment dies look here 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.190
 I always like to do that I do not know why 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.440
 I like to do it but I do not like it 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.020
 do it that seems to you 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.080
 surely what they think as I do with 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.450
 the active one knew there was one there 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.210
 I can read I have a nose locus very 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.520
 good 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.330
 now here here I have to be careful 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.880
 why 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.800
 It's worth not even touching me and then I 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.210
 tumbo would have that he had to have 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.180
 all the charger with each asset by 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.570
 least 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.840
 yes because behind me there was no one I think 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.729
 and there are 2 there are two there are there to see killed 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.040
 an honor if it kills you the most expensive kills if 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.039
 I killed him killed one to see if he kills the other 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.750
 if we do not go, I will not go as fast 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.150
 which can 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.400
 to help here with haul since if I go 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.680
 directly, it's going to be a little bit more 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.900
 complicated because we were all together 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.150
 there's a good first round 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.980
 I'm hearing shots over here knew 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.980
 kill someone look at this 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.080
 and I think that if the best happened, 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.460
 killed 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.960
 the other to be able to kill this I'm going to 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:39.820
 help here nothing happens friend 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.820
 is good good good good 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.030
 teamwork is what matters 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:47.480
 besides, since I am the marcus, you will see 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:52.549
 you what 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:55.250
 it's much harder not to have 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.739
 careful because as I blow me throw 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.960
 to the ground to the robe does not tell me a 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.180
 friend who was lying 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.590
 steal it until it is here to the other 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.900
 framework 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.150
 to the speaker that just killed the 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.750
 last so good at least I do not know 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.820
 it was in vain is not that he did not kill anyone 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.710
 191 the first round with Marxism 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.750
 he perceives a lot but I always play badly 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.050
 I have the marcus, this would be an exception 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.850
 you can say I'm going to the album because 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.590
 this if you can not turn around 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.540
 and it's not what I'd like there are several 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.920
 of the team are going for the boom so 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.190
 well I'm going to go up here because 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.760
 down there is worth one here 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:36.250
 directly end is worth pum and in the already 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.110
 they killed it's worth it if they took it away from me 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.360
 nothing happens since I was removed 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:44.400
 how many so that this one is going to advance 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.400
 surely if it's going to advance it's worth 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.750
 uy that was close we have the boom 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.670
 perfect until this round I think that already 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.950
 is also won practically if the 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.689
 of the boom does not make nonsense the round is 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.810
 Canary Islands that we have locked up and 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:00.829
 there is one with an alan to be 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.180
 practically this is finished since 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.860
 you can not stay there you can not 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.780
 hide my baby and the boom is the one of 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.569
 true boom on the other side so 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.760
 well this looks good killed us 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.370
 they killed one more band 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.650
 the regulation is just because they 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.510
 I take the time my mind says go for 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.910
 the fragmentation that you already throw there 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.199
 someone who would be good was one of the 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.199
 another team that week 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.500
 here comes people like this come fast 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.690
 the time I shot this side and it came out 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.490
 well the play because I knew it was going 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.260
 to brake because I did not know where to go down 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.120
 the grenade 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.650
 and there came a bot already good I hope that 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.320
 do not leave many people there I'm seeing 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.580
 one but I think this one will kill you if 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.250
 out for him 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:49.480
 pity that he killed himself friend kills him 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:52.680
 he tried to help he did not kill me my promoter 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.380
 has killed me for trying to help 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.200
 do not 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:01.700
 because this world is so cruel 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:04.640
 get him such a good thing he did not get up 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.490
 good because the game is already what it is 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.870
 blame the frame of their guilt in frames 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.030
 it's your frame fault that intrudes on 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.380
 other people's problems 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.850
 let's see here I hope I 'm not 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.620
 waiting for nothing and there are not any 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.990
 surprise for me not 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:23.389
 I think the fermentation in this 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.389
 game or not that will take me mattos 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:30.930
 at sea ​​with embargo makes me fail 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.930
 my mother is killing me 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.920
 I'm sorry but it 's the frame's fault 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.080
 I gave the same frame to the bird neither 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.490
 nothing the cachazos the gods marcus to me 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.250
 do not blame me blame the marcus 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.860
 this marcus luckily we won because 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.630
 If I did not have some very serious words 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.120
 with him I hope you liked this 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:52.199

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.199
