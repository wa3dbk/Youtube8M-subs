00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.699 
coughing so it's a very like exhausting
process<00:02:34.920> so<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:35.940> was<00:02:36.209> able<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.540> literally<00:02:37.200> get

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
process so I was able to literally get

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.310 
process so I was able to literally get
over<00:02:37.980> this<00:02:38.100> cold<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.730> like<00:02:38.940> two<00:02:39.239> days<00:02:39.450> no<00:02:40.020> joke

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.750 
I did differently that I normally do not
do<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:46.260> first<00:02:46.500> thing<00:02:46.709> is<00:02:46.920> I<00:02:47.280> there's

heard of people using other methods of
like<00:03:18.180> nasal<00:03:18.570> sprays<00:03:18.840> but<00:03:19.170> you<00:03:19.380> need<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:19.830> be

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
like nasal sprays but you need to be

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.460 
like nasal sprays but you need to be

is can be deadly or it is deadly or one
of<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:32.910> other<00:03:33.060> so<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:33.750> want<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:33.989> be<00:03:34.079> really

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
of the other so you want to be really

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.400 
of the other so you want to be really
careful<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:35.040> only<00:03:35.430> use<00:03:35.760> a<00:03:36.180> product<00:03:36.720> that<00:03:36.989> is

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
careful and only use a product that is

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.550 
careful and only use a product that is
like<00:03:37.980> sterile<00:03:38.730> from<00:03:39.150> a<00:03:39.390> drug<00:03:39.630> company<00:03:39.840> let<00:03:40.410> me

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
like sterile from a drug company let me

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.170 
like sterile from a drug company let me
tell<00:03:40.799> you<00:03:40.980> I<00:03:41.010> use<00:03:41.340> this<00:03:41.549> like<00:03:41.850> pretty

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
tell you I use this like pretty

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.810 
tell you I use this like pretty
frequently<00:03:42.930> when<00:03:43.170> it<00:03:43.260> was<00:03:43.380> really<00:03:43.620> bad<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:44.220> I

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
frequently when it was really bad and I

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.420 
frequently when it was really bad and I
think<00:03:45.329> that<00:03:45.630> it<00:03:45.959> really<00:03:46.200> cleared<00:03:46.920> secretions

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
think that it really cleared secretions

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.680 
think that it really cleared secretions
up<00:03:47.640> majorly

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
up majorly

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.560 
up majorly
and<00:03:48.780> helped<00:03:49.470> me<00:03:49.680> get<00:03:50.010> over<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.880> bug<00:03:51.239> or

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
and helped me get over the bug or

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.199 
and helped me get over the bug or
bacteria<00:03:52.170> or<00:03:52.410> virus<00:03:52.860> that<00:03:53.040> I<00:03:53.070> had<00:03:53.310> almost<00:03:53.910> in<00:03:54.090> a

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
bacteria or virus that I had almost in a

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.000 
bacteria or virus that I had almost in a
jiffy<00:03:54.570> like<00:03:54.840> literally<00:03:55.170> two<00:03:55.530> days<00:03:55.560> so<00:03:55.920> it

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
jiffy like literally two days so it

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.520 
jiffy like literally two days so it
literally<00:03:56.310> cut<00:03:56.700> off<00:03:56.880> like<00:03:57.209> almost<00:03:57.750> seven<00:03:58.350> to

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
literally cut off like almost seven to

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.190 
literally cut off like almost seven to
ten<00:03:58.709> days<00:03:58.950> of<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.579> nagging<00:03:59.970> cold<00:04:00.239> that<00:04:00.600> usually

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
ten days of a nagging cold that usually

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.340 
ten days of a nagging cold that usually
lags<00:04:01.680> on<00:04:02.100> forever<00:04:02.790> so<00:04:03.090> if<00:04:03.269> you<00:04:03.480> get<00:04:03.959> a<00:04:03.989> cold

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
lags on forever so if you get a cold

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.039 
lags on forever so if you get a cold
that<00:04:04.680> is<00:04:04.980> like<00:04:05.250> in<00:04:05.430> your<00:04:05.459> nasal<00:04:06.180> area<00:04:06.750> or

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
that is like in your nasal area or

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.170 
that is like in your nasal area or
sinuses<00:04:07.739> I<00:04:07.980> highly<00:04:08.430> recommend<00:04:08.880> this<00:04:08.970> it's

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
sinuses I highly recommend this it's

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.270 
sinuses I highly recommend this it's
super<00:04:09.750> cheap<00:04:10.019> you<00:04:10.170> can<00:04:10.290> probably<00:04:10.590> find<00:04:11.040> it<00:04:11.190> at

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
super cheap you can probably find it at

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.069 
super cheap you can probably find it at
your<00:04:11.430> local<00:04:11.489> pharmacy<00:04:12.150> I<00:04:12.480> looked<00:04:12.810> you<00:04:12.959> can

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079

cold in the future

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.979 
cold in the future
