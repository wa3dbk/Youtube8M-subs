 tv code that we start another 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.079
 presentation with alain sale of this 250d 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.110
 which is therefore part of the coxide range 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.579
 is therefore aluminum the circumference 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.590
 always plastic on a new 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.109
 range but that remains very well done and 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.780
 the steel frame we start with the 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.110
 front so aluminum here the bridge 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.860
 neurons the risette the bay 5 25 inches 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.240
 2 usb 3.0 audio and audio inputs 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.119
 finally the aluminum fac that conceals 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.600
 a filter all compatible 140 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.880
 and 200 mm we can of course removed the 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.759
 filter like this you see it's very 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.380
 easy we can even change the 140 mm 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.689
 for a 120 mm 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.689
 we find a fan af 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:43.049
 obas directly on the first side on 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.450
 the first side we see we have a wide 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.579
 grid that will allow a good air intake 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.530
 fees for graphics cards and the 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.299
 everything being more filter what is a 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.100
 very good thing with a type filter 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.369
 loving and can be removed 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.240
 easily in the back a lot of things 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.030
 to have 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.390
 two locations in 80 mm with 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.470
 robots 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.610
 rubber two expansion slots 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.789
 the location for the plate or shield 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.979
 from the motherboard a slot for them 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.870
 hdd cages so removable or would see him the 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.700
 loading is done from behind it's 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.350
 quite original and finally the location of 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.270
 feeding with a plate 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.940
 of adaptation there too it can be 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.190
 practice we find finally below the 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.560
 city ​​mop filter to 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.690
 supply 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.459
 we now go to the right side on 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.300
 right side is very similar to the side 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.520
 left we find the grid filter 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.090
 with a fan behind we go 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.090
 come back 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.000
 flexible 250d nothing special is found 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.060
 agly for food 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.410
 with its filter finally we finish on the 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:55.170
 above on the top where we discover 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.660
 a small glass plexiglass smoke that 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.459
 will have a view of the 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.910
 material right away we discover the 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.829
 frame athens we discover so 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.690
 now inside of 250 of 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.880
 started with at the door to terror he 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.860
 was talking about the movie really and you see 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.100
 it's very simple we trap it 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.170
 remove one cleans and replace all that 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:20.430
 at the frame in itself was 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.780
 on the top a 25 inch 5 bay with 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.630
 a passage on the side that's good 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.930
 to pass cables without screws 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.200
 at the level of this beast 5025 on the side 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.340
 we found the location for 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.690
 the food we see we do not have 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.640
 limitation on the length of this 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.110
 which is pretty good for a m 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.239
 Modular type power supply 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.310
 we will find rubber pads 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.560
 underneath the inside to avoid 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.260
 any vibration in the front we have the 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.700
 140 mm fan that we can 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.230
 pc by a 120 mm or 1,220 mm a little more 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.250
 back here we see the two slots 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.750
 extension the device to be the 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.420
 keel to the number of the motherboard the 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.970
 two slots in 80 mm 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.930
 here further back we notice the 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.849
 blood fan 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.659
 mm could turn gauthier that 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:12.090
 will be easier for everyone we have 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:14.969
 at the location in 120 mm followed by a 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.039
 second location in 120 mm we will be able to 

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:20.160
 this place add a radiator 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.720
 watercooling are where 240 mm 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.419
 in the bar still has space 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.039
 of course the platinum is removable which 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.710
 will allow you to make the arrangements 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:30.330
 a bit like double you want we're going 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.750
 now go to the back because at 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.900
 interior 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.800
 in the back is also interesting we have 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.800
 here the hdd cage 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:42.360
 the latter is responsible from behind 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:48.660
 to remove the device from the 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:51.960
 protection like these and we're going 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:56.270
