00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello, I 'm the gene face and here in our 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.460
 trump 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.130
 many girls ask how to use the 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.080
 white pencil has many more shapes 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.830
 Today I'm going to teach three very nice kids. 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.830
 to define 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.740
 ae 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.169
 the white pencil he is already a player for 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:32.140
 if only the first trick will nominate the 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:35.379
 Kestrel thing you need to do is 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.100
 the risk close to the middle eyebrow 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:45.309
 to the end 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:49.260
 the small volume that teaching the 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.260
 brush and smoke 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.329
 You see how much more 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.329
 eyebrow looks different 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.550
 The trick is you. 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.530
 highlight the color of the shadow if you have a 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.659
 shadow that is not very fragmented you 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.520
 can use white pencil as a base 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.220
 There you use pencils to use color 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:29.409
 the skin then you go where it goes 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:32.680
 pass on the case here in fear the car 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.680
 out 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.770
 there you come with the shadow of the 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.990
 preference for upward and passes over 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.000
 you dondi passed on blank 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.590
 Only you can have a good time and already 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.119
 You can see how pigmented it is. 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.119
 How much differently, I 'm world. 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.820
 and now it's just hand 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.100
 The last trick is nothing else at all. 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.160
 black pencil threshold when you pass 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.840
 underneath it it diminishes your gaze 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.390
 in this function 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.160
 white is just the opposite and you 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.390
 open the eyes mainly to those who 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.040
 has a clear eye, it's very cool because 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.410
 gives a very big note 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:38.220
 I like to use nothing here at all. 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:40.500
 line to finish I'll go 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:47.480
 eliminate the corner of the eye right here in the 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:47.480
 up and down 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:05.069
 Then you give a little foam and you're done. 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.069
 nothing is waiting for the eye 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.520
 I hope you have enjoyed it and all 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.570
 land has new video on our truck at 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.930
 11 o'clock in the morning 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.930
 stay connected
