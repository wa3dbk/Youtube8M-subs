00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:09.410
 Oh yeah 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:11.590
 The first thing is to take out x kilograms from here x Take out the program 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.590
 When 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.710
 2- x in kilograms 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:26.970
 The density does not change The density is 12.5% 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.619
 In step this is taken out x Kedomo not in this mode once return the water 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:37.090
 Still small mode 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:44.100
 There are 20-x kilograms in 12.5% ​​saline so it remains 12.5% 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:44.100
 The amount of sodium chloride dissolved in this is expressed by the formula 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.469
 Salt 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:57.940
 This is 10- x 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.170
 That's about 10 / 102.5 . 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:05.670
 This is the amount of salt dissolved in 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:11.930
 I wonder if you that the time being taken out of the x-kilogram 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.930
 I'll return the water here next time I'm water x mode 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.729
 The amount of sugar to do so is 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.729
 Return to 10kg 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:30.690
 The amount of salt dissolved in it is 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:36.050
 This is the same because I just returned the water, so I didn't dissolve salt in the water 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.050
 The amount of dissolved salt has changed a while ago 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:47.730
 But the density is no longer at 12.5% 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.730
 In're gone generate dilute yellow sand does not know you some percentage 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:56.850
 From this stage on a 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.850
 I hope it is 2x grams xg Toru 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.810
 And 2x machine robe rug 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:12.690
 Only to but we're focusing seconds of salt contained therein Then 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:20.580
 This is the food contained in this 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:23.150
 I just melted 10- x 20/20 x 2.5 x g 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:30.140
 Depending on the take 2x 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:31.440
 I say or reduce how much naturally reduces you'll ne melts and salt Damn edge originally 10 kilometers 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.050
 The 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:38.540
 9 kg 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:40.630
 Take 2x from here, so take x from inside 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:47.599
 It's the rest of it 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:51.770
 The rest of it is flexible enough to put it on 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:54.230
 10/10 - to Kusu' 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:59.319
 It will be the amount you have spent 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.319
 Kedomo'm not sure I wonder a little difficult comes here or Iebaii 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.020
 Hm 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:07.520
 Somehow I will explain with a little more simple example 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.880
 For example, Maan 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.750
 If there was a saline solution 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:18.700
 It was fine here x 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:20.350
 Suppose that xg melted, and the entire mass is medium 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.780
 from here 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:26.050
 Let's say you take 3 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:29.190
 And the place was 10 km and 3 km breakthrough 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:34.340
 Taking three kilometers Once you do so 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.340
 What is the remaining salt when I take it? 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:47.200
 The remaining sodium chloride is a 10-minute walk of the 10 of them Kedomo I was a little while ago x 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.940
 Only 7/10 left 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.740
 Salt in this 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.330
 I am allowed to do this with such a way of thinking 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.349
 x melted 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.780
 Ne 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.440
 In a 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:05.990
 When 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:12.830
 It is only 7/10 in terms of ratio that there is only a damn child left because it took 6 kg 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:16.430
 You mean consisting of sodium chloride, which is dissolved in because there are no remaining saline 7/10 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:20.840
 In other words , a house in the cemetery cemetery 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.670
 As we take 2x, there is only 10-2 left 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:28.450
 eh 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:34.480
 x remained on the x axis and the whole was originally inside 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:36.100
 10/10 - 2 x minutes remaining because you will Rutte events 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.120
 this 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.910
 Here day 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:49.970
 It is the staff who is in 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:55.070
 -x out of 10 / 1002.5 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:05:01.330
 10/10 - 2 x only remains 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:01.330
 It is that common salt is this in such Fu remaining in the final without 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.009
 That's 6% down 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.870
 That's right 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:11.310
 When 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.730
 10 kg 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:18.800
 I did this because 10 kg of salt was this kilogram 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.800
 Salt Noremo sorry is all kilograms 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:30.620
 It is 6% at 10kg 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:30.620
 It is to dissolve the amount of salt that is that it is 6/100 to apply 10 during 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:40.380
 It is supposed that this is the amount of salt that is dissolved in, so people surrounded by this square are with = 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.500
 It will be a quadratic equation to be connected 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:46.270
 10- x over 100 minutes 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.910
 12th 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:53.150
 In Chinese 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:56.790
 10-2 x 1 = 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:06:00.940
 6/100 will be to those who like to apply 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:03.180
 I want you to stand a space system 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.540
 As 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:09.780
 Say-xi 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:11.560
 10-2 x 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:16.000
 12/10 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:20.500
 Also = 60 Kana 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.110
 Do you want to multiply the dodger reciprocal 10 / 102.5 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:26.770
 If you apply 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.910
 10- x a 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.470
 Ssu 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:37.350
 = 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:43.460
 Since multiplying the divisor and is multiplied by the early reciprocal is multiplied by the gun of 12.5 minutes Kurena 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:43.460
 Because it is 12.5 which erases this and divides 600 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:51.600
 Because 600 is r 12th place school 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:07:03.040
 It is 4810 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:07:08.020
 Then 100-20 x -10 x plus x 2 = 48 

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:17.080
 Letter x everywhere in the square-30 x- 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:19.139
 Minus 52 No. Rose arm to put the I x- certification date or 15 x brass 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:24.320
 26 = 0 

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:26.860
 x - become a neat x -13 years a few minutes mother 

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:33.240
 x = same 10 days 

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:33.240
 But -x is more than 10 kg does not fit the problem of taking out 13 

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:40.450
 I have an idea to wind Tteyuu become 2kg in that 

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.450
 This is the end
