00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.000
 i 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.799
 what's so special about that panasonic 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.180
 lumix LC1 we have no hands 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:10.190
 now it is not the only one but when 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.350
 presented months ago was the first 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.639
 compact camera with an integrated viewfinder 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.109
 a feature that many users 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.510
 they have been asking for a long time and that 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:19.010
 finally we have here is actually 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.450
 of a viewer that is too small and not very 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.310
 comfortable when working well 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.450
 It also has a direct impact on the 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.950
 camera price in fact we have to 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.660
 confess one thing we have long been 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.070
 asking for a built-in viewfinder a camera 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.360
 compact but the weeks that we have 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.340
 been working with this election or 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.870
 we have finished using more the screen that 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.550
 sometimes we are so incoherent 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.050
 leaving aside the subject the viewer the 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.749
 right also something like the version 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.460
 pocket of the lx and we are seeing 

00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:41.839
 which is noticeably smaller but 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.120
 despite this incorporates a further zoom 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:46.100
 powerful seven magnification that yields 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.899
 focal lengths equivalent to 28 200 millimeters 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.170
 although it is true that the luminosity falls 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.429
 very fast from f2 to effe 59 things that we 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.079
 have liked this camera we have already 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:55.789
 said its reduced size perfect for 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.079
 Always carry in your pocket the fact 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.579
 that you have manual controls and 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.589
 raw format something is not very usual in 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.149
 a camera so small the wifi connection 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:03.649
 that in addition already accompanied by connection 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.180
 nfc in such a way that if we have a 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.340
 phone or a tablet with this connection 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.930
 the configuration is really simple 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.430
 just touch the two devices 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.990
 and the image quality is also 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.510
 pretty good thanks to a bait of 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.920
 considerable size and 12 megapixels of 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.180
 anyway as always the best thing is that 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.710
 you are a look at the galleries of 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.960
 samples that we have published and take out 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.370
 yourselves conclusions good note 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.110
 also for this front ring that we 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.640
 allows you to control manual settings 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.320
 that we mentioned before but also 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.330
 other type of controls like for example 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.570
 the zoom steps that incorporates this 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.430
 camera 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.780
 all are good news not really 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.120
 because we have already said that the lg 1 is 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.860
 quite that right now it costs about 370 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.940
 euros and the problem is that for that same 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.280
 price for a little bit more we can 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.050
 find the lx 7 that is true that is 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.310
 bigger but it's also more camera and 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.440
 offer more image quality than you do 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.910
 a remarkably better optics other 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.009
 problem its main competitor is the 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.810
 canon s 110 that right now you can 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.280
 find for 100 euros less although it is 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.110
 true that it has less smoke and that 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.310
 has a built-in viewfinder in fact if 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.690
 what we are looking for is a camera 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.460
 Pocket of this size and with viewfinder 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.320
 incorporated this is the only option like this 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.240
 that will play at home and by the way 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.649
 if the money we problems of law that 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.570
 it also has its own version though 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.570
 logically it will pay to pay a lot more
