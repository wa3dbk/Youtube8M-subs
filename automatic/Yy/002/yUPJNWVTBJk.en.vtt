00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.290

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.910
 fees up to 30% higher each 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.350
 second is a final 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.720
 bwin 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.480
 well this weekend a game of 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.750
 the classics of the classics so perhaps 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:23.080
 the athletic club bilbao against the real 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.760
 madrid to my friends live and with know 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:29.060
 what is my prognosis 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:32.840
 The truth is that both teams are not 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.600
 at best he has needed us 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.170
 little end of june as I would say to 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.210
 English seeks the position in point no 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:46.150
 because the quotes the victory of 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:51.980
 athletic club pays six euros fifty 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:56.840
 650 the tie for four euros 75 and the 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:01:00.490
 Real Madrid victory one euro 48 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:06.110
 Of course it is a sunset that has a little 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:08.180
 dubitative 650 athletic club and then no 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.670
 I can resist the temptation to think about 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.240
 what can be 11 initial of the program 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.220
 that he really has footballers 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.600
 fantastic then I have here my 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:23.119
 application and I'll do the old trick 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.700
 when to look for a better quota 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:29.690
 positions that really to win but 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.759
 it's going to cost you I think then I think of 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.270
 who can finish the first half 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:38.180
 tied for then in the end it ends 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.940
 winning the real madrid has happened so many 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:45.890
 true times but if we opt for this 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.729
 option for four euros 60 this is not 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.060
 wrong 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.040
 so much that I'm going to bet what 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:57.190
 tied in the break and will end 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.190
 winning the Real Madrid four euros 60
