00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.269
 hello friends think it's youtube 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.039
 Greetings to all and then in this 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.340
 occasion we come with a tutorial about 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.220
 of gimp so let's start let's go 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.050
 open our game here and let's go 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.940
 to learn the day from now we are going to 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.670
 learn how to make a change 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.670
 color to a car then for it 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.559
 so let's select as the layer of 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.930
 automobile we want to change color 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.620
 and here we come to the menu 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.449
 file then to open as layers and then 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.359
 let's choose the car that we 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.670
 we want to change color 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:03.239
 Now, well, I have this time 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:07.470
 here an alpha so let's change it from 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.899
 red color to blue color then we have 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.600
 here the car and depending on the 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:15.270
 color that you want can do it 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.950
 whatever the color and the first thing that 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.899
 let's do is let's duplicate this 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.450
 layer for it we are going to apply here in 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:25.120
 this button on each right side down one 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.250
 Once we have the duplicate layer 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.650
 let's wait for us to double already 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.870
 when we have the layer of each here in 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.730
 our layer area we come here to 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:37.540
 color menu 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.820
 in the menu up here and then we're going to 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.450
 choose the second option has this 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.190
 saturation and then we have chosen this 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.100
 option then this menu will appear 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.970
 in this menu we see that we have here 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.040
 the color red yellow green blue 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.990
 magenta and the celestial as you can see the 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.970
 color is red so let's choose here 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.580
 the red color that is what we 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.700
 we want to change and then only 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.760
 we are going to come here to the part where 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.220
 says guido and here is where we are going to go down 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:13.780
 let's say I would like it magenta then there 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:17.140
 I leave it at -57 if I wanted it purple 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.420
 I could change it to less than 89 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:24.000
 let's leave it on this occasion a color 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.000
 blue for that we're going to leave it here 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.640
 let's leave it 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:41.750
 there are less 112 and ready now because the car does not 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.490
 it has changed to blue and once 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.790
 done this, we're just going to 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.170
 click here on ok and once 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.540
 we arrive in ok because we see that already 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.060
 we have our car blue color without 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.310
 However, the problem is that 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.740
 if we observe here if you 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.780
 they are observers the Italian flag does not 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.710
 we have been affected with the color of 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.140
 change 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.780
 blue of the automobile in the same way the 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.540
 Alpha logo has been affected 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.000
 the cross has turned blue too 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.460
 how are we going to correct this and this can 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.560
 what happens to you, we will continue 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.800
 do this with a photograph that has 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.230
 a different background are going to see some 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.730
 parts in which they will be affected 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.710
 for the color change that we have given 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.570
 to the car how are we going to correct this 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.150
 simply because we make sure that here 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.860
 our layer is selected that 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.020
 we just changed color we see a 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.920
 click 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:38.940
 and we come to the option that 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.709
 it says alpha knows what this is 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.239
 then I think we 're going here and then 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.250
 we come to our box 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.160
 tools and we choose the tool 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.860
 of eraser sometimes we go the tool 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.739
 of draft here the draft size 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.180
 We will choose depending on the size 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.790
 which is what we want to correct 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.540
 for example here if I leave it in 20 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.950
 Since the size is very high because 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.110
 the parts that we are going to correct are 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.110
 small so I'm going to go down here 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.660
 88 I like the size of the brush 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.310
 and we work here m correction of the 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.310
 flag with our tool 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:21.440
 eraser we hold the left click 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.440
 of the mouse to make the protections 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.840
 and there we are then we see that already 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.900
 we have the flag to its original color 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.830
 we are going to correct here the logo of 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.830
 alpha the cross 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.960
 we see that they are very small details but 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:46.150
 So, yes, if we are 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.159
 observers we want everything to be 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.229
 clear, it is necessary to do this 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:51.819
