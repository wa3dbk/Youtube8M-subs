00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.819
 water is where I feel most free more 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:12.260
 comfortable is a means not control you 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:15.140
 you feel like a fish more in some way 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:19.030
 and you can appreciate much more what 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.030
 you have around you is my means 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.930
 in recent years and that would be clear 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.239
 that where more faults in swimming and 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.430
 this year the bet has been to count 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.210
 with the help of víctor gonzález la 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.489
 swimming then he is giving me 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.410
 helping technically controls all the 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.760
 train from outside and sometimes help 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.010
 also with the theme of series and 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.330
 other then the truth that from a 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.100
 principle we have decided that we are going to 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.350
 work a first period of technique 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.420
 almost until Christmas after 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.519
 Christmas and now we are working 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.019
 in this second period more strength 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:58.979
 which is what I saw that had more 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.900
 lack of it 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:03.150
 we have focused on trying to win 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.060
 force the rubber beetles a bit 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.940
 strength work weights work in 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.770
 the water to try to get a point 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.750
 more there of strength and look like so I am 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.740
 able to earn a little faster than 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.740
 that the objective 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.720
 in technique in getting a little 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.460
 improve the water stroke and then 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.920
 also the attitude within the water how 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.230
 face many series with almost all 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.960
 face a long period of series in 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.430
 the sea in open waters and especially 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.110
 now the force of what more gray than 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.660
 He lacked strength because nothing and nothing 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.430
 more less well and what we want 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.720
 work is that strength that plus that 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.890
 lack to then have a more 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.890
 aggressive inside the water 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.740
 tanks 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.740
 this is happiness 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.689
 Well it looks like it does at least go 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.100
 having a little improvement in the 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.390
 training does not seem that the series comes out 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.210
 quicker it seems that I have 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.870
 better sensations 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.550
 how much that is always the doubt after 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.800
 the training pool to the 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.820
 competition there is an important jump 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.950
 then until they start 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.650
 competitions and see me and well neither 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.690
 I do not know how far I'm going to go but 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.010
 well I hope the jump is great and 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.750
 I hope it can be a little closer 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.750
 of the people in front of you when you get out of the water 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.780
 which we are moving working with a 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.830
 person like him as well as 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.230
 transmit me to me I can 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.770
 transmit and is learning very 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.770
 quickly
