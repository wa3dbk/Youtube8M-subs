ok<00:01:10.070> remember<00:01:10.310> car<00:01:10.700> 18<00:01:10.940> you're<00:01:11.150> backing<00:01:11.480> in<00:01:11.600> and

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
ok remember car 18 you're backing in and

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.160 
ok remember car 18 you're backing in and
now<00:01:12.260> the<00:01:12.320> orange<00:01:12.980> gqb<00:01:13.340> unboxed<00:01:14.180> so<00:01:14.870> I'll<00:01:14.960> go

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
now the orange gqb unboxed so I'll go

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.010 
now the orange gqb unboxed so I'll go
over<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.440> little<00:01:15.680> metal<00:01:15.830> first<00:01:16.750> so<00:01:17.750> it's<00:01:17.900> just

over the little metal first so it's just

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.680 
over the little metal first so it's just
basically<00:01:18.230> i<00:01:18.830> think<00:01:19.550> it's<00:01:19.670> the<00:01:19.760> u-turn<00:01:20.390> or

these<00:01:33.350> metals<00:01:33.770> I<00:01:34.010> don't<00:01:34.430> only<00:01:34.520> think<00:01:34.640> i'm

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
these metals I don't only think i'm

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.280 
these metals I don't only think i'm
going<00:01:35.000> to<00:01:35.090> keep<00:01:35.210> them<00:01:35.420> they're<00:01:36.080> kind<00:01:36.260> of

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
going to keep them they're kind of

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.590 
going to keep them they're kind of
stupid<00:01:36.680> in<00:01:36.800> my<00:01:36.830> opinion<00:01:36.980> I<00:01:37.550> rather<00:01:37.940> have<00:01:38.150> extra

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
stupid in my opinion I rather have extra

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.960 
stupid in my opinion I rather have extra
guns<00:01:38.840> or<00:01:39.380> some<00:01:39.830> more<00:01:40.010> equipment<00:01:40.250> or<00:01:40.610> something

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
guns or some more equipment or something

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.060 
guns or some more equipment or something
other<00:01:41.450> than<00:01:41.870> these<00:01:42.410> something<00:01:42.800> because<00:01:42.950> you

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
other than these something because you

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.580 
other than these something because you
can't<00:01:43.280> really<00:01:43.400> do<00:01:43.580> anything<00:01:43.910> with<00:01:44.150> these

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
can't really do anything with these

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.520 
can't really do anything with these
except<00:01:45.590> for<00:01:45.770> just<00:01:45.860> displaying<00:01:46.370> them<00:01:46.660> so<00:01:47.660> it's

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
except for just displaying them so it's

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.350 
except for just displaying them so it's
very<00:01:48.620> much<00:01:48.860> it<00:01:49.010> and<00:01:49.220> of<00:01:49.700> course<00:01:49.729> he<00:01:50.030> comes<00:01:50.210> with

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
very much it and of course he comes with

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.050 
very much it and of course he comes with
the<00:01:50.479> larger<00:01:50.870> bruise<00:01:51.260> on<00:01:51.440> the<00:01:51.500> shotgun<00:01:52.010> the<00:01:52.850> sad

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
the larger bruise on the shotgun the sad

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.780 
the larger bruise on the shotgun the sad
thing<00:01:53.090> is<00:01:53.300> the<00:01:53.780> shotgun<00:01:54.229> sculpt<00:01:54.650> it<00:01:55.220> used<00:01:55.670> to

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
thing is the shotgun sculpt it used to

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.790 
thing is the shotgun sculpt it used to
have<00:01:55.970> a<00:01:56.000> little<00:01:56.300> trigger<00:01:56.720> hole<00:01:57.020> right<00:01:57.740> there

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
have a little trigger hole right there

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.890 
have a little trigger hole right there
where<00:01:58.130> you<00:01:58.190> can<00:01:58.220> put<00:01:58.430> the<00:01:58.550> finger<00:01:58.790> in<00:01:58.850> there<00:01:58.970> by

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
where you can put the finger in there by

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.190 
where you can put the finger in there by
the<00:01:59.960> ends<00:02:00.320> up<00:02:00.760> where<00:02:01.760> it's<00:02:01.910> like<00:02:02.060> filled<00:02:02.390> like

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
the ends up where it's like filled like

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.250 
the ends up where it's like filled like
the<00:02:03.440> mold<00:02:03.830> it<00:02:04.310> wasn't<00:02:04.700> my<00:02:04.820> correct<00:02:05.270> so<00:02:05.990> there's

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
the mold it wasn't my correct so there's

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.690 
the mold it wasn't my correct so there's
no<00:02:06.440> home<00:02:06.680> there<00:02:06.920> so<00:02:07.100> it's<00:02:07.220> kind<00:02:07.369> of<00:02:07.400> hard<00:02:07.490> to

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
no home there so it's kind of hard to

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.930 
no home there so it's kind of hard to
give<00:02:07.910> them<00:02:08.000> to<00:02:08.179> hold<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.869> shotgun<00:02:09.290> properly

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
give them to hold the shotgun properly

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.550 
give them to hold the shotgun properly
but<00:02:10.940> it<00:02:11.150> has<00:02:11.270> a<00:02:11.300> fig<00:02:11.720> as<00:02:11.990> well<00:02:12.170> which<00:02:12.530> is

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
but it has a fig as well which is

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.250 
but it has a fig as well which is
removable<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:13.510> then<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.690> figure<00:02:14.959> it's<00:02:15.110> off

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
removable and then the figure it's off

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.810 
removable and then the figure it's off
