00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.220
 hello to all richer allied to his 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.170
 today we find ourselves on call of 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.910
 black duty ops not on the zombie card 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.190
 more of the dead to present you a 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.450
 brand new click to achieve this rich 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.170
 it's very simple you go to 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.390
 infirmary 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.830
 when you have a death you go 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.629
 you commit suicide in the same place as me 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.489
 in the video but what are you 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.770
 suicidal you go with your and not 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.780
 you resuscitate exactly by placing yourself 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.730
 like me once did you do this you 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.110
 just run and dive 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.540
 in the wall that is in front of 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.339
 you and at the next round you 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.909
 commit suicide once again 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:55.739
 a death letra you 're committing suicide either 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:56.850
 you revive yourself or be at 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.260
 you come alive 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.580
 the best is that a friend realize you 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.140
 you will still run your 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.830
 death to try to waele breches 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.269
 in the ground 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.550
 and if you can not do it it's not 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.440
 very serious so if you do not have 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.790
 managed to wall e breaches in the ground this 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.530
 that you're going to do you're going to wait 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.729
 zombies and when you see them 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.860
 zombies you 're just going to 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.870
 you 're doing a first live lounge for 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.370
 power where it breaks into the ground a 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.290
 once in the soil if you can not manage to 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.430
 forward while me in the video j 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.740
 happens very well after a while 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.329
 you will ask your friends about you 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.000
 jump in the back to be able to 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:28.170
 move forward more easily and by 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.009
 against pay attention because if you 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.119
 jump on the head 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.950
 you will take one of 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.890
 barriers and so die very foolishly 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.109
 short once you are in the ground you 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.299
 go again wait for a zombie and 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:41.880
 you will try to side to make a 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.009
 new challenge and you come under 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.960
 under the floor so rather on 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.399
 tile once you are there you 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.049
 are totally invincible 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.270
 it's a little barriers are btu 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.189
 everywhere around you or the 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.929
 zombies will go but me what I 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.310
 shows you and it's rather a scic the 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.439
 troupe so for him in this so 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.210
 chrome it's very simple you're going 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.189
 redirect to the same place as me in 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.350
 the video so as you could you 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.819
 I'll call it the 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.429
 toilet but I do not think it's 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:10.920
 really a short outcry you're going to go 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.250
 in this kind of two small parts 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.810
 you will manage to fall into a hole 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.299
 and when you fell into the 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.670
 hole are you going to go in a so four 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.170
 men so a little secret room and 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.849
 when you are in this room you 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.799
 make barriers we live all around 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.230
 from you no matter where you are 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.700
 or rather when you go on the wall 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.959
 right for example the zombies are all going 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.760
 right when you go on the wall of 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.319
 before they have 12 in front brief they are 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.000
 really attracted to you alone 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.329
 disadvantage is that you can not 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.430
 really kill them very easily because the 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:43.950
 wall is too thick and so you can 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.109
 only make them a few small 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.299
 small damage from time to time but 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.890
 here is no more brief once in there 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.450
 but you are totally idiot I 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.280
 repeat you are in a magnificent 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.230
 sicre and rom you can see a beam 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.310
 lama through seven cycles and room so 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.260
 I personally think it's really 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.560
 very very pretty you really see any 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.120
 the map the details etc etc 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.609
 so here I think I've said everything for 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.859
 this video if you liked this glitch 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.329
