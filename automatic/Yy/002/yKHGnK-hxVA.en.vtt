time and lost scoring record potentially

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.110 
time and lost scoring record potentially
and<00:00:58.440> when<00:00:58.680> winning<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.129> sinless<00:00:59.370> player<00:00:59.820> of<00:01:00.030> all

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.630 
and when winning a sinless player of all
times<00:01:00.500> you<00:01:01.500> have<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.829> chance<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.250> do<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.579> a

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
times you have a chance to do that in a

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.520 
times you have a chance to do that in a
galaxy<00:01:03.030> uniform<00:01:03.449> now<00:01:04.070> that<00:01:05.070> would<00:01:05.250> be<00:01:05.400> ideal<00:01:05.549> I

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
galaxy uniform now that would be ideal I

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.929 
galaxy uniform now that would be ideal I
think<00:01:07.530> if<00:01:08.010> I'm<00:01:08.189> going<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.369> be<00:01:08.460> here<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.670> few<00:01:08.760> more

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
think if I'm going to be here a few more

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.429 
think if I'm going to be here a few more
years<00:01:09.240> there's<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.659> probably<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.200> pretty<00:01:10.320> good

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
years there's a probably a pretty good

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.980 
years there's a probably a pretty good
chance<00:01:10.740> I'll<00:01:11.010> score<00:01:11.310> five<00:01:12.299> more<00:01:12.540> goals<00:01:13.460> the

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
chance I'll score five more goals the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.870 
chance I'll score five more goals the
winning<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.200> MLS<00:01:16.530> Cup<00:01:16.740> would<00:01:16.979> be<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.460> dream<00:01:17.700> I

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
winning and MLS Cup would be the dream I

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.640 
winning and MLS Cup would be the dream I
would<00:01:18.509> love<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.720> win<00:01:19.049> another<00:01:19.259> championship

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
would love to win another championship

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.789 
would love to win another championship
or<00:01:20.250> two<00:01:20.430> or<00:01:20.700> three<00:01:20.970> or<00:01:21.240> more<00:01:21.600> potentially<00:01:22.500> here

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
or two or three or more potentially here

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.969 
or two or three or more potentially here
if<00:01:23.750> we<00:01:24.750> have<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.080> opportunity<00:01:25.380> which<00:01:25.830> I

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
if we have that opportunity which I

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.249 
if we have that opportunity which I
think<00:01:26.189> we<00:01:26.340> do<00:01:26.520> we're<00:01:27.509> going<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.659> go<00:01:27.840> for<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.200> and

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
think we do we're going to go for it and

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.230 
think we do we're going to go for it and
we'll<00:01:28.979> see<00:01:29.130> what<00:01:29.280> happens<00:01:29.369> but<00:01:29.729> it's

so we can focus on what's really
important<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:44.970> we're<00:01:45.950> in<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.040> good<00:01:47.189> place

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
important and we're in a good place

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.859 
important and we're in a good place
right<00:01:47.610> now<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.850> think<00:01:47.970> our<00:01:48.240> team's<00:01:48.450> starting<00:01:48.810> to

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
right now I think our team's starting to

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.840 
right now I think our team's starting to
play<00:01:49.110> very<00:01:49.350> well<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.890> we<00:01:50.130> head<00:01:50.310> into<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.610> last

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850
