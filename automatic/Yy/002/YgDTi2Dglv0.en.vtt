that<00:03:52.970> it's<00:03:53.420> really<00:03:53.780> important<00:03:54.230> it<00:03:54.620> might<00:03:54.800> seem

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
that it's really important it might seem

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.680 
that it's really important it might seem
kind<00:03:55.370> of<00:03:55.430> meaningless<00:03:55.730> but<00:03:56.150> at<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:56.510> end<00:03:56.540> of

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
kind of meaningless but at the end of

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.180 
kind of meaningless but at the end of
the<00:03:56.780> day<00:03:56.930> you<00:03:57.500> know<00:03:57.590> if<00:03:57.709> it<00:03:57.800> helps<00:03:57.980> you<00:03:58.010> get<00:03:58.130> a

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
the day you know if it helps you get a

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.220 
the day you know if it helps you get a
kill<00:03:58.430> and<00:03:58.459> went<00:03:58.730> around<00:03:58.959> it's<00:03:59.959> really

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
kill and went around it's really

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.620 
kill and went around it's really
important<00:04:00.590> so<00:04:00.770> right<00:04:01.610> there<00:04:01.820> I<00:04:02.090> was<00:04:02.300> in<00:04:02.420> a<00:04:02.480> one

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
important so right there I was in a one

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.420 
important so right there I was in a one
be<00:04:02.780> three<00:04:02.959> situation<00:04:03.620> I<00:04:03.680> was<00:04:03.739> taken<00:04:04.070> out<00:04:04.190> from

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
be three situation I was taken out from

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.310 
be three situation I was taken out from
main<00:04:04.700> stage<00:04:05.030> wasn't<00:04:05.810> much<00:04:05.900> I<00:04:06.050> can<00:04:06.200> do<00:04:06.290> right

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
main stage wasn't much I can do right

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.010 
main stage wasn't much I can do right
there<00:04:06.709> there<00:04:07.370> was<00:04:07.459> a<00:04:07.489> minute<00:04:07.760> and<00:04:07.820> a<00:04:07.880> half<00:04:08.020> in

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
there there was a minute and a half in

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.990 
there there was a minute and a half in
each<00:04:09.260> round<00:04:09.290> now<00:04:09.800> after<00:04:10.250> the<00:04:10.340> rules<00:04:10.550> update

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
each round now after the rules update

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.300 
each round now after the rules update
and<00:04:11.209> I<00:04:11.690> believe<00:04:11.959> there<00:04:12.170> was<00:04:12.290> like<00:04:12.620> 30<00:04:12.860> seconds

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
and I believe there was like 30 seconds

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.550 
and I believe there was like 30 seconds
left<00:04:13.550> when<00:04:13.730> I<00:04:13.760> died<00:04:14.090> right<00:04:14.360> there<00:04:14.570> so<00:04:14.900> I<00:04:14.930> had<00:04:15.530> to

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
left when I died right there so I had to

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.349 
left when I died right there so I had to
really<00:04:15.860> push<00:04:16.130> it<00:04:16.310> go<00:04:16.520> for<00:04:16.700> the<00:04:16.790> bomb<00:04:16.940> try<00:04:17.239> and

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
really push it go for the bomb try and

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.690 
really push it go for the bomb try and
plant<00:04:17.570> something<00:04:17.840> and<00:04:18.200> I<00:04:18.859> was<00:04:19.010> taken<00:04:19.340> out<00:04:19.459> so

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
plant something and I was taken out so

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.300 
plant something and I was taken out so
the<00:04:20.570> first<00:04:20.840> one<00:04:21.020> round<00:04:21.440> I<00:04:21.590> went<00:04:21.770> inside<00:04:22.130> the

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
the first one round I went inside the

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.100 
the first one round I went inside the
door<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:23.090> second<00:04:23.479> round<00:04:23.570> I<00:04:23.840> pushed<00:04:24.260> up<00:04:24.500> around

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
door the second round I pushed up around

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.719 
door the second round I pushed up around
and<00:04:25.530> then<00:04:25.620> that<00:04:25.740> time<00:04:25.979> I<00:04:26.009> kind<00:04:26.219> of<00:04:26.340> just<00:04:26.490> poked

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
and then that time I kind of just poked

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:28.610 
and then that time I kind of just poked
my<00:04:26.909> head<00:04:27.030> out<00:04:27.090> saw<00:04:27.449> if<00:04:27.629> anyone<00:04:28.020> was<00:04:28.229> going<00:04:28.439> to

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
my head out saw if anyone was going to

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.679 
my head out saw if anyone was going to
rush<00:04:28.830> and<00:04:29.069> then<00:04:29.610> I<00:04:29.639> went<00:04:29.819> on<00:04:29.939> this<00:04:30.090> planter<00:04:30.659> and

00:04:30.679 --> 00:04:30.689 
rush and then I went on this planter and

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:32.689 
rush and then I went on this planter and
watched<00:04:31.259> both<00:04:31.650> jail<00:04:31.979> side<00:04:32.250> do<00:04:32.430> that<00:04:32.580> little

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
watched both jail side do that little

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:35.119 
watched both jail side do that little
crack<00:04:33.060> and<00:04:33.389> I<00:04:33.870> watched<00:04:34.110> trees<00:04:34.590> or<00:04:34.800> golden

00:04:35.119 --> 00:04:35.129 
crack and I watched trees or golden

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:37.189 
crack and I watched trees or golden
arches<00:04:35.430> straight<00:04:35.759> ahead<00:04:35.879> of<00:04:36.120> me<00:04:36.210> now<00:04:36.419> sitting

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
arches straight ahead of me now sitting

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:38.629

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
around so i got the call out that the

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.529 
around so i got the call out that the
