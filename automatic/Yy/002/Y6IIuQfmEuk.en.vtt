console<00:01:21.150> versions<00:01:21.420> because<00:01:21.600> every<00:01:21.780> update<00:01:21.900> so

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
console versions because every update so

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.719 
console versions because every update so
far<00:01:22.470> has<00:01:22.619> moved<00:01:22.830> forward<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.130> not<00:01:23.250> playing<00:01:23.520> one

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
far has moved forward to not playing one

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.670 
far has moved forward to not playing one
from<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.060> PC<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.540> that's<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.500> know<00:01:25.590> just

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
from the PC and that's you know just

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.530 
from the PC and that's you know just
been<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> tried-and-true<00:01:26.790> formula<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.450> we

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
been a tried-and-true formula and we

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.609 
been a tried-and-true formula and we
figured<00:01:27.869> it'd<00:01:28.020> be<00:01:28.049> good<00:01:28.140> moving<00:01:28.350> up<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.530> one

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
figured it'd be good moving up to one

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.440 
figured it'd be good moving up to one
point<00:01:28.829> for<00:01:29.009> next<00:01:29.189> however<00:01:29.790> instead<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.329> just

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
point for next however instead of just

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.240 
point for next however instead of just
doing<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.840> or<00:01:31.049> even<00:01:31.170> 1.5<00:01:31.890> which<00:01:32.040> was<00:01:32.220> a

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
doing that or even 1.5 which was a

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.469 
doing that or even 1.5 which was a
theory<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.610> I've<00:01:32.790> actually<00:01:32.939> got<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.210> video

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
theory that I've actually got a video

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.030 
theory that I've actually got a video
ready<00:01:33.720> for<00:01:33.990> they're<00:01:34.530> now<00:01:34.740> gonna<00:01:34.890> have<00:01:34.979> to

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
ready for they're now gonna have to

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.260 
ready for they're now gonna have to
cancel<00:01:35.220> but<00:01:35.549> yeah<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.759> figured<00:01:36.119> they'd<00:01:36.240> be

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
cancel but yeah I figured they'd be

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.850 
cancel but yeah I figured they'd be
going<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.720> redstone<00:01:37.079> update<00:01:37.409> potentially

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
going to the redstone update potentially

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.319 
going to the redstone update potentially
to<00:01:38.159> make<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.310> big<00:01:38.549> update<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.939> make<00:01:39.060> up<00:01:39.210> to

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
to make a big update to make up to

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.520 
to make a big update to make up to
everyone<00:01:39.570> but<00:01:39.900> they're<00:01:40.079> going<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.470> step

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
everyone but they're going a step

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.249 
everyone but they're going a step
further<00:01:40.860> than<00:01:41.460> even<00:01:41.909> like<00:01:42.119> my<00:01:42.450> weird<00:01:42.930> theory

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
further than even like my weird theory

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.749 
further than even like my weird theory
predicted<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.920> they're<00:01:44.189> going<00:01:44.340> all<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.729> way

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
predicted and they're going all the way

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.910 
predicted and they're going all the way
up<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.030> 1.6<00:01:45.720> for<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:45.990> PC<00:01:46.350> which<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.710> horse

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
up to 1.6 for the PC which is the horse

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.100

update so horses donkeys mules all the
other<00:02:07.649> 1.6<00:02:08.429> features<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.030> it's<00:02:09.420> going<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.780> be

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
other 1.6 features and it's going to be

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.530 
other 1.6 features and it's going to be
an<00:02:09.989> absolutely<00:02:10.770> massive<00:02:11.459> update<00:02:11.849> also<00:02:12.360> um

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
an absolutely massive update also um

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.370 
an absolutely massive update also um
just<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.900> few<00:02:13.110> cool

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
just a few cool

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.960 
just a few cool
things<00:02:13.500> I<00:02:13.590> think<00:02:13.650> is<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.340> fact<00:02:14.640> that<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.850> can

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
things I think is the fact that you can

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.460 
things I think is the fact that you can
extra<00:02:15.330> help<00:02:15.510> with<00:02:15.720> grown<00:02:15.930> apples<00:02:16.110> instead

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
extra help with grown apples instead

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.080 
extra help with grown apples instead
just<00:02:16.650> getting<00:02:16.890> fast<00:02:17.070> regeneration<00:02:17.520> that's

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
just getting fast regeneration that's

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.910 
just getting fast regeneration that's
hard<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.450> clay<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.750> stained<00:02:19.290> clay<00:02:19.590> there's

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
hard and clay the stained clay there's

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.340 
hard and clay the stained clay there's
blocks<00:02:20.250> of<00:02:20.460> clay<00:02:20.640> there's<00:02:21.360> just<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:21.990> much

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
blocks of clay there's just so much

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.010 
blocks of clay there's just so much
massive<00:02:23.130> stuff<00:02:23.430> coming<00:02:23.820> and<00:02:23.970> it's<00:02:24.360> not<00:02:24.570> really

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
massive stuff coming and it's not really

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.230 
massive stuff coming and it's not really
really<00:02:25.440> exciting<00:02:25.980> updates<00:02:26.340> so<00:02:26.580> when<00:02:27.090> is<00:02:27.210> it

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
really exciting updates so when is it

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.390 
really exciting updates so when is it
coming<00:02:27.690> roughly<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:28.560> is<00:02:28.920> this<00:02:29.100> gonna<00:02:29.250> be<00:02:29.370> a

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
coming roughly and is this gonna be a

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.530 
coming roughly and is this gonna be a
good<00:02:29.550> thing<00:02:29.670> so<00:02:29.730> first<00:02:30.030> of<00:02:30.090> all<00:02:30.120> it's<00:02:30.270> gonna<00:02:30.390> be

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
good thing so first of all it's gonna be

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.450 
good thing so first of all it's gonna be
a<00:02:30.570> good<00:02:31.020> thing<00:02:31.230> if<00:02:31.470> they<00:02:31.740> can<00:02:32.010> get<00:02:32.190> this<00:02:32.280> out

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
a good thing if they can get this out

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.090 
a good thing if they can get this out
within<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.240> next<00:02:33.450> like<00:02:33.690> few<00:02:34.290> sort<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:34.740> months

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
within the next like few sort of months

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.010 
within the next like few sort of months
so<00:02:35.250> we're<00:02:35.400> talking<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.910> next<00:02:36.240> like<00:02:36.420> let's<00:02:36.840> say

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
so we're talking the next like let's say

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.740 
so we're talking the next like let's say
before<00:02:37.830> March<00:02:38.580> of<00:02:38.730> next<00:02:38.880> year<00:02:39.030> so<00:02:39.330> it's<00:02:39.480> not<00:02:39.540> a

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
before March of next year so it's not a

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.330 
before March of next year so it's not a
year<00:02:40.050> vow<00:02:40.200> an<00:02:40.320> update<00:02:40.620> that<00:02:41.040> would<00:02:41.190> be

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
year vow an update that would be

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.040 
year vow an update that would be
absolutely<00:02:41.640> massive<00:02:42.270> because<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:42.690> means<00:02:42.870> that

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
absolutely massive because it means that

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.960 
absolutely massive because it means that
Microsoft<00:02:43.740> bought<00:02:43.890> Mojang<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.520> they<00:02:44.790> did<00:02:44.940> a

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
Microsoft bought Mojang and they did a

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.250

we'll have to see how that works works
out<00:03:09.870> that<00:03:10.200> would<00:03:10.350> take<00:03:10.500> us<00:03:10.650> from<00:03:10.710> being<00:03:11.010> five

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
out that would take us from being five

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.440 
they had a whole bunch of redstone
things<00:04:05.310> so<00:04:05.490> you<00:04:05.550> could<00:04:05.760> make<00:04:05.880> really<00:04:06.150> complex

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
things so you could make really complex

redstone<00:04:06.870> circuits<00:04:07.320> in<00:04:07.590> if<00:04:07.770> you<00:04:07.830> don't<00:04:08.040> like

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
redstone circuits in if you don't like

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.710 
redstone circuits in if you don't like
redstone<00:04:08.640> it's<00:04:08.850> cool<00:04:09.090> because<00:04:09.270> they're<00:04:09.570> stuff

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
redstone it's cool because they're stuff

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.270 
redstone it's cool because they're stuff
like<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:09.959> daylight<00:04:10.320> sensor<00:04:10.680> which<00:04:10.830> is<00:04:10.860> simple

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
like the daylight sensor which is simple

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.340 
like the daylight sensor which is simple
to<00:04:11.370> use<00:04:11.550> when<00:04:11.790> it's<00:04:11.940> day<00:04:12.150> it's<00:04:12.600> a<00:04:12.750> full<00:04:12.959> signal

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
to use when it's day it's a full signal

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.810 
to use when it's day it's a full signal
when<00:04:13.470> it's<00:04:13.620> night<00:04:13.860> it<00:04:13.980> turns<00:04:14.220> off<00:04:14.430> and<00:04:14.640> it

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
when it's night it turns off and it

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:15.980 
when it's night it turns off and it
means<00:04:14.910> you<00:04:15.030> can<00:04:15.120> have<00:04:15.209> a<00:04:15.270> house<00:04:15.480> that<00:04:15.690> lights

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
means you can have a house that lights

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.180 
means you can have a house that lights
up<00:04:16.230> when<00:04:16.380> it<00:04:16.500> turns<00:04:16.709> there<00:04:16.980> you<00:04:17.100> know

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
up when it turns there you know

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.620 
up when it turns there you know
nighttime<00:04:17.670> and<00:04:17.910> you<00:04:17.970> can<00:04:18.120> do<00:04:18.239> a<00:04:18.270> whole<00:04:18.420> bunch

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
nighttime and you can do a whole bunch

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.720 
nighttime and you can do a whole bunch
of<00:04:18.720> cool<00:04:18.870> things<00:04:19.080> like<00:04:19.260> that<00:04:19.590> you<00:04:20.520> know<00:04:20.609> as

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
of cool things like that you know as

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:21.920 
of cool things like that you know as
well<00:04:20.880> as<00:04:20.910> that<00:04:21.120> they<00:04:21.270> change<00:04:21.540> the<00:04:21.660> redstone

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
well as that they change the redstone

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.570 
well as that they change the redstone
system<00:04:22.260> make<00:04:22.410> it<00:04:22.530> analog<00:04:22.890> which<00:04:23.070> means<00:04:23.340> a

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
system make it analog which means a

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.830 
system make it analog which means a
whole<00:04:23.729> bunch<00:04:23.940> of<00:04:23.970> our<00:04:24.090> resident<00:04:24.450> creations

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
whole bunch of our resident creations

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.090 
whole bunch of our resident creations
but<00:04:25.229> again<00:04:25.470> if<00:04:25.590> you<00:04:25.680> know<00:04:25.770> interests<00:04:26.040> in

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
but again if you know interests in

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.129 
but again if you know interests in
redstone<00:04:26.490> then<00:04:26.700> it<00:04:26.820> also

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
redstone then it also

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:28.719 
redstone then it also
brought<00:04:27.319> the<00:04:27.469> fact<00:04:27.650> that<00:04:27.740> slimes<00:04:28.189> can<00:04:28.460> spawn

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
brought the fact that slimes can spawn

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.640 
brought the fact that slimes can spawn
in<00:04:28.939> swamps<00:04:29.330> and<00:04:29.449> the<00:04:29.509> redstone<00:04:30.199> block<00:04:30.439> which

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
in swamps and the redstone block which

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:31.989 
in swamps and the redstone block which
is<00:04:30.800> a<00:04:30.830> cool<00:04:31.069> way<00:04:31.159> to<00:04:31.189> use<00:04:31.310> redstone<00:04:31.729> because<00:04:31.879> it

00:04:31.989 --> 00:04:31.999 
is a cool way to use redstone because it

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:34.989 
is a cool way to use redstone because it
looks<00:04:32.210> cool<00:04:32.830> 1.6<00:04:33.830> brought<00:04:34.039> with<00:04:34.159> it<00:04:34.189> horses<00:04:34.849> of

00:04:34.989 --> 00:04:34.999 
looks cool 1.6 brought with it horses of

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:36.550 
looks cool 1.6 brought with it horses of
course<00:04:35.030> which<00:04:35.509> everyone<00:04:36.050> is<00:04:36.169> crazy<00:04:36.439> about

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
course which everyone is crazy about

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.550 
course which everyone is crazy about
horses<00:04:37.370> in<00:04:37.580> Minecraft<00:04:38.210> and<00:04:38.509> that<00:04:39.199> means<00:04:39.379> that

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
horses in Minecraft and that means that

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.200 
horses in Minecraft and that means that
you<00:04:39.650> could<00:04:39.770> actually<00:04:39.949> oval<00:04:40.759> free<00:04:40.909> update
