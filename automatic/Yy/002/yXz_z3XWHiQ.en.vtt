00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
that pre-production is a huge huge part

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.190 
that pre-production is a huge huge part
especially<00:01:36.180> when<00:01:36.689> you're<00:01:36.810> going<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:36.990> be<00:01:37.079> doing

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.740 
especially when you're going to be doing
a<00:01:37.439> series<00:01:37.829> now<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.880> actual<00:01:39.090> photo<00:01:39.329> shoots<00:01:39.600> and

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
a series now the actual photo shoots and

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.940 
a series now the actual photo shoots and
the<00:01:39.869> post-production<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.500> stuff<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> lot

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
the post-production that stuff is a lot

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.920 
the post-production that stuff is a lot
of<00:01:41.009> fun<00:01:41.220> pre-production<00:01:41.700> tends<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.479> be<00:01:42.570> not<00:01:42.750> as

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
of fun pre-production tends to be not as

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.080 
of fun pre-production tends to be not as
much<00:01:43.140> fun<00:01:43.200> but<00:01:43.799> spending<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.579> little<00:01:44.759> bit<00:01:44.880> more

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
much fun but spending a little bit more

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.880 
much fun but spending a little bit more
time<00:01:45.390> in<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.600> pre-production<00:01:45.930> phase<00:01:46.350> really

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
time in the pre-production phase really

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.490 
time in the pre-production phase really
does<00:01:47.100> help<00:01:47.310> out<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.329> big<00:01:48.930> lesson<00:01:49.259> here<00:01:49.409> is

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
does help out and the big lesson here is

does help out and the big lesson here is
if<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:50.040> are<00:01:50.070> going<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.490> be<00:01:50.549> shooting<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.909> series

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
if you are going to be shooting a series

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.880 
if you are going to be shooting a series
like<00:01:51.390> images<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.350> are<00:01:52.439> supposed<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.740> be

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
like images that are supposed to be

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.399 
like images that are supposed to be
coming<00:01:53.700> together<00:01:53.880> make<00:01:54.540> sure<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.840> each<00:01:55.049> one

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
coming together make sure that each one

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.280 
coming together make sure that each one
of<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.590> images<00:01:56.130> tells<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.149> story<00:01:57.210> on<00:01:57.659> its<00:01:58.049> own

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
of the images tells a story on its own

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.109 
of the images tells a story on its own
but<00:01:58.710> together<00:01:58.920> they<00:01:59.460> all<00:01:59.670> tell<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.000> same

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
but together they all tell the same

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.969 
but together they all tell the same
story<00:02:00.329> as<00:02:00.810> well<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.500> that's<00:02:01.590> something<00:02:01.829> that

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
story as well and that's something that

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.399 
story as well and that's something that
we<00:02:02.549> missed<00:02:02.579> we<00:02:03.090> created<00:02:03.479> each<00:02:03.659> individual

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
we missed we created each individual

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.660 
we missed we created each individual
character<00:02:04.770> each<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.130> them<00:02:05.219> telling<00:02:05.520> their<00:02:05.640> own

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
character each of them telling their own

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.089 
character each of them telling their own
story<00:02:06.000> but<00:02:06.210> together<00:02:06.600> they<00:02:07.530> didn't<00:02:07.860> really

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
story but together they didn't really

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.339 
story but together they didn't really
create<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.459> complete<00:02:08.940> story<00:02:09.239> so<00:02:09.660> if<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.170> are

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
create a complete story so if you are

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.110 
create a complete story so if you are
doing<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.739> series<00:02:11.009> make<00:02:11.190> sure<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.489> those<00:02:11.610> both

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
doing a series make sure that those both

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.760 
doing a series make sure that those both
things<00:02:12.450> are<00:02:12.629> in<00:02:12.750> place<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:13.319> know<00:02:13.440> we're

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
things are in place I know we're

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.710 
things are in place I know we're
going<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:14.070> from<00:02:14.280> here<00:02:14.460> on<00:02:14.550> out<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.540> should

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
going to from here on out and it should

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.940 
going to from here on out and it should
help<00:02:15.900> series<00:02:16.260> look<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.530> little<00:02:16.680> bit<00:02:16.830> more

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
help series look a little bit more

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.880 
help series look a little bit more
cohesive<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:17.880> keep<00:02:18.750> things<00:02:18.990> just<00:02:19.620> keep

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
cohesive and keep things just keep

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.830 
cohesive and keep things just keep
things<00:02:20.130> making<00:02:20.340> sense<00:02:20.700> quite<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:20.970> bit<00:02:21.120> more<00:02:21.270> so

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
things making sense quite a bit more so

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.780 
things making sense quite a bit more so
our<00:02:21.960> final<00:02:22.140> decision<00:02:22.680> was<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:22.950> basically<00:02:23.070> take

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
our final decision was to basically take

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.400 
our final decision was to basically take
out<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.060> couple<00:02:24.360> of<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.600> characters<00:02:24.960> and<00:02:25.200> just

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
out a couple of the characters and just

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.900 
out a couple of the characters and just
leave<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.770> characters<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:26.370> actually<00:02:26.700> made

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
leave the characters that actually made

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.640 
leave the characters that actually made
sense<00:02:26.940> together<00:02:27.420> which<00:02:28.050> left<00:02:28.290> us<00:02:28.410> with<00:02:28.620> a

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
sense together which left us with a

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.070 
sense together which left us with a
slightly<00:02:29.310> smaller<00:02:29.550> series<00:02:30.210> but<00:02:30.390> one<00:02:30.630> we<00:02:30.840> felt

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
slightly smaller series but one we felt

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.230 
slightly smaller series but one we felt
was<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.350> little<00:02:31.590> more<00:02:31.680> cohesive<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.400> we're<00:02:33.150> not

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
was a little more cohesive and we're not

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.580 
was a little more cohesive and we're not
sure<00:02:33.390> this<00:02:33.540> was<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.750> right<00:02:33.870> answer<00:02:33.990> though<00:02:34.350> so

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
sure this was the right answer though so

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.990 
sure this was the right answer though so
what<00:02:34.830> do<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:35.010> guys<00:02:35.130> what<00:02:35.610> would<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.880> have

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
done like would you have left all the

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.930
