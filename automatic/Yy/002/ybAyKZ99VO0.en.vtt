00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
been released its unreleased but it'd be

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.190

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.140 
very nice to see micro cons really
implement<00:01:25.770> this<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.250> game<00:01:26.490> um<00:01:26.729> they<00:01:26.939> did

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
implement this in the game um they did

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.149 
implement this in the game um they did
find<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.509> in<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.750> code<00:01:28.049> or<00:01:28.259> some<00:01:28.590> sort<00:01:28.920> so

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
find this in the code or some sort so

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.380 
find this in the code or some sort so
that's<00:01:29.400> why<00:01:29.579> it's<00:01:29.759> in<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.970> game<00:01:30.150> right<00:01:30.329> now

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
that's why it's in the game right now

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.630 
that's why it's in the game right now
because<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.259> can't<00:01:31.500> actually<00:01:31.680> mod<00:01:32.130> camels

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
because you can't actually mod camels

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.789 
because you can't actually mod camels
into<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.030> game<00:01:33.240> I'm<00:01:33.479> not<00:01:33.659> sure<00:01:33.960> anyways<00:01:34.439> but

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
into the game I'm not sure anyways but

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.319
