00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:28.429 
different careers that except from level

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:30.279 
different careers that except from level
to<00:01:28.520> level<00:01:28.550> I<00:01:28.850> mean<00:01:29.030> what's<00:01:29.690> most<00:01:29.959> of<00:01:30.050> them<00:01:30.140> is

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
to level I mean what's most of them is

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:31.690 
to level I mean what's most of them is
right<00:01:30.560> here<00:01:30.709> who<00:01:30.830> can<00:01:30.979> we<00:01:31.099> expect<00:01:31.340> some<00:01:31.520> black

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
right here who can we expect some black

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.370 
right here who can we expect some black
ops<00:01:31.910> that<00:01:32.179> is<00:01:32.360> you<00:01:32.630> know<00:01:32.660> that's<00:01:33.259> actually

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
ops that is you know that's actually

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.570 
ops that is you know that's actually
something<00:01:33.619> we've<00:01:33.830> been<00:01:33.860> going<00:01:34.099> for<00:01:34.160> level

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
something we've been going for level

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.999 
something we've been going for level
variety<00:01:35.030> so<00:01:35.239> pacing<00:01:35.780> in<00:01:35.869> this<00:01:36.050> there's<00:01:36.709> a<00:01:36.800> set

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
variety so pacing in this there's a set

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.460 
variety so pacing in this there's a set
up<00:01:37.130> here<00:01:37.369> obviously<00:01:37.660> completely<00:01:38.660> different

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
up here obviously completely different

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.290 
up here obviously completely different
than<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:39.679> all-out<00:01:39.860> action<00:01:40.069> he<00:01:40.520> just<00:01:40.729> you<00:01:41.119> saw

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
than the all-out action he just you saw

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.419 
than the all-out action he just you saw
with<00:01:41.479> payback<00:01:41.840> earlier<00:01:42.229> so<00:01:43.099> we're<00:01:43.220> doing<00:01:43.280> the

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
with payback earlier so we're doing the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:45.070 
with payback earlier so we're doing the
setup<00:01:43.729> here<00:01:43.970> and<00:01:44.119> you're<00:01:44.509> controlling<00:01:44.899> this

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
setup here and you're controlling this

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.620 
setup here and you're controlling this
squad<00:01:45.380> but<00:01:45.619> then<00:01:45.860> in<00:01:46.069> a<00:01:47.000> couple<00:01:47.119> of<00:01:47.300> seconds

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
squad but then in a couple of seconds

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.460 
squad but then in a couple of seconds
what<00:01:47.720> we're<00:01:47.810> going<00:01:47.899> to<00:01:47.989> do<00:01:48.050> is<00:01:48.140> going<00:01:48.289> to<00:01:48.349> bring

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
this roster i like to think that but

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.740 
this roster i like to think that but
what<00:03:34.790> you<00:03:34.909> can't<00:03:35.120> watch<00:03:35.239> which<00:03:35.540> you<00:03:35.629> don't

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
what you can't watch which you don't

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.300 
what you can't watch which you don't
expect<00:03:35.900> is<00:03:36.379> you<00:03:36.919> know<00:03:37.009> these<00:03:37.129> black

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310

expect is you know these black
operations<00:03:37.849> unit<00:03:38.030> they<00:03:38.209> could<00:03:38.389> they<00:03:38.750> could

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
operations unit they could they could

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.629 
operations unit they could they could
outfit<00:03:39.229> themselves<00:03:39.829> and<00:03:39.979> they<00:03:40.129> would<00:03:40.250> have

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:40.639 
outfit themselves and they would have

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.960 
outfit themselves and they would have
modified<00:03:41.060> weaponry<00:03:41.840> and<00:03:42.169> an<00:03:42.620> ammo<00:03:42.859> this<00:03:43.849> is
