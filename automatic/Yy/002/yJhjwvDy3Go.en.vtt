00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:11.400
 hi guys I hope you go 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:14.099
 well cushy fishing here then isie 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.210
 is on 4 4 wonderful guys game 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:21.199
 again because here is there is 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.029
 no murderer everyone plays 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.619
 here is not just a few 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.109
 accessories on men it's simple 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.710
 but it's good this season 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:34.860
 this is the base for me so that's it 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.890
 is going to be a small 30 of a strict the 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.510
 nuclear addition to the nuclear on this game 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.760
 who literally explodes map 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.710
 match executive positions because I 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.800
 thought they do not know I'm 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.920
 also a way to tell a little a 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.530
 little mans are there a little lie on 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.449
 will say that like that so 30 registered 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.570
 which is not bad the only one point 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.300
 negative guys the only negative point 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:05.729
 it is that your series does not renew itself 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:07.380
 renew it waited it renews not by 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.700
 example on black ops of you have to 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.409
 return to the mooring micro up 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.060
 after that goes back drones rhÃ´ne voyage 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.130
 micro what are you going on from kiel and 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.490
 you can not do that meal but on 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.409
 that one 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.780
 here you have it once in your 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.189
 life too cute strict it's not bad 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.540
 so I was accompanied by scissors 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.220
 dedication to thoissey but who did my 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.320
 little mountain his chain that is in 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.000
 the description of the fitting in the neck 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.740
 in 46 seconds 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.770
 by the way who is who has you far more 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.329
 that there are some who have finally 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.650
 pasta unless they want before 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.329
 very unique in 47 seconds 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.030
 he had not seen it on my gameplay in 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.770
 did it so I preferred to put to 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.570
 especially since it's still a 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.119
 second record I put that it's not for 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.040
 to be pretentious Libyan it's this 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.540
 fastest planet to the same 13 but 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.560
 I did not say my stockings 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.600
 finally a little 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.799
 for me assault rifle treat me these 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.409
 similarities but it's true that by 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:03.280
 example a uc snipe for 30 we go 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.600
 to say anything that's it it's not 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.860
 like to play it's just playing 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.750
 with a treat finally brief here is a 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.130
 odds 4 I think if you like them 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.140
 guys I think I'm going to pack you up 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.950
 it's because I honestly think of 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.470
 enjoy playing this game there I take 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.420
 frankly not mw3 so m doubled too 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.880
 guys I'm trying to treat him 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.230
 small live I fall with glandus 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.709
 already it starts there but it's not 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.750
 it's the worst 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:33.190
 what is small balls species 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:37.690
 schilb isa the guy 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:40.060
 in fact we cross 3d night two of him 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.130
 time it happened to me he pulls in the scope 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.019
 melee with his stack but you 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.330
 not on your screen, you see your time 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.190
 you followed but still I 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.540
 the habit of playing aggressive to be at 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.799
 melee with the enemies so you 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.810
 take me back normally I'm on the 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.340
 dude I can not be next you shoot 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.410
 but the guy who takes nothing and he they te 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.989
 kill like that a lot of butch like that 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.760
 on w3 I tell myself that by meter of me 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.410
 because he a little disgusted me but I 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.340
 think I wanted to go here are our stockings 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.150
 mpda his friendly the ump 45 that does not want 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.600
 believe in 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.220
 a pretty face and lacquer 47 a 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.700
 beautiful but look at me mouth 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.440
 tears 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.690
 it is frankly it is violent I 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.040
 does so like the series quietly 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.510
 the only problem is that there was the 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.209
 not too many people I have in there against 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.950
 I shredded a few files 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.910
 6 and Thursday at the step right at no 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.380
 right of the as you like 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.450
 because it's a little shit what 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.650
 if there is no euro but I did 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.910
 that back and forth like that so the 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.190
 spo changes are not on that one there 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.750
 no need to be six months that's what 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.180
 is good too 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.810
 and behold the magnificent welcome the 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.810

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.020
 that's all that is to say guys 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.470
 that's all there is to say 30 gun 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.880
 strict 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.020
 after I have one of the layers during the 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.090
 part without that I want rhÃ©nus the 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.950
 entire part but there's no worries 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.790
 I know why the beach and peel 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:02.330
 first generation there a little more I 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:05.210
 think it's the console if my pc there 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.490
 still has the internet and by hec not finally 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:10.700
 brief and also at the level of the maps sure that 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.960
 in four ways I'll talk about it again 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.300
 it was real maps where there were 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.860
 real precious look it's not the 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.209
 latest games the vod and where there is no 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.650
 pre shoot after schouppe de re 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.000
 must walk a quarter of an hour not there 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.830
 it's price drop you walk five 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.570
 seconds that arrive for the r &amp; d all 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.550
 and the maps is vaulted work except in 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.890
 Anything short I hope this video
