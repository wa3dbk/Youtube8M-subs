other thing that makes this really nice
is<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.390> compact<00:00:33.989> size<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.949> it's<00:00:35.129> less<00:00:35.370> weight

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
is this compact size so it's less weight

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.119 
is this compact size so it's less weight
smaller<00:00:36.449> size<00:00:36.750> it's<00:00:37.170> easy<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.530> control<00:00:37.800> you

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
smaller size it's easy to control you

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.710 
smaller size it's easy to control you
can<00:00:38.309> get<00:00:38.430> into<00:00:38.640> all<00:00:38.820> kinds<00:00:39.150> of<00:00:39.239> areas<00:00:39.420> on<00:00:39.629> the

couple other things about this it's got
a<00:00:43.320> built<00:00:43.650> in<00:00:43.830> forward<00:00:44.309> grip<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.150> lot<00:00:45.360> of

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:45.479 
a built in forward grip so a lot of

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:47.090 
a built in forward grip so a lot of
times<00:00:45.659> when<00:00:45.809> I'm<00:00:45.930> using<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.409> rotary<00:00:46.559> buffer<00:00:46.769> I

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
times when I'm using a rotary buffer I

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.950 
times when I'm using a rotary buffer I
don't<00:00:47.339> want<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.550> use<00:00:47.699> the<00:00:47.879> handle<00:00:48.330> so<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.780> like

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
don't want to use the handle so I like

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.630 
don't want to use the handle so I like
to<00:00:49.050> take<00:00:49.199> the<00:00:49.320> handle<00:00:49.680> off<00:00:49.800> put<00:00:50.280> my<00:00:50.400> hand<00:00:50.580> right

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
to take the handle off put my hand right

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.860 
to take the handle off put my hand right
up<00:00:50.879> here<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.120> grip<00:00:51.269> it<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.659> way<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.780> can

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
up here and grip it and that way I can

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.570 
up here and grip it and that way I can
put<00:00:52.019> all<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.500> pressure<00:00:52.680> right<00:00:53.129> down<00:00:53.309> over<00:00:53.430> the

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
put all the pressure right down over the

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.039 
put all the pressure right down over the
head<00:00:53.729> and<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:53.970> gives<00:00:54.089> me<00:00:54.210> awesome<00:00:54.690> control

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:55.049 
head and it gives me awesome control

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:57.500 
head and it gives me awesome control
over<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.440> tool<00:00:55.650> as<00:00:55.830> I'm<00:00:56.430> buffing<00:00:56.820> out<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.030> car

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
over the tool as I'm buffing out a car

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.210 
over the tool as I'm buffing out a car
another<00:00:57.930> thing<00:00:58.229> is<00:00:58.320> they've<00:00:58.470> taken<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.010> the

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
another thing is they've taken the the

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.219 
another thing is they've taken the the
mech<00:00:59.549> the<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.089> gear<00:01:00.269> head<00:01:00.510> lock<00:01:00.720> right<00:01:00.989> here

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:01.229 
mech the the gear head lock right here

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:03.259 
mech the the gear head lock right here
they've<00:01:01.620> moved<00:01:01.860> it<00:01:02.100> back<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.729> lot<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:02.970> rotary

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
they've moved it back so a lot of rotary

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.000 
they've moved it back so a lot of rotary
buffers<00:01:03.570> have<00:01:03.720> it<00:01:03.839> up<00:01:03.930> here<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.559> if<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.739> try

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
buffers have it up here and if you try

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.219 
buffers have it up here and if you try
to<00:01:05.070> use<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.280> by<00:01:05.519> hand<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.690> actually<00:01:07.049> engage

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
to use it by hand you actually engage

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.200 
to use it by hand you actually engage
the<00:01:07.740> lock<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.280> can<00:01:08.430> hear<00:01:08.610> some<00:01:08.760> grinding

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
the lock and you can hear some grinding

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.760 
the lock and you can hear some grinding
sounds<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:09.810> has<00:01:09.960> been<00:01:10.170> moved<00:01:10.409> back<00:01:10.530> it's

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
sounds so this has been moved back it's

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.859 
sounds so this has been moved back it's
a<00:01:10.799> great<00:01:10.979> idea<00:01:11.159> now<00:01:11.880> one<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.360> problems

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
a great idea now one of the problems

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.930 
a great idea now one of the problems
with<00:01:12.990> small<00:01:13.560> rotary<00:01:13.920> buffers<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.490> they<00:01:14.640> tend

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
with small rotary buffers is they tend

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.749 
with small rotary buffers is they tend
to<00:01:15.060> get<00:01:15.240> hot<00:01:15.750> real<00:01:16.049> easily<00:01:16.500> especially<00:01:16.829> if<00:01:17.579> you

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
to get hot real easily especially if you

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.819 
to get hot real easily especially if you
try<00:01:17.969> to<00:01:18.030> run<00:01:18.210> them<00:01:18.359> at<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> low<00:01:18.689> speed<00:01:18.719> now<00:01:19.680> in

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:19.829 
try to run them at a low speed now in

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:21.440 
try to run them at a low speed now in
Flex<00:01:20.159> brought<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.640> tool<00:01:20.909> out<00:01:21.060> what<00:01:21.240> they<00:01:21.390> do
