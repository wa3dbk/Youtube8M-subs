 asked for more information to 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.330
 respect to our equipment, I am not 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.700
 making a video here to show 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.930
 which is the equipment that is for sale 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.960
 these are the three pots each right 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.109
 the pot of hot water half the pot 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.740
 pan of posture and filtration and the pan 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.240
 from the left is the boiling pan and this 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.770
 bomb 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.750
 the stainless steel pump that people use 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.840
 a detail here the ways we 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:46.649
 we use are all the hoses of 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:49.920
 silicone with hitch is sms the pots have 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:54.750
 temperature control one terminated 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.550
 doctor does not have a ticket 17 to show 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.379
 temperature is not really only control 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.650
 it's like a thermometer all the pots 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:09.659
 ratio by direct fire heating 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:13.530
 each pot has 3 gb 13 for heating 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:19.080
 the laying pot has an opening 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:22.200
 to take to remove the mulch and within 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.460
 here you can see the false bottom has 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.860
 two plates placed right there 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.369
 transfer between the pots is made 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:36.930
 through this pump and a pump and 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:41.159
 mail cv and through hoses of 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:44.310
 silicone with connectors here is done is 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.610
 made the right boil with exits 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.140
 sides enter 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:56.350
 for the brother the cooling system is 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:59.410
 made through three is she three 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.830
 plate coolers from the right of 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:06.160
 80 plates and the other two with the 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.490
 Yellow zinhos connectors there are 60 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:15.250
 plates we have cooled the 300 liters here 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:17.820
 boiling point from 97 100 degrees to 18 16 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.430
 degrees in approximately 21 minutes 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:27.130
 this is our fermenter is a 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:30.670
 nox 304 fermenter and on the outside and has 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:34.390
 with a styrofoam and also 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:39.270
 with this thermal blanket with the control of 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:44.350
 temperature that it triggers is 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:46.570
 represent direct refrigeration is 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:52.530
 so yellow back there to our line of 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:52.530
 gas feeding the leak
