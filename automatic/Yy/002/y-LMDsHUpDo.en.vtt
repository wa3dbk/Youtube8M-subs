00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
so let's get into this modern view

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.000 
so let's get into this modern view
pretty<00:00:07.319> much<00:00:07.470> what<00:00:07.620> i'm<00:00:07.710> going<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.890> be

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
pretty much what i'm going to be

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.860 
pretty much what i'm going to be
reviewing<00:00:08.040> is<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.820> trampoline<00:00:09.389> mod<00:00:09.599> and

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
reviewing is the trampoline mod and

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.690 
reviewing is the trampoline mod and
there<00:00:10.380> is<00:00:10.500> other<00:00:10.740> trampoline<00:00:11.250> mods<00:00:11.429> but<00:00:11.610> i

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
there is other trampoline mods but i

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.039 
there is other trampoline mods but i
think<00:00:11.910> this<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.090> definitely<00:00:12.719> one<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:12.900> the

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
think this is definitely one of the

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.320 
think this is definitely one of the
better<00:00:13.200> ones<00:00:13.320> because<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.309> its<00:00:14.429> easy<00:00:14.700> crafting

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
better ones because of its easy crafting

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.689 
better ones because of its easy crafting
recipe<00:00:15.719> it's<00:00:15.900> sort<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.289> realistic<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:17.070> takes<00:00:17.520> a

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
recipe it's sort of realistic it takes a

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.730 
recipe it's sort of realistic it takes a
little<00:00:17.940> bit<00:00:18.180> but<00:00:18.570> not<00:00:18.720> too<00:00:18.750> much<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.439> it's

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
little bit but not too much and it's

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.470 
little bit but not too much and it's
just<00:00:20.010> really<00:00:20.279> fun<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.880> looks<00:00:21.119> really

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
just really fun and looks really

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.689 
just really fun and looks really
realistic<00:00:21.840> so<00:00:22.529> this<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.189> what<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.400> looks<00:00:23.550> like

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
realistic so this is what it looks like

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.300 
realistic so this is what it looks like
when<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:23.910> place<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.300> above<00:00:24.449> ground<00:00:25.050> but<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.650> my

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
when you place it above ground but I my

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.800 
when you place it above ground but I my
personal<00:00:26.699> preference<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.180> place<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.570> below

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
personal preference to place it below

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.179 
personal preference to place it below
ground<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.380> just<00:00:28.529> have<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.710> like<00:00:28.920> in<00:00:29.070> the

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
ground and just have it like in the

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.740 
ground and just have it like in the
ground<00:00:29.369> like<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.609> did<00:00:29.789> here<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.480> can<00:00:30.570> jump

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
ground like I did here and you can jump

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.209 
ground like I did here and you can jump
really<00:00:30.960> high<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.500> know<00:00:31.590> maybe<00:00:31.830> if<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.040> want

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
really high you know maybe if you want

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.860 
really high you know maybe if you want
to<00:00:32.369> like<00:00:32.520> have<00:00:32.730> like<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.910> castle<00:00:33.660> or<00:00:33.690> something

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
to like have like a castle or something

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.080 
to like have like a castle or something
you<00:00:34.140> gotta<00:00:34.290> jump<00:00:34.950> up<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.219> second<00:00:35.610> layer<00:00:35.760> or

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
you gotta jump up to a second layer or

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.490 
you gotta jump up to a second layer or
like<00:00:36.300> if<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.600> fall<00:00:36.870> down<00:00:37.020> from<00:00:37.170> really<00:00:37.380> high

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
like if you fall down from really high

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.229 
like if you fall down from really high
you<00:00:37.559> can<00:00:37.770> land<00:00:37.950> on<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.219> there's<00:00:38.940> no<00:00:39.030> fall

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
you can land on that there's no fall

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.060 
you can land on that there's no fall
damage<00:00:39.510> when<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:39.690> hit<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:39.960> but<00:00:40.469> anyway<00:00:40.920> this

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
damage when you hit that but anyway this

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.410 
damage when you hit that but anyway this
is<00:00:41.190> how<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.370> craft<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.879> pretty<00:00:42.120> much<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.300> want

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
is how you craft it pretty much you want

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.299 
is how you craft it pretty much you want
to<00:00:42.480> put<00:00:42.600> four<00:00:42.899> iron<00:00:43.140> ingots<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.040> those

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
to put four iron ingots in those

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.610 
to put four iron ingots in those
positions<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:45.510> then<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.750> want<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.020> put<00:00:46.289> three

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
positions and then you want to put three

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.990 
positions and then you want to put three
string<00:00:46.890> on<00:00:47.039> top<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.579> will<00:00:47.730> give<00:00:47.760> you

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
string on top and that will give you

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.810 
string on top and that will give you
four<00:00:48.300> trampoline<00:00:48.870> blocks<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:50.520> am<00:00:50.670> on

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
four trampoline blocks and I am on

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.910 
four trampoline blocks and I am on
creative<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.360> it's<00:00:51.840> obviously<00:00:52.199> not<00:00:52.320> taking

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
creative so it's obviously not taking

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.860 
creative so it's obviously not taking
any<00:00:53.070> one<00:00:53.190> way<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.699> pretty<00:00:53.910> much<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.660> would

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
any one way so pretty much that would

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.779 
any one way so pretty much that would
only<00:00:55.020> give<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:56.309> much<00:00:56.489> space<00:00:56.730> for

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
only give you that much space for

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.060 
only give you that much space for
trampoline<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.510> very<00:00:57.750> small<00:00:57.960> trampoline<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:59.039> i

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
trampoline a very small trampoline so i

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.979 
trampoline a very small trampoline so i
recommend<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.760> know<00:00:59.879> maybe<00:01:00.030> i'm<00:01:00.329> just<00:01:00.539> making

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
recommend you know maybe i'm just making

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.510 
recommend you know maybe i'm just making
it<00:01:01.109> bigger<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.500> there's<00:01:01.949> not<00:01:02.070> really<00:01:02.219> too

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
that it's a freaking trampoline in

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.450 
that it's a freaking trampoline in
Minecraft<00:01:05.820> but<00:01:06.439> it's<00:01:07.439> not<00:01:07.590> much<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.070> review

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460
