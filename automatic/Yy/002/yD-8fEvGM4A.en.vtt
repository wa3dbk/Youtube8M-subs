awesome<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:57.000> wonder<00:01:57.300> how<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.480> sound<00:01:57.780> from<00:01:57.990> the

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
awesome I wonder how that sound from the

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.160 
awesome I wonder how that sound from the
camera<00:01:58.410> but<00:01:59.040> that's<00:01:59.250> awesome

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
camera but that's awesome

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:09.109 
camera but that's awesome
maybe<00:02:01.170> extraordinarily<00:02:07.850> that's<00:02:08.850> what<00:02:09.000> it's

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
maybe extraordinarily that's what it's

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.140 
maybe extraordinarily that's what it's
for<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.330> think<00:02:10.640> how<00:02:11.640> did<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:11.790> do<00:02:11.940> that

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
for I think how did I do that

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:19.730 
for I think how did I do that
or<00:02:15.740> bring<00:02:16.740> benefit<00:02:17.220> I<00:02:18.470> really<00:02:19.470> think<00:02:19.680> we

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
or bring benefit I really think we

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.770 
or bring benefit I really think we
should<00:02:19.890> have<00:02:19.980> gotten<00:02:20.160> more<00:02:20.310> than<00:02:20.370> three<00:02:20.640> balls
