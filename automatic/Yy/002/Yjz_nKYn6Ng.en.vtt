00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.950 
fingers where the neck hole is
and<00:01:54.930> then<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.439> can<00:01:55.619> make<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.799> snip<00:01:56.130> there<00:01:56.960> and

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
and then you can make a snip there and

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.300 
and then you can make a snip there and
I'm<00:01:58.049> gonna<00:01:58.170> do<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.380> same<00:01:58.530> here<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:58.829> it'll<00:01:59.189> be

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
I'm gonna do the same here so it'll be

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.120 
I'm gonna do the same here so it'll be
easy<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.939> then<00:02:00.420> I'm<00:02:00.540> going<00:02:00.780> right<00:02:01.110> down<00:02:01.409> to

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
easy and then I'm going right down to

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.010 
easy and then I'm going right down to
the<00:02:02.250> underarm<00:02:02.850> but<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.570> want<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.869> at<00:02:03.990> least

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
the underarm but you want to at least

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.289 
the underarm but you want to at least
two<00:02:04.439> inches<00:02:04.829> wider<00:02:05.579> than<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.909> underarm

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
two inches wider than the underarm

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.510 
two inches wider than the underarm
because<00:02:06.659> they<00:02:07.380> kind<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:07.979> go<00:02:08.099> down<00:02:08.130> like<00:02:08.459> that

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
because they kind of go down like that

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.199 
because they kind of go down like that
so<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:10.819> am<00:02:11.819> just<00:02:12.120> going<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.480> go<00:02:12.599> right<00:02:12.780> around<00:02:13.140> it

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
so I am just going to go right around it

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.360 
so I am just going to go right around it
like<00:02:15.209> that<00:02:15.269> as<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:15.989> can<00:02:16.170> see<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:16.739> then<00:02:17.099> what

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
like that as you can see and then what

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.390 
like that as you can see and then what
you<00:02:17.489> can<00:02:17.640> also<00:02:17.849> do<00:02:18.209> so<00:02:18.810> that<00:02:18.989> yours<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:20.280> know

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
you can also do so that yours you know

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.440 
you can also do so that yours you know
in<00:02:20.519> case<00:02:20.670> you're<00:02:20.819> not<00:02:20.940> good<00:02:21.180> at<00:02:21.209> eyeballing

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
in case you're not good at eyeballing

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.050 
in case you're not good at eyeballing
things<00:02:21.989> after<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:22.709> do<00:02:22.890> one<00:02:22.920> fold<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:23.910> in<00:02:24.030> half

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
things after you do one fold it in half

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.059 
things after you do one fold it in half
and<00:02:24.840> then<00:02:25.760> you<00:02:26.760> can<00:02:27.410> cut<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.500> again<00:02:28.769> and<00:02:28.950> now

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
and then you can cut it again and now

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.220 
and then you can cut it again and now
that<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.400> is<00:02:29.430> fold<00:02:29.790> in<00:02:29.880> half<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.450> could<00:02:30.900> kind<00:02:31.170> of

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
that it is fold in half I could kind of

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.870 
that it is fold in half I could kind of
see<00:02:31.500> my<00:02:33.170> bottom<00:02:34.170> part<00:02:34.410> isn't<00:02:34.830> that<00:02:35.010> even<00:02:35.310> I'm

do<00:03:55.110> is<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.159> turn<00:03:56.310> it<00:03:56.489> inside<00:03:57.060> inside<00:03:58.049> out<00:03:58.200> yeah

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
do is to turn it inside inside out yeah

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:03.890 
do is to turn it inside inside out yeah
inside<00:03:59.069> out<00:04:01.069> like<00:04:02.069> that<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:02.580> then<00:04:03.450> you're

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
inside out like that and then you're

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.190 
inside out like that and then you're
going<00:04:04.080> to<00:04:04.200> start<00:04:04.860> I<00:04:05.190> will<00:04:05.579> start<00:04:06.079> where<00:04:07.079> the

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
going to start I will start where the

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.589 
going to start I will start where the
seams<00:04:07.500> are<00:04:07.709> because<00:04:08.400> that's<00:04:08.760> a<00:04:08.970> more<00:04:09.299> thicker

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
seams are because that's a more thicker

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.740 
seams are because that's a more thicker
area<00:04:10.349> and<00:04:10.620> then<00:04:11.459> right<00:04:12.000> where<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.329> seams<00:04:12.569> are

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
area and then right where the seams are

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.670 
area and then right where the seams are
I'm<00:04:13.079> going<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.739> put<00:04:14.010> some<00:04:14.340> glue<00:04:15.410> close<00:04:16.410> to<00:04:16.590> the

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
I'm going to put some glue close to the

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.800 
I'm going to put some glue close to the

edge but not too close and not too much

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.909 
edge but not too close and not too much
because<00:04:19.229> it<00:04:19.350> works<00:04:19.530> pretty<00:04:19.799> good<00:04:20.389> and<00:04:21.590> then<00:04:22.590> I
