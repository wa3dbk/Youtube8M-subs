I'm just basics and we are first gonna
start<00:00:46.530> as<00:00:47.010> far<00:00:47.309> as<00:00:47.520> explaining<00:00:48.300> how<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.570> do

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
start as far as explaining how to do

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.389 
start as far as explaining how to do
this<00:00:48.930> we're<00:00:49.379> gonna<00:00:49.469> start<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.860> with<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.100> side

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
this we're gonna start it with the side

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.220 
this we're gonna start it with the side
of<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.059> birdhouse<00:00:51.329> it's<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:52.020> most

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
of this birdhouse it's the most

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.959 
of this birdhouse it's the most
difficult<00:00:52.770> part<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.219> birdhouse<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.760> build

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
difficult part of the birdhouse to build

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.020 
difficult part of the birdhouse to build
we<00:00:54.840> give<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.140> all<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.379> dimensions<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.760> back

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
we give you all the dimensions the back

part is seven and a half inches tall and

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.410 
part is seven and a half inches tall and
then<00:01:01.320> it's<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.859> bottom<00:01:02.340> section<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:03.090> four

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
then it's the bottom section is four

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.830 
then it's the bottom section is four
inches

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
inches

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.500 
inches
now<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.439> first<00:01:04.830> cut<00:01:05.369> as<00:01:05.549> far<00:01:05.820> as<00:01:05.850> width<00:01:06.240> and

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
now you first cut as far as width and

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.690 
now you first cut as far as width and
you're<00:01:07.409> probably<00:01:07.650> gonna<00:01:07.860> want<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.189> cut<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.520> so

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
you're probably gonna want to cut it so

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.789 
you're probably gonna want to cut it so
seven<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.479> half<00:01:09.510> inches<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.080> then<00:01:10.350> six

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
seven and a half inches and then six

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.460 
seven and a half inches and then six
inches<00:01:11.250> or<00:01:11.490> I'm<00:01:12.360> actually<00:01:12.810> six<00:01:15.049> six<00:01:16.049> inches

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
inches or I'm actually six six inches

bottom is 3 and 3/4 this length is 3 and

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.910 
bottom is 3 and 3/4 this length is 3 and
7/8<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.619> then<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.250> top<00:01:35.549> angle<00:01:36.590> slanted<00:01:37.590> piece

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
7/8 and then the top angle slanted piece

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.140 
7/8 and then the top angle slanted piece
is<00:01:38.159> 4<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.030> 1/4<00:01:40.280> now<00:01:41.280> let's<00:01:41.549> scroll<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.030> the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
is 4 and 1/4 now let's scroll to the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.200 
is 4 and 1/4 now let's scroll to the
other<00:01:42.299> side<00:01:43.009> so<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:44.909> see<00:01:45.060> the

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
other side so that you can see the

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.649 
other side so that you can see the
angles<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:47.180> is<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.360> good<00:01:48.630> view<00:01:48.869> right<00:01:49.200> there

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
angles that is a good view right there

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.690 
angles that is a good view right there
alright<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.140> top<00:01:52.530> angle<00:01:53.090> here<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:55.430> 97.1

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
alright so this top angle here is 97.1
