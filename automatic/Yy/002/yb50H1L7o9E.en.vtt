that disappointed her the most the fact

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.080 
that disappointed her the most the fact
that<00:04:54.210> she<00:04:54.630> couldn't<00:04:55.620> convince<00:04:55.950> these<00:04:56.790> two

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
that she couldn't convince these two

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.470 
that she couldn't convince these two
people<00:04:57.480> of<00:04:57.870> her<00:04:58.800> genuinely<00:04:59.790> good<00:05:00.290> intentions

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
people of her genuinely good intentions

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.150 
people of her genuinely good intentions
she<00:05:03.480> was<00:05:03.630> probably<00:05:03.840> more<00:05:04.260> put<00:05:04.590> down<00:05:04.860> by<00:05:05.100> the

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
she was probably more put down by the

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.960 
she was probably more put down by the
fact<00:05:05.520> that<00:05:05.640> no<00:05:06.540> more<00:05:06.780> tried<00:05:07.080> to<00:05:07.260> kill<00:05:07.500> her<00:05:07.970> than

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
fact that no more tried to kill her than

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.940 
fact that no more tried to kill her than
the<00:05:09.120> fact<00:05:09.390> that<00:05:09.480> her<00:05:09.690> masters<00:05:10.260> betrayed<00:05:10.740> her

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
the fact that her masters betrayed her

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.640 
the fact that her masters betrayed her
and<00:05:11.360> going<00:05:12.360> back<00:05:12.630> to<00:05:12.840> the<00:05:12.960> prologue<00:05:13.380> the

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
and going back to the prologue the

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.340 
and going back to the prologue the
message<00:05:14.040> she<00:05:14.250> writes<00:05:14.480> she<00:05:15.480> is<00:05:15.600> now<00:05:15.780> faced<00:05:16.140> with

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
message she writes she is now faced with

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.650 
message she writes she is now faced with
the<00:05:16.770> same<00:05:17.040> problem<00:05:17.100> there<00:05:17.940> is<00:05:18.090> someone<00:05:18.480> who

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
the same problem there is someone who

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.260 
the same problem there is someone who
obviously<00:05:18.960> doesn't<00:05:19.500> trust<00:05:19.830> her<00:05:20.270> actually

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
obviously doesn't trust her actually

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.930 
obviously doesn't trust her actually
it's<00:05:21.390> two<00:05:21.840> people<00:05:22.020> she<00:05:22.470> refers<00:05:22.860> to<00:05:22.890> two<00:05:23.880> of

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
it's two people she refers to two of

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.880 
it's two people she refers to two of
them<00:05:24.180> and<00:05:24.360> the<00:05:24.450> message<00:05:24.780> has<00:05:24.960> the<00:05:25.380> two<00:05:25.590> of<00:05:25.740> you

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
them and the message has the two of you

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.180 
them and the message has the two of you
so<00:05:26.850> these<00:05:27.240> two<00:05:27.450> people<00:05:27.630> doesn't<00:05:28.140> don't<00:05:28.860> trust

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
so these two people doesn't don't trust

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.210 
so these two people doesn't don't trust
her<00:05:29.490> and<00:05:29.930> she's<00:05:30.930> trying<00:05:31.260> to<00:05:31.470> convince<00:05:31.860> them
