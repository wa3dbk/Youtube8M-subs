00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.650 
missing my iPhone 6 a lot and iOS in
general<00:00:20.609> maybe<00:00:20.820> because<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.210> rectangular

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
general maybe because the rectangular

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.540 
general maybe because the rectangular
form<00:00:21.840> factor<00:00:22.289> are<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.470> one-handed<00:00:22.949> usability

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
form factor are the one-handed usability

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.839 
form factor are the one-handed usability
but<00:00:24.240> as<00:00:24.510> we<00:00:24.990> progress<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.320> day<00:00:25.590> 20<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.130> find

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
but as we progress to day 20 I find

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.820 
but as we progress to day 20 I find
myself<00:00:26.970> missing<00:00:27.449> my<00:00:27.599> Android<00:00:28.019> devices<00:00:28.349> and

myself missing my Android devices and

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.290 
myself missing my Android devices and
that's<00:00:29.099> maybe<00:00:29.220> because<00:00:29.400> those<00:00:29.789> have<00:00:30.060> more

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
that's maybe because those have more

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.089 
that's maybe because those have more
control<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.750> can<00:00:31.170> customize<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.769> little<00:00:32.009> bit

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
control you can customize a little bit

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.729

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
kind of missing that functionality but

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.830 
kind of missing that functionality but
at<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.930> same<00:00:40.110> time<00:00:40.489> the<00:00:41.489> passport<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.239> in<00:00:42.570> a

at the same time the passport is in a

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.959 
at the same time the passport is in a
league<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.050> its<00:00:43.260> own<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.739> find<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.610> when<00:00:44.879> you

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
league of its own I find that when you

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.490 
league of its own I find that when you
try<00:00:45.149> using<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.570> in<00:00:45.660> your<00:00:45.780> day<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.930> day<00:00:46.079> life<00:00:46.289> for

try using it in your day to day life for
example<00:00:46.890> when<00:00:47.010> you're<00:00:47.160> walking<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.149> texting

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
example when you're walking and texting

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.940 
example when you're walking and texting
like<00:00:48.600> many<00:00:48.809> people<00:00:48.960> do<00:00:49.230> it's<00:00:49.469> much<00:00:49.739> much

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
like many people do it's much much

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.799 
like many people do it's much much
easier<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.489> do<00:00:50.700> with<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:50.969> physical<00:00:51.390> keyboard

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
easier to do with this physical keyboard

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.840 
easier to do with this physical keyboard
I<00:00:51.989> mean<00:00:52.980> it's<00:00:53.160> something<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.460> really<00:00:53.489> have<00:00:53.760> to

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
I mean it's something you really have to

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.400 
I mean it's something you really have to
experience<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.270> understand<00:00:54.719> versus<00:00:55.110> using<00:00:55.260> a

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
experience to understand versus using a

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.979 
experience to understand versus using a
touchscreen<00:00:55.620> your<00:00:56.070> your<00:00:56.550> accuracy<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.210> far

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
touchscreen your your accuracy is far

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.569 
touchscreen your your accuracy is far
superior<00:00:58.199> on<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.770> not<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.039> physical<00:00:59.460> keyboard

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
superior on it not a physical keyboard

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.950 
superior on it not a physical keyboard
and<00:00:59.850> this<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.030> amplified<00:01:00.449> when<00:01:00.629> you're<00:01:00.780> moving

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
and this is amplified when you're moving

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.979 
and this is amplified when you're moving
I<00:01:01.320> don't<00:01:01.949> know<00:01:02.010> give<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.430> try<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.090> another

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
I don't know give it a try and another

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.270 
I don't know give it a try and another
thing<00:01:04.140> worth<00:01:04.320> pointing<00:01:04.710> out<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.040> if<00:01:05.189> you

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
thing worth pointing out is that if you

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.440 
thing worth pointing out is that if you
want<00:01:05.400> those<00:01:05.489> people<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.820> text<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.299> drive
