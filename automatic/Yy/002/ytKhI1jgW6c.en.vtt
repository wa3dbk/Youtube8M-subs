00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
in this by pulling it while it's not in

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.670 
in this by pulling it while it's not in
the<00:02:15.300> belt<00:02:15.540> itself<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:16.050> will<00:02:16.140> say<00:02:16.260> mistake

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
will be back to normal now all these

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.369 
will be back to normal now all these
buttons<00:02:26.909> are<00:02:27.120> programmed<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.599> same<00:02:27.870> so<00:02:28.319> you

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
buttons are programmed the same so you

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.320 
buttons are programmed the same so you
can<00:02:28.620> press<00:02:28.739> in<00:02:28.890> any<00:02:29.069> order<00:02:29.430> press<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:29.879> again

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:42.710 
can press in any order press it again
twice<00:02:30.660> so<00:02:31.530> let's<00:02:31.770> go<00:02:32.070> through<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.310> sales<00:02:41.720> so

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
twice so let's go through the sales so

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.130 
twice so let's go through the sales so
don't<00:02:42.930> program<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.380> same<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:44.300> now<00:02:45.300> there<00:02:45.870> is

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
don't program the same and now there is

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.900 
don't program the same and now there is
a<00:02:46.320> button<00:02:46.530> on<00:02:46.710> the<00:02:46.800> back<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.220> activates<00:02:47.730> the

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
a button on the back that activates the

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.550 
a button on the back that activates the
henching<00:02:48.270> sound<00:02:50.330> that<00:02:51.330> is<00:02:51.480> for<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.260> track

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
henching sound that is for the the track

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.260 
henching sound that is for the the track
of<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.950> belt<00:02:53.160> where<00:02:53.490> it<00:02:53.580> has<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.730> little<00:02:53.970> stub

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
of the belt where it has a little stub

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.490 
of the belt where it has a little stub
right<00:02:54.450> here<00:02:54.630> so<00:02:54.810> when<00:02:54.960> you<00:02:54.990> connect<00:02:55.320> them

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
right here so when you connect them

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.250 
right here so when you connect them
it'll<00:02:58.940> do<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.060> henching<00:03:00.450> now<00:03:00.840> if<00:03:00.930> you<00:03:01.020> want<00:03:01.170> to

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
it'll do the henching now if you want to

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.020 
it'll do the henching now if you want to
remove<00:03:01.470> this<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:01.830> can<00:03:02.010> pull<00:03:02.550> these<00:03:02.700> two<00:03:02.850> down

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
remove this you can pull these two down

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.910 
remove this you can pull these two down
and<00:03:03.240> pull<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:03.510> out<00:03:03.600> and<00:03:03.840> there's<00:03:04.530> actually<00:03:04.860> a

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
and pull it out and there's actually a

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.140 
and pull it out and there's actually a
function<00:03:05.310> in<00:03:05.430> this<00:03:05.550> while<00:03:05.790> it's<00:03:06.120> on<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.720> track

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
function in this while it's on the track

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.870 
function in this while it's on the track
I'll<00:03:09.150> just<00:03:09.360> make<00:03:09.540> that<00:03:09.690> generic<00:03:10.470> sound<00:03:10.620> there

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.920 

doesn't<00:03:14.880> matter<00:03:14.970> what<00:03:15.210> twenty-plus<00:03:15.660> like<00:03:15.900> I

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
doesn't matter what twenty-plus like I

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.020 
doesn't matter what twenty-plus like I
said<00:03:16.170> it's<00:03:16.410> programmed<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:16.980> same<00:03:17.190> now<00:03:17.760> if<00:03:17.910> you

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
said it's programmed the same now if you

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.110 
said it's programmed the same now if you
want<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.270> do<00:03:18.360> a<00:03:18.390> cast-off<00:03:18.960> you<00:03:19.820> soak<00:03:20.820> it<00:03:20.940> up<00:03:21.000> a

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
want to do a cast-off you soak it up a

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.580 
want to do a cast-off you soak it up a
bit

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
bit

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:31.310 
bit

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
accessories like the kunai gun which

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:45.980 
accessories like the kunai gun which
will<00:04:45.030> look<00:04:45.180> right<00:04:45.360> there<00:04:45.570> and<00:04:45.690> you<00:04:45.780> put<00:04:45.930> the

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
will look right there and you put the

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.010 
will look right there and you put the
kunai<00:04:46.260> gun<00:04:46.470> right<00:04:46.710> there<00:04:47.300> and<00:04:48.300> for<00:04:48.750> the<00:04:48.810> sides

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
kunai gun right there and for the sides

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.050

you can put the straps in there so you

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.210 
you can put the straps in there so you
can<00:04:51.419> put<00:04:51.630> them<00:04:51.690> where<00:04:52.560> it's<00:04:52.710> supposed<00:04:52.980> to<00:04:53.070> be

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
can put them where it's supposed to be

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.610 
can put them where it's supposed to be
for<00:04:53.490> the<00:04:53.520> clock<00:04:53.850> up<00:04:54.120> so<00:04:54.690> just<00:04:54.930> like<00:04:55.050> that<00:04:55.080> and

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
for the clock up so just like that and

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.650 
for the clock up so just like that and
look<00:04:56.400> what<00:04:56.580> it<00:04:56.669> looks<00:04:56.790> like<00:04:56.850> on<00:04:57.030> the<00:04:57.060> back<00:04:57.240> and

look what it looks like on the back and

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.219 
look what it looks like on the back and
you<00:04:58.169> can<00:04:58.290> simulate<00:04:58.530> clock<00:04:59.430> up<00:04:59.669> which<00:05:00.300> you<00:05:01.110> know

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
you can simulate clock up which you know

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.800 
you can simulate clock up which you know
can't<00:05:01.680> really<00:05:01.740> do<00:05:01.979> it<00:05:02.180> now<00:05:03.180> very<00:05:03.360> similar<00:05:03.660> to<00:05:03.780> a
