and forward walking lunges why am i

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.660 
and forward walking lunges why am i
doing<00:00:17.180> reverse<00:00:17.480> walking<00:00:18.349> lunges<00:00:18.890> well<00:00:19.340> a

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
doing reverse walking lunges well a

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.980 
doing reverse walking lunges well a
couple<00:00:20.240> of<00:00:20.390> reasons<00:00:20.539> first<00:00:21.140> off<00:00:21.380> I<00:00:22.210> I<00:00:23.210> tend<00:00:23.900> to

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
couple of reasons first off I I tend to

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.740 
couple of reasons first off I I tend to
move<00:00:24.109> forward<00:00:24.410> a<00:00:24.590> lot<00:00:24.770> as<00:00:24.949> do<00:00:25.430> most<00:00:25.609> people<00:00:26.029> so

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
move forward a lot as do most people so

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.259 
move forward a lot as do most people so
in<00:00:27.230> order<00:00:27.500> to<00:00:27.650> make<00:00:27.920> myself<00:00:28.220> stronger<00:00:28.910> in<00:00:29.150> all

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
in order to make myself stronger in all

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.179 
in order to make myself stronger in all
planes<00:00:29.599> I<00:00:29.930> wanted<00:00:30.380> to<00:00:30.500> do<00:00:30.650> something<00:00:31.039> where<00:00:31.130> I

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
planes I wanted to do something where I

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.850 
planes I wanted to do something where I
was<00:00:31.460> moving<00:00:31.670> backwards<00:00:32.269> so<00:00:33.050> I'm<00:00:33.620> doing

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
was moving backwards so I'm doing

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.560 
was moving backwards so I'm doing
reverse<00:00:34.220> lot<00:00:34.519> walking<00:00:34.910> lunges<00:00:35.210> another

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
reverse lot walking lunges another

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.110 
reverse lot walking lunges another
reason<00:00:35.989> is<00:00:36.110> because<00:00:36.790> reverse<00:00:37.790> lunges

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
reason is because reverse lunges

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.060 
reason is because reverse lunges
actually<00:00:38.540> take<00:00:38.930> a<00:00:38.960> lot<00:00:39.230> of<00:00:39.260> stress<00:00:39.620> off<00:00:39.829> of<00:00:39.860> the

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
actually take a lot of stress off of the

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.490 
actually take a lot of stress off of the
name<00:00:40.219> so<00:00:40.520> i<00:00:40.550> was<00:00:40.730> able<00:00:40.880> to<00:00:41.000> get<00:00:41.239> more<00:00:41.870> reps<00:00:42.170> out

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
name so i was able to get more reps out

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.180 
name so i was able to get more reps out
of<00:00:42.860> the<00:00:42.920> lunch<00:00:43.210> without<00:00:44.210> putting<00:00:45.079> all<00:00:45.860> the

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
of the lunch without putting all the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.650 
of the lunch without putting all the
stress<00:00:46.430> on<00:00:46.640> the<00:00:46.730> knee<00:00:46.879> that<00:00:47.059> i<00:00:47.120> would<00:00:47.360> from

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
stress on the knee that i would from

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.580 
stress on the knee that i would from
doing<00:00:48.110> a<00:00:48.200> forward<00:00:48.800> lunge<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:49.370> entire<00:00:49.670> time<00:00:50.000> so

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
doing a forward lunge the entire time so

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.869 
doing a forward lunge the entire time so
walk<00:00:51.590> back<00:00:51.860> to<00:00:52.039> a<00:00:52.070> certain<00:00:52.430> point<00:00:52.579> and<00:00:52.760> then

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
walk back to a certain point and then

hips back a little bit I think it

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:11.029 
hips back a little bit I think it
actually<00:06:08.999> focuses<00:06:09.719> more<00:06:09.990> on<00:06:10.050> the<00:06:10.560> hamstrings

actually focuses more on the hamstrings

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:15.350 
actually focuses more on the hamstrings
than<00:06:12.029> on<00:06:12.360> the<00:06:13.219> quadriceps<00:06:14.219> but<00:06:14.490> we<00:06:14.759> decided<00:06:15.180> to

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
than on the quadriceps but we decided to

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.959
