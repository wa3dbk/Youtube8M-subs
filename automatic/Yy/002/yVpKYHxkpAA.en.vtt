00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.399
 immense obste 

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:14.099

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.930
 to erase everything I have written and before this clean 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.530
 here is what we are going to do first 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.729
 more than 500 integers int 

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:32.380
 uu bahceli 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.380

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.420
 Cuba accepted equal 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.630

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.630
 with the comafi int yes 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.950
 d will be equal 7 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.350
 polycom antón let's go to put now yes 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.530
 let's do that as these go from a 10 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.810
 uu remember equal to equal productive as before 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.170
 so 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.520
 the the equal to the same I say it again for what it is to compare the values 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.510
 of the variables not to match them though 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.970
 let's put in three what 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.120
 jackson and ate 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.160
 uu 3 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.830
 I spoke anyway 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.360
 now kilos of amosal 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.200
 the different 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.210
 the driver to show 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.280
 this message on the screen 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.000
 always when the condition that I put equal and met 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.420
 the sigil we run now 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.630
 colon 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.630
 consumption 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.540
 or if it fills me with more basic error 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.910
 ready now function 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.500
 nothing happens 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.600
 does not show the proposal of the commission is not met but if we put a kaos 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.520
 Do not wait to say 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.010
 otherwise 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.150
 if the commission from above 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.390
 this is not fulfilled then so the following 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.340
 show me in three what 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.420
 at coexist with her 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.929
 uu 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.369
 3 so-called inept from 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:16.279
 now let's see what happens 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:21.700
 right now he did show the group that just 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.349
 the commission that is fulfilled is not this 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.349
 if it's not the fact that different pubes should 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.059
 if we put five here too 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:33.089
 who thinks it's going to happen 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:34.839
 obviously not 

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:37.839
 showed lady legend uu is equal bird 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:41.419
 since the condition we wanted was exactly fulfilled 

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:44.569
 now actress 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.229
 min pamos adams 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:49.229
 has defined a bulma 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.659
 I do not all feel 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.649
 so capitalized 

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:56.649
 I published x that will be the same 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:00.939
 to the condition above as we saw inside the previous 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:05.129
 that is to dedicate myself clear because pulp exactly what you handle conditions 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:06.249
 sneak 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:08.739
 because to the collectives 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.739
 just like the last commission 

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:15.489
 no x 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.489
 so 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:24.079
 min sink if equality is not met then he will tell us that those who 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:29.409
 comic mile club one is different from beck 

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:33.789
 in agreement 

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:37.359
 now let's put a mess that here also works 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.120
 what do you 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.739
 sergio massa 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.400
 or is equal to see we touched kut hair we are emelec stockpile up 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.469
 to speed things up 

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:53.469
 so let's see what function you eat bios 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.859
 ubs excuse me typical of values ​​that did not correspond 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:01.599
 he no longer lives here 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.789
 and the fmi is a bit strange in short correspondent 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:08.899
 ronzulli strap 

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:11.899
 just do not have to do it since there was a trial at the same time 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:16.469
 because good in the knock down we have seen but this goal 

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:20.430
 that is defined by a commission the commission of the roundtrip inside uribe 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.050
 these months yes 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.349
 no xtc if the rival condition is not true 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:29.569
 is our in is crazy there was success should 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.849
 otherwise 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:33.129
 sample 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:34.569
 in Slovak 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:37.270
 hughes equal bird or what 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.779
 we are going to 

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:41.779
 to modify the values ​​again to see that this also works well 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:48.590
 excellent does not work in both things go 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.289
 here I just exemplified how to use bulls 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:55.659
 to define conditions ublense visions of my program 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:59.190
 and how to do it without using bags this gives you it was clear 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.320
 Calvete is that it is very simple opposes very good to the ceiling soon the idea is 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.010
 start to program aps for the mac 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.629
 is the criminal idea this course 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:10.379
 manolo of base that follows thanks 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:13.379
