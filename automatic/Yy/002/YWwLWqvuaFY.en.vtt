00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.360
 facebook and twitter called to achieve 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.220
 through facebook 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.120
 we wait for it to load 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.720
 they charge high 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:54.930
 and this will come out 610 you will have 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.600
 to accept and that and what is this 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.190
 good page this page of bets is 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.520
 what do you have to do with teams of 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.260
 basketball , sport and other tennis 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.510
 and in one of those is football is not 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:10.020
 true more than the best-known game of 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:13.440
 everyone the best known sport and 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.360
 it can be this one I'm going to show you this 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.580
 page of bets and by depends on the 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.900
 things that you are betting more you are going 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.720
 winning 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.239
 You are gaining points to be able to claim 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.640
 the awards for example we are poor the 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.950
 who plays at 2 o'clock today we give 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.870
 play we give to play hit and 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.189
 let's bet on who you think will win a 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.489
 recommendation that I make is that 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:37.890
 look here the coolest teaches you by 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.319
 which the postcard and design how many points 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.720
 have cost for example and the run and already 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.159
 we bet them big because it has 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.900
 bet on many points for the rally 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.269
 science assumes that if he has put the 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.120
 monitos sure true so let's go to 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.819
 bet at least 200% scholes 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.090
 to bet and then as you see does not come out 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.739
 bet made a lot of luck and here not 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.450
 they leave our plays here they do not come out 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.849
 the points that we have bet the cons 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.579
 already carlos that we have for example already 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:08.040
 posta 200 matches out 200 in play and 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:09.629
 our points you bet 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.599
 made a lot of luck we are in 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:16.079
 our home page and how can 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:18.750
 see I've bet 20 thousand coins and I've 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:20.040
 lost magnitude protagonists because no 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.530
 Won 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.689
 and so you lose points and the 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.459
 points but it is very easy how to recover 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:29.010
 points if I have serious I do not have anything 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.560
 what to do then there are sometimes that you get 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.859
