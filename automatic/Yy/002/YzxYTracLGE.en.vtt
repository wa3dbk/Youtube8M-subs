00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
tell you a little bit why composition is

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.740 
tell you a little bit why composition is
so<00:00:19.289> important<00:00:20.070> when<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.640> was<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:21.000> art<00:00:21.240> college

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
so important when I was in art college

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.019 
so important when I was in art college
in<00:00:22.380> at<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.010> Columbus<00:00:23.310> College<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.730> Art<00:00:23.850> Design

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
in at the Columbus College of Art Design

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.560 
in at the Columbus College of Art Design
in<00:00:24.570> Columbus<00:00:25.050> Ohio<00:00:25.460> we<00:00:26.460> did<00:00:26.699> foundations

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
in Columbus Ohio we did foundations

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.750 
in Columbus Ohio we did foundations
classes<00:00:28.199> for<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.500> first<00:00:28.650> two<00:00:29.099> years<00:00:29.670> of

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
classes for the first two years of

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.060 
classes for the first two years of
school<00:00:30.330> so<00:00:30.869> our<00:00:30.900> freshman<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.560> sophomore

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
school so our freshman and sophomore

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.819 
school so our freshman and sophomore
years<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:33.110> Composition<00:00:34.110> was<00:00:34.260> part<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.770> that

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
years and Composition was part of that

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.639 
years and Composition was part of that
foundation<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.880> we<00:00:35.969> did<00:00:36.149> two<00:00:36.480> years<00:00:36.840> of

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
foundation so we did two years of

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.310 
foundation so we did two years of
composition<00:00:38.370> that's<00:00:38.879> how<00:00:39.210> important<00:00:39.809> they

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
composition that's how important they

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.619 
composition that's how important they
thought<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.340> that's<00:00:41.760> how<00:00:41.969> important<00:00:42.480> I

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
thought it is and that's how important I

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.319 
thought it is and that's how important I
know<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.980> what<00:00:44.520> I've<00:00:44.640> done<00:00:44.879> for<00:00:44.940> this

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
know it is and what I've done for this

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.110 
know it is and what I've done for this
class<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.140> boiled<00:00:46.680> down<00:00:46.920> those<00:00:47.399> two<00:00:47.789> years

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
class is I boiled down those two years

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.560 
class is I boiled down those two years
of<00:00:48.420> techniques<00:00:48.960> into<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.250> four<00:00:50.850> week<00:00:51.059> format

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
of techniques into a four week format

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.479 
of techniques into a four week format
for<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.930> I've<00:00:52.170> taken<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.620> ones<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.219> think

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
for you I've taken the ones that I think

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.939 
for you I've taken the ones that I think
are<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.699> most<00:00:53.910> intuitive<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:55.170> easiest<00:00:55.680> to

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
are the most intuitive the easiest to

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:56.930 
are the most intuitive the easiest to
get<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.280> started

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
get you started

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.119 
get you started
now<00:00:57.300> these<00:00:57.510> techniques<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.559> ways<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:59.070> working

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
now these techniques and ways of working

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.540 
now these techniques and ways of working
are<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.149> easy<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.809> implement<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.620> promise<00:01:02.399> that

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
are so easy to implement I promise that

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.939 
are so easy to implement I promise that
within<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.000> first<00:01:03.359> week<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:04.110> will<00:01:04.260> have<00:01:04.589> more

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
within the first week you will have more

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.120 
within the first week you will have more
professional-looking<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.840> cleaner<00:01:07.560> looking

professional-looking and cleaner looking

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.660 
professional-looking and cleaner looking
collages<00:01:08.970> than<00:01:09.420> you've<00:01:09.600> ever<00:01:09.930> had<00:01:10.080> before<00:01:10.670> by

work so don't worry about how you work
I've<00:01:27.930> used<00:01:28.470> collage<00:01:28.979> as<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.640> format<00:01:30.090> for<00:01:30.150> this

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
I've used collage as the format for this

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.020 
I've used collage as the format for this
class<00:01:31.320> because<00:01:31.950> that's<00:01:32.100> my<00:01:32.400> specialty

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
class because that's my specialty

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.060 
class because that's my specialty
working<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.720> collage<00:01:34.049> but<00:01:34.500> also<00:01:34.740> then<00:01:35.040> you

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
working in collage but also then you

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.679 
working in collage but also then you
don't<00:01:35.340> have<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.549> worry<00:01:35.729> about<00:01:35.820> drawing<00:01:36.299> or

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
don't have to worry about drawing or

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.149

the<00:02:00.420> best<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.899> they<00:02:01.049> can<00:02:01.130> so<00:02:02.130> let<00:02:02.340> me<00:02:02.430> tell

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
the best that they can so let me tell

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.580 
the best that they can so let me tell
you<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.729> little<00:02:02.790> bit<00:02:03.119> about<00:02:03.420> how<00:02:03.750> this<00:02:04.020> class<00:02:04.320> is

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
you a little bit about how this class is

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.730 
you a little bit about how this class is
going<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:04.979> work<00:02:05.450> each<00:02:06.450> week<00:02:06.840> we're<00:02:07.380> going<00:02:07.560> to

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
going to work each week we're going to

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.400 
going to work each week we're going to
upload<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.399> video<00:02:08.580> we're<00:02:09.300> going<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.479> upload<00:02:09.780> two

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
upload a video we're going to upload two

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.430 
upload a video we're going to upload two
videos<00:02:10.440> slideshows<00:02:11.220> which<00:02:11.819> are<00:02:12.000> essentially

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
videos slideshows which are essentially

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.890 
videos slideshows which are essentially
similar<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.190> PowerPoint<00:02:14.600> presentations<00:02:15.600> I've

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
similar to PowerPoint presentations I've

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.110 
similar to PowerPoint presentations I've
created<00:02:16.290> for<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.650> with<00:02:16.770> audio<00:02:17.400> going<00:02:17.700> over

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
created for you with audio going over

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.480 
created for you with audio going over
them<00:02:18.270> I'm<00:02:18.660> going<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.140> introduce<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:20.070> new

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
them I'm going to introduce you to a new

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.690 
them I'm going to introduce you to a new
composition<00:02:21.390> principle<00:02:22.260> each<00:02:22.560> week<00:02:23.160> now

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
composition principle each week now

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.360 
composition principle each week now
these<00:02:23.970> are<00:02:24.330> almost<00:02:24.750> composition<00:02:25.680> formulas

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
these are almost composition formulas

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.360 
these are almost composition formulas
that<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:26.640> can<00:02:26.880> plug<00:02:27.240> elements<00:02:28.080> into<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:28.770> find

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
that you can plug elements into I find

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.480 
that you can plug elements into I find
this<00:02:29.490> is<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.700> really<00:02:30.210> great<00:02:30.600> way<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.440> start<00:02:32.190> with

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
this is a really great way to start with

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.370 
this is a really great way to start with
composition<00:02:32.940> if<00:02:33.330> you've<00:02:33.510> never<00:02:33.840> worked<00:02:34.200> with

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
composition if you've never worked with

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.770 
composition if you've never worked with
compositional<00:02:35.220> structures<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:35.940> formulas<00:02:36.510> it

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
compositional structures and formulas it

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.340 
compositional structures and formulas it
is<00:02:37.260> such<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.680> great<00:02:38.130> way<00:02:38.520> to<00:02:38.820> fall<00:02:39.420> back<00:02:39.810> on<00:02:39.840> when

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
is such a great way to fall back on when

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.530 
is such a great way to fall back on when
you<00:02:40.650> get<00:02:40.830> stuck<00:02:41.280> in<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.550> bad<00:02:41.730> composition

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
you get stuck in a bad composition

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.660 
you get stuck in a bad composition
sometimes<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.380> have<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.530> piece<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:44.160> you<00:02:44.400> know

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
sometimes you have a piece and you know

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.660 
sometimes you have a piece and you know
it's<00:02:44.850> not<00:02:45.060> working<00:02:45.570> you<00:02:46.230> don't<00:02:46.560> know<00:02:46.770> why<00:02:46.980> you

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
it's not working you don't know why you

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.220 
it's not working you don't know why you
can<00:02:47.850> use<00:02:47.880> one<00:02:48.270> of<00:02:48.300> these<00:02:48.450> compositional

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
can use one of these compositional

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.110 
can use one of these compositional
formulas<00:02:49.740> so<00:02:49.890> I'm<00:02:50.040> going<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.430> teach<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:50.670> to

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
formulas so I'm going to teach you to

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.150 
formulas so I'm going to teach you to
fix<00:02:51.570> it

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
fix it

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.650 
fix it
sometimes<00:02:53.160> you're<00:02:53.340> stuck<00:02:53.640> for<00:02:53.910> inspiration

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
sometimes you're stuck for inspiration

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.510 
sometimes you're stuck for inspiration
you<00:02:54.780> don't<00:02:54.990> know<00:02:55.110> which<00:02:55.260> way<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.500> go<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:56.340> can

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
you don't know which way to go you can

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.400 
you don't know which way to go you can
use<00:02:56.640> one<00:02:56.880> of<00:02:56.910> these<00:02:57.090> compositional<00:02:57.840> formulas

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
use one of these compositional formulas

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.730 
use one of these compositional formulas
to<00:02:58.590> get<00:02:58.770> yourself<00:02:59.220> jump-started<00:03:00.180> there<00:03:01.140> is<00:03:01.350> no

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
to get yourself jump-started there is no
