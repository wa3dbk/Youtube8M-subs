00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.440
 and this is a new tutorial on how 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.440
 do 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.200
 some automatic lights on the roof 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:23.080
 although agent and good how this works 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.939
 my mother of beautiful love well as 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.380
 You see the roof is totally normal and 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.760
 when we give the little button we're going to 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.680
 exchange for a light said vale 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.690
 it can be light that thing you want 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.690
 it can be a close- ton can be 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.140
 here a lantern of the sea and can be 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.530
 a reston lamp of a lifetime 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.090
 they are worth and good how this works 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.980
 it works practically the same as 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.410
 block exchanger that we made the 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.380
 another day 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.100
 but vertical and occupies very little of 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.960
 resources of malen and as you see works 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.170
 almost the same from one side to the other 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.270
 circuit and quickly respond a 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.470
 slow motion to see how it works and 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.470
 let's go with the tutorial 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.190
 good good people like always we are going to 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.890
 start by creating our 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:15.070
 pistons okay the first one will go around here 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.080
 so we remove this will go with the block to 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.150
 exchange on the roof worth this will be 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.950
 the material that is made 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.520
 our roof well let's put this 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.859
 block cited from the line over here 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.619
 another piston of jose looking down 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:31.200
 the lamp is worth and here we are going to put 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.360
 a sticky piston facing east 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.049
 sling block are worth and we go with the 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.820
 circuit 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.469
 good good people the circuit is very 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.539
 simple and we're going to put our 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:40.649
 input with a block does not push blÃ© vale 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.259
 this is very important with a 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.610
 palanquita around here okay let's 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.409
 explain then it works to me we're going to 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.469
 explain then the first circuit let's go 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.229
 to put torch here block block 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:54.659
 blocks and akira a quick up to a 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.939
 repeated the tics here and one of reston 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.569
 ok and the circuit would be finished 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.590
 OK 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:00.360
 good good people I will explain 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.950
 quickly how this circuit works 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.079
 and half mind when we see the lever 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.989
 this piston will stop receiving current 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:10.049
 ok and it will collect well this is going to 

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:11.790
 allow the circuit to move towards 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.610
 one side and the other thanks to this 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.110
 piston is worth the push to your stop already 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.750
 and receiving a current from 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.120
 this video two tics is worth and until then 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.120
 well worth the point is that when it arrives 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.040
 this seen in here is worth because this 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.540
 gun will push everything here when 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.100
 come this pistan here this piston will be 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.470
 understood by this torch is fair 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.100
 as soon as it arrives 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.780
 from one side to another and this block that 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.680
 is stuck to this block is line will be 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.000
 the one that moves from one side of another 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.710
 well perfect because this is already good 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.320
 good to quickly explain how to carry 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.420
 the input here below is very simple 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.350
 you just take off I'm here and you put 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.350
 a rest torch 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.620
 that works 70 same is a tad more 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.680
 slow by the torch but I like it 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.989
 and if you change this for a lamp, what 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.709
 only you will have to do is put a 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.450
 palanquita here and here is worth so 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.519
 always be on whenever you 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.560
 deis is worth as you see so it is off 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.970
 but against here it turns on and 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.680
 well I hope you liked this 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.269
 tutorial and see you in the next 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.269
 video chau people
