disappointing<00:01:42.750> though<00:01:42.930> we've<00:01:43.229> been<00:01:43.470> informed

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
disappointing though we've been informed

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.160 
disappointing though we've been informed
that<00:01:44.100> FIFA<00:01:44.640> 16<00:01:44.790> won't<00:01:45.450> be<00:01:45.600> making<00:01:45.750> its<00:01:45.990> way<00:01:46.110> to

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
that FIFA 16 won't be making its way to

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.280 
that FIFA 16 won't be making its way to
PlayStation<00:01:46.649> Vita<00:01:46.979> 3ds<00:01:47.670> or<00:01:48.000> Wii<00:01:48.240> U<00:01:48.509> now<00:01:49.259> I

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
PlayStation Vita 3ds or Wii U now I

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.539 
PlayStation Vita 3ds or Wii U now I
guess<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.619> fact<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:49.890> they're<00:01:50.130> cutting<00:01:50.430> off

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
guess the fact that they're cutting off

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.580 
guess the fact that they're cutting off
the<00:01:50.700> 3ds<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.420> Wii<00:01:51.509> U<00:01:51.689> is<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:52.049> tiny<00:01:52.350> bit

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
the 3ds and the Wii U is a tiny bit

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.190 
the 3ds and the Wii U is a tiny bit
reassuring<00:01:53.220> but<00:01:53.880> it's<00:01:54.060> just<00:01:54.210> generally<00:01:54.930> quite

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
reassuring but it's just generally quite

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.780 
reassuring but it's just generally quite
disappointing<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:55.979> mean<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.340> PlayStation

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
disappointing I mean the PlayStation

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.219 
disappointing I mean the PlayStation
Vita<00:01:56.909> wasn't<00:01:57.390> exactly<00:01:57.689> getting<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.990> best

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
Vita wasn't exactly getting the best

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.410 
Vita wasn't exactly getting the best
fifa<00:01:58.619> ports<00:01:58.979> but<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.579> feel<00:01:59.880> like<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.240> just

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
fifa ports but I feel like this is just

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.300 
fifa ports but I feel like this is just
the<00:02:00.509> start<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.170> massive<00:02:01.590> collapse<00:02:01.950> in

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
the start of a massive collapse in

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.330 
the start of a massive collapse in
developers<00:02:03.270> making<00:02:03.479> mainstream<00:02:04.079> games

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
developers making mainstream games

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.779 
developers making mainstream games
actually<00:02:05.340> disappearing<00:02:06.350> so<00:02:07.350> on<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.399> positive

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
actually disappearing so on the positive

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.339 
actually disappearing so on the positive
note<00:02:08.849> though<00:02:09.149> we<00:02:09.390> are<00:02:09.509> still<00:02:09.720> getting<00:02:09.840> Lego

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
note though we are still getting Lego

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.110 
note though we are still getting Lego
Jurassic<00:02:10.739> world<00:02:11.129> which<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.910> very

are really doing well now this is a

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.840 
are really doing well now this is a
combination<00:03:33.470> of<00:03:33.530> factors<00:03:33.980> but<00:03:34.010> basically

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
combination of factors but basically

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.789 
combination of factors but basically
it's<00:03:35.510> to<00:03:35.690> do<00:03:35.810> with<00:03:35.930> the<00:03:35.989> fact<00:03:36.200> that<00:03:36.260> in<00:03:36.470> Japan

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
it's to do with the fact that in Japan

it's to do with the fact that in Japan
the<00:03:37.010> PlayStation<00:03:37.459> Vita<00:03:37.549> is<00:03:37.760> actually<00:03:38.180> setting

quite<00:03:38.780> well<00:03:39.109> so<00:03:39.799> although<00:03:40.040> sales<00:03:40.250> haven't

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
quite well so although sales haven't

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:42.400 
quite well so although sales haven't
picked<00:03:40.760> up<00:03:40.970> they've<00:03:41.329> barely<00:03:41.600> faulted<00:03:42.200> since

picked up they've barely faulted since

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.979 
picked up they've barely faulted since
about<00:03:42.620> two<00:03:42.889> years<00:03:43.040> ago<00:03:43.250> for<00:03:44.239> some<00:03:44.389> reason<00:03:44.840> I

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
about two years ago for some reason I

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.690 
about two years ago for some reason I
suppose<00:03:45.319> it's<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:45.560> constant<00:03:46.100> slew<00:03:46.340> of<00:03:46.370> games

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
suppose it's the constant slew of games

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.490 
suppose it's the constant slew of games
more<00:03:46.940> than<00:03:47.090> anything<00:03:47.269> the<00:03:47.930> Japanese<00:03:48.319> market

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
more than anything the Japanese market

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.410 
more than anything the Japanese market
is<00:03:48.769> hungry<00:03:49.130> for<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:49.370> PlayStation<00:03:49.850> Vita<00:03:50.000> and

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
is hungry for the PlayStation Vita and

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.539 
is hungry for the PlayStation Vita and
demand<00:03:51.200> does<00:03:51.350> not<00:03:51.530> seem<00:03:51.739> to<00:03:51.859> be<00:03:51.980> faltering<00:03:52.430> at

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
demand does not seem to be faltering at

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.699 
demand does not seem to be faltering at
all<00:03:52.730> which<00:03:52.970> is<00:03:53.000> good<00:03:53.720> I<00:03:53.750> guess<00:03:53.870> it<00:03:54.380> means<00:03:54.560> that

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
all which is good I guess it means that

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:55.990 
all which is good I guess it means that
we're<00:03:54.799> getting<00:03:55.010> at<00:03:55.100> least<00:03:55.130> some<00:03:55.489> games<00:03:55.730> even

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
we're getting at least some games even

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.160 
we're getting at least some games even
if<00:03:56.090> they're<00:03:56.209> not<00:03:56.299> quite<00:03:56.480> the<00:03:56.720> games<00:03:56.900> that<00:03:57.049> we

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
if they're not quite the games that we

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.289 
if they're not quite the games that we
wanted<00:03:57.530> you<00:03:58.400> know<00:03:58.519> it's<00:03:58.700> still<00:03:59.030> some

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
wanted you know it's still some

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:00.759 
wanted you know it's still some
attention<00:03:59.750> it's<00:03:59.870> better<00:04:00.049> than<00:04:00.200> nothing<00:04:00.560> and

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
attention it's better than nothing and

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.259 
attention it's better than nothing and
then<00:04:01.250> again<00:04:01.459> this<00:04:01.609> is<00:04:01.760> what<00:04:01.910> happened<00:04:02.150> with<00:04:02.239> a

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
then again this is what happened with a

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:03.759 
then again this is what happened with a
PlayStation<00:04:02.810> Portable<00:04:03.170> and<00:04:03.349> said<00:04:03.530> eventually

Monster Hunter came along and just saved

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.509 
Monster Hunter came along and just saved
the<00:04:05.959> system<00:04:06.410> so<00:04:06.920> who<00:04:07.040> knows<00:04:07.190> what<00:04:07.400> will<00:04:07.489> happen

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
the system so who knows what will happen

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.699 
the system so who knows what will happen
to<00:04:07.849> the<00:04:07.940> PlayStation<00:04:08.420> Vita<00:04:08.569> I<00:04:08.959> wouldn't<00:04:09.530> say

to the PlayStation Vita I wouldn't say

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.800

highly doubt we'll be talking about a
playstation<00:04:41.240> 5<00:04:41.510> at<00:04:41.690> this<00:04:41.780> early<00:04:42.080> stage<00:04:42.110> but

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
playstation 5 at this early stage but

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.590 
playstation 5 at this early stage but
nonetheless<00:04:43.190> I<00:04:43.640> don't<00:04:43.970> think<00:04:44.180> the<00:04:44.240> places<00:04:44.540> to

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
nonetheless I don't think the places to

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.090 
nonetheless I don't think the places to
meet<00:04:44.720> will<00:04:44.930> get<00:04:45.050> a<00:04:45.080> huge<00:04:45.350> amount<00:04:45.560> of<00:04:45.590> attention

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
meet will get a huge amount of attention

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.160 
meet will get a huge amount of attention
but<00:04:46.400> a<00:04:46.730> little<00:04:47.120> bit<00:04:47.210> of<00:04:47.300> hope<00:04:47.510> will<00:04:47.750> never<00:04:47.960> hurt

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
but a little bit of hope will never hurt

but a little bit of hope will never hurt
anyone

so<00:04:49.340> when<00:04:49.460> Sony<00:04:49.700> actually<00:04:50.120> released<00:04:50.390> the

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300 
make another PlayStation Vita and I

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.730 
make another PlayStation Vita and I
think<00:06:20.570> this<00:06:20.720> agrees<00:06:21.050> with<00:06:21.080> just<00:06:21.410> about<00:06:21.590> what

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
think this agrees with just about what

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.430 
think this agrees with just about what
everyone<00:06:22.010> else<00:06:22.130> is<00:06:22.490> saying<00:06:22.870> the<00:06:23.870> reasons<00:06:24.200> are

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 
everyone else is saying the reasons are

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.840 
everyone else is saying the reasons are
pretty<00:06:24.590> obvious<00:06:25.160> I<00:06:25.310> mean<00:06:25.430> it<00:06:25.550> doesn't<00:06:25.760> make

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
pretty obvious I mean it doesn't make

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.660 
pretty obvious I mean it doesn't make
sense<00:06:25.880> for<00:06:26.390> Sony<00:06:26.690> to<00:06:26.720> repeat<00:06:27.520> initial<00:06:28.520> mistake

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:28.670 
sense for Sony to repeat initial mistake

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.720 
sense for Sony to repeat initial mistake
with<00:06:29.120> yet<00:06:29.660> another<00:06:29.930> mistake<00:06:30.220> but<00:06:31.220> I<00:06:31.250> do<00:06:31.370> think

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:31.730 
with yet another mistake but I do think

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.220 
with yet another mistake but I do think
Sony<00:06:32.030> will<00:06:32.270> release<00:06:32.510> another<00:06:32.540> portable

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:33.230 
Sony will release another portable

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.020 
Sony will release another portable
console<00:06:33.650> whether<00:06:34.340> it's<00:06:34.580> called<00:06:34.940> a

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.030 
console whether it's called a

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.790 
console whether it's called a
PlayStation<00:06:35.480> Vita<00:06:35.630> -<00:06:35.870> to<00:06:36.200> be<00:06:36.260> honest<00:06:36.500> I<00:06:36.590> doubt

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
PlayStation Vita - to be honest I doubt

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.440 
PlayStation Vita - to be honest I doubt
I<00:06:36.980> mean<00:06:37.130> they<00:06:37.280> probably<00:06:37.580> like<00:06:37.820> to<00:06:37.970> start<00:06:38.210> again

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:38.450 
I mean they probably like to start again

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.480 
I mean they probably like to start again
giving<00:06:38.840> the<00:06:39.040> negative

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.490 
giving the negative

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.550

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 
associated with the Vita name but

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.800 
associated with the Vita name but
clearly<00:06:42.949> I<00:06:43.250> mean<00:06:43.550> really<00:06:44.240> really<00:06:44.479> clearly

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810 
clearly I mean really really clearly

clearly I mean really really clearly
there<00:06:45.229> is<00:06:45.380> a<00:06:45.590> market<00:06:46.160> for<00:06:46.400> handheld<00:06:46.819> consoles

the 3ds is just an example of this I

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.309 
the 3ds is just an example of this I

as<00:06:58.039> is<00:06:58.220> that's<00:06:58.610> all<00:06:58.789> they<00:06:58.940> do<00:06:59.000> so<00:06:59.449> I<00:06:59.479> personally

00:06:59.890 --> 00:06:59.900 
as is that's all they do so I personally

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.469 
as is that's all they do so I personally
think<00:07:00.410> it's<00:07:00.650> pretty<00:07:00.949> fair<00:07:01.190> to<00:07:01.400> assume<00:07:01.490> that<00:07:01.849> by

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 
think it's pretty fair to assume that by

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:05.589 
think it's pretty fair to assume that by
2017<00:07:03.110> or<00:07:03.590> 2018<00:07:03.819> Sony<00:07:04.819> will<00:07:05.030> probably<00:07:05.449> have

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:05.599 
2017 or 2018 Sony will probably have

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:07.390 
2017 or 2018 Sony will probably have
released<00:07:05.870> either<00:07:06.139> a<00:07:06.289> new<00:07:06.590> games<00:07:06.860> console
