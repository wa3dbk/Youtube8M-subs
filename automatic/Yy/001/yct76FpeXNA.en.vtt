00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690
 a lot 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.420
 hello everyone and hot potato lady 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.400
 I find you today in a 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.400
 new tutorial for making tacos 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.560
 so to start you need some 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.480
 translucent white paw and ocher you 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.939
 go the state finely and you go 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.920
 draw two circles there you go 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.399
 cutouts and highs the edges and the 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.399
 textures and 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.449
 then we will come the colored ones with 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.449
 dry pastel ocher 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.920
 so we do not hesitate on the coloring 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.310
 no but really everywhere since the 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.930
 taco leaves have gone pretty 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.780
 colorful then I want it done well 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.760
 fall back in the rain of the dry pastel brown 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.350
 dark and I then come down with 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.350
 my finger to adhere the color 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.740
 with a second round I will continue 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.000
 to texture and goes up because so in 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.000
 pushing a little bit everywhere 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:42.630
 I'm just a little room 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.619
 on the edge and also on the middle for 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.619
 give a little bit of relief 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:54.240
 I then take two ice cream sticks 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:57.649
 and I'm going to put my dacos on it and 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.649
 I will then cook them flat 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.780
 fifteen minutes to 110 degrees 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.579
 once they are cooked we will be able to 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.579
 go to work more easily 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.480
 so I'm going to take fim at 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.520
 chocolate and translucent 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.349
 I'm going to create a sausage that I'm going to 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.330
 put inside I'm going to cut 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.330
 on the edges and then come textured 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.760
 a good textures and so to make a 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.280
 little bit of crumbs everywhere 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:01.010
 to really have that steak effect 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.450
 chopped 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.470
 then we'll take some white from 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.700
 translucent yellow and green 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.120
 we will take a little piece of themselves 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.650
 to mix we will add translucent 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.090
 to come and make the salad 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.650
 simply ripped off 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.690
 that well stuck on the chopped steak 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.760
 so be careful not all around since 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.420
 must still see the 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.420
 meat on the side 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.459
 I then take makan tomatoes I you 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.200
 invite to see tutorials on my 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.940
 chain I'm going to cut some slices 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.319
 I'm going to cut in small 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.250
 pieces to make lots of little ones 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.250
 pieces of tomatoes 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.090
 I then take the translucent apa 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:59.470
 and white to make little onions 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.599
 which I made a little rectangle like 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.690
 I'm a long end rectangle that I have 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:06.459
 well cut in lots of small rectangles 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.870
 that I'm rolling one by one on my 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.530
 needle to give them a small 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.530
 round shape 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.690
 I then take yellow and 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.410
 transmissive for a cheese 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:32.080
 I make a pretty thin plate and I'm going 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.080
 come and do lots of little things 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.990
 and then we'll just garnish 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:54.349
 our tacos alternating tomato onions 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.349
 and cheeses 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.180
 2 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.470
 we add a little salad to 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.470
 need if we do not see anymore 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.530
 if you want to add little ones 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.970
 elements and you are afraid that it sticks 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:33.530
 not you can add a little bit 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:35.120
 two liquid films and that's it I 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.620
 did my two little ones because I 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.620
 will be able to go to the oven 

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:43.300
 thirty minutes to 110 degrees this time 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.040
 this 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.540
 once your little leather tacos or 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.320
 the future the greens read and add a 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.320
 little bit of grass 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:58.540
