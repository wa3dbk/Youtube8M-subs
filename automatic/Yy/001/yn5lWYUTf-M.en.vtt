would<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.549> turn<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.090> round<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.770> won't<00:01:55.770> do<00:01:55.920> it

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
would you turn that round I won't do it

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.260 
would you turn that round I won't do it
with<00:01:56.100> this<00:01:56.189> particular<00:01:56.520> one<00:01:56.759> because<00:01:56.790> it

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
with this particular one because it

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.039 
with this particular one because it
what's<00:01:57.390> happening<00:01:57.689> there

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
what's happening there

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.080 
what's happening there
push<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.740> down<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.189> would<00:01:59.310> hold<00:01:59.460> nice<00:01:59.790> and

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
push it down it would hold nice and

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.300 
push it down it would hold nice and
tight<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.479> would<00:02:00.570> be<00:02:00.689> nice<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.140> secure<00:02:01.310> no

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
tight it would be nice and secure no

tight it would be nice and secure no
issue<00:02:02.490> with<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.820> at<00:02:02.969> all<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.750> probably<00:02:03.960> took

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
issue with it at all it probably took

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.010 
issue with it at all it probably took
about<00:02:04.350> two<00:02:04.799> months<00:02:05.219> before<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:06.020> stopped

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
about two months before that stopped

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.469 
about two months before that stopped
working<00:02:07.680> in<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:07.950> way<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.849> you'd<00:02:09.149> have<00:02:09.330> to

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
working in that way and you'd have to

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.330 
working in that way and you'd have to
then<00:02:09.629> turn<00:02:09.929> these<00:02:10.200> things<00:02:10.440> around<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.920> tighten

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
then turn these things around to tighten

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.980 
then turn these things around to tighten
it

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
it

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.810 
it
again<00:02:13.290> if<00:02:13.560> you<00:02:13.740> need<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:13.920> get<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.280> into<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.580> car

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
again if you need to get it into the car

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.820 
again if you need to get it into the car
if<00:02:15.240> you've<00:02:15.450> got<00:02:15.570> a<00:02:15.600> relatively<00:02:16.110> average-sized

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
if you've got a relatively average-sized

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.500 
if you've got a relatively average-sized
car<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:17.670> don't<00:02:17.760> want<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.000> put<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.240> in<00:02:18.330> with<00:02:18.450> the

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
car you don't want to put it in with the

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.650 
car you don't want to put it in with the
handles<00:02:18.990> like<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.350> so<00:02:20.090> you'd<00:02:21.090> be<00:02:21.240> lifting<00:02:21.570> it

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
handles like that so you'd be lifting it

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.250 
handles like that so you'd be lifting it
up<00:02:21.750> like<00:02:21.960> that<00:02:21.990> turning<00:02:22.860> them<00:02:22.980> in<00:02:23.180> and<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:25.080> do

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
up like that turning them in and you do

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.940 
up like that turning them in and you do
that<00:02:26.990> but<00:02:27.990> you<00:02:28.080> can<00:02:28.230> see<00:02:28.440> I've<00:02:28.560> already<00:02:28.710> got

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
that but you can see I've already got

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.890 
that but you can see I've already got
problems<00:02:29.460> with<00:02:29.610> it<00:02:29.730> now<00:02:30.150> we<00:02:30.270> sent<00:02:30.540> me<00:02:30.690> on<00:02:30.780> it

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
problems with it now we sent me on it

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.560 
problems with it now we sent me on it

problem with the washers and they sent
it<00:02:35.520> back<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.940> us<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:38.030> looked<00:02:39.030> at<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.270> when<00:02:39.360> it

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
it back to us I looked at it when it

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.060 
it back to us I looked at it when it
first<00:02:39.720> came<00:02:40.020> back<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.440> I<00:02:40.500> wasn't<00:02:40.740> satisfied

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
first came back and I wasn't satisfied

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.090 
first came back and I wasn't satisfied
because<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.970> me<00:02:42.180> that<00:02:42.900> seemed<00:02:43.260> tighter<00:02:43.650> it

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
because to me that seemed tighter it

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.190 
because to me that seemed tighter it
wasn't<00:02:44.610> that<00:02:44.820> tight<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.630> I<00:02:45.750> thought<00:02:45.900> this

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
wasn't that tight and I thought this

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.440 
wasn't that tight and I thought this
isn't<00:02:46.500> right<00:02:46.800> because<00:02:47.250> after<00:02:48.150> about<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.360> week

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
isn't right because after about a week

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.750 
isn't right because after about a week
it's<00:02:48.900> gonna<00:02:49.080> loosen<00:02:49.500> up<00:02:49.830> again<00:02:50.160> because<00:02:50.520> these

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
it's gonna loosen up again because these

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.510 
it's gonna loosen up again because these
things<00:02:51.120> always<00:02:51.330> do<00:02:51.780> lo<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.530> behold<00:02:52.620> same

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.160 
it's appalling as you can see these two
here<00:03:48.000> again<00:03:48.300> is<00:03:48.960> this<00:03:49.760> and<00:03:50.780> even<00:03:51.780> if<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:51.960> try

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
here again is this and even if you try

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.590 
here again is this and even if you try
and<00:03:52.230> tighten<00:03:52.740> these<00:03:52.860> up<00:03:52.920> here<00:03:53.370> as<00:03:54.150> tight<00:03:54.450> as

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
and tighten these up here as tight as

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.070 
and tighten these up here as tight as
they'll<00:03:54.810> go

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
they'll go

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.700 
they'll go
without<00:03:55.980> even<00:03:56.220> clamping<00:03:57.060> them<00:03:57.180> down<00:03:57.390> again<00:03:57.710> it

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
without even clamping them down again it

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.370 
without even clamping them down again it
still<00:03:59.160> won't<00:03:59.340> hold<00:03:59.670> it's<00:04:00.600> gone<00:04:00.780> beyond<00:04:01.110> that

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
still won't hold it's gone beyond that

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.200 
still won't hold it's gone beyond that
point<00:04:01.650> where<00:04:02.040> it<00:04:02.100> will<00:04:02.220> even<00:04:02.370> hold<00:04:02.730> it<00:04:02.850> at<00:04:03.000> all

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
point where it will even hold it at all

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.180 
point where it will even hold it at all
so<00:04:03.690> we're<00:04:03.930> walking<00:04:04.080> around<00:04:04.560> with<00:04:04.710> our<00:04:04.830> child

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
so we're walking around with our child

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.110 
so we're walking around with our child
with<00:04:05.400> a<00:04:05.430> plan

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
with a plan

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.300 
with a plan
that<00:04:06.360> is<00:04:06.480> finally<00:04:06.960> insecure<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:08.010> we're<00:04:08.220> not

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
that is finally insecure and we're not

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.310 
that is finally insecure and we're not
compensation<00:04:09.240> see<00:04:09.540> because<00:04:09.810> we're<00:04:10.020> not<00:04:10.110> those

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
compensation see because we're not those

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.230 
compensation see because we're not those
sort<00:04:10.620> of<00:04:10.680> people<00:04:10.920> we<00:04:11.280> just<00:04:11.520> want<00:04:11.910> a<00:04:11.970> product

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
sort of people we just want a product

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
sort of people we just want a product
that<00:04:12.540> works<00:04:12.780> I<00:04:13.140> don't<00:04:13.440> think<00:04:13.860> there's<00:04:14.010> a<00:04:14.100> lot
