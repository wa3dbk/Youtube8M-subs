00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
keyed into temperature and very

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.150 
keyed into temperature and very
sensitive<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.619> winter<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:28.950> takes

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
sensitive to that so the winter it takes

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.370 
sensitive to that so the winter it takes
longer<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.509> summer<00:01:30.750> I've<00:01:31.020> got<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.229> rush<00:01:31.350> a

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
longer and the summer I've got to rush a

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.910 
longer and the summer I've got to rush a
little<00:01:31.710> bit<00:01:31.830> more<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:33.649> it<00:01:34.649> is<00:01:34.860> very

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
little bit more and it is very

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.660 
little bit more and it is very
contemplative<00:01:35.369> because<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.539> is<00:01:36.920> so<00:01:37.920> plotting

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
contemplative because it is so plotting

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.070 
contemplative because it is so plotting
and<00:01:38.789> there's<00:01:38.970> there's<00:01:39.390> patient<00:01:39.869> that's

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
and there's there's patient that's

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.199 
and there's there's patient that's
needed<00:01:40.500> between<00:01:40.680> each<00:01:41.009> step<00:01:41.280> I've<00:01:41.700> tried<00:01:42.030> to

00:01:42.199 --> 00:01:42.209 
needed between each step I've tried to

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:43.639 
needed between each step I've tried to
rush<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.569> when<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.810> didn't<00:01:43.289> allow<00:01:43.470> myself

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
rush it when I didn't allow myself

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.340 
rush it when I didn't allow myself
enough<00:01:44.039> time<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:45.720> dough<00:01:45.869> doesn't<00:01:46.050> like

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
enough time and the dough doesn't like

enough time and the dough doesn't like
it<00:01:46.530> it's<00:01:47.039> it<00:01:47.550> ends<00:01:48.030> up<00:01:48.119> tough<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.810> ends<00:01:49.140> up<00:01:49.259> not

to<00:01:54.240> listen<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.069> listen<00:01:56.069> to<00:01:56.220> what<00:01:56.399> it

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
to listen to it and listen to what it

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.690 
to listen to it and listen to what it
needs<00:01:56.940> and<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.990> it's<00:01:58.200> not<00:01:58.470> about<00:01:58.830> me<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.520> my

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700

needs and so it's not about me and my
ego<00:02:00.149> it's

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
ego it's

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.640 
ego it's
being<00:02:01.220> connected<00:02:01.850> with<00:02:02.630> what<00:02:03.050> is<00:02:03.170> a<00:02:03.200> living

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
being connected with what is a living

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.710 
being connected with what is a living
thing<00:02:03.800> and<00:02:04.280> I<00:02:04.430> take<00:02:04.670> a<00:02:04.910> block<00:02:05.210> of<00:02:05.450> butter<00:02:05.570> out

thing and I take a block of butter out

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.090 
thing and I take a block of butter out
of<00:02:05.930> the<00:02:06.140> refrigerator<00:02:06.290> that<00:02:06.830> I've<00:02:06.920> already

of the refrigerator that I've already

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.219 
of the refrigerator that I've already
formed<00:02:07.640> into<00:02:07.940> a<00:02:07.970> slab<00:02:08.360> just<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.869> right<00:02:08.990> size

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.660 
formed into a slab just the right size
and<00:02:09.619> I<00:02:10.430> roll<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.910> dough<00:02:11.060> out<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:12.430> lay<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:13.550> on

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
and I roll the dough out and lay it on

and I roll the dough out and lay it on
the<00:02:13.910> dough<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.390> fold<00:02:15.260> it<00:02:15.440> up<00:02:15.530> like<00:02:15.560> laundry

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
the dough and fold it up like laundry

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.880 
the dough and fold it up like laundry
it's<00:02:16.850> like<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.030> little<00:02:17.150> bundle<00:02:17.510> and<00:02:17.930> that's<00:02:18.740> the

if I pay attention to what it needs and
I<00:02:41.240> feel<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.690> nuance<00:02:41.960> of<00:02:42.170> it<00:02:42.320> and<00:02:42.980> I've<00:02:43.070> done<00:02:43.220> it

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
I feel the nuance of it and I've done it

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.510 
I feel the nuance of it and I've done it
all<00:02:43.400> correctly<00:02:44.320> when<00:02:45.320> I<00:02:45.380> go<00:02:45.590> to<00:02:45.620> shape<00:02:45.980> the

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
all correctly when I go to shape the

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.600 
all correctly when I go to shape the
cutter<00:02:46.760> will<00:02:46.940> use<00:02:47.150> these<00:02:47.510> buns<00:02:47.840> I<00:02:48.280> can<00:02:49.280> see

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
cutter will use these buns I can see

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.970 
cutter will use these buns I can see
what<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.630> dough<00:02:50.750> looks<00:02:50.960> like<00:02:51.230> I've<00:02:51.440> rolled

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
what the dough looks like I've rolled

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.640 
what the dough looks like I've rolled
them<00:02:52.310> up<00:02:52.490> and<00:02:52.910> cut<00:02:53.480> them<00:02:53.720> and<00:02:54.110> I<00:02:54.170> see<00:02:54.320> the<00:02:54.440> cross

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
them up and cut them and I see the cross

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.350 
them up and cut them and I see the cross
sections<00:02:55.100> like<00:02:55.310> rings<00:02:55.580> of<00:02:55.790> a<00:02:55.850> tree<00:02:55.880> and

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
sections like rings of a tree and

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.020 
sections like rings of a tree and
they're<00:02:56.870> very<00:02:56.900> distinct<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:57.800> like<00:02:58.610> rings<00:02:58.880> of

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
they're very distinct and like rings of

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.970 
they're very distinct and like rings of
a<00:02:59.090> tree<00:02:59.120> you<00:02:59.330> can<00:02:59.570> see<00:02:59.870> if<00:03:00.140> it's<00:03:00.320> been<00:03:00.440> a<00:03:00.500> heavy

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
a tree you can see if it's been a heavy

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.890 
a tree you can see if it's been a heavy
rain<00:03:01.250> or<00:03:01.459> light<00:03:01.640> rain<00:03:01.850> and<00:03:02.150> I<00:03:02.390> want<00:03:02.600> these<00:03:02.720> to

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
rain or light rain and I want these to

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.510 
rain or light rain and I want these to
all<00:03:03.020> be<00:03:03.170> even<00:03:03.530> I<00:03:03.680> don't<00:03:03.920> want<00:03:04.100> them<00:03:04.220> to<00:03:04.310> show<00:03:04.490> a

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
all be even I don't want them to show a

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.120 
all be even I don't want them to show a
variance<00:03:05.000> of<00:03:05.120> season<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:05.660> once<00:03:06.590> they<00:03:06.770> proof

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
variance of season and once they proof

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.310 
variance of season and once they proof
and<00:03:07.459> they<00:03:07.580> they<00:03:07.970> rise<00:03:08.239> I<00:03:08.739> can<00:03:09.739> tell<00:03:10.070> then<00:03:10.520> also

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
and they they rise I can tell then also

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.590 
and they they rise I can tell then also
it's<00:03:12.320> telling<00:03:13.100> me<00:03:13.130> it's<00:03:13.480> confirming<00:03:14.480> that

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
it's telling me it's confirming that

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.290 
it's telling me it's confirming that
I've<00:03:14.750> done<00:03:14.930> it<00:03:15.050> right<00:03:15.200> because<00:03:15.500> it<00:03:16.060> rises<00:03:17.060> more

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
I've done it right because it rises more

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.470 
I've done it right because it rises more
and<00:03:17.600> it<00:03:18.380> opens<00:03:18.769> up<00:03:18.920> more<00:03:19.190> and<00:03:19.459> once<00:03:20.300> they're

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
and it opens up more and once they're

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.050 
and it opens up more and once they're
baked<00:03:20.720> even<00:03:21.140> more<00:03:21.290> so<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:22.160> layers<00:03:22.670> become

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
baked even more so the layers become

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.590 
baked even more so the layers become
more<00:03:23.269> pronounced<00:03:23.870> and<00:03:24.310> and<00:03:25.420> finally<00:03:26.420> when<00:03:26.570> I

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
more pronounced and and finally when I

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.080 
more pronounced and and finally when I
see<00:03:27.140> people<00:03:27.170> eat<00:03:27.620> them<00:03:27.860> as<00:03:28.220> I<00:03:28.430> look<00:03:28.970> out

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
see people eat them as I look out

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.960 
see people eat them as I look out
through<00:03:29.300> the<00:03:29.420> open<00:03:29.690> kitchen<00:03:29.900> I<00:03:30.430> can<00:03:31.430> tell<00:03:31.820> by

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
through the open kitchen I can tell by

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.970 
through the open kitchen I can tell by
the<00:03:33.600> expression<00:03:33.930> on<00:03:34.140> their<00:03:34.260> face<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:34.620> can<00:03:34.770> tell

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
the expression on their face I can tell

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.680 
the expression on their face I can tell
how<00:03:35.190> they're<00:03:35.340> enjoying<00:03:35.700> them<00:03:35.940> from<00:03:36.240> the<00:03:36.390> first

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
how they're enjoying them from the first

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.020 
how they're enjoying them from the first
bite<00:03:36.990> they're<00:03:37.860> enjoying<00:03:38.190> it<00:03:38.370> I<00:03:38.430> can<00:03:38.580> see<00:03:38.790> the

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
bite they're enjoying it I can see the

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.460 
bite they're enjoying it I can see the
expression<00:03:39.480> on<00:03:39.540> their<00:03:39.660> face<00:03:39.930> and<00:03:39.960> then<00:03:40.350> their

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
expression on their face and then their

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.650 
expression on their face and then their
eyes<00:03:40.650> this<00:03:41.580> is<00:03:41.730> something<00:03:42.030> special<00:03:42.390> to<00:03:42.510> them

because<00:03:43.410> it's<00:03:44.160> all<00:03:44.310> about<00:03:44.490> that<00:03:44.670> moment

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920
