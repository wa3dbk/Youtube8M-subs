 hi how about friends in this video 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:10.769
 I will teach how to patch and how to install 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.080
 the screencast video recorder pro for 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.570
 to install it we must make users 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.030
 root and also have installed the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.100
 lucky application to cher that they 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.150
 I'll leave the download links in the 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.340
 video description 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.340
 well let's install the chopped side 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.120
 we give you to install 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.750
 here we give you the fact we do not open the 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.750
 application 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.550
 then we go to the lucky application 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.300
 for cher 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.300
 we open it 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:10.549
 here we do not look for the screencast what 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.500
 open we unfold several options you 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:16.000
 we give to open patch menu 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.159
 we select the first option that is 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.570
 in green color that says remove 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:24.420
 license verification 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.760
 here again the first option that is 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.450
 automatic modes 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:33.450
 he sends us another menu of 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.800
 options here we just select 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:41.700
 automatic mode and the third one that is 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:45.810
 other patches extreme mode only 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.810
 those two we have to select 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.140
 the application will be good and 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.340
 apart we give you to apply 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.340
 we hope it charges 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:09.390
 let's finish we're going to give this message 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.300
 patch of the correct pattern 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.120
 the others that are in red does not matter 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.440
 they say failed or failure there is no 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:22.200
 problem because the screencast has already been 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.650
 is already full section only give you 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.650
 to accept 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.000
 and we go to the screencast that we already 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.090
 created the button to access the 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.090
 application 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.590
 we open it 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:41.830
 Here we give you 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:47.160
 in allow because it is the request of 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:50.600
 superuser that's why it's necessary to be 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:54.370
 ruth because if not we will not be able 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:59.290
 use the application here we give start 1 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.290
 nights scripts 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.580
 and we're all going to both 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.580
 leds leds 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.569
 and ready and left the program as they see and 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:17.299
 tells us 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.299
 and press to start recording 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.500
 now the configurations we owe him 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:27.560
 to put so that we can reproduce a 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.159
 video here in video resolution we give you 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.159
 in hi 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.670
 the other is the orientation of the video not 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:39.459
 matter we go to the touch 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.910
 pointer that is if we want to put a 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.140
 cursor us the one that we like some 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:49.120
 cursor 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:52.720
 I see him I choose this the little hand 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:57.750
 to record audio only 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:01.190
 we give audio record we value that option 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:06.550
 and then the whole program is already full 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:09.360
 and it's working 100% 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:13.370
 we see the other options bring your own 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:16.669
 player of the videos that we recorded 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.180
 and it would be all of the video until the 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.180
 next
