00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
personally I think it's the best

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.480 
personally I think it's the best
character<00:00:09.599> in<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.780> game<00:00:09.920> simply<00:00:10.920> because<00:00:11.309> of

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
character in the game simply because of

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.580 
character in the game simply because of
his<00:00:11.639> level<00:00:12.000> three<00:00:12.179> super<00:00:12.630> you<00:00:13.200> don't<00:00:13.380> have<00:00:13.500> to

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
his level three super you don't have to

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.320 
his level three super you don't have to
chase<00:00:13.799> people<00:00:13.980> around<00:00:14.340> with<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:14.849> you<00:00:15.299> can

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
chase people around with it you can

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.950 
chase people around with it you can
focus<00:00:15.719> more<00:00:16.139> on<00:00:16.640> destroying<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.880> enemy<00:00:18.060> and

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
focus more on destroying the enemy and

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.460 
focus more on destroying the enemy and
he<00:00:19.800> has<00:00:19.949> long-range<00:00:20.220> attack<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:21.470> close-range

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
he has long-range attack a close-range

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.580 
he has long-range attack a close-range
attack<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.660> guess<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.080> can<00:00:25.230> cut<00:00:25.410> like

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
attack and and I guess you can cut like

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.609 
attack and and I guess you can cut like
an<00:00:25.710> aerial<00:00:26.099> attack<00:00:26.160> he<00:00:26.550> shoots<00:00:26.789> missiles<00:00:27.090> up

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
and some things that i would have liked

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.119 
and some things that i would have liked
to<00:02:33.540> see<00:02:33.750> them<00:02:33.900> change<00:02:34.200> they<00:02:34.680> could<00:02:34.890> have<00:02:34.920> added

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
to see them change they could have added

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:36.650 
to see them change they could have added
you<00:02:35.400> know<00:02:35.489> at<00:02:35.609> least<00:02:35.640> two<00:02:36.030> more<00:02:36.180> characters

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
you know at least two more characters

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.130 
you know at least two more characters
they<00:02:37.140> supposed<00:02:37.799> to<00:02:37.859> have<00:02:38.040> 20<00:02:38.459> in<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.730> game<00:02:39.140> and

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
they supposed to have 20 in the game and

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.670 
they supposed to have 20 in the game and
i<00:02:40.290> really<00:02:40.620> don't<00:02:40.859> like<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:42.120> character<00:02:42.680> list

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
i really don't like the character list

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.229 
i really don't like the character list
that<00:02:43.920> they<00:02:44.040> put<00:02:44.280> out<00:02:44.310> for<00:02:44.579> the<00:02:44.670> game<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:45.030> think

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
that they put out for the game I think

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.720 
that they put out for the game I think
they<00:02:45.329> could<00:02:45.450> have<00:02:45.569> done<00:02:45.599> a<00:02:45.690> better<00:02:45.780> job<00:02:45.989> but

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
they could have done a better job but

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.879 
they could have done a better job but
know<00:02:47.730> what<00:02:47.880> it<00:02:48.000> is<00:02:48.150> what<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.510> is<00:02:48.599> and<00:02:48.780> they<00:02:49.230> did

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
know what it is what it is and they did

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:52.400 
know what it is what it is and they did
take<00:02:50.069> out<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.280> level<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:51.150> had<00:02:51.329> access<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.959> it<00:02:51.989> I

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
take out a level you had access to it I

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.849 
take out a level you had access to it I
think<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:54.000> game<00:02:54.180> is<00:02:54.209> called<00:02:54.540> quiesce<00:02:55.079> they

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
think the game is called quiesce they

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.670 
think the game is called quiesce they
were<00:02:56.010> had<00:02:56.160> access<00:02:56.639> to<00:02:56.910> in<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.630> private<00:02:57.989> beta<00:02:58.139> I

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
were had access to in the private beta I

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.670 
were had access to in the private beta I
haven't<00:02:59.609> seen<00:02:59.819> that<00:02:59.849> yet<00:03:00.030> so<00:03:00.540> I<00:03:01.079> think<00:03:01.410> they

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
haven't seen that yet so I think they

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.620 
haven't seen that yet so I think they
took<00:03:01.889> it<00:03:01.950> out<00:03:02.190> I<00:03:02.519> would<00:03:03.090> have<00:03:03.150> liked<00:03:03.329> to<00:03:03.419> seen

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
took it out I would have liked to seen

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.920 
took it out I would have liked to seen
