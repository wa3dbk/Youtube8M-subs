00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
mean there's definitely opportunity for

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.350 
mean there's definitely opportunity for
scholarships<00:00:37.610> more<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:38.790> than<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.000> other

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
scholarships more so than in other

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.780 
scholarships more so than in other
majors<00:00:39.720> I<00:00:39.900> think<00:00:40.170> just<00:00:40.590> by<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.770> generosity<00:00:41.400> of

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
majors I think just by the generosity of

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.220 
majors I think just by the generosity of
the<00:00:41.910> scholarship<00:00:42.600> i<00:00:42.720> receive<00:00:43.020> just

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
the scholarship i receive just

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.979 
the scholarship i receive just
individually<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.130> think<00:00:44.610> shows<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.270> they're

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
individually I think shows that they're

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.660 
individually I think shows that they're
willing<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.380> invest<00:00:46.500> money<00:00:47.220> in<00:00:47.489> their

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
willing to invest money in their

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.160 
willing to invest money in their
students<00:00:48.120> would<00:00:48.540> they<00:00:48.630> have<00:00:48.750> an<00:00:48.900> awards

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
students would they have an awards

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.600 
students would they have an awards
banquet<00:00:49.230> here<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:49.950> went<00:00:50.160> there<00:00:50.340> for<00:00:50.550> a

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610
