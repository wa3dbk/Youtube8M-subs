00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
Wow ok let me just

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.000 
Wow ok let me just
yeah<00:00:39.390> I'm<00:00:39.510> hitting<00:00:39.840> restore<00:00:40.200> defaults<00:00:40.800> and

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
yeah I'm hitting restore defaults and

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.420 
yeah I'm hitting restore defaults and
the<00:00:41.219> defaults<00:00:41.760> are<00:00:41.910> everything<00:00:42.510> on<00:00:43.079> Macs

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
the defaults are everything on Macs

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.580 
the defaults are everything on Macs
visual<00:00:45.059> effects<00:00:45.329> dynamic<00:00:45.870> shadows<00:00:46.020> are<00:00:46.350> on

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
visual effects dynamic shadows are on

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.770 
visual effects dynamic shadows are on
the<00:00:46.920> draw<00:00:47.129> distance<00:00:47.300> 100%<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.480> screen

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
the draw distance 100% and screen

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.069 
the draw distance 100% and screen
resolution<00:00:49.260> 100%<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:51.030> mean<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.870> is

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
resolution 100% so I mean this is

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.840 
resolution 100% so I mean this is
another<00:00:52.530> one<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.770> those<00:00:52.949> weird<00:00:53.250> things<00:00:53.340> it's

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
another one of those weird things it's

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.130 
another one of those weird things it's
obviously<00:00:54.149> just<00:00:54.390> because<00:00:54.539> it's<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.780> Tegra<00:00:55.110> 3

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
obviously just because it's a Tegra 3

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.540 
obviously just because it's a Tegra 3
it's<00:00:55.530> decided<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.100> it's<00:00:56.309> great<00:00:57.230> and<00:00:58.550> whereas

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
it's decided that it's great and whereas

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.569 
it's decided that it's great and whereas
my<00:00:59.760> Nexus<00:01:00.270> turn<00:01:00.600> on<00:01:00.780> my<00:01:00.870> Nexus<00:01:01.260> 4<00:01:01.620> on<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> Nexus

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
my Nexus turn on my Nexus 4 on the Nexus

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.670 
my Nexus turn on my Nexus 4 on the Nexus
4<00:01:02.850> especially<00:01:03.359> probably<00:01:03.690> with<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.840> better<00:01:04.080> GPU

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
4 especially probably with a better GPU

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.520 
4 especially probably with a better GPU
with<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.979> audrina<00:01:05.220> 320<00:01:05.990> doesn't<00:01:06.990> max<00:01:07.170> out<00:01:07.380> the

with the audrina 320 doesn't max out the

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.679 
with the audrina 320 doesn't max out the
graphics<00:01:07.950> but<00:01:08.070> then<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.460> lower<00:01:08.700> Integra<00:01:09.210> 3<00:01:09.450> in

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
graphics but then the lower Integra 3 in

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.850 
graphics but then the lower Integra 3 in
the<00:01:09.840> Nexus<00:01:10.170> 7<00:01:10.320> does<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:12.380> seems<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.530> be<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.650> bit<00:01:13.799> of

games especially for the price point and
I'm<00:01:59.460> really<00:02:00.030> shocked<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.600> didn't<00:02:00.930> think<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.200> was

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
I'm really shocked I didn't think it was

I'm really shocked I didn't think it was
going<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.439> perform<00:02:01.770> this<00:02:02.070> well<00:02:02.310> on<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:03.829> wave

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
going to perform this well on the wave

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.999 
going to perform this well on the wave
if<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.100> say<00:02:05.369> but<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.299> performing<00:02:06.810> it

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
if I say but it is is performing it

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.010 
if I say but it is is performing it
everything<00:02:08.009> on<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.160> hundred<00:02:08.780> settings<00:02:09.780> are

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
everything on a hundred settings are

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.960 
everything on a hundred settings are
maxed<00:02:10.440> out

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.580 

we<00:02:13.970> all<00:02:14.090> gained<00:02:14.299> very<00:02:14.599> good<00:02:14.930> performance<00:02:15.470> as

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
we all gained very good performance as

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:25.119 
we all gained very good performance as
you<00:02:15.709> can<00:02:15.860> see<00:02:23.170> turn<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.319> down<00:02:24.440> a<00:02:24.500> bit<00:02:24.650> is<00:02:24.860> quite

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
you can see turn it down a bit is quite

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:32.920 
you can see turn it down a bit is quite
loud<00:02:30.819> so<00:02:31.819> that's<00:02:31.970> still<00:02:32.180> better<00:02:32.329> driving

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
loud so that's still better driving

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.539 
loud so that's still better driving
we're<00:02:33.049> trying<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.409> get<00:02:33.560> built<00:02:33.980> up<00:02:34.069> from<00:02:34.250> speed

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
we're trying to get built up from speed

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
sure if you wanted to get it

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:09.759 
sure if you wanted to get it
epically<00:03:08.390> smooth<00:03:08.840> you<00:03:09.079> could<00:03:09.290> lower<00:03:09.530> the

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
epically smooth you could lower the

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.550 
epically smooth you could lower the
resolution<00:03:09.920> or<00:03:10.430> lower<00:03:10.609> the<00:03:10.790> draw<00:03:10.970> distance

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
resolution or lower the draw distance

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.430 
resolution or lower the draw distance
but<00:03:12.560> there's<00:03:12.709> honestly<00:03:12.950> no<00:03:13.129> need<00:03:13.780> it's<00:03:14.780> very

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
but there's honestly no need it's very

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.650 
but there's honestly no need it's very
quick<00:03:15.709> it's<00:03:15.919> very<00:03:16.130> fast<00:03:16.459> it's<00:03:16.700> really<00:03:17.209> really

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
quick it's very fast it's really really

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.610 
quick it's very fast it's really really
really<00:03:18.049> cool<00:03:18.230> and<00:03:19.450> just<00:03:20.450> confuses<00:03:21.169> me<00:03:21.319> even<00:03:21.560> a

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
really cool and just confuses me even a

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.960 
really cool and just confuses me even a
little<00:03:21.769> bit<00:03:21.980> more<00:03:22.160> as<00:03:22.340> to<00:03:22.549> why<00:03:22.669> I<00:03:22.700> like<00:03:22.940> my

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
little bit more as to why I like my

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.979 
little bit more as to why I like my
Nexus<00:03:23.569> 4<00:03:24.319> doesn't<00:03:25.010> hold<00:03:25.730> well<00:03:26.299> it<00:03:26.419> I<00:03:26.569> mean<00:03:26.780> if

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
Nexus 4 doesn't hold well it I mean if

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.809 
Nexus 4 doesn't hold well it I mean if
you<00:03:27.139> look<00:03:27.319> to<00:03:27.440> my<00:03:27.530> Nexus<00:03:27.829> 4<00:03:28.010> video<00:03:28.190> it<00:03:28.370> handles

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
you look to my Nexus 4 video it handles

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.530 
you look to my Nexus 4 video it handles
full<00:03:29.239> graphics<00:03:30.169> easily<00:03:30.739> with<00:03:31.010> no<00:03:31.129> problems

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
full graphics easily with no problems

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.819 
full graphics easily with no problems
I'm<00:03:32.540> just<00:03:32.780> wondering<00:03:33.139> why<00:03:33.230> it<00:03:33.379> doesn't<00:03:33.590> choose

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
I'm just wondering why it doesn't choose

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:44.409 
I'm just wondering why it doesn't choose
it<00:03:33.950> by<00:03:34.040> default<00:03:34.430> I<00:03:34.549> guess<00:03:42.370> so<00:03:43.400> very<00:03:44.000> I<00:03:44.060> mean<00:03:44.269> if

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:44.419 
it by default I guess so very I mean if

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:46.839 
it by default I guess so very I mean if
I<00:03:44.540> had<00:03:44.690> to<00:03:44.720> if<00:03:45.169> I<00:03:45.769> had<00:03:45.949> to<00:03:46.099> say<00:03:46.280> which<00:03:46.459> one<00:03:46.699> was

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
I had to if I had to say which one was

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.300 
I had to if I had to say which one was
better<00:03:47.030> performing<00:03:47.569> at<00:03:47.660> my<00:03:47.900> Nexus<00:03:48.260> 7<00:03:48.470> or<00:03:49.129> that

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
better performing at my Nexus 7 or that

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.879 
better performing at my Nexus 7 or that
my<00:03:49.400> Nexus<00:03:49.790> 4<00:03:50.120> I<00:03:50.419> would<00:03:51.109> say<00:03:51.319> that<00:03:51.500> on<00:03:51.590> four

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:51.889 
my Nexus 4 I would say that on four

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:54.369 
my Nexus 4 I would say that on four
graphics<00:03:52.370> I<00:03:52.579> think<00:03:52.879> my<00:03:53.000> Nexus<00:03:53.359> 4<00:03:53.629> is<00:03:53.660> smoother

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
graphics I think my Nexus 4 is smoother

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:59.800 
graphics I think my Nexus 4 is smoother
for<00:03:54.530> sure<00:03:56.019> not<00:03:57.019> by<00:03:57.319> like<00:03:58.120> loads<00:03:59.120> of<00:03:59.329> frames<00:03:59.599> I'm

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
for sure not by like loads of frames I'm

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.180 
for sure not by like loads of frames I'm
actually<00:03:59.930> very<00:04:00.230> impressed<00:04:00.709> with<00:04:00.859> the<00:04:00.980> frame

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
actually very impressed with the frame

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.670 
actually very impressed with the frame
rate<00:04:01.370> here<00:04:01.669> but<00:04:02.419> I<00:04:02.569> think<00:04:02.840> it<00:04:02.959> is<00:04:03.079> smoother<00:04:03.560> on

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
rate here but I think it is smoother on

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.509 
rate here but I think it is smoother on
my<00:04:03.709> for<00:04:05.500> saying<00:04:06.500> that<00:04:06.709> though<00:04:06.919> I<00:04:06.949> say<00:04:07.370> it's

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
my for saying that though I say it's

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.670 
my for saying that though I say it's
definitely<00:04:07.760> smoother<00:04:08.540> on<00:04:08.660> the<00:04:08.780> 7<00:04:09.260> than<00:04:09.440> it<00:04:09.560> is

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
definitely smoother on the 7 than it is

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.280 
definitely smoother on the 7 than it is
on<00:04:09.829> the<00:04:09.949> 10<00:04:10.250> and<00:04:10.579> this<00:04:11.269> maximum<00:04:11.930> savings

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
on the 10 and this maximum savings

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.870 
on the 10 and this maximum savings
anyway<00:04:14.980> will<00:04:15.980> do<00:04:16.099> a<00:04:16.130> bit<00:04:16.280> bit<00:04:16.430> more<00:04:16.459> running

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
anyway will do a bit bit more running

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.520 
anyway will do a bit bit more running
around<00:04:17.000> just<00:04:17.539> a<00:04:17.660> little<00:04:18.049> bit<00:04:18.139> more
