00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
Angela and and and well I didn't think I

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.299 
Angela and and and well I didn't think I
did<00:00:27.960> very<00:00:27.990> very<00:00:29.240> good<00:00:30.529> bestest<00:00:31.529> grammars<00:00:32.009> on

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
did very very good bestest grammars on

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.790 
did very very good bestest grammars on
it<00:00:32.910> um<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.690> think<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:34.260> could<00:00:34.410> have<00:00:34.500> done<00:00:34.620> better

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
it um I think I could have done better

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.950 
it um I think I could have done better
so<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.370> try<00:00:35.610> again<00:00:35.640> as<00:00:35.940> close<00:00:36.149> as<00:00:36.300> 300<00:00:36.809> as

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
so I try again as close as 300 as

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.290 
so I try again as close as 300 as
possible<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.129> got<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.460> one<00:00:38.520> down<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:39.120> two

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
possible so I got this one down to two

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.760 
possible so I got this one down to two
hundred<00:00:39.390> nine<00:00:39.750> dollars<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.350> ninety<00:00:40.590> one

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
hundred nine dollars and ninety one

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.869 
hundred nine dollars and ninety one
sense<00:00:41.480> so<00:00:42.480> let's<00:00:43.260> get<00:00:43.500> started<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.250> CPU<00:00:44.730> is

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
sense so let's get started so the CPU is

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.670 
sense so let's get started so the CPU is
still<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.239> same<00:00:45.300> which<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.500> AMD<00:00:46.890> a10<00:00:47.129> 58

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
still the same which is the AMD a10 58

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.430 
still the same which is the AMD a10 58
100k<00:00:49.820> 3.8<00:00:50.820> gigahertz<00:00:51.120> quad-core<00:00:51.449> processor

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.580 
100k 3.8 gigahertz quad-core processor
which<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.800> 89<00:00:53.280> 99<00:00:54.120> if<00:00:54.960> you're<00:00:55.110> going<00:00:55.260> for<00:00:55.410> three

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
which is 89 99 if you're going for three

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.990 
which is 89 99 if you're going for three
and<00:00:55.710> three<00:00:55.829> dollars<00:00:56.190> i<00:00:56.340> think<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
and three dollars i think this is the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.060 
and three dollars i think this is the
best<00:00:57.120> way<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.390> go<00:00:57.600> all<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.320> motherboard

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
best way to go all the motherboard

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.759

which is forty four dollars and
ninety-nine<00:01:07.229> cents<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.890> actually<00:01:08.460> did<00:01:08.850> go<00:01:09.090> five

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
ninety-nine cents I actually did go five

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.859 
ninety-nine cents I actually did go five
dollars<00:01:09.869> more<00:01:10.020> expensive<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:11.310> scary<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.909> one

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
dollars more expensive so scary and one

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.200 
dollars more expensive so scary and one
gigabyte<00:01:13.350> which<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.770> even<00:01:14.310> better<00:01:14.340> than<00:01:14.610> msi

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
gigabyte which is even better than msi

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.550 
gigabyte which is even better than msi
so<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.200> memory<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.710> PNY<00:01:17.360> xlr8<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:19.049> key<00:01:19.380> but

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
so the memory is the PNY xlr8 a key but
