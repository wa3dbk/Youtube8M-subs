00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.380
 hi minecraft friends your illusion the 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.430
 channel craft my in this tutorial I come to 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.490
 teach them the traps 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.170
 that I was going to teach two of them and 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.690
 next week they will have the third 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.930
 we go quickly the simplest with 101 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:36.300
 pairs that would be the wall of a mine and 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.300
 place diamond in the center 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.250
 then behind the diamond they place a 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.290
 torch with subtract down to a 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.290
 distance place two blocks of this 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.200
 form in the center a repeater and to the 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:51.800
 side a few nights that way then 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.910
 we come build behind a clock in 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.080
 faster and I know the simplest 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.630
 which is the active this way it breaks 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:03.740
 and the remains are quickly activated 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.740
 we have to live it 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:11.350
 when resting and it would be working 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:14.910
 How do you want to have two or 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.910
 three blocks like this 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:23.990
 they locate a piston block forward carries 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.800
 in this this remaining is activated 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.830
 until luisa and disco the signal is cut 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:40.400
 then we locate it from avoid date 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:42.920
 to and think and when it breaks this 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.580
 first trap let's move on to the 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.580
 second trap 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.460
 well I started with him with the second 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:57.009
 trap we make a kitchen we make 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.009
 a one wall they knew 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.890
 thus 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:09.979
 they have them behind the kitchen they shout a 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.979
 piston were in a block 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.550
 rest a block and a torch that 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.080
 they have another block on top and they have two 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.620
 side stand 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.440
 well you have two on top of web presses to 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.190
 out a repeater 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.140
 and ends up in this way and good 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.470
 when they go to see that when I go to the cinema 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.880
 something 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.880
 put something that we have 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.830
 When I cook, they will listen to me 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.200
 they are behind 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.800
 so what they have to do is 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.900
 locate there and there what they will have 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.380
 block of course then that's going to 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.380
 be the roof 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:01.560
 It looks like a kitchen but what we have 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:04.549
 what to do now is locate the dynamics 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.709
 that are going to be there and here so let's go 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:09.810
 to put first the torches that the 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.540
 they will activate this form and then they 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.689
 let's make an edge to avoid that 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:19.769
 dynamic it when they jump in 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:22.469
 the chest and do not fall finally let's 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.980
 expand is a block here and we go 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:28.799
 to put a block there during the chat is 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:32.250
 that is going to pay another block and other 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:35.629
 two later we expand these by the 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.629
 Colombian side with torches 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.469
 thus 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.569
 and then you have to place and person 

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:44.060
 attention to this part in the block that 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.370
 It's next to the piston 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.040
 have to cause a repeat of this 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.840
 way and extend the time to the maximum 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.310
 and whether it would be in the trap 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.310
 working but let's figurative 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.319
 works perfectly well 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:03.049
 still to be more sure but what 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.790
 ideal is this time can add more 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.930
 received from sites we put the dynamite 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.930
 we do one-time test 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.300
 there is a nationalist workshop 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.239
 and with this expression we're going 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.850
 laying off up next week 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.709
 trap tutorial trap 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.900
 undetectable I hope you have them 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.419
 liked I hope it's useful do not forget 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.290
 subscribe and see you in a next 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.290
 goodbye video
