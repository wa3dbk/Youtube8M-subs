unboxing<00:00:02.429> of<00:00:03.560> thermaltake<00:00:04.560> case<00:00:04.740> I<00:00:05.130> just<00:00:05.310> got

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:06.140 
unboxing of thermaltake case I just got

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.009 
unboxing of thermaltake case I just got
it's<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.319> overseer<00:00:07.799> rxi<00:00:08.580> and<00:00:08.970> it's<00:00:10.639> the<00:00:11.639> end

it's the overseer rxi and it's the end

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:14.959 
it's the overseer rxi and it's the end
700m<00:00:13.019> series<00:00:13.679> so<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.219> just<00:00:14.460> took<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:14.700> out<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:14.910> the

inch size you can just plug it in there
easy<00:01:15.420> access<00:01:18.650> let's<00:01:19.650> take<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.920> look<00:01:20.159> at<00:01:20.250> the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
easy access let's take a look at the

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:28.390 
easy access let's take a look at the
sign<00:01:20.670> here<00:01:21.150> it's<00:01:22.020> got<00:01:23.240> on<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.450> side<00:01:24.630> panel

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.730 

it's<00:01:29.400> got<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.700> small<00:01:32.180> clear<00:01:33.180> window<00:01:33.740> plastic

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
it's got a small clear window plastic

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.530 
it's got a small clear window plastic
window<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:36.030> it's<00:01:36.390> also<00:01:36.540> got<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:36.990> event<00:01:37.560> for

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
window and it's also got this event for

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:46.270 
window and it's also got this event for
an<00:01:39.540> optional<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:43.009> guess<00:01:44.030> 200<00:01:45.030> millimeter<00:01:45.420> fan

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
an optional I guess 200 millimeter fan

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.730 
an optional I guess 200 millimeter fan
know<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> little<00:01:47.579> bit<00:01:47.729> bigger<00:01:47.939> than<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.740> but

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
know a little bit bigger than that but

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.410 
know a little bit bigger than that but
it<00:01:49.829> doesn't<00:01:49.920> come<00:01:50.220> with<00:01:50.250> its<00:01:50.549> standard<00:01:51.060> and

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
it doesn't come with its standard and

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.980 
it doesn't come with its standard and
then<00:01:52.079> if<00:01:52.200> we<00:01:52.320> take<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.530> look<00:01:52.649> on<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.979> inside

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
then if we take a look on the inside

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.499 
then if we take a look on the inside
you'll<00:01:54.990> see<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.290> have<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.829> lot<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.310> hard<00:01:57.270> drive

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
you'll see you have a lot of hard drive

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.490 
you'll see you have a lot of hard drive
slots<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:59.750> they've<00:02:00.750> got<00:02:00.990> they've<00:02:01.320> all<00:02:01.469> come

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
slots and they've got they've all come

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.649 
slots and they've got they've all come
with<00:02:01.890> trays<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.640> it's<00:02:03.060> really<00:02:03.240> easy<00:02:03.540> to

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
with trays so it's really easy to

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.160 
with trays so it's really easy to
install

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.900 

it's<00:02:07.170> also<00:02:07.350> got<00:02:07.819> this<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:10.640> motherboard<00:02:11.640> tray

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
it's also got this the motherboard tray

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.910 
it's also got this the motherboard tray
which<00:02:12.690> has<00:02:13.500> um<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.870> bunch<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:15.989> slots<00:02:16.379> so<00:02:16.709> you<00:02:16.800> can

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
which has um a bunch of slots so you can

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.130 
which has um a bunch of slots so you can
stick<00:02:17.160> all<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.430> wiring<00:02:17.840> behind<00:02:18.840> the

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
stick all the wiring behind the

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.680 
stick all the wiring behind the
motherboard<00:02:19.560> tray<00:02:19.769> so<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:21.060> inside<00:02:21.629> of

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
motherboard tray so that the inside of

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.180 
motherboard tray so that the inside of
the<00:02:21.780> case<00:02:21.930> will<00:02:22.140> look<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.349> little<00:02:22.440> cleaner<00:02:22.799> it's

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
the case will look a little cleaner it's

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.030 
the case will look a little cleaner it's
got<00:02:23.549> an<00:02:23.760> exhaust<00:02:24.120> on<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.420> back<00:02:24.629> and<00:02:25.440> also

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
got an exhaust on the back and also

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.600 
got an exhaust on the back and also
figure<00:02:26.910> 1<00:02:27.120> on<00:02:27.269> on<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.720> top<00:02:28.549> um<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:31.680> then<00:02:31.950> you

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
figure 1 on on the top um and then you

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.670 
figure 1 on on the top um and then you
can<00:02:32.760> see<00:02:32.970> on<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.180> back<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:34.590> has<00:02:35.810> two<00:02:36.810> little

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
can see on the back it has two little

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.949 
can see on the back it has two little
openings<00:02:38.310> so<00:02:38.730> if<00:02:38.849> you<00:02:38.940> decide<00:02:39.269> to<00:02:39.420> water<00:02:39.630> for

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
openings so if you decide to water for

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.559 
openings so if you decide to water for
your<00:02:40.049> system<00:02:40.940> it's<00:02:41.940> ready<00:02:42.269> for<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:44.239> yeah<00:02:45.239> and

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
your system it's ready for that yeah and

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.550 
your system it's ready for that yeah and
it's<00:02:45.750> its<00:02:46.319> overall<00:02:46.680> it's<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.069> really<00:02:47.099> nice<00:02:47.459> case

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
it's its overall it's a really nice case

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.390 
it's its overall it's a really nice case
it<00:02:49.560> comes<00:02:49.829> with<00:02:51.769> it<00:02:52.769> comes<00:02:53.010> with<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.190> lot<00:02:53.370> of
