one here this one here is bent just a

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.540 
one here this one here is bent just a
little<00:02:25.330> because<00:02:25.900> it<00:02:26.050> came<00:02:26.230> down<00:02:26.410> on<00:02:26.590> this<00:02:26.830> but

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
it could be rebuilt bent back and then

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.980 
it could be rebuilt bent back and then
strengthened<00:02:32.170> pretty<00:02:33.100> easy<00:02:33.690> but<00:02:34.690> it<00:02:34.810> just

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
strengthened pretty easy but it just

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.750 
strengthened pretty easy but it just
needs<00:02:35.230> it<00:02:35.530> needs<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.860> piece<00:02:36.130> from<00:02:36.340> here<00:02:36.610> to

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
needs it needs the piece from here to

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.750 
needs it needs the piece from here to
there<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:40.420> needs<00:02:40.720> this<00:02:41.280> cleaned<00:02:42.280> up<00:02:42.460> and

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
there and that needs this cleaned up and

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:50.520 
there and that needs this cleaned up and
fixed<00:02:45.390> just<00:02:46.390> got<00:02:46.600> one<00:02:47.530> break<00:02:47.860> single<00:02:49.530> disc

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530

really<00:04:40.700> really<00:04:41.240> good<00:04:41.479> engine<00:04:42.220> he'll<00:04:43.220> take

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
really really good engine he'll take
