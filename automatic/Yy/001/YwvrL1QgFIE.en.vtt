going<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:20.939> cover<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.600> standard<00:00:22.260> way<00:00:22.439> that

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
going to cover the standard way that

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.920 
going to cover the standard way that
everyone<00:00:22.830> has<00:00:23.070> taught<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.400> tuner<00:00:23.760> guitar<00:00:24.119> and

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
everyone has taught to tuner guitar and

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.839 
everyone has taught to tuner guitar and
it's<00:00:25.109> simply<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.590> fifth<00:00:25.830> fret<00:00:26.070> method<00:00:26.460> where

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
it's simply the fifth fret method where

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.019 
it's simply the fifth fret method where
you<00:00:26.880> fifth<00:00:27.150> fret<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:28.080> low<00:00:28.470> E<00:00:28.650> string<00:00:28.910> and<00:00:29.910> then

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
you fifth fret the low E string and then

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.799 
you fifth fret the low E string and then
tune<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.480> eight<00:00:31.040> the<00:00:32.040> next<00:00:32.309> train<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.809> to

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
tune the eight the next train to the to

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.020 
tune the eight the next train to the to
the<00:00:33.840> E<00:00:33.960> string<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:35.070> keep<00:00:35.280> going<00:00:35.550> up<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.700> Fred

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
the E string and keep going up to Fred

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.479 
the E string and keep going up to Fred
moving<00:00:36.930> down<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.559> fourth<00:00:38.010> fret<00:00:38.160> on<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.399> B

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
moving down to the fourth fret on the B

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.610 
moving down to the fourth fret on the B
string<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.239> forth<00:00:39.510> we'll<00:00:40.350> cover<00:00:40.500> that

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
string and so forth we'll cover that

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.229 
string and so forth we'll cover that
right<00:00:40.890> quick<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.340> method<00:00:41.820> goes<00:00:42.030> like

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
right quick so that method goes like

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.880 
right quick so that method goes like
this<00:00:44.000> and<00:00:45.000> what<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.210> do<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.570> striking<00:00:46.050> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
this and what you do is you striking the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.700 
this and what you do is you striking the
E<00:00:46.950> string<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.270> string<00:00:48.750> not<00:00:49.410> only

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
E string and the a string not only

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.110 
E string and the a string not only
fretting<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.750> E<00:00:51.750> string<00:00:52.230> at<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.440> fifth<00:00:52.739> fret

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.270 

and<00:00:55.260> never<00:00:56.260> peace<00:00:56.530> throughout<00:00:56.800> the<00:00:56.860> rest<00:00:57.160> of

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
and never peace throughout the rest of

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:06.120 
and never peace throughout the rest of
those<00:00:57.340> tracks<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:05.140> you<00:01:05.470> can<00:01:05.590> hear<00:01:05.710> my<00:01:05.830> guitars

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
those tracks and you can hear my guitars

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.450 
those tracks and you can hear my guitars
a<00:01:06.220> little<00:01:06.430> bit<00:01:06.520> out<00:01:06.640> of<00:01:06.670> town<00:01:06.909> so<00:01:08.460> hopefully

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
a little bit out of town so hopefully

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.530 
a little bit out of town so hopefully
will<00:01:09.580> correct<00:01:09.850> that<00:01:09.909> while<00:01:10.180> we're<00:01:10.330> doing

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
will correct that while we're doing

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.630 
will correct that while we're doing
these<00:01:10.630> methods<00:01:11.020> okay<00:01:11.800> so<00:01:11.860> you've<00:01:12.460> probably

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
these methods okay so you've probably

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.430 
these methods okay so you've probably
seen<00:01:12.850> many<00:01:13.030> videos<00:01:13.360> that<00:01:13.600> discuss<00:01:14.020> that

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
seen many videos that discuss that

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.710 
seen many videos that discuss that
method<00:01:14.800> however<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:16.240> problem<00:01:16.509> with<00:01:16.600> this

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
method however the problem with this

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.370 
method however the problem with this
method<00:01:16.780> is<00:01:17.460> why<00:01:18.460> you're<00:01:18.670> holding<00:01:19.000> it

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.670 

oh<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:23.130> Ross<00:01:23.369> I'm<00:01:23.939> Richter's<00:01:24.530> in<00:01:25.530> those

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
oh and Ross I'm Richter's in those

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.350 
oh and Ross I'm Richter's in those
strengths<00:01:26.070> are<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.280> just<00:01:26.670> remember<00:01:26.909> how<00:01:27.210> it

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
strengths are you just remember how it

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.859 
strengths are you just remember how it
sounds<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:29.689> then<00:01:30.689> two<00:01:30.899> and<00:01:30.930> then<00:01:31.320> do<00:01:31.560> it

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
sounds and then two and then do it

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.330 
sounds and then two and then do it
here's<00:01:33.869> another<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.350> an<00:01:34.500> optimum<00:01:34.979> method<00:01:35.250> that

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
here's another is an optimum method that

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.289 
here's another is an optimum method that
I<00:01:35.429> use<00:01:36.920> dealing<00:01:37.920> with<00:01:38.039> harmonics<00:01:38.579> what<00:01:39.240> I'm

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
I use dealing with harmonics what I'm

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.490 
I use dealing with harmonics what I'm
going<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.479> do<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.720> instead<00:01:39.929> of<00:01:40.049> pressing<00:01:40.259> on

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
going to do is instead of pressing on

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.649 
going to do is instead of pressing on
the<00:01:40.530> fifth<00:01:40.799> fret<00:01:40.920> i'm<00:01:41.220> gonna<00:01:41.460> harmonic<00:01:42.390> on<00:01:42.569> the

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
the fifth fret i'm gonna harmonic on the

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.779 
the fifth fret i'm gonna harmonic on the
fifth<00:01:42.899> grade<00:01:44.630> that's<00:01:45.630> gonna<00:01:45.780> make<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.049> eat<00:01:46.289> own

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
fifth grade that's gonna make a eat own

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:53.090 
fifth grade that's gonna make a eat own
same<00:01:47.789> as<00:01:47.939> open<00:01:48.240> string<00:01:51.170> on<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.530> string<00:01:52.590> I'm

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
same as open string on the a string I'm

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.089 
same as open string on the a string I'm
gonna<00:01:53.280> harmonic<00:01:53.729> on<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.939> set<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.149> foot<00:01:55.099> yeah

00:01:56.089 --> 00:01:56.099 
gonna harmonic on the set of foot yeah

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:00.350 
gonna harmonic on the set of foot yeah
it's<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.490> same<00:01:56.670> tone<00:01:57.349> it's<00:01:58.349> also<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.679> need<00:01:59.360> okay

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
it's the same tone it's also a need okay

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.089 
it's the same tone it's also a need okay
so<00:02:00.599> what<00:02:00.720> I'm<00:02:00.810> gonna<00:02:00.899> do<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.140> I'm<00:02:01.380> gonna<00:02:01.500> do

00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:02.099 
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:07.399 
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do
those<00:02:02.280> together<00:02:05.209> my<00:02:06.209> free<00:02:06.420> hand

turn to Tony pitch and here the warbling

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.509 
turn to Tony pitch and here the warbling
tone<00:02:12.560> that<00:02:13.560> allows<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:14.069> lets<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.370> know<00:02:14.489> that

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
tone that allows that lets you know that

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:20.330 
tone that allows that lets you know that
it's<00:02:14.819> not<00:02:14.879> until<00:02:18.410> it<00:02:19.410> goes<00:02:19.560> away<00:02:19.620> your<00:02:20.010> intern

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
as the notes are out of faith want to

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:33.100 
as the notes are out of faith want to
get<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.790> in<00:02:26.849> turn<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.180> get<00:02:27.330> in<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.540> mess

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.280 

hey

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.120 

you

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:54.180 

okay<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.610> next<00:02:42.760> race<00:02:46.980> next<00:02:47.980> to<00:02:48.160> stretch<00:02:53.190> as

we're<00:02:54.370> here<00:02:54.460> comes<00:02:54.700> a<00:02:54.790> problem<00:02:55.180> with<00:02:55.540> this

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
we're here comes a problem with this

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.860 
we're here comes a problem with this
method<00:02:55.750> is<00:02:56.170> you<00:02:56.320> can't<00:02:57.000> do<00:02:58.000> a<00:02:58.030> harmonic<00:02:58.540> on<00:02:58.690> the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
method is you can't do a harmonic on the

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.200 
method is you can't do a harmonic on the
g<00:02:59.530> string<00:02:59.560> and<00:03:00.040> on<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.520> B<00:03:00.670> string<00:03:00.730> have<00:03:01.090> the

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
g string and on the B string have the

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.000 
g string and on the B string have the
matter<00:03:02.790> they<00:03:03.790> don't<00:03:04.000> work<00:03:04.470> so<00:03:05.470> in<00:03:05.590> this<00:03:05.710> this

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
matter they don't work so in this this

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.470 
matter they don't work so in this this
is<00:03:06.160> where<00:03:06.310> this<00:03:06.430> method<00:03:06.850> fall<00:03:07.030> short<00:03:07.300> and<00:03:07.420> you

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
is where this method fall short and you

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.840 
is where this method fall short and you
have<00:03:07.630> to<00:03:07.750> you<00:03:08.200> can<00:03:08.320> do<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.530> harmonic<00:03:08.830> on<00:03:09.580> the

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
have to you can do to harmonic on the

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.750 
have to you can do to harmonic on the
fifth<00:03:10.240> fret<00:03:10.420> g<00:03:11.200> string<00:03:11.400> but<00:03:12.400> you<00:03:12.520> have<00:03:12.610> to

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
fifth fret g string but you have to

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:21.150 
fifth fret g string but you have to
press<00:03:13.000> eight<00:03:13.840> fret<00:03:14.260> on<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:16.690> B<00:03:16.810> string<00:03:20.160> but

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
press eight fret on the B string but

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.120 
press eight fret on the B string but
once<00:03:21.340> you<00:03:21.430> pass<00:03:21.640> that<00:03:21.820> strengthen<00:03:22.830> you<00:03:23.830> can<00:03:24.010> do

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
once you pass that strengthen you can do

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.510 
once you pass that strengthen you can do
the<00:03:24.280> same<00:03:24.460> 5th<00:03:24.940> fret<00:03:25.090> 7th<00:03:25.450> row<00:03:25.540> come<00:03:25.720> on<00:03:26.250> ok<00:03:27.250> so

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
the same 5th fret 7th row come on ok so

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.240 
the same 5th fret 7th row come on ok so
that's<00:03:27.700> method<00:03:28.060> to<00:03:28.270> of<00:03:28.480> 20<00:03:29.070> it<00:03:30.070> actually

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
that's method to of 20 it actually

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.160 
that's method to of 20 it actually
worked<00:03:30.550> pretty<00:03:30.670> good<00:03:31.050> method<00:03:32.050> 3<00:03:33.960> this<00:03:34.960> method

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
worked pretty good method 3 this method

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.350 
worked pretty good method 3 this method
is<00:03:35.380> very<00:03:35.440> similar<00:03:35.890> to<00:03:36.070> the<00:03:36.250> fifth<00:03:36.760> fret<00:03:36.910> method

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
is very similar to the fifth fret method

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.930 
is very similar to the fifth fret method
using<00:03:38.080> harmonics<00:03:38.530> except<00:03:39.040> for<00:03:39.070> you're<00:03:39.820> going

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
using harmonics except for you're going

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.730 
using harmonics except for you're going
to<00:03:40.000> be<00:03:40.090> using<00:03:40.240> the<00:03:40.480> 12th<00:03:40.840> fret<00:03:40.960> and<00:03:41.170> 7th<00:03:41.560> fret

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
to be using the 12th fret and 7th fret

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:54.030 
to be using the 12th fret and 7th fret
to<00:03:41.890> do<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.130> same

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:09.270 

you

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.850 

get<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:10.400> basic<00:04:10.700> idea<00:04:10.820> same<00:04:11.600> problem<00:04:11.860> occurs

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
get the basic idea same problem occurs

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.550 
get the basic idea same problem occurs
with<00:04:13.130> the<00:04:13.220> B<00:04:13.370> string<00:04:13.670> hey<00:04:15.459> Fred<00:04:16.459> 27<00:04:17.290> or<00:04:18.290> did<00:04:18.410> you

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
with the B string hey Fred 27 or did you

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.759 
with the B string hey Fred 27 or did you
get<00:04:19.010> to<00:04:19.130> know<00:04:20.019> but<00:04:21.019> then<00:04:21.079> you<00:04:21.200> can<00:04:21.380> move<00:04:21.500> on<00:04:21.650> to

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
get to know but then you can move on to

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:31.480 
get to know but then you can move on to
the<00:04:21.859> low<00:04:22.190> E<00:04:22.220> string<00:04:22.340> or<00:04:22.730> Louise<00:04:29.650> ok<00:04:30.650> now<00:04:31.160> this

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
the low E string or Louise ok now this

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.070 
the low E string or Louise ok now this
method<00:04:31.820> is<00:04:31.940> useful<00:04:32.090> if<00:04:32.360> you<00:04:32.480> got<00:04:32.660> intonation

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
method is useful if you got intonation

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.320 
method is useful if you got intonation
problems<00:04:33.590> where<00:04:34.310> your<00:04:34.730> guitar<00:04:35.090> gets

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
problems where your guitar gets

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.820 
problems where your guitar gets
increasingly<00:04:35.630> out<00:04:35.960> of<00:04:35.990> tune<00:04:36.200> as<00:04:36.410> you<00:04:36.530> move<00:04:36.710> up

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
increasingly out of tune as you move up

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.180 
increasingly out of tune as you move up
the<00:04:37.010> threats<00:04:37.570> and<00:04:38.620> you<00:04:39.620> don't<00:04:39.800> do<00:04:39.920> a<00:04:40.010> lot<00:04:40.070> of

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
the threats and you don't do a lot of

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.710 
the threats and you don't do a lot of
chords<00:04:40.550> drumming<00:04:40.880> down<00:04:41.030> here<00:04:41.210> look<00:04:41.390> close<00:04:41.570> to

chords drumming down here look close to
the<00:04:41.810> close<00:04:42.320> to<00:04:42.440> the<00:04:42.560> nut<00:04:42.970> that's<00:04:43.970> why<00:04:44.090> you<00:04:44.270> to

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
the close to the nut that's why you to

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.910 
the close to the nut that's why you to
tune<00:04:44.600> your<00:04:44.630> guitar<00:04:44.750> a<00:04:45.050> little<00:04:45.170> bit<00:04:45.440> closer<00:04:45.620> up

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
tune your guitar a little bit closer up

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.120 
tune your guitar a little bit closer up
to<00:04:46.100> the<00:04:46.250> to<00:04:47.210> the<00:04:47.240> bridge<00:04:47.600> it<00:04:48.140> maybe<00:04:48.440> give<00:04:49.010> you<00:04:49.100> a

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
to the to the bridge it maybe give you a

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.500 
to the to the bridge it maybe give you a
little<00:04:49.340> bit<00:04:49.550> tighter<00:04:49.790> tuning<00:04:50.210> up<00:04:50.330> there

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
little bit tighter tuning up there

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.030 
little bit tighter tuning up there
around<00:04:50.630> twelve<00:04:50.960> fret<00:04:52.030> ok<00:04:53.530> this<00:04:54.530> is<00:04:54.740> now<00:04:54.980> I'm

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
around twelve fret ok this is now I'm

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.350 
around twelve fret ok this is now I'm
going<00:04:55.160> to<00:04:55.250> show<00:04:55.280> you<00:04:55.430> a<00:04:55.520> fourth<00:04:55.910> method<00:04:56.120> of

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
going to show you a fourth method of

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.790 
going to show you a fourth method of
tuning<00:04:56.690> that<00:04:56.810> I<00:04:56.900> used<00:04:57.140> rather<00:04:57.320> frequently

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
tuning that I used rather frequently

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.370 
tuning that I used rather frequently
first<00:04:58.550> you<00:04:58.760> went<00:04:58.970> to<00:04:59.150> the<00:04:59.270> beginners<00:04:59.720> fifth

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
first you went to the beginners fifth

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.440 
first you went to the beginners fifth
fret<00:05:02.500> no<00:05:03.500> strength<00:05:03.830> however<00:05:04.490> instead<00:05:05.240> of<00:05:05.360> that

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
fret no strength however instead of that
