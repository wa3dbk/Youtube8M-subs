team really stepped up in the second
half<00:00:43.370> and<00:00:43.789> really<00:00:44.629> started<00:00:44.840> to<00:00:44.930> be<00:00:44.989> more

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
direct and getting some more shots on

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:49.239 
direct and getting some more shots on

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:49.249 
goal and we started playing out why we

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:50.500 
goal and we started playing out why we
started<00:00:49.460> looking<00:00:49.550> for<00:00:49.850> a<00:00:49.909> lil<00:00:50.059> another

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
started looking for a lil another

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.090 
started looking for a lil another
worldwide<00:00:50.809> and<00:00:51.050> that<00:00:51.199> created<00:00:51.739> more<00:00:51.920> space

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
worldwide and that created more space

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.250 
worldwide and that created more space
for<00:00:52.429> them<00:00:52.699> to<00:00:52.789> play<00:00:52.999> and<00:00:53.359> the<00:00:53.629> krabby<00:00:54.079> in<00:00:54.170> the

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
for them to play and the krabby in the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.930 
for them to play and the krabby in the
middle<00:00:54.499> forget<00:00:54.769> her<00:00:54.859> hat-trick<00:00:55.039> women<00:00:55.609> and

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
middle forget her hat-trick women and

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.910 
middle forget her hat-trick women and
then<00:00:56.390> we<00:00:56.809> just<00:00:56.960> compacted<00:00:57.440> the<00:00:57.559> game<00:00:57.710> a<00:00:57.739> little

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
then we just compacted the game a little

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.319 
then we just compacted the game a little
bit<00:00:58.039> more<00:00:58.249> you<00:00:58.399> know<00:00:58.489> the<00:00:58.519> defensive<00:00:59.059> pushing

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
bit more you know the defensive pushing

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.569 
bit more you know the defensive pushing
up<00:00:59.449> dolphins<00:01:00.140> was<00:01:00.319> coming<00:01:00.679> back<00:01:00.800> it<00:01:01.280> just<00:01:01.399> was

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
up dolphins was coming back it just was

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.030 
up dolphins was coming back it just was
a<00:01:01.640> lot<00:01:01.789> easier<00:01:01.969> to<00:01:02.149> play<00:01:02.359> I<00:01:02.629> think<00:01:03.620> there's<00:01:03.979> a

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
a lot easier to play I think there's a

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.070 
a lot easier to play I think there's a
little<00:01:04.100> bit<00:01:04.280> of<00:01:04.339> shock<00:01:04.600> when<00:01:05.600> it<00:01:05.690> was<00:01:05.930> late

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
little bit of shock when it was late

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.600 
little bit of shock when it was late
when<00:01:06.229> they<00:01:06.350> score<00:01:06.590> but<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:07.100> nice<00:01:07.250> thing<00:01:07.280> was

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
when they score but the nice thing was

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.070 
when they score but the nice thing was
then<00:01:07.940> was<00:01:08.090> in<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.210> first<00:01:08.270> five<00:01:08.720> minutes<00:01:08.960> of

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
then was in the first five minutes of

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.750 
then was in the first five minutes of
the<00:01:09.140> game<00:01:09.200> and<00:01:09.590> so<00:01:09.710> I<00:01:09.740> think<00:01:09.830> that<00:01:10.010> the<00:01:10.610> guys

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
the game and so I think that the guys

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.910 
the game and so I think that the guys
settle<00:01:11.540> this<00:01:11.630> down<00:01:11.840> a<00:01:11.870> little<00:01:11.960> bit<00:01:12.290> because<00:01:12.530> I

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
settle this down a little bit because I

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.680 
settle this down a little bit because I
think<00:01:12.979> we<00:01:13.280> might<00:01:13.760> have<00:01:13.880> started<00:01:14.090> off<00:01:14.540> a<00:01:14.570> little

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
think we might have started off a little

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.020 
think we might have started off a little
flat<00:01:15.110> but<00:01:15.140> uh<00:01:15.409> we<00:01:16.100> know<00:01:16.220> now<00:01:16.430> that<00:01:16.460> you<00:01:16.909> know

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
flat but uh we know now that you know

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.550 
flat but uh we know now that you know
five<00:01:17.300> minutes<00:01:17.660> still

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
five minutes still

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.020 
five minutes still
difference<00:01:18.920> in<00:01:19.009> the<00:01:19.100> game<00:01:19.220> and<00:01:19.549> we<00:01:19.670> got<00:01:19.820> to<00:01:19.939> be

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
difference in the game and we got to be

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.760 
difference in the game and we got to be
ready<00:01:20.149> the<00:01:20.840> Stars<00:01:21.110> it<00:01:21.229> was<00:01:21.320> fun<00:01:21.530> at<00:01:21.680> the

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
important because with a young team you

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.720 
important because with a young team you
don't<00:02:57.770> know<00:02:57.860> how<00:02:58.070> they're<00:02:58.280> going<00:02:58.370> to<00:02:58.430> react

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
don't know how they're going to react

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.640 
don't know how they're going to react
are<00:02:58.880> they<00:02:58.970> going<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.180> get<00:02:59.570> shaky<00:03:00.170> are<00:03:00.440> they

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
are they going to get shaky are they

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.920 
are they going to get shaky are they
going<00:03:00.830> to<00:03:00.920> raise<00:03:01.130> their<00:03:01.430> level<00:03:01.460> and<00:03:01.970> I<00:03:02.720> thought

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
going to raise their level and I thought

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.140 
going to raise their level and I thought
the<00:03:03.080> team<00:03:03.320> were<00:03:04.070> only<00:03:04.220> two<00:03:04.430> minutes<00:03:04.550> in<00:03:04.910> but<00:03:05.090> I

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
the team were only two minutes in but I

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.150 
the team were only two minutes in but I
thought<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.540> team<00:03:05.750> definitely<00:03:06.160> performed

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
thought the team definitely performed

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.580 
thought the team definitely performed
very<00:03:07.370> well<00:03:07.430> they<00:03:07.760> raise<00:03:07.970> their<00:03:08.180> level<00:03:08.590> we

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
very well they raise their level we

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:10.900 
very well they raise their level we
didn't<00:03:09.860> get<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.070> tying<00:03:10.310> goal<00:03:10.400> for<00:03:10.700> a<00:03:10.730> long

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
didn't get the tying goal for a long

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.560 
didn't get the tying goal for a long
time<00:03:11.210> and<00:03:12.160> we<00:03:13.160> never<00:03:13.370> got<00:03:13.580> rattled<00:03:13.790> so<00:03:14.150> it<00:03:14.300> was

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
time and we never got rattled so it was

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.530 
time and we never got rattled so it was
important<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:16.640> main<00:03:16.850> thing<00:03:16.880> that<00:03:17.150> we've<00:03:17.420> been
