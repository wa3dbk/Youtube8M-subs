views on the role of wood in modern
architecture<00:00:21.439> so<00:00:22.439> I've<00:00:22.800> become<00:00:23.220> passionate

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:23.849 
architecture so I've become passionate

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:26.200 
architecture so I've become passionate
about<00:00:24.269> this<00:00:24.630> idea<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.230> wood<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:25.740> an

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
about this idea that wood is an

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.790 
about this idea that wood is an
incredible<00:00:27.210> material<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.839> it's<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.560> think

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
incredible material and it's I think

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.189 
incredible material and it's I think
going<00:00:29.250> through<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.580> really<00:00:30.210> interesting<00:00:30.689> phase

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
going through a really interesting phase

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.710 
going through a really interesting phase
of<00:00:31.650> being<00:00:32.430> reinvented<00:00:33.090> in<00:00:33.420> modern

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
of being reinvented in modern

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.390 
of being reinvented in modern
architecture<00:00:33.870> for<00:00:34.470> a<00:00:34.530> long<00:00:34.770> time<00:00:35.010> for<00:00:35.310> the

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:35.400 
architecture for a long time for the

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.400 
architecture for a long time for the
last<00:00:35.490> century<00:00:35.760> we'd<00:00:36.510> seen<00:00:36.870> concrete<00:00:37.320> and

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
last century we'd seen concrete and

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.290 
last century we'd seen concrete and
steel<00:00:37.590> really<00:00:37.920> take<00:00:38.130> over<00:00:38.340> as<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.910> modern

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
steel really take over as the modern

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.960 
steel really take over as the modern
materials<00:00:39.900> the<00:00:40.110> man-made<00:00:40.620> materials<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.700> now

materials the man-made materials and now

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.760 
materials the man-made materials and now
I<00:00:42.000> think<00:00:42.150> we're<00:00:42.390> realizing<00:00:42.900> that<00:00:43.170> natural

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
I think we're realizing that natural

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.080 
I think we're realizing that natural
materials<00:00:44.250> are<00:00:44.430> perhaps<00:00:44.610> far<00:00:45.060> more

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
materials are perhaps far more

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.900 
materials are perhaps far more
sophisticated<00:00:45.680> far<00:00:46.680> better<00:00:47.070> for<00:00:47.370> our<00:00:47.610> health

sophisticated far better for our health
to<00:00:48.210> be<00:00:48.360> around<00:00:48.660> far<00:00:49.020> better<00:00:49.260> for<00:00:49.560> the<00:00:49.740> planet

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570

into the making and manufacturing of
just<00:00:56.790> steel<00:00:57.150> and<00:00:57.330> concrete<00:00:57.690> we<00:00:58.260> need<00:00:58.440> to

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560 
just steel and concrete we need to

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.980 
just steel and concrete we need to
reduce<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.190> the<00:01:00.030> forests<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.690> trees

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:00.990 
reduce that and the forests and trees

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.770 
reduce that and the forests and trees
have<00:01:01.560> this<00:01:01.830> incredible<00:01:02.460> advantage<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:03.060> both

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
have this incredible advantage of both

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.509 
have this incredible advantage of both
being<00:01:04.110> lower<00:01:04.350> energy<00:01:04.830> materials<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.489> work

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
being lower energy materials to work

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.179 
being lower energy materials to work
with<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:06.149> also<00:01:06.570> trees<00:01:07.350> soak<00:01:07.649> up<00:01:07.829> carbon

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
with but also trees soak up carbon

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.099 
with but also trees soak up carbon
dioxide<00:01:08.670> as<00:01:08.820> they<00:01:08.969> grow<00:01:09.270> when<00:01:09.719> you<00:01:09.750> harvest

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:10.109 
dioxide as they grow when you harvest

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:12.080 
dioxide as they grow when you harvest
them<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.679> carbon<00:01:11.009> dioxide<00:01:11.039> stored<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.030> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
them that carbon dioxide stored in the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.179 
them that carbon dioxide stored in the
material<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.140> really<00:01:13.710> are<00:01:13.740> creating

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
material and so you really are creating

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.310 
material and so you really are creating
a<00:01:14.310> sink<00:01:15.000> for<00:01:15.210> carbon<00:01:15.240> dioxide<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.079> helping

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
a sink for carbon dioxide and helping

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.739 
a sink for carbon dioxide and helping
address<00:01:16.619> climate<00:01:16.859> change<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.240> really

00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:18.749 
address climate change that is really

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:20.510 
address climate change that is really
the<00:01:18.899> exact<00:01:19.229> opposite<00:01:19.829> of<00:01:20.070> most<00:01:20.280> other

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the exact opposite of most other

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.580 
the exact opposite of most other
materials<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.270> we<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:21.960> build<00:01:22.170> with<00:01:22.229> in

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
materials that we that we build with in

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.349 
materials that we that we build with in
the<00:01:22.679> world<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.789> know<00:01:23.880> trees<00:01:24.179> have

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:24.359 
the world and so you know trees have

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:26.389 
the world and so you know trees have
this<00:01:24.450> very<00:01:24.899> unique<00:01:25.109> role<00:01:25.409> in<00:01:25.679> helping<00:01:26.130> us

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
this very unique role in helping us

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:28.999 
this very unique role in helping us
counteract<00:01:26.909> climate<00:01:27.390> as<00:01:28.020> long<00:01:28.469> as<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.829> cut<00:01:28.979> the

sustainability as a matter of

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.999 
sustainability as a matter of
responsibility<00:01:36.450> whenever<00:01:37.380> we<00:01:37.590> go<00:01:37.770> about

responsibility whenever we go about

wonderful to know that when we source

for us if we think about sustainable

for us if we think about sustainable
forestry<00:01:52.930> it's<00:01:53.380> about<00:01:54.120> really<00:01:55.120> understanding

forestry it's about really understanding

replant trees properly that we are

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.110 
replant trees properly that we are
creating<00:02:11.770> a<00:02:11.860> really<00:02:12.160> organic<00:02:12.760> way<00:02:12.940> of

thinking about the future of building

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.490 
thinking about the future of building
we've<00:02:14.740> seen<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:14.980> huge<00:02:15.220> change<00:02:15.340> over<00:02:15.970> time<00:02:16.180> where

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
we've seen a huge change over time where

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.690 
we've seen a huge change over time where
you<00:02:17.500> know<00:02:17.590> environmental<00:02:18.220> groups<00:02:18.430> who<00:02:18.610> have

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
you know environmental groups who have

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.670 
you know environmental groups who have
thankfully<00:02:19.120> been<00:02:19.510> very<00:02:20.020> wonderful<00:02:20.260> at

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
thankfully been very wonderful at

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.440 
thankfully been very wonderful at
protecting<00:02:21.070> the<00:02:21.490> interests<00:02:21.880> of<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.030> forests

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
protecting the interests of the forests

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.690 
protecting the interests of the forests
have<00:02:22.540> also<00:02:23.020> come<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.590> understand<00:02:24.070> that<00:02:24.250> and

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
have also come to understand that and

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.670 
have also come to understand that and
using<00:02:25.000> trees<00:02:25.270> is<00:02:25.450> actually<00:02:25.840> very<00:02:26.050> much<00:02:26.170> part

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
using trees is actually very much part

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.890 
using trees is actually very much part
of<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.010> environmental<00:02:27.670> story<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:28.390> so<00:02:28.750> we've

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
of the environmental story and so we've

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.210 
of the environmental story and so we've
seen<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.170> transformation<00:02:29.440> without

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
seen a transformation without

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.360 
seen a transformation without
understanding<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:32.410> real<00:02:32.590> revolution<00:02:32.830> that's

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
understanding the real revolution that's

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.520 
understanding the real revolution that's
happening<00:02:33.489> in<00:02:33.940> wood<00:02:34.150> is<00:02:34.390> is<00:02:34.660> because<00:02:35.020> we're<00:02:35.350> no

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
happening in wood is is because we're no

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.590 
happening in wood is is because we're no
longer<00:02:35.890> thinking<00:02:36.280> of<00:02:36.400> wood<00:02:36.640> as<00:02:36.820> these<00:02:37.030> solid

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
longer thinking of wood as these solid

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.870 
longer thinking of wood as these solid

Timbers coming from old-growth trees

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.390 
Timbers coming from old-growth trees
we're<00:02:40.150> thinking<00:02:40.480> about<00:02:40.600> wood<00:02:41.050> as<00:02:41.400> younger

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
we're thinking about wood as younger

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.940 
we're thinking about wood as younger
trees<00:02:42.780> gluing<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:43.930> wood<00:02:44.110> fiber<00:02:44.350> together<00:02:44.739> to

trees gluing the wood fiber together to

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.790 
trees gluing the wood fiber together to
make<00:02:45.100> very<00:02:45.459> strong<00:02:45.610> very<00:02:46.180> large<00:02:46.750> panels<00:02:47.470> of

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
make very strong very large panels of

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.100 
make very strong very large panels of
wood<00:02:48.400> or<00:02:48.550> engineered<00:02:49.060> wood<00:02:49.300> that<00:02:49.690> are<00:02:49.780> very

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
wood or engineered wood that are very

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.229 
wood or engineered wood that are very
very<00:02:50.380> strong<00:02:50.709> wood<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.400> it's<00:02:51.580> strength<00:02:52.000> to

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
very strong wood and it's strength to

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.870 
very strong wood and it's strength to
its<00:02:52.390> weight<00:02:52.660> is<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:54.040> know<00:02:54.100> comparable<00:02:54.760> to

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
its weight is you know comparable to

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.720 
its weight is you know comparable to
steel<00:02:55.120> than<00:02:55.510> concrete<00:02:55.870> and<00:02:55.989> so<00:02:56.500> its<00:02:56.730> aníbal

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
steel than concrete and so its aníbal

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.270 
steel than concrete and so its aníbal
material<00:02:58.180> for<00:02:59.080> a<00:02:59.110> natural<00:02:59.410> material<00:02:59.530> and<00:03:00.010> so

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
material for a natural material and so

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.160 
material for a natural material and so
that<00:03:00.459> change<00:03:00.880> in<00:03:01.090> technology<00:03:01.390> also<00:03:01.989> means

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
that change in technology also means

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.259 
that change in technology also means
that<00:03:02.290> we're<00:03:02.590> using<00:03:02.739> younger<00:03:03.340> trees<00:03:03.489> faster

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
that we're using younger trees faster

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:05.580 
that we're using younger trees faster
growing<00:03:04.840> trees<00:03:05.080> trees<00:03:05.410> that<00:03:05.440> actually

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
growing trees trees that actually

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.650 
growing trees trees that actually
sequestered<00:03:06.549> carbon<00:03:06.940> dioxide<00:03:07.420> from<00:03:07.540> the

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
sequestered carbon dioxide from the

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.750 
sequestered carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere<00:03:07.950> faster<00:03:08.950> when<00:03:09.340> they're<00:03:09.519> young<00:03:09.730> and

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
atmosphere faster when they're young and

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.180 
atmosphere faster when they're young and
so<00:03:10.150> they're<00:03:10.360> harnessing<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.440> carbon<00:03:11.739> dioxide

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
so they're harnessing the carbon dioxide

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.100 
so they're harnessing the carbon dioxide
in<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.400> in<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:12.790> wood<00:03:13.000> when<00:03:13.330> we<00:03:13.480> build<00:03:13.780> with<00:03:13.959> it

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
in the in the wood when we build with it

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.470 
in the in the wood when we build with it
a<00:03:14.260> little<00:03:14.709> more<00:03:14.950> and<00:03:15.250> so<00:03:15.459> for<00:03:16.090> all<00:03:16.239> these

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
a little more and so for all these

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.120 
a little more and so for all these
reasons<00:03:16.720> we<00:03:17.140> now<00:03:17.260> have<00:03:17.500> these<00:03:17.650> products

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
reasons we now have these products

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.190 
reasons we now have these products
because<00:03:18.459> of<00:03:18.489> their<00:03:18.760> large<00:03:19.060> scale<00:03:19.510> that<00:03:19.959> allow

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
because of their large scale that allow

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.140 
because of their large scale that allow
us<00:03:20.230> to<00:03:20.470> build<00:03:20.620> much<00:03:20.950> larger<00:03:21.489> scale<00:03:21.730> buildings

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
us to build much larger scale buildings

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.600 
us to build much larger scale buildings
and<00:03:22.390> it<00:03:22.900> makes<00:03:23.140> it<00:03:23.290> a<00:03:23.350> very<00:03:23.380> exciting<00:03:23.980> time<00:03:24.549> to

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
and it makes it a very exciting time to

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.880 
and it makes it a very exciting time to
be<00:03:24.850> a<00:03:24.880> designer<00:03:25.239> and<00:03:25.600> it's<00:03:25.959> an<00:03:26.110> exciting<00:03:26.739> thing

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
be a designer and it's an exciting thing

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.410 
be a designer and it's an exciting thing
to<00:03:26.950> think<00:03:27.220> about<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.489> future<00:03:27.670> of<00:03:27.880> cities<00:03:28.090> with

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
to think about the future of cities with

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.090 
to think about the future of cities with
these<00:03:28.570> much<00:03:28.870> taller<00:03:29.170> much<00:03:29.590> bigger<00:03:29.860> wood

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
these much taller much bigger wood

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.770 
these much taller much bigger wood
buildings<00:03:30.519> really<00:03:30.850> start<00:03:31.390> have<00:03:31.480> become<00:03:31.750> a

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
buildings really start have become a

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.960 
buildings really start have become a
very<00:03:32.049> common<00:03:32.410> part<00:03:32.860> of<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.010> way<00:03:33.250> we<00:03:33.430> live<00:03:33.640> as

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
very common part of the way we live as

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.270 
very common part of the way we live as
architects<00:03:34.540> this<00:03:35.140> is<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.410> first<00:03:35.830> time<00:03:36.100> we've

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
architects this is the first time we've

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.830 
architects this is the first time we've
had<00:03:36.400> a<00:03:36.459> new<00:03:36.700> structural<00:03:37.120> material<00:03:37.600> to<00:03:37.690> build

had a new structural material to build

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.140 
had a new structural material to build
within<00:03:38.110> a<00:03:38.470> century<00:03:38.680> I<00:03:39.040> absolutely<00:03:39.820> am

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
within a century I absolutely am

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.120 
within a century I absolutely am
convinced<00:03:40.780> that<00:03:40.989> these<00:03:41.500> buildings<00:03:41.950> will

convinced that these buildings will
become<00:03:42.430> commonplace<00:03:42.910> that<00:03:43.450> we<00:03:43.600> will<00:03:43.780> all<00:03:43.930> not

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
become commonplace that we will all not
