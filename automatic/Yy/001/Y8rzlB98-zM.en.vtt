00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:02.360
 now take a deep breath 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.910
 Let's play together in the world's longest running car and see up close is a 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.910
 privilege 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.289
 In this quiet city in the north-east of France, some of the 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.529
 best white wines in the region 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.359
 but here also did not fail the home of another new map tool 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:23.280
 contributions 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.310
 to phase 6 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.310
 thousand times the smallest 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:32.330
 Can you believe that the fastest car? 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.330
 and powerful in the world was born here 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.550
 despite its founder Alfred Hitchcock having been born in Italy 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.740
 the intention was installed in the small town hall in the region of the band 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.690
 in fact, as the case was known 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.240
 required that their cars be works of art 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.690
 with 27 points 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.690
 and ends up suffering horrors 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.080
 his really impressive mother the width of the caribbean image is very air 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.860
 is almost the breadth to honor those of bread america-rn 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.110
 everything changed this will be the pair starting with the local motorcycle club 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.550
 There are 16 cylinders in four tubes that make the power reach 1,000 in 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.580
 a horse 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.780
 in other words 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.670
 is one of the best and most modern engines that has ever 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.670
 last goal 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.790
 I only have marta from medina syllables marta 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.980
 I have lace feet go 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.510
 curious to know the maximum speed 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.510
 407 km 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.940
 the structure that the problem for those piloting a practice mothers they covered 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.880
 a place to walk at this speed 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.910
 the sports car is all the same, I do not feel any difficulty 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.910
 we will try 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.160
 it looks cool airplane, huh? 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.210
 clear 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.739
 the skin is very fast 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:19.399
 as an actor worked at maximum power at 5 liters of gasoline per kilometer 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:23.689
 you did not understand me wrong 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:26.689
 is more or less the same as an open faucet 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:33.479
 It's awesome the hour I paid but it will have pain I think it deposits 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:37.360
 literally the half lÃ©o horses he has on the body over the head 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.360
 and over my heart it's okay to get out by the mouth 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.540
 look what to call the rocket ferry and it is not no exaggeration 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.139
 Space engineers have developed the brakes that have tiscoski 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:52.839
 carbon ceramics 

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:56.069
 just take a look 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.419
 they have the same diameter as a 15 inch rim wheel it can stop the 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:06.579
 car of 400 per hour December still second chipp the new grade zero gives a 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.979
 extra help in stopping acting as aerodynamic brake just like one of the 

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:20.750
 denounce the allegations that 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.479
 followed by a race car 

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:25.649
 the ex-hostages of cylinders produce 

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:27.739
 but very hot 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.340
 phrases viva viva summer has nothing less than play day 2 using 40 liters 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.179
 of water 

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:38.599
 while the majority of cases lurk we only two books 

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:44.189
 if you find it exciting to have one of the most exclusive positions in the world 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.829
 just take a look at the surprise that we have at the time of recording 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.269
 but it erred the direct action of electing to 0 in the quay of the place of the district of the rock and 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.079
 you suddenly snuff or 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:58.959
 two mouth through time 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.289
 It's hard to see the case and walking through the 

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:06.289
 6 attended streets around the world 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:11.159
 a car that goes from 400 per hour aerodynamic 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:13.939
 is as important as patents 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:18.390
 the tongue shapes of the wings of an airplane no one survived 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.199
 no use changing the world the rear window 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.740
 here any complicated maneuver 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.710
 so the parking spot has to be great because if you 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.770
 you will see that it ranks in an ana the loss is 9 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.659
 the set of wheels and tires made exclusively for him 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:42.210
 one hundred twenty thousand reais 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.330
 after so many numbers there is one more that it definitely does in place of 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.039
 a rare monkey gem 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.180
 or brescia 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.840
 it costs here in europe 3 million reais if you come back to Brazil to 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.840
 Passaredo 6 million 

00:04:59.059 --> 00:05:02.889
 there are none that I am not surprised because the government searches for data from the 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:04.629
 organization 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:08.289
 husband by a woman camera just to wait for a reminder 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:17.629
 having the chance to drive this dream machine is really a special moment 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.999
 deserves to be remembered how to build in with via 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:25.359
 on the outside and why I do not believe the doors closed 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.800
 Let's make it already believe it. 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.840
 logo today's sketch ends here we'll be back on Sunday coming at nine 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.970
 in the morning
