00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.780
 Hello everyone, today we are in a guise 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.650
 different we usually do in recipes 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.879
 of cooking 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:16.039
 today instead we are defender snake reeds 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:19.010
 today instead we have uploaded one 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.440
 berth was there for our kitten 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.800
 matisse with the things we already have in 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.660
 home is a very fast thing and 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.000
 easy to do now let's go to 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.890
 see how our project will be 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.890
 a mesh of files 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.790
 then I used this here as you can 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.579
 also as a padding you can also 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.930
 to make old shirts in short that 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.670
 you do n't need them anymore 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.700
 I usually jump this place 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.460
 in fact, under the doors I don't know how 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.579
 it's called a draft excluder I think I won't do 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:56.690
 pass that from under the doors o 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:01:00.530
 near old ones for chairs and 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:05.420

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:08.000
