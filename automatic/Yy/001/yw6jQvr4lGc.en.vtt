00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Marcela take some pictures of us!

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
OK!

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.500
Include Catalina.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.300
Are you recording this?

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.500
I feel stupid now.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
They are not cool.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.500
What? I love them!

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.000
Every place I go I hang a snake on my neck.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.500
No Way!

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.500
And those scales!

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I think it´s funny

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
how they stick together.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Where? Where? Where is it?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
It's really angry!

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The tiger is angry

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
you see, it's angry.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
It's bored!

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It's so cute!

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The Jaguar or Tigre Mariposo (Butterfly Tiger)

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Typical from Colombia.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
It´s so cute!

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Look at its beautiful eyes!

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.000
Awww

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.000
Hi!

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.000
Hi!

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
It´s pregnant or just had a baby

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
because it has a belly.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.500
They are definitely the kings.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.500
Look at their place,

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.000
not even tigers.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Well, do something entertaining,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
everyone has done something cool!

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
That was like phone sex, right?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
(LOL)

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
It's getting ready,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and the other one is so relaaaxed!

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Awww they groom each other.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
That massage looks nice!

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
It looks like a stuffed animal,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
look at its face!

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.000
Hello!

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.000
Hello!

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
It's posing for us!

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
This is a "Tití del Chocó"

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.500
Don't throw your food!

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.000
It's peeling it.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
It's a family!

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Do you see them?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Yes I do!

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
They have a baby.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.500
We are walking through

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.500
the spider-monkeys area

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.000
to get to the other side of the park.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.700
There's still park of the zoo

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.000
we haven´t seen

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
as well as parts of the park.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
We are going to eat something,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
He have walked a lot

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and we need a break.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
We are in the second floor

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
looking for some desserts.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.000
This lamp is made with clay.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
This is so beautiful,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
It's Noah's Ark Colombian Style.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
It seems like the "Guatín"

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
came here to the squirrel's house

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
because it doesn't have one.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
I don't know its behavior

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
but I think it ate the squirrel

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
in order to steal its home.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
I apologize,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
we missunderstood the situation.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
This is not the "Guatín"

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000
This is a "Lapa" (Paca)

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and the "Guatín"

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
is at its place

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
and didn´t eat the squirrel.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Please forgive us.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
The squirrel was fine,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
in a different house.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Its weight is around one and a half tons,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
they can weigh up to four tons.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
It is eight years old.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.000
Hi!

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Take a picture!

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.500
What a show!

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.500
Do it again!

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.500
The peacock is standing on its sign

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.500
explaining itself.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.500
We are planning to put it

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.500
in 9GAG and call it

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.000
the Obvious Bird.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Yeah, the Self Referential Peacock!

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Here are some prints.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Cool!

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Hi Birdl!

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
It is gorgeous!

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
It is drinking water.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Birds love to drink water

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
in disgusting places.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Call him, zoo whisperer.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Catalina has animal powers!

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
It is angry.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
It's like it's saying:

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
This is my place!

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Look at its back,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
It's aware of us!

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Oh! God!

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Hi!

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.500
The Parrot: Quiere Cacao!

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.000
They are all wet.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
They are asleep.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
We ended our visit to the zoo at the snake

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
and continued walking arround the park.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
if you didn't see our visit to the park,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
the link to the last episode is at the end.
