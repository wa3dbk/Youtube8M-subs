cartridges in fact they were very

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.240 
cartridges in fact they were very
similar<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.030> buying<00:01:03.480> one<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.559> canons<00:01:05.010> own

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
similar to buying one of canons own

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.240 
similar to buying one of canons own
cartridges<00:01:06.500> but<00:01:07.500> they<00:01:07.680> were<00:01:07.740> much<00:01:08.220> cheaper

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250
