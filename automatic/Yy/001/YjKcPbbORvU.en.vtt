00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
this but I have a holographic sight on

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.620 
this but I have a holographic sight on
it<00:01:58.409> now<00:01:59.630> um<00:02:01.880> but<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.030> worked<00:02:03.270> great

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
putting this on my sniper rifle as a 45

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.730 
putting this on my sniper rifle as a 45
degree<00:02:13.230> mouth

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
degree mouth

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.590 
degree mouth
saw<00:02:14.070> like<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.340> flip<00:02:14.610> off-site<00:02:15.060> in<00:02:15.360> case

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
saw like a flip off-site in case

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.910 
saw like a flip off-site in case
someone's<00:02:15.990> like<00:02:16.140> running<00:02:16.410> at<00:02:16.530> me<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:16.710> then

I<00:02:22.130> would<00:02:23.130> definitely<00:02:23.550> recommend<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:24.090> um<00:02:24.300> it's

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
I would definitely recommend it um it's

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.990 
I would definitely recommend it um it's
a<00:02:24.900> great<00:02:25.020> beginner<00:02:25.440> site<00:02:25.770> I<00:02:26.100> could<00:02:26.550> I<00:02:26.730> mean<00:02:26.880> I

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
a great beginner site I could I mean I

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.220 
a great beginner site I could I mean I
would<00:02:27.210> even<00:02:27.420> use<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.690> for<00:02:27.720> maybe<00:02:28.110> an

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
would even use it for maybe an

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.310 
would even use it for maybe an
intermediate<00:02:28.710> player<00:02:29.750> now<00:02:30.750> if<00:02:30.840> your<00:02:30.960> expert

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
intermediate player now if your expert

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.480 
intermediate player now if your expert
you're<00:02:31.440> probably<00:02:31.590> going<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:31.860> go<00:02:32.190> with<00:02:32.340> like<00:02:32.460> a

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
you're probably going to go with like a

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.540 
you're probably going to go with like a
holographic<00:02:32.970> but<00:02:33.390> for<00:02:33.930> this<00:02:34.250> it's<00:02:35.250> great<00:02:35.430> for

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
holographic but for this it's great for

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.330 
holographic but for this it's great for
any<00:02:35.700> in<00:02:36.030> your<00:02:36.240> media<00:02:36.660> players
