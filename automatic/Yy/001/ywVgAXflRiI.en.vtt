 partner is the good old propaganda 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.470
 maybe the naughty new winter trend 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.210
 you have to ask that if for 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.550
 for example, the Bundeswehr just like one 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.150
 so-called showroom in berlin opened 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.800

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.650

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.180
 There is nothing better than ours 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.369

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.680
 and that's why there are the fat ones now 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.050

 the strong troop they can 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.829
 These trends out on the screen 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.410
 once explain why the Bundeswehr 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.090
 Probably the Bundeswehr is a high 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.899
 attractive employer you can 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.539

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.070

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.670
 the Bundeswehr attractive employer 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.170
 because many use areas used 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:57.860
 The Bundeswehr as attractive 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.860
 employer has offered great job 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:08.479

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:10.750
 Offers we try on the new 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.250

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.300

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:05.869
 Minister of Police intervened 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.069
