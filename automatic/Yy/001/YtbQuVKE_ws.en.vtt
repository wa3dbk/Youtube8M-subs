00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.340
 goethe and beautiful 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.149
 not nice that he turned on today 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.149
 I show you 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.320
 my karas i show you today like you 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.320
 on a 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:21.800
 from frei.wild does not vollidioten 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.800
 plays 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:29.720
 relatively easy to play there 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.849
 just a lot of chords are and this one 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.849
 I will show you now 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.360
 WulsbÃ¼ttel 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.079
 So I hope that everything sees here 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.019
 well 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.909
 In any case always with a pick 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:57.190
 player here but that you should 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:58.520
 maybe we have known for some time 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.430
 played 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.220
 I have 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.180
 I currently have 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.160
 but this 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.409
 I have it myself and not myself 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.850
 taught but with a kind 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.679
 but with a culture I do not anymore 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.970
 Wise flies with German supervision 

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:17.230
 So it's easy 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.620
 the finger 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.620
 while 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.590
 so berlin found mourning first 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.720
 He puts his forefinger 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.720
 but with the side 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.470
 ring finger 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.470
 Yes 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.400
 us 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.500
 the side and the little finger directly 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.940
 behind it 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.940
 this sounds like that 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.090
 with that you have the accord a 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.979
 but also something else 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.929
 that depends on how it feels better 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.170
 just the index finger here is one 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.810
 a little bit better 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.000
 the fingers 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.800
 on the two sides 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.940
 the two sides he gives up 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.270
 the rescue lie on the side 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.270
 and then 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.739
 the pensions stop 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.019
 The viewer something determined because of that 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.000
 Unfortunately I can not play but you 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:32.930
 need 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.829
 Idea and the bet on the game 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.829
 really critical 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.310
 always one more but I'm making 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.310
 to play the right chords 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.980
 by the way , the intro begins the intro 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.720
 next to it with an a 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.720
 and around us again 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.580
 when is it ever? 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:12.790
 we see he puts his finger on the 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:16.190
 from the third wish of the spouses 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.580
 is her on the fifth and the work 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.270
 and the little finger 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.940
 behind it 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.860
 on the 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.860
 with us the world 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:39.489
 that's shopping almost only 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.489
 yet one of the Actros is that it 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.260
 I do not know if that's with the guitar 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.260
 hears 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.610
 it is relatively easy to play 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.240
 namely almost as like going that 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:02.100
 shifts your fingers 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.100
 first point of the page 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.379
 third bunch of 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.379
 worked and 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.060
 the bet 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:20.019
 so that would be the intro 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.080
 and certainly he also wanted a 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.860
 a little more trainer wanted 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.969
 actually the whole song will be 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.639
 the whole thing will not be if the 

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:31.919
 doing sport would be split up report 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.659
 because the solopart can not do that 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.050
 I have to practice so well and there I can 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:38.460
 then help with the same 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:42.409
 definitely make now first the 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.409
 rescue guitar rig later 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:50.139
 so he has two options next and 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:50.139
 last after a short play that is 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.020
 I hope that I mean voter very good 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.900
 until playful I know I know that 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.430
 happens to me from time to time but that is 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.180
 it is difficult for English 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.540
 improve 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.050
 definitely 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.340
 c as hindered 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.659
 consists of the course had to 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.659
 tighten 24 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.430
 eight of the eighteen bund 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.030
 head 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:48.700
 the isar of us thought 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:52.560
 are a-side colorful under ten points 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.880
 the people you have the goal 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.650
 many would find it easier to look after them 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.960
 play is not right there because you 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.940
 then pretty much with the fingers 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:05.710
 he understands so liu back and forth 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:07.210
 I have to walk and I do not think so 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.310
 optimally because of that there is also still 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.789
 a second topic of many could 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.789
 are countless 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:20.559
 my guitar on the side something 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:22.270
 It is determined how you get like that 

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:24.580
 I should not be able to sound that unfortunately 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.940
 show that he can measure weeks 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:30.180
 his 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:33.930
 third bund currently working grant 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:36.080
 fifth bund the side of the small 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:39.600
 finger as always changed as usual 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:42.660
 then they are actually a tougher 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.610
 but that is a hair now 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.530
 become out of this and if you are upset 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.860
 I hope you are only one more time 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.080
 vote 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.150
 that will be synonymous on the next video 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.730
 to have 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:55.100
 In any case, the stop should that 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:59.470
 then i have to level that up 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.470
 you should play like that 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.520
 something my face
