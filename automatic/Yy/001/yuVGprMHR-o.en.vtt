00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.830 

forget<00:01:22.600> about<00:01:22.630> that<00:01:22.810> big<00:01:25.439> yeah<00:01:27.240> also<00:01:28.240> I<00:01:28.509> kind

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
forget about that big yeah also I kind

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.660 
forget about that big yeah also I kind
of<00:01:28.900> want<00:01:29.110> to<00:01:29.320> lower<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:30.130> I<00:01:32.520> kinda<00:01:33.520> want<00:01:33.640> to

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
of want to lower the I kinda want to

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:34.800 
of want to lower the I kinda want to
lower<00:01:33.790> the<00:01:33.940> terrain<00:01:34.210> what<00:01:34.360> I<00:01:34.420> kind<00:01:34.630> of<00:01:34.659> don't

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
lower the terrain what I kind of don't

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
lower the terrain what I kind of don't
at<00:01:34.899> the<00:01:34.990> same<00:01:35.140> time<00:01:35.290> because<00:01:35.649> then<00:01:35.799> people

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
at the same time because then people

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:42.139 
at the same time because then people
can't<00:01:36.369> get<00:01:36.490> into<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:36.790> exhibit<00:01:37.080> which<00:01:38.080> sucks

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.399 

create<00:01:43.149> cliffs<00:01:43.920> control<00:01:44.920> of<00:01:45.070> height<00:01:46.350> reckon<00:01:47.350> I

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
create cliffs control of height reckon I

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.399 
create cliffs control of height reckon I
could<00:01:47.470> do<00:01:47.619> this<00:01:47.770> I<00:01:48.840> think<00:01:49.840> I<00:01:49.899> can<00:01:50.020> do<00:01:50.110> this<00:01:50.140> this

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
could do this I think I can do this this

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.029 
could do this I think I can do this this
would<00:01:51.070> be<00:01:51.159> apparently<00:01:52.470> already<00:01:53.470> increase<00:01:53.860> the

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
would be apparently already increase the

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:55.620 
would be apparently already increase the
size<00:01:54.340> of<00:01:54.490> this<00:01:54.610> though<00:01:54.909> because<00:01:55.240> then<00:01:55.509> it's

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
size of this though because then it's

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.430 
size of this though because then it's
gonna<00:01:55.720> look<00:01:55.899> really<00:01:55.960> weird<00:01:56.319> don't<00:01:58.259> tell<00:01:59.259> what

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
gonna look really weird don't tell what

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:09.419 
gonna look really weird don't tell what
I<00:02:00.390> know<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:04.350> mmm<00:02:05.350> know<00:02:06.190> what<00:02:06.340> Alex<00:02:07.330> yeah<00:02:08.429> it

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:16.130 
I know that mmm know what Alex yeah it
was<00:02:09.580> this<00:02:09.729> that<00:02:12.120> didn't<00:02:13.120> even<00:02:13.269> lower<00:02:13.769> bastard

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
was this that didn't even lower bastard

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.330 
was this that didn't even lower bastard
also<00:02:17.140> I<00:02:17.170> tried<00:02:17.440> recording<00:02:17.680> us<00:02:17.920> like<00:02:18.069> a<00:02:18.160> law

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
also I tried recording us like a law

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.070 
also I tried recording us like a law
like<00:02:18.370> plenty<00:02:19.330> of<00:02:19.480> times<00:02:19.569> and<00:02:19.810> it<00:02:19.930> just

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
like plenty of times and it just

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:28.259 
like plenty of times and it just
wouldn't<00:02:20.470> work<00:02:20.910> just<00:02:21.910> really<00:02:22.209> weird<00:02:25.019> I<00:02:27.269> don't

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
wouldn't work just really weird I don't

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.680 
wouldn't work just really weird I don't
think<00:02:28.360> these<00:02:28.600> guys<00:02:28.660> actually<00:02:29.049> like<00:02:30.660> yeah<00:02:31.660> I

experimenting with I guess I mean I do
want<00:02:49.150> to<00:02:49.180> change<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.959> height<00:02:50.200> of<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.530> next<00:02:50.799> a

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859 
want to change the height of the next a

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:54.210 
want to change the height of the next a
bit<00:02:51.010> one<00:02:51.160> time<00:02:52.500> maybe<00:02:53.500> maybe<00:02:53.829> in<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.130> next

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
bit one time maybe maybe in the next
