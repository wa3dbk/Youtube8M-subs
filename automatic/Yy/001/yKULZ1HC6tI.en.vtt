00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.889 

okay<00:00:01.079> we're<00:00:01.260> back<00:00:01.439> for<00:00:01.589> part<00:00:01.829> two<00:00:02.750> all<00:00:03.750> right

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
okay we're back for part two all right

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.230 
okay we're back for part two all right
here's<00:00:04.859> what<00:00:05.069> we<00:00:05.190> did<00:00:05.339> with<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.819> sensor

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
here's what we did with the sensor

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.259 
here's what we did with the sensor
because<00:00:07.230> if<00:00:07.350> you<00:00:07.500> drop<00:00:07.770> it<00:00:07.830> I<00:00:08.189> don't<00:00:09.150> know

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
because if you drop it I don't know

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.629 
because if you drop it I don't know
where<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.599> hell<00:00:09.750> it<00:00:09.870> goes<00:00:10.080> but<00:00:10.410> it<00:00:10.650> disappears

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
where to hell it goes but it disappears

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.200 
where to hell it goes but it disappears
so<00:00:12.540> we<00:00:12.719> use<00:00:12.900> some<00:00:13.200> line<00:00:13.799> level<00:00:14.040> string<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:15.059> can

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
so we use some line level string you can

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.670 
so we use some line level string you can
use<00:00:15.330> wire<00:00:15.599> whatever<00:00:15.990> you<00:00:16.080> want<00:00:16.289> we<00:00:16.440> figure

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
use wire whatever you want we figure

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.250 
use wire whatever you want we figure
wire<00:00:16.890> might<00:00:17.130> get<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.490> way<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:18.080> we're<00:00:19.080> just

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
wire might get in the way and we're just

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.630 
wire might get in the way and we're just
going<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.470> leave<00:00:19.740> that<00:00:19.770> string<00:00:20.279> on<00:00:20.430> there

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
going to leave that string on there

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.740 
going to leave that string on there
because<00:00:20.820> it's<00:00:21.000> not<00:00:21.119> going<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.330> hurt<00:00:21.480> anything

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
because it's not going to hurt anything

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.029 
because it's not going to hurt anything
in<00:00:21.990> case<00:00:22.080> we<00:00:22.289> ever<00:00:22.380> have<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.590> take<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:22.920> out

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
in case we ever have to take it out

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.700 
in case we ever have to take it out
again<00:00:23.189> because<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:24.330> probably<00:00:24.810> will<00:00:25.170> drop<00:00:25.500> it

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
again because you probably will drop it

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.599 
again because you probably will drop it
okay

sending unit you better change this to

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.679 
sending unit you better change this to
only<00:01:28.229> like<00:01:28.470> five<00:01:28.740> bucks<00:01:29.040> at<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.250> dealership

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
only like five bucks at the dealership

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:31.850 
only like five bucks at the dealership
we<00:01:30.689> got<00:01:30.900> two<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.229> them<00:01:31.320> just<00:01:31.439> in<00:01:31.530> case<00:01:31.590> we

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
we got two of them just in case we

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.380 
we got two of them just in case we
dropped<00:01:32.100> one<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.340> them<00:01:32.549> because<00:01:32.790> really<00:01:33.240> no

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
dropped one of them because really no

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.330 
dropped one of them because really no
way<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.540> tie<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> string<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:35.159> is

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
way to tie a string to that and this is

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.270 
way to tie a string to that and this is
the<00:01:35.460> pic<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.909> we<00:01:36.060> used<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.920> actually<00:01:37.920> heated

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
the pic that we used I actually heated

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.039 
the pic that we used I actually heated
it<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.520> bent<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.880> because<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.570> was<00:01:39.720> actually

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
it and bent it because it was actually

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.800 
it and bent it because it was actually
too<00:01:40.259> wide<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.740> fit<00:01:40.770> into<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:42.240> hole

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
too wide to fit into the hole

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.170 
too wide to fit into the hole
the<00:01:43.590> way<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.829> was<00:01:43.920> made<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:45.000> got<00:01:45.149> a

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
the way it was made so I just got a

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.700 
the way it was made so I just got a
bunch<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.509> these<00:01:45.689> laying<00:01:45.899> around<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.380> or<00:01:46.500> broke

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
bunch of these laying around it or broke

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.490 
bunch of these laying around it or broke
I<00:01:46.860> sharpen<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.340> end<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.759> now<00:01:48.259> this<00:01:49.259> one's

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
I sharpen the end of it now this one's

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.139 
I sharpen the end of it now this one's
perfect<00:01:49.770> because<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.250> stick<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:50.939> then

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
perfect because you stick it in and then

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.800 
perfect because you stick it in and then
you<00:01:51.240> go<00:01:51.390> like<00:01:51.540> that

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
you go like that

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.859 
you go like that
whoop<00:01:52.619> yeah<00:01:53.299> hard<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.390> do<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.600> with<00:01:54.689> one<00:01:54.840> hand

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
whoop yeah hard to do it with one hand

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.289 
whoop yeah hard to do it with one hand
but<00:01:55.680> when<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.310> backwards<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.090> goes

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
but when you it backwards it goes

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.859 
but when you it backwards it goes
it<00:01:58.049> puts<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.469> hole<00:01:58.680> through<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.189> screen

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
it puts a hole through the screen

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.910 
it puts a hole through the screen
actually<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:00.990> didn't<00:02:01.259> do<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.350> on<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.649> one<00:02:01.799> I
