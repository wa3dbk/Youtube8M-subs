are just in the shells and then having

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.670 
are just in the shells and then having
that<00:01:30.570> period<00:01:30.960> for<00:01:31.110> 10<00:01:31.259> minutes<00:01:31.409> where<00:01:31.590> we

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
that period for 10 minutes where we

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.870 
that period for 10 minutes where we
could<00:01:31.770> go<00:01:31.829> live<00:01:32.040> scrimmage<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.610> having<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
could go live scrimmage and having the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.950 
could go live scrimmage and having the
officials<00:01:33.240> out<00:01:33.329> here<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.869> was

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
officials out here to that that was

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.840 
officials out here to that that was
really<00:01:34.170> good<00:01:34.290> part<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.490> challenge

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
really good part of it the challenge

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.340 
really good part of it the challenge
keeping<00:01:36.060> things<00:01:36.329> fresh<00:01:36.630> during<00:01:37.140> all<00:01:37.229> these

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
keeping things fresh during all these

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.289 
keeping things fresh during all these
practices<00:01:37.829> this<00:01:38.009> time<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.280> year<00:01:38.340> yeah<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:38.939> think

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
practices this time of year yeah I think

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.969 
practices this time of year yeah I think
it's<00:01:39.600> definitely<00:01:39.840> about<00:01:40.170> keeping<00:01:40.619> them<00:01:40.710> fresh

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
it's definitely about keeping them fresh

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.620 
it's definitely about keeping them fresh
I<00:01:41.220> think<00:01:41.430> DS<00:01:41.759> has<00:01:41.939> done<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> really<00:01:42.329> good<00:01:42.570> job

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
I think DS has done a really good job

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.330 
I think DS has done a really good job
but<00:01:42.990> daddy's<00:01:43.259> got<00:01:43.439> 30<00:01:43.829> years<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.159> experience

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
but daddy's got 30 years of experience

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.249 
but daddy's got 30 years of experience
and<00:01:44.909> knowing<00:01:45.149> how<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.329> get<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.570> team<00:01:45.780> ready<00:01:46.020> and

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
and knowing how to get a team ready and

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.749 
and knowing how to get a team ready and
keep<00:01:46.439> them<00:01:46.590> fresh<00:01:46.829> but<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.399> gets<00:01:47.520> really

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
keep them fresh but it gets really

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.700 
keep them fresh but it gets really
helped<00:01:48.090> us<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.390> think<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.960> way<00:01:49.049> we<00:01:49.079> practiced

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
helped us I think the way we practiced

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.920 
helped us I think the way we practiced
all<00:01:49.860> year<00:01:50.100> long<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.579> terms<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.180> not<00:01:51.899> a

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
all year long in terms of the not a

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.270 
all year long in terms of the not a
whole<00:01:52.110> lot<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.409> going<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.799> ground<00:01:53.040> live

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
whole lot of going to the ground live

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.219 
whole lot of going to the ground live
hitting<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.000> those<00:01:54.659> types<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:54.990> things<00:01:55.049> I

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
hitting and those types of things I

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.289 
hitting and those types of things I
think<00:01:55.259> have<00:01:55.500> helped<00:01:55.770> us<00:01:56.000> and<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.060> think<00:01:57.240> our

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
think have helped us and I think our

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.120 
think have helped us and I think our
guys<00:01:57.479> have<00:01:57.750> taken<00:01:58.320> care<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.530> themselves<00:01:58.740> it's

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
guys have taken care of themselves it's

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.469 
guys have taken care of themselves it's
amazing<00:01:59.549> what<00:01:59.670> going<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.060> bed<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.329> get<00:02:00.420> some

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
amazing what going to bed and get some

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.330 
amazing what going to bed and get some
rest<00:02:00.719> will<00:02:01.079> do<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.500> know<00:02:01.590> when<00:02:01.770> your<00:02:01.860> college

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
rest will do you know when your college

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.859 
rest will do you know when your college
and<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.820> don't<00:02:02.969> do<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.270> very<00:02:03.420> often<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:03.810> I

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
and you don't do that very often so I

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.810 
and you don't do that very often so I
think<00:02:03.930> all<00:02:04.140> those<00:02:04.259> things<00:02:04.530> are<00:02:04.710> important<00:02:05.490> but

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
think all those things are important but

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.880 
think all those things are important but
also<00:02:06.000> just<00:02:06.149> keeping<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:06.990> fresh<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.290> doing

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
also just keeping it fresh and doing

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.180 
also just keeping it fresh and doing
some<00:02:08.039> different<00:02:08.190> things

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
some different things

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.830 
some different things
I<00:02:09.220> always<00:02:09.369> test<00:02:09.700> on<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.000> phone<00:02:10.210> practices

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
I always test on the phone practices

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.530 
I always test on the phone practices
extra<00:02:11.740> practices<00:02:12.190> me<00:02:12.400> but<00:02:12.700> is<00:02:12.820> it<00:02:12.880> better<00:02:13.180> for

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
extra practices me but is it better for

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.200 
extra practices me but is it better for
the<00:02:13.840> younger<00:02:14.110> players<00:02:14.350> theoretically

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
the younger players theoretically

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.390 
the younger players theoretically
I<00:02:16.300> I<00:02:17.110> think<00:02:17.680> it<00:02:17.770> is<00:02:18.600> but<00:02:19.980> every<00:02:20.980> place<00:02:21.190> I've

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
I I think it is but every place I've

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.730 
I I think it is but every place I've
ever<00:02:21.430> been<00:02:21.760> everybody<00:02:22.450> talks<00:02:22.780> about<00:02:23.050> how

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
ever been everybody talks about how

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.770 
ever been everybody talks about how
these<00:02:23.980> extra<00:02:24.340> practices<00:02:24.790> are<00:02:25.000> so<00:02:25.210> more<00:02:25.450> so

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
these extra practices are so more so

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.210 
these extra practices are so more so
important<00:02:26.230> for<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.380> program<00:02:26.590> development

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
important for the program development

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
important for the program development
and<00:02:27.400> those<00:02:27.490> types<00:02:27.670> of<00:02:27.760> things<00:02:27.820> but<00:02:28.000> then<00:02:28.150> you

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
and those types of things but then you

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.650 
and those types of things but then you
do<00:02:28.360> it<00:02:28.390> and<00:02:29.040> it's<00:02:30.040> 15<00:02:30.520> more<00:02:30.670> practices<00:02:31.240> for<00:02:31.390> NC

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
do it and it's 15 more practices for NC

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.990 
do it and it's 15 more practices for NC
State<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:32.050> it's<00:02:32.290> just<00:02:32.530> same<00:02:33.160> old<00:02:33.460> thing<00:02:33.760> and

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
State and it's just same old thing and

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.530 
State and it's just same old thing and
energies<00:02:34.570> nothing<00:02:35.170> like<00:02:35.350> we've<00:02:35.560> had<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:37.000> I

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
energies nothing like we've had and I

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.760 
energies nothing like we've had and I
think<00:02:37.900> that's<00:02:38.050> I<00:02:38.260> think<00:02:38.290> that's<00:02:38.590> been

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
think that's I think that's been

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.620 
think that's I think that's been
important<00:02:39.220> that<00:02:39.340> they<00:02:39.460> saw<00:02:39.790> you<00:02:40.240> know<00:02:40.360> then

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
important that they saw you know then

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.960 
important that they saw you know then
that's<00:02:40.750> actually<00:02:41.410> what<00:02:41.590> it<00:02:41.620> was<00:02:41.860> is<00:02:42.070> about<00:02:42.310> for

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
that's actually what it was is about for

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.460 
that's actually what it was is about for
an<00:02:43.030> entire<00:02:43.330> program<00:02:43.810> especially<00:02:43.990> the<00:02:44.320> young

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
an entire program especially the young

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.530 
an entire program especially the young
guys<00:02:44.650> there's<00:02:44.890> no<00:02:45.010> doubt<00:02:45.160> about<00:02:45.190> that<00:02:45.460> we<00:02:46.390> did

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
guys there's no doubt about that we did

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.240 
guys there's no doubt about that we did
some<00:02:46.750> different<00:02:47.080> things<00:02:47.110> and<00:02:47.650> I<00:02:47.920> think<00:02:47.950> that's

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
some different things and I think that's

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.370 
some different things and I think that's
been<00:02:48.400> really<00:02:48.610> good<00:02:48.760> for<00:02:48.970> so<00:02:49.240> for<00:02:49.630> us<00:02:49.690> it's<00:02:50.170> been

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
been really good for so for us it's been

defensive like beginning of fall camp to

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.749 
defensive like beginning of fall camp to
now<00:04:19.299> like<00:04:19.539> hold<00:04:20.109> practices<00:04:20.289> yeah<00:04:21.100> i<00:04:21.160> think<00:04:21.459> so

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:21.759 
now like hold practices yeah i think so

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:22.680 
now like hold practices yeah i think so
i<00:04:21.789> think<00:04:21.880> they're<00:04:22.150> just<00:04:22.330> much<00:04:22.449> more

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
i think they're just much more

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.080 
i think they're just much more
comfortable<00:04:23.259> with<00:04:23.410> how<00:04:23.560> we<00:04:23.620> do<00:04:24.039> things<00:04:24.280> i<00:04:24.580> did

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
comfortable with how we do things i did

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.999 
comfortable with how we do things i did
think<00:04:25.240> it<00:04:25.389> was<00:04:25.479> a<00:04:25.570> point<00:04:25.870> around<00:04:26.259> week<00:04:26.590> seven

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:27.009 
think it was a point around week seven

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:28.290 
think it was a point around week seven
week<00:04:27.190> eight<00:04:27.430> where<00:04:27.669> they<00:04:27.729> kind<00:04:27.940> of<00:04:28.000> hit<00:04:28.150> the

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
week eight where they kind of hit the

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.270 
week eight where they kind of hit the
wall<00:04:28.509> and<00:04:28.780> then<00:04:29.470> they<00:04:29.620> kind<00:04:29.860> of<00:04:29.919> caught<00:04:30.100> their

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
wall and then they kind of caught their

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.850 
wall and then they kind of caught their
second<00:04:30.639> wind<00:04:30.820> and<00:04:30.940> now<00:04:31.090> our<00:04:31.330> back<00:04:31.770> you<00:04:32.770> know

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090 
that we've seen I do think this this is

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.060 
that we've seen I do think this this is
this<00:06:31.120> is<00:06:31.600> a<00:06:31.630> game<00:06:32.110> that<00:06:32.140> I<00:06:32.350> think<00:06:32.650> we<00:06:32.830> match<00:06:33.040> up

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.070 
this is a game that I think we match up

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.350 
this is a game that I think we match up
pretty<00:06:33.400> well<00:06:33.550> I<00:06:33.730> think<00:06:33.880> it's<00:06:34.090> going<00:06:34.180> to<00:06:34.240> be<00:06:34.300> a

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
pretty well I think it's going to be a

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.970 
pretty well I think it's going to be a
great<00:06:34.660> game<00:06:34.900> because<00:06:35.230> I<00:06:35.290> think<00:06:35.350> we<00:06:35.770> were

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:35.980 
great game because I think we were

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.550 
great game because I think we were
similar<00:06:36.550> in<00:06:36.580> a<00:06:36.730> lot<00:06:36.760> of<00:06:36.910> ways<00:06:37.150> you<00:06:38.110> know<00:06:38.380> like

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
similar in a lot of ways you know like

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.020 
similar in a lot of ways you know like
you<00:06:38.710> guys<00:06:38.800> heard<00:06:39.040> before<00:06:39.340> I<00:06:39.520> just<00:06:39.760> think<00:06:39.910> we're

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
you guys heard before I just think we're

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.190 
you guys heard before I just think we're
still<00:06:40.180> a<00:06:40.210> lot<00:06:40.300> of<00:06:40.330> point<00:06:40.570> is<00:06:40.690> a<00:06:40.720> program<00:06:41.080> what

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:41.200 
still a lot of point is a program what

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.930 
still a lot of point is a program what
are<00:06:41.290> some<00:06:41.500> games<00:06:41.680> where<00:06:42.010> I<00:06:42.190> don't<00:06:42.550> think<00:06:42.790> it's

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940 
are some games where I don't think it's

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.640 
are some games where I don't think it's
a<00:06:43.030> great<00:06:43.180> matchup<00:06:43.480> I<00:06:43.870> think<00:06:44.020> it's<00:06:44.290> this<00:06:44.470> has

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:44.650 
a great matchup I think it's this has

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.110 
a great matchup I think it's this has
chance<00:06:44.860> to<00:06:44.950> be<00:06:45.010> really<00:06:45.280> good<00:06:45.340> games<00:06:45.640> i<00:06:45.910> think

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.120 
chance to be really good games i think

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.400 
chance to be really good games i think
you<00:06:46.360> know<00:06:46.420> if<00:06:46.510> you<00:06:46.600> look<00:06:46.750> personnel<00:06:47.260> by

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:47.410 
you know if you look personnel by

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.460 
you know if you look personnel by
personnel<00:06:47.890> we're<00:06:48.040> very<00:06:48.220> similar
