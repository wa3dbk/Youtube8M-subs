00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.160 

now<00:00:03.030> had<00:00:03.270> several<00:00:03.720> requests<00:00:04.520> to<00:00:05.520> show<00:00:06.140> how<00:00:07.140> the

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
now had several requests to show how the

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.160 
now had several requests to show how the
adapter<00:00:07.799> works<00:00:07.950> on<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.429> deluxe<00:00:09.030> model<00:00:12.170> you

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
adapter works on the deluxe model you

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.390 
adapter works on the deluxe model you
notice<00:00:13.500> on<00:00:14.420> this<00:00:15.420> bottle<00:00:15.870> it's<00:00:16.049> got<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.410> curved

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.310 

situation<00:00:20.400> here<00:00:20.760> so<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.840> wouldn't<00:00:22.140> really

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
situation here so it wouldn't really

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.980 
situation here so it wouldn't really
work<00:00:22.500> very<00:00:22.710> well<00:00:23.300> laying<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.449> bottle<00:00:24.810> this

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
work very well laying the bottle this

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.849 
work very well laying the bottle this
way<00:00:25.460> but<00:00:27.740> when<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.800> reverse<00:00:30.410> this<00:00:31.410> set<00:00:31.740> up

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
way but when you reverse this set up

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.400 
way but when you reverse this set up
here<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.250> put<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.579> cone<00:00:32.850> here<00:00:34.550> then<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:35.700> can

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
here and put the cone here then you can

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.510 
here and put the cone here then you can
set<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.469> in<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.710> top<00:00:38.960> and<00:00:40.010> at<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.040> bottle<00:00:41.430> this

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
set it in the top and at the bottle this

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.990 
set it in the top and at the bottle this
way<00:00:41.760> now<00:00:45.620> I've<00:00:46.620> had<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.010> adjust<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
way now I've had to adjust the the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.240 
way now I've had to adjust the the
cutting<00:00:48.390> head<00:00:48.600> out<00:00:49.280> to<00:00:50.719> to<00:00:51.719> keep<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.860> purple

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
cutting head out to to keep it purple

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:02.400 
cutting head out to to keep it purple
perpendicular<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.270> glass<00:00:57.500> if<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.620> notice

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.220 

it's<00:01:03.410> adjustable<00:01:03.890> in<00:01:04.100> two<00:01:04.309> different<00:01:04.520> ways

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.230 
it's adjustable in two different ways

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:12.730 
it's adjustable in two different ways
this<00:01:06.230> way<00:01:06.530> with<00:01:07.520> this<00:01:07.700> group<00:01:08.090> to<00:01:09.010> get<00:01:10.010> the<00:01:11.740> two

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
this way with this group to get the two

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.030 
this way with this group to get the two
sides<00:01:13.540> equal<00:01:14.540> angles<00:01:14.870> here<00:01:15.200> from<00:01:15.710> here<00:01:15.890> to

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
sides equal angles here from here to

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.900 
sides equal angles here from here to
here<00:01:16.220> and<00:01:16.430> here<00:01:16.640> to<00:01:16.760> here<00:01:16.970> and<00:01:17.500> then<00:01:18.760> that's<00:01:19.760> a

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
here and here to here and then that's a

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.940 
here and here to here and then that's a
dis<00:01:20.120> screwin<00:01:20.270> you<00:01:20.600> tighten<00:01:20.960> it<00:01:21.050> then<00:01:21.290> then

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
dis screwin you tighten it then then

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.150 
dis screwin you tighten it then then
with<00:01:22.130> this<00:01:22.280> crew<00:01:22.630> you<00:01:23.630> can<00:01:23.870> adjust<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.530> angle

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
with this crew you can adjust the angle

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.510 
with this crew you can adjust the angle
this<00:01:25.580> way<00:01:26.080> so<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:27.530> end<00:01:27.680> result<00:01:27.830> is<00:01:28.160> you<00:01:28.190> have<00:01:28.490> a

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
this way so the end result is you have a

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.130 
this way so the end result is you have a
perpendicular<00:01:31.090> wheel<00:01:32.090> to<00:01:32.390> the<00:01:32.420> cutting<00:01:33.110> wheel

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
perpendicular wheel to the cutting wheel

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.700 
perpendicular wheel to the cutting wheel
to<00:01:33.530> the<00:01:33.560> glass<00:01:34.180> now<00:01:35.180> there<00:01:36.170> are<00:01:36.200> several<00:01:36.500> ways

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
to the glass now there are several ways

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.719 
to the glass now there are several ways
to<00:01:37.000> to<00:01:38.410> deterrent<00:01:39.410> rotate<00:01:39.950> distance<00:01:40.399> scribe

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
to to deterrent rotate distance scribe

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.270 
to to deterrent rotate distance scribe
to<00:01:40.759> the<00:01:41.270> line<00:01:41.509> one<00:01:42.470> way<00:01:43.270> is<00:01:44.920> just<00:01:45.920> allow

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
to the line one way is just allow

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.580 
to the line one way is just allow
gravity<00:01:46.580> to<00:01:46.850> work<00:01:47.119> for<00:01:47.420> you<00:01:47.540> you<00:01:47.990> just<00:01:48.020> put<00:01:48.470> the

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
gravity to work for you you just put the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.870 
gravity to work for you you just put the
bottle<00:01:48.950> down<00:01:48.979> on<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:49.520> table<00:01:49.990> like<00:01:50.990> soul<00:01:51.880> bring

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
bottle down on the table like soul bring

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.870 
bottle down on the table like soul bring
your<00:01:53.000> hand<00:01:53.270> behind<00:01:53.479> and<00:01:54.020> start<00:01:54.890> rotating<00:01:55.610> this

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
your hand behind and start rotating this

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.469 
your hand behind and start rotating this
way<00:01:57.850> the<00:01:58.850> other<00:01:59.030> way<00:01:59.240> is<00:02:00.369> and<00:02:01.369> you<00:02:02.119> know<00:02:02.149> that

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
way the other way is and you know that

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.080 
way the other way is and you know that
allows<00:02:02.720> it<00:02:03.020> to<00:02:03.050> just<00:02:03.649> follow<00:02:04.220> the<00:02:04.520> same<00:02:04.759> line

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
allows it to just follow the same line

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.090 
allows it to just follow the same line
all<00:02:05.330> around<00:02:05.360> and<00:02:05.810> gravity<00:02:06.200> keeps<00:02:06.530> it<00:02:06.770> straight

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
all around and gravity keeps it straight

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.550 
all around and gravity keeps it straight
the<00:02:07.789> other<00:02:07.940> way<00:02:08.090> is<00:02:08.119> to<00:02:08.360> build<00:02:08.690> a<00:02:08.840> little<00:02:09.020> setup

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
the other way is to build a little setup

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:17.740 
the other way is to build a little setup
like<00:02:09.830> this<00:02:11.319> show<00:02:12.319> you<00:02:12.380> how<00:02:12.530> that<00:02:12.770> works

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.680 

it's<00:02:18.750> just<00:02:18.990> awful<00:02:19.910> some<00:02:20.910> that<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.210> can<00:02:21.390> sit

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
it's just awful some that you can sit

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.990 
it's just awful some that you can sit
though<00:02:22.430> I'll<00:02:23.430> cut<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:23.760> down<00:02:23.970> at<00:02:24.210> an<00:02:24.330> angle<00:02:26.000> and

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
though I'll cut it down at an angle and

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.600 
though I'll cut it down at an angle and
uh<00:02:28.760> just<00:02:29.760> set<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:30.750> in<00:02:30.930> there<00:02:31.020> like<00:02:31.230> so<00:02:31.610> some

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
uh just set it in there like so some

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.700 
uh just set it in there like so some
people<00:02:32.880> like<00:02:33.030> this<00:02:33.270> because<00:02:33.600> then<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.500> can

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
people like this because then you can

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.610 
people like this because then you can
keep<00:02:34.920> turning<00:02:35.400> it<00:02:35.460> without<00:02:35.790> letting<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:37.590> know

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
keep turning it without letting you know

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.550 
keep turning it without letting you know
alternating<00:02:38.400> your<00:02:38.520> hands<00:02:39.030> without<00:02:39.560> changing

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
alternating your hands without changing

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.850 
alternating your hands without changing
the<00:02:41.240> speed<00:02:42.240> without<00:02:42.660> stopping<00:02:43.380> at<00:02:43.470> any<00:02:43.620> one

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
the speed without stopping at any one

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.620 
the speed without stopping at any one
point<00:02:44.930> but<00:02:46.820> and<00:02:47.820> all<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.180> have<00:02:48.240> to<00:02:48.390> go<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.540> the

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
point but and all you have to go to the

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.150 
point but and all you have to go to the
trouble<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:49.020> build<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.710> little<00:02:49.950> thing<00:02:50.130> like

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
trouble to build a little thing like

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.490 
trouble to build a little thing like
this<00:02:50.610> so<00:02:53.060> one<00:02:54.060> way<00:02:54.210> or<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.330> other<00:02:54.390> you<00:02:55.290> get

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
this so one way or the other you get

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.490 
this so one way or the other you get
practice<00:02:56.460> with<00:02:56.670> it<00:02:56.790> let's<00:02:57.420> do<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.720> let's<00:02:58.020> do<00:02:58.410> it

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
practice with it let's do it let's do it

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.470 
practice with it let's do it let's do it
the<00:02:58.590> vertical<00:02:59.040> way<00:02:59.190> I<00:03:00.500> sort<00:03:01.500> of<00:03:01.590> like<00:03:01.770> this<00:03:02.130> way

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
the vertical way I sort of like this way

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.090 
the vertical way I sort of like this way
too<00:03:03.480> but<00:03:03.840> it<00:03:03.930> just<00:03:04.140> takes<00:03:04.470> a<00:03:04.590> little<00:03:04.740> time<00:03:05.040> to

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
too but it just takes a little time to

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.280 
too but it just takes a little time to
build<00:03:07.190> let's<00:03:08.190> do<00:03:08.430> this<00:03:08.580> way<00:03:08.870> I'll<00:03:09.870> scribe<00:03:10.260> a

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
build let's do this way I'll scribe a

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.050 
build let's do this way I'll scribe a
line<00:03:11.630> and<00:03:13.010> listen<00:03:14.010> for<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.430> meet<00:03:14.640> itself

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
line and listen for it to meet itself

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.670 
line and listen for it to meet itself
that's<00:03:15.390> important<00:03:15.960> so<00:03:16.230> here<00:03:16.470> we<00:03:16.560> go<00:03:18.590> notice<00:03:19.590> I

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
that's important so here we go notice I

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
itself you can see the line all the way

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.179 
itself you can see the line all the way
around<00:03:43.829> okay<00:03:44.829> now<00:03:46.319> that's<00:03:47.319> important<00:03:47.950> it's

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.500 

this<00:05:50.260> is<00:05:50.440> just<00:05:50.650> a<00:05:50.770> piece<00:05:50.980> of<00:05:51.930> plate<00:05:52.930> glasses

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
this is just a piece of plate glasses

00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:03.720 
this is just a piece of plate glasses
with<00:05:55.510> the<00:05:55.780> silicon<00:05:56.650> carbide<00:05:57.160> on<00:05:57.400> it<00:06:02.730> sprinkle

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:03.730 
with the silicon carbide on it sprinkle

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:11.340 
with the silicon carbide on it sprinkle
a<00:06:03.760> little<00:06:03.940> air<00:06:04.180> I<00:06:09.870> thought<00:06:10.870> let's<00:06:11.169> get<00:06:11.320> a

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
a little air I thought let's get a

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.050 
a little air I thought let's get a
little<00:06:11.440> water<00:06:11.770> this<00:06:12.010> is<00:06:12.160> the<00:06:12.280> finish<00:06:12.580> button<00:06:12.910> I

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
little water this is the finish button I

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.580 
little water this is the finish button I
did<00:06:13.389> one<00:06:13.540> earlier<00:06:13.870> and<00:06:14.080> this<00:06:14.139> is<00:06:14.320> how<00:06:14.470> it<00:06:14.560> looks

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
did one earlier and this is how it looks

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:21.000 
did one earlier and this is how it looks
when<00:06:14.919> it's<00:06:14.980> finished<00:06:15.280> nice<00:06:16.030> shape<00:06:16.360> huh<00:06:20.010> I'll

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.010 
when it's finished nice shape huh I'll

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:43.460 
when it's finished nice shape huh I'll
go<00:06:21.280> get<00:06:21.430> a<00:06:21.490> little<00:06:21.729> water

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:43.470 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.480 

see<00:06:44.470> the<00:06:44.590> sound<00:06:44.919> getting<00:06:45.310> soft<00:06:46.110> softer<00:06:47.490> let's

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.490 
see the sound getting soft softer let's

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.090 
see the sound getting soft softer let's
see<00:06:48.730> if<00:06:48.790> we<00:06:49.260> grind<00:06:50.260> the<00:06:50.380> edges<00:06:50.440> a<00:06:50.710> little<00:06:50.740> bit

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:51.100 
see if we grind the edges a little bit

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:56.490 
see if we grind the edges a little bit
now<00:06:53.580> there's<00:06:54.580> this<00:06:54.810> like<00:06:55.810> an<00:06:55.960> emery<00:06:56.290> cloth

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:56.500 
now there's this like an emery cloth

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:14.700 
now there's this like an emery cloth
again<00:07:12.150> careful<00:07:13.150> not<00:07:13.270> to<00:07:13.330> bend<00:07:14.169> it<00:07:14.320> too<00:07:14.530> much

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:14.710 
again careful not to bend it too much

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:17.820 
again careful not to bend it too much
and<00:07:14.919> scratched<00:07:15.220> up<00:07:15.900> the<00:07:16.900> glass<00:07:17.169> just<00:07:17.500> enough

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:17.830 
and scratched up the glass just enough

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:23.909 
and scratched up the glass just enough
to<00:07:17.950> get<00:07:18.100> the<00:07:18.220> edge<00:07:18.370> style<00:07:22.290> well<00:07:23.290> this<00:07:23.530> wins<00:07:23.740> it

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:23.919 
to get the edge style well this wins it

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:28.590 
to get the edge style well this wins it
often<00:07:24.450> see<00:07:25.450> how<00:07:25.540> she<00:07:25.600> looks<00:07:27.330> right<00:07:28.330> foot<00:07:28.510> up

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:28.600 
often see how she looks right foot up

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:33.900 
often see how she looks right foot up
here<00:07:30.360> you<00:07:31.360> have<00:07:31.479> a<00:07:31.540> nice<00:07:31.810> glass<00:07:32.610> pretty<00:07:33.610> shape

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:33.910 
here you have a nice glass pretty shape

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.719 
here you have a nice glass pretty shape
to<00:07:34.180> it<00:07:34.210> I<00:07:34.750> like<00:07:35.110> that<00:07:35.139> shape<00:07:35.620> makes<00:07:36.460> a<00:07:36.580> good

00:07:36.719 --> 00:07:36.729 
to it I like that shape makes a good

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:46.050 
to it I like that shape makes a good
juice<00:07:37.000> glass

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:46.060 

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.120 

you
