00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.410
 dear fan of youtube followers 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.590
 followers from youtube and today 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.230
 let's see how to demonstrate a master 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.720
 kinetics 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.720
 let's do the whole normal process 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:28.230
 if we have any problem 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:32.680
 in order to show present 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.680
 a tool a kinetic extractor 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.980
 that we design and not only 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.100
 we economical easy to manufacture and 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:45.239
 they will be of much use for good 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.760
 teachers who beat their hands 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.940
 exclude the thread the whole theme axis 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.530
 but it will not treat the vehicle we create 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.720
 that tool we are going to do the 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.360
 step by step processes let's ride the 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.640
 motion and in a normal way and then we go 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.790
 to explain in the event that 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.420
 up ok let's go to the recipe that I make 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:10.740
 curves let's occupy a die for 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:15.450
 Demonstrate the 30-millimeter notches 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.450
 12 19 for our tool 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.920
 he is a puncher 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.910
 do not 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.910
 ah 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.490
 we take out insurance from the water 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:44.159
 ah 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.159
 let's go the nut 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.360
 we are without ethics 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.360
 is 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.170
 we must be doing we are doing the 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.810
 exercise for many tools to the 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:12.820
 people normally when you take a 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:15.040
 homokinetic in the case that we 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.080
 let's change or replace is like 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.060
 kinetics for a new 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.150
 It is not a problem that the thread is damaged or 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.530
 the axis because we are going to replace it and 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.760
 when we are going to make a change 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.690
 in braille we are going to change a bellows 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:34.350
 any element that 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.540
 we need to leave this same 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.210
 piece 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:42.290
 we should not mistreat her 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.290
 this piece normally 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:52.080
 in the case of this piece this agripada 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.030
 when the vehicles come from the factory and 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.170
 are his first interventions by the 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.410
 mechanical in this case 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.410
 this piece comes super stuck up 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.540
 in that case 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.700
 if your google dump destroys the point 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.430
 of blow or the thread we go kinetic 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.170
 dies the piece has to change the 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.730
 piece in the case that you are going to do 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.090
 another type of work in the vehicle 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.670
 when you need to save this piece that 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.099
 you have to occupy 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.260
 a candle speaker extractor we 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.790
 we make with whom someone is 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.000
 workshop 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.390
 what is this is not built with a 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.390
 disk 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:41.290
 a bearing a mass a nut and a 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:44.930
 fine thread obviously a fine thread that 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.350
 has greater support greater strength 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:52.170
 as the thread of the actors 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.170
 it costs half 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:59.560
 to this tool in the market is 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.170
 around 80 100 thousand pesos but 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.260
 I'm showing 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.239
 for you to manufacture your workshop 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.140
 Do not hit your hands and do not hit him 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:13.740
 the car to the customer 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:16.750
 when a kitchen is private 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.170
 usually some hits are more than 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.860
 half an hour 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.970
 turning around turning around cutting the vehicle 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.860
 and obviously if you own a 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:29.270
 teacher's vehicle that is hitting 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.960
 the vehicle that scares for your design 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.920
 I make this tool 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:39.400
 and simple 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:42.980
 brake fluid w of 40 was creative of 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.730
 anti-corrosive and apply a little eye and 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.730
 the outside 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:54.710
 a little bit inside soak a 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.710
 just how many pieces 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.720
 until they match so that today they are 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:07.620
 two planes of the same vehicle in the 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.780
 holes and whatever is insured 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:14.510
 with this tool I do not say you're not going to 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.510
 hit the vehicle in no time 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.490
 the world 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:46.770
 can focus 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.770
 there the table ensures you 

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:53.679
 now will or 19 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:07.010
 with a 19,19 we are going to spin the thread 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:10.070
 true with the vitola with one with one 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:13.760
 buzzer with a bar and he's going to 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:16.570
 focus back here as the kinetics site 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.570
 without any blow 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.620
 yes 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:32.870
 is fixed in this case obviously left 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:35.030
 rabid without problem but as I say with 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:39.249
 a gun like from actor to are micro 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:43.229
 blows with air the pneumatic gun 

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:43.229
 it's done in an easy simple way 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:48.650
 and remove homokinetics derived from a 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:52.470
 vehicle 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:56.310
 the first body is knee 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:59.430
 this piece without any knock let's see 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:01.820
 how it stayed fixed we installed means 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.820
 in 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.590
 hills 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:13.330
 and we finished with this tool so 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:15.129
 simple easy to manufacture in your workshop 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.349
 you can make a kinetic extractor 

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:21.030
 that around 200 and 100 views of 

00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:23.949
 market makes optimism this very 

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:25.870
 mark me as I say a gift tell the 

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:28.740
 colleagues who would like to do 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.740
 mechanical in the house
