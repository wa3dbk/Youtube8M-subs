00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
all right nobody's got a tutorial out

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.210 
all right nobody's got a tutorial out
for<00:00:02.520> this<00:00:02.639> song<00:00:02.879> so<00:00:03.300> I<00:00:03.629> thought<00:00:04.100> figured<00:00:05.100> I'd

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
for this song so I thought figured I'd

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.610 
for this song so I thought figured I'd
do<00:00:05.460> it<00:00:05.640> since<00:00:06.150> I<00:00:06.240> think<00:00:06.569> I<00:00:06.690> figured<00:00:06.960> most<00:00:07.350> of<00:00:07.529> it

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
do it since I think I figured most of it

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.770 
do it since I think I figured most of it
out<00:00:07.770> at<00:00:07.980> least<00:00:08.059> at<00:00:09.059> least<00:00:09.120> enough<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.630> look

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
out at least at least enough to look

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.450 
out at least at least enough to look
good<00:00:09.990> doing<00:00:11.630> this<00:00:12.630> on<00:00:12.809> my<00:00:12.840> iPad<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.679> most<00:00:14.340> of

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
good doing this on my iPad and most of

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.269 
good doing this on my iPad and most of
its<00:00:14.610> just<00:00:14.820> for<00:00:15.000> me<00:00:15.120> so<00:00:15.150> I<00:00:15.330> can<00:00:15.570> look<00:00:15.719> back<00:00:15.960> and

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
its just for me so I can look back and

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.920 
its just for me so I can look back and
remember<00:00:17.279> some<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.820> stuff<00:00:18.029> this<00:00:18.300> is<00:00:18.510> this

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
remember some of the stuff this is this

remember some of the stuff this is this
is<00:00:19.050> red<00:00:19.260> rag<00:00:19.529> top<00:00:20.539> it's<00:00:21.539> uh<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:22.140> think<00:00:22.470> his<00:00:22.560> name

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
is red rag top it's uh I think his name

is red rag top it's uh I think his name
is<00:00:22.769> James<00:00:23.130> White<00:00:23.430> was<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.150> one<00:00:24.359> who<00:00:24.539> redid<00:00:25.019> it

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
is James White was the one who redid it

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.529 
is James White was the one who redid it
and<00:00:25.490> Tim<00:00:26.490> McGraw<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.119> one<00:00:27.240> who<00:00:27.330> made<00:00:27.510> it

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
and Tim McGraw is the one who made it

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.529 
and Tim McGraw is the one who made it
famous<00:00:28.519> all<00:00:29.519> right<00:00:29.640> your<00:00:29.820> tuning<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.210> gonna<00:00:30.359> be

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
famous all right your tuning is gonna be

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.100 
famous all right your tuning is gonna be
I'm<00:00:31.529> doing<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:31.949> on<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.460> 12<00:00:32.820> string<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.540> might

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
I'm doing it on a 12 string so it might

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.530 
I'm doing it on a 12 string so it might
sound<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.469> little<00:00:34.559> different<00:00:35.210> your<00:00:36.210> tuning<00:00:36.480> is

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
sound a little different your tuning is

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.459 
sound a little different your tuning is
gonna<00:00:36.690> be<00:00:36.840> 'if<00:00:37.440> lat<00:00:37.850> right<00:00:38.850> there<00:00:40.460> F<00:00:41.460> sharp<00:00:42.469> C

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
gonna be 'if lat right there F sharp C

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
sharp a lot of sharps in there all right

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.270 
sharp a lot of sharps in there all right
there's<00:01:00.690> really<00:01:00.840> only<00:01:00.960> three<00:01:01.199> parts<00:01:02.960> and<00:01:04.280> I

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
there's really only three parts and I

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.800 
there's really only three parts and I
just<00:01:05.489> had<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:06.000> had<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.180> watch<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.570> James

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
just had to I had to watch the James

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.450 
just had to I had to watch the James
White<00:01:07.049> video<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.500> figure<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.920> out<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.369> had

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
White video to figure it out and I had

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.550 
White video to figure it out and I had
to<00:01:08.549> look<00:01:08.700> through<00:01:09.060> all<00:01:09.720> sorts<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.110> blogs<00:01:10.350> to

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
to look through all sorts of blogs to

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.050 
to look through all sorts of blogs to
figure<00:01:10.770> out<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.040> tuning<00:01:11.430> because<00:01:11.670> I'm<00:01:11.909> not

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
figure out the tuning because I'm not

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.670 
figure out the tuning because I'm not
that<00:01:12.240> not<00:01:13.170> quite<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.619> good<00:01:13.909> but<00:01:14.909> uh<00:01:15.680> there's

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
that not quite that good but uh there's

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.920 
that not quite that good but uh there's
one<00:01:17.009> main<00:01:17.280> picking<00:01:17.729> pattern<00:01:18.150> with<00:01:18.570> your<00:01:18.750> right

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
one main picking pattern with your right

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.399 
one main picking pattern with your right
hand<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.909> that's<00:01:20.909> gonna<00:01:21.090> be<00:01:21.600> I'm<00:01:22.110> just<00:01:22.290> going

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
hand and that's gonna be I'm just going

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.230 
hand and that's gonna be I'm just going
to<00:01:22.439> call<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.799> strings<00:01:23.189> as<00:01:23.610> they<00:01:23.759> normally<00:01:24.210> are

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
to call the strings as they normally are

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.390 
to call the strings as they normally are
ad<00:01:25.850> B<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.030> G<00:01:27.320> so<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.439> picking<00:01:28.799> pattern<00:01:29.009> is

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
ad B and G so the picking pattern is

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.830 
ad B and G so the picking pattern is
just<00:01:30.020> it's<00:01:31.020> just<00:01:31.079> your<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.530> string

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
just it's just your a string

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.160 
just it's just your a string
your<00:01:33.020> D<00:01:33.380> string<00:01:33.920> and<00:01:34.310> then<00:01:35.149> you're<00:01:35.299> gonna<00:01:35.420> do

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
your D string and then you're gonna do

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.950 
your D string and then you're gonna do
kind<00:01:36.380> of<00:01:36.500> pinch<00:01:37.070> harmonic<00:01:37.700> little<00:01:38.600> double

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
kind of pinch harmonic little double

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.340 
kind of pinch harmonic little double
thing<00:01:39.170> on<00:01:39.439> the<00:01:40.189> B<00:01:40.429> and<00:01:40.579> G<00:01:40.820> so

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.640 

pretty<00:01:43.860> much<00:01:44.010> all<00:01:44.250> through<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.640> song<00:01:45.650> alright

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
pretty much all through the song alright

00:01:46.650 --> 00:02:04.020 
pretty much all through the song alright
so<00:01:47.310> your<00:01:47.490> intro

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.219 

all<00:02:04.720> you're<00:02:04.900> doing<00:02:05.140> there<00:02:05.350> is<00:02:07.080> doing<00:02:08.080> this

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
all you're doing there is doing this

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.710 
all you're doing there is doing this
picking<00:02:08.619> pattern<00:02:09.009> you're<00:02:09.610> on<00:02:09.759> fifth<00:02:10.360> string

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
picking pattern you're on fifth string

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.330 
picking pattern you're on fifth string
or<00:02:11.650> B<00:02:12.640> string<00:02:13.060> fifth<00:02:13.810> fret<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:15.010> you're<00:02:15.190> just

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
or B string fifth fret and you're just

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.140 
or B string fifth fret and you're just
doing<00:02:17.430> it's<00:02:18.430> a<00:02:18.520> little<00:02:18.760> pull<00:02:18.970> off<00:02:19.210> there<00:02:19.570> so

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
doing it's a little pull off there so

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.550 
doing it's a little pull off there so
you<00:02:22.150> can<00:02:22.300> see<00:02:22.930> all<00:02:23.080> that<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:25.380> then<00:02:26.380> you<00:02:26.410> just

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
you can see all that and then you just

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.720 
you can see all that and then you just
take<00:02:26.920> it<00:02:27.070> down<00:02:27.220> to<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:27.550> g<00:02:27.790> string<00:02:28.150> fifth<00:02:28.450> fret

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:54.600 

and<00:02:33.910> then<00:02:34.120> G<00:02:34.450> string<00:02:34.780> third<00:02:35.110> fret

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.270 

and<00:02:54.880> you're<00:02:55.030> just<00:02:55.120> doing<00:02:55.240> open

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.190 

and<00:03:05.000> we<00:03:06.000> come<00:03:06.209> back<00:03:06.390> here<00:03:06.629> you're<00:03:06.750> gonna<00:03:06.840> do<00:03:07.049> an

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
and we come back here you're gonna do an

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.869 
and we come back here you're gonna do an
e<00:03:07.439> shape<00:03:08.659> so<00:03:09.659> you<00:03:09.989> got<00:03:10.200> second<00:03:11.040> fret<00:03:11.310> of<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.579> a

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.150 
that good to begin with so that's pretty

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.749 
that good to begin with so that's pretty
much<00:06:46.330> it<00:06:46.600> right<00:06:46.840> there<00:06:47.380> I<00:06:47.710> can't<00:06:48.520> think<00:06:48.699> of
