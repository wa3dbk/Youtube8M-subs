now<00:03:04.919> absolutely<00:03:05.099> not<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.790> reason

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
now absolutely not and the reason

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.309 
now absolutely not and the reason
there's<00:03:06.209> nothing<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.629> do<00:03:06.750> with<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.019> second

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
there's nothing to do with the second

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.409 
there's nothing to do with the second
moment<00:03:07.620> itself<00:03:07.889> actually<00:03:08.819> it's<00:03:09.150> because

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:09.419 
moment itself actually it's because

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:11.569 
moment itself actually it's because
there<00:03:09.599> are<00:03:09.659> a<00:03:09.689> lot<00:03:09.719> of<00:03:09.840> Genesis<00:03:10.260> games<00:03:10.500> I<00:03:10.799> still

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
there are a lot of Genesis games I still

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:12.709 
there are a lot of Genesis games I still

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:12.719 
need to collect from a Genesis to

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:14.059 
need to collect from a Genesis to
honestly<00:03:13.079> I<00:03:13.139> have<00:03:13.379> actually<00:03:13.739> a<00:03:13.769> very<00:03:13.980> small

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
honestly I have actually a very small

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.420 
honestly I have actually a very small
library<00:03:14.669> and<00:03:15.379> if<00:03:16.379> I<00:03:16.560> was<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.829> prime<00:03:17.069> focus<00:03:17.250> on

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
library and if I was the prime focus on

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.680 
library and if I was the prime focus on
the<00:03:17.489> in<00:03:17.579> the<00:03:17.639> asset<00:03:17.940> probably<00:03:18.269> focused<00:03:18.599> on

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
the in the asset probably focused on

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.869 
the in the asset probably focused on
this<00:03:18.870> even<00:03:19.590> though<00:03:19.709> because<00:03:20.159> Sega<00:03:20.519> Genesis

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
this even though because Sega Genesis

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.490 
this even though because Sega Genesis
games<00:03:21.180> are<00:03:21.359> very<00:03:21.599> expensive

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
games are very expensive

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.159 
games are very expensive
I<00:03:22.530> just<00:03:23.040> haven't<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.699> I<00:03:24.209> see<00:03:24.449> my<00:03:24.629> Steam<00:03:24.930> store
