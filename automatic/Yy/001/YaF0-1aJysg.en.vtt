00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
laptop great price it's actually very

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.400 
laptop great price it's actually very
closely<00:00:18.060> related<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.510> another<00:00:18.840> Acer<00:00:19.350> Aspire

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
closely related to another Acer Aspire

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.630 
closely related to another Acer Aspire
laptop<00:00:20.039> make<00:00:20.160> sure<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.310> don't<00:00:20.460> get<00:00:20.520> them

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
laptop make sure you don't get them

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.950 
laptop make sure you don't get them
confused<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:21.210> have<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.359> slightly<00:00:21.660> different

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
confused I have a slightly different

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.330 
confused I have a slightly different
model<00:00:22.020> number<00:00:22.350> it's<00:00:22.710> basically<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.220> same

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
model number it's basically the same

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.040 
model number it's basically the same
thing<00:00:23.519> so<00:00:23.640> this<00:00:23.730> one<00:00:23.880> has<00:00:24.050> 10/100/1000

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
thing so this one has 10/100/1000

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.920 
thing so this one has 10/100/1000
Ethernet<00:00:25.500> as<00:00:26.160> well<00:00:26.460> instead<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:26.970> 210<00:00:27.390> 100<00:00:27.840> so

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
Ethernet as well instead of 210 100 so

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.359 
Ethernet as well instead of 210 100 so
if<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.140> are<00:00:28.260> coming<00:00:28.439> into<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.619> network<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:29.310> is

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
if you are coming into a network this is

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.859 
if you are coming into a network this is
gonna<00:00:29.580> be<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.849> one<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.179> wanna<00:00:30.420> get<00:00:30.630> it's

gonna be the one that you wanna get it's

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.510 
gonna be the one that you wanna get it's
only<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.230> little<00:00:31.380> bit<00:00:31.500> more<00:00:31.679> expensive<00:00:31.920> I'd<00:00:32.219> get

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
only a little bit more expensive I'd get

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.400 
only a little bit more expensive I'd get
it<00:00:32.610> anyway<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.180> think<00:00:33.420> it's<00:00:33.540> awesome<00:00:33.690> let's

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
it anyway I think it's awesome let's

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.569 
it anyway I think it's awesome let's
start<00:00:34.590> by<00:00:34.680> taking<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.920> look<00:00:34.980> at<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.190> display

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
start by taking a look at the display

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.209 
start by taking a look at the display
this<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> very<00:00:36.149> nice<00:00:36.390> 15.6<00:00:37.230> inch<00:00:37.320> laptop<00:00:37.440> the

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
this is a very nice 15.6 inch laptop the

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.639 
this is a very nice 15.6 inch laptop the
native<00:00:38.489> resolution<00:00:38.550> on<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.270> 1366<00:00:39.750> by<00:00:40.230> 768

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
native resolution on this is 1366 by 768

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.100 
native resolution on this is 1366 by 768
so<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.250> will<00:00:41.370> play<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> full<00:00:41.820> 720p<00:00:42.390> high-def

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
so it will play a full 720p high-def

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.380 
so it will play a full 720p high-def
video<00:00:43.410> stream<00:00:43.890> if<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.129> want<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.460> does<00:00:45.030> have<00:00:45.239> a

connectivity goes like I mentioned this
one's<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.439> little<00:01:25.500> bit<00:01:25.710> better<00:01:25.799> because<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.250> has

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
one's a little bit better because it has

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.789 
one's a little bit better because it has
the<00:01:26.640> 802<00:01:26.939> 11<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.570> as<00:01:27.750> well<00:01:28.350> as<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.650> ten

the 802 11 and as well as the ten
101,000<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:30.119> also<00:01:30.420> got<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.810> six<00:01:31.049> cell

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
101,000 it's also got the six cell

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.230 
101,000 it's also got the six cell
battery<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.740> it's<00:01:31.860> gonna<00:01:31.950> give<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.310> about<00:01:32.610> 5
