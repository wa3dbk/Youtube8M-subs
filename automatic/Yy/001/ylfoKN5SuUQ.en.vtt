00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:14.339 
I talked to Ken a little bit about 5g

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:16.640 
I talked to Ken a little bit about 5g
and<00:00:14.519> how<00:00:15.119> how<00:00:15.389> always<00:00:15.780> sees<00:00:15.990> that<00:00:16.170> developing

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
so Ken held us how long way defying 5g

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.850 
so Ken held us how long way defying 5g
yeah<00:00:20.490> billion<00:00:21.090> five<00:00:21.300> T<00:00:21.540> is<00:00:22.050> one<00:00:22.290> of<00:00:22.440> the<00:00:22.560> most

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:22.860 
yeah billion five T is one of the most

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.160 
yeah billion five T is one of the most
exciting<00:00:23.250> innovations<00:00:23.970> in<00:00:24.120> our<00:00:24.210> industry<00:00:24.720> we

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
exciting innovations in our industry we

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.230 
exciting innovations in our industry we
believe<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:25.590> party<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.370> much<00:00:26.610> more<00:00:26.760> than<00:00:26.940> an

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
believe that party is much more than an

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.360 
believe that party is much more than an
upgrade<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:28.020> technology<00:00:28.710> from<00:00:29.160> my

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:29.370 
upgrade of technology from my

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.999 
upgrade of technology from my
perspective<00:00:29.700> I<00:00:30.090> think<00:00:30.120> 5<00:00:30.510> G's<00:00:30.750> new<00:00:31.320> technology

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
perspective I think 5 G's new technology

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.580 
perspective I think 5 G's new technology
5g<00:00:32.640> will<00:00:32.820> bring<00:00:33.120> us<00:00:33.329> amazing<00:00:34.020> features

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
5g will bring us amazing features

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.340 
5g will bring us amazing features

heavy investment in the technological

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.960 
heavy investment in the technological
innovation<00:01:28.350> for<00:01:29.010> example<00:01:29.369> we<00:01:29.460> just<00:01:29.670> announced

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
innovation for example we just announced

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.140 
innovation for example we just announced
that<00:01:30.270> we<00:01:30.930> develop<00:01:31.830> a<00:01:31.920> new<00:01:32.130> air<00:01:32.400> interface

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
that we develop a new air interface

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.210 
that we develop a new air interface
framework<00:01:33.560> includes<00:01:34.560> include<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:36.119> SEMA<00:01:37.220> OFDM

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
framework includes include the SEMA OFDM

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.850 
framework includes include the SEMA OFDM
and<00:01:38.400> Pollock<00:01:38.909> holy<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:40.140> new<00:01:40.650> air

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
and Pollock holy so this new air

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.270 
and Pollock holy so this new air
interface<00:01:41.310> were<00:01:41.820> not<00:01:42.090> just<00:01:42.900> you<00:01:43.080> know

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
interface were not just you know

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.190 
interface were not just you know
significantly<00:01:44.360> enhanced<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> spectrum

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
significantly enhanced the spectrum

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.950 
significantly enhanced the spectrum
efficiency<00:01:46.549> but<00:01:47.549> also<00:01:47.790> allows<00:01:48.180> for<00:01:48.570> more

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
efficiency but also allows for more

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.230 
efficiency but also allows for more
connections

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
connections

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.429 
connections
and<00:01:50.390> ultra-low<00:01:51.350> latency<00:01:51.850> so<00:01:52.850> in<00:01:53.780> market<00:01:54.200> child

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
and ultra-low latency so in market child

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.469 
and ultra-low latency so in market child
we<00:01:55.009> work<00:01:55.220> closely<00:01:55.490> with<00:01:55.729> some<00:01:55.970> of<00:01:56.329> our
