00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.790 

I<00:00:00.179> just<00:00:00.539> gave<00:00:00.690> everybody<00:00:01.020> a<00:00:01.199> sketch<00:00:01.560> of<00:00:01.589> the

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
I just gave everybody a sketch of the

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.679 
I just gave everybody a sketch of the
future<00:00:02.100> fill<00:00:02.310> in<00:00:02.399> some<00:00:02.550> of<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:02.730> gaps<00:00:02.760> well

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
future fill in some of the gaps well

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.510 
future fill in some of the gaps well
it's<00:00:03.810> an<00:00:03.929> exciting<00:00:04.380> future<00:00:04.650> we've<00:00:05.400> been

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
it's an exciting future we've been

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.369 
it's an exciting future we've been
working<00:00:05.730> hard<00:00:05.910> for<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.330> last<00:00:06.509> 10<00:00:06.870> years<00:00:07.080> on

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
working hard for the last 10 years on

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.200 
working hard for the last 10 years on
the<00:00:07.470> technology<00:00:07.859> that<00:00:08.220> literally<00:00:08.820> lets<00:00:09.059> the

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
the technology that literally lets the

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.209 
the technology that literally lets the
car<00:00:09.389> drive<00:00:09.599> itself<00:00:09.960> no<00:00:10.349> human<00:00:10.740> in<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:10.920> car<00:00:11.099> at

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
car drive itself no human in the car at

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.370 
car drive itself no human in the car at
all<00:00:11.340> that<00:00:12.059> sets<00:00:12.300> up<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.570> world<00:00:12.750> where<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.200> can

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
all that sets up a world where you can

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.379 
all that sets up a world where you can
design<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.980> car<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.580> assumption<00:00:15.089> that<00:00:15.120> you

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
design the car the assumption that you

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.750 
design the car the assumption that you
don't<00:00:15.570> need<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.780> driver<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.859> that<00:00:17.039> takes<00:00:17.369> us<00:00:17.580> to

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
don't need a driver and that takes us to

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.580 
don't need a driver and that takes us to
a<00:00:17.789> point<00:00:18.180> where<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.840> take<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.020> lot<00:00:19.199> of<00:00:19.230> parts

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
a point where you take a lot of parts

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.710 
a point where you take a lot of parts
off<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.920> car<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.730> put<00:00:20.880> some<00:00:21.090> parts<00:00:21.390> on<00:00:21.510> to

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
off the car to put some parts on to

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.570 
off the car to put some parts on to
drive<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.170> but<00:00:22.410> most<00:00:22.590> importantly<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.189> think<00:00:23.460> it

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
drive it but most importantly I think it

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.679 
drive it but most importantly I think it
puts<00:00:23.699> us<00:00:23.820> in<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.060> world<00:00:24.240> where<00:00:24.420> we<00:00:24.510> get<00:00:24.660> the

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
puts us in a world where we get the

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.450 
puts us in a world where we get the
crash<00:00:25.050> out<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.099> automobile

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
crash out of the automobile

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.519 
crash out of the automobile
transportation<00:00:27.029> see<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.660> least<00:00:27.840> act<00:00:28.050> like<00:00:28.170> oh

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
transportation see the least act like oh

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.290 
transportation see the least act like oh
I<00:00:28.740> absolutely<00:00:28.980> do<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.490> write<00:00:29.760> in<00:00:29.910> these<00:00:30.029> cars

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
I absolutely do I write in these cars

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.479 
I absolutely do I write in these cars
regularly<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.500> technology<00:00:32.189> has<00:00:32.279> progressed

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
regularly the technology has progressed

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.729 
regularly the technology has progressed
dramatically<00:00:33.420> since<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:34.140> was<00:00:34.260> first<00:00:34.440> tested

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
dramatically since it was first tested

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.520 
dramatically since it was first tested
in<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.430> 2007<00:00:36.360> time<00:00:36.540> frame<00:00:36.899> what's<00:00:37.260> going<00:00:37.469> to

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
in the 2007 time frame what's going to

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.530 
in the 2007 time frame what's going to
be<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.620> interim<00:00:38.160> period<00:00:38.730> like<00:00:38.910> once<00:00:39.239> these

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
be the interim period like once these

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.200 
be the interim period like once these
cars<00:00:40.110> are<00:00:40.440> allowed<00:00:40.620> on<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.070> road<00:00:41.100> what<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.090> it

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
cars are allowed on the road what is it

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.850 
cars are allowed on the road what is it
going<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.570> be<00:00:42.660> like<00:00:42.690> when<00:00:42.840> driverless<00:00:43.469> cars

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
going to be like when driverless cars

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.000 
going to be like when driverless cars
are<00:00:44.129> interfacing<00:00:45.030> with<00:00:45.210> cars<00:00:45.750> being<00:00:46.230> driven

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
are interfacing with cars being driven

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.190 
are interfacing with cars being driven
by<00:00:47.219> humans<00:00:47.610> most<00:00:48.149> can<00:00:48.329> be<00:00:48.360> much<00:00:48.690> like<00:00:48.899> what<00:00:49.079> we

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
by humans most can be much like what we

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.170 
by humans most can be much like what we
see<00:00:49.379> today<00:00:49.410> because<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.399> car<00:00:50.640> will<00:00:50.820> actually

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
see today because this car will actually

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.299 
see today because this car will actually
be<00:00:51.329> safer<00:00:51.840> than<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.050> human<00:00:52.410> driven<00:00:52.739> car<00:00:52.920> people

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
be safer than a human driven car people

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.250 
be safer than a human driven car people
are<00:00:53.430> not<00:00:53.579> very<00:00:53.820> good<00:00:54.180> drivers<00:00:54.600> quite<00:00:54.870> honestly

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
are not very good drivers quite honestly

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.080 
are not very good drivers quite honestly
there's<00:00:55.500> thirty<00:00:55.739> three<00:00:55.980> thousand<00:00:56.340> dollars<00:00:56.910> a

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
there's thirty three thousand dollars a

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.720 
there's thirty three thousand dollars a
year<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.480> u.s.<00:00:58.010> 1.2<00:00:59.010> million<00:00:59.340> worldwide

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
year in the u.s. 1.2 million worldwide

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.240 
year in the u.s. 1.2 million worldwide
so<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.690> idea<00:01:00.809> here<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.469> have<00:01:01.739> sensors

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
so the idea here is to have sensors

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.670 
so the idea here is to have sensors
things<00:01:02.670> like<00:01:02.820> lasers<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.600> radar<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.170> cameras

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
things like lasers and radar and cameras

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.160 
things like lasers and radar and cameras
and<00:01:04.890> computer<00:01:05.790> processors<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.450> basically

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
and computer processors that basically

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.690 
and computer processors that basically
do<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.439> driving<00:01:07.799> test<00:01:08.070> better<00:01:08.400> than<00:01:08.580> what<00:01:08.670> a

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
do the driving test better than what a

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.250 
do the driving test better than what a
human<00:01:09.030> can<00:01:09.150> do<00:01:09.299> what<00:01:09.720> about<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.990> implications

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
human can do what about the implications

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.530 
human can do what about the implications
for<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.070> automotive<00:01:11.460> industry<00:01:11.670> if<00:01:12.360> you've

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
for the automotive industry if you've

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.260 
for the automotive industry if you've
got<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.720> car<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.650> doesn't<00:01:13.680> need<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.130> driver<00:01:14.549> in

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
got a car that doesn't need a driver in

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.030 
got a car that doesn't need a driver in
theory<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.930> could<00:01:16.200> be<00:01:16.290> driving<00:01:16.650> around<00:01:16.740> all

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
theory it could be driving around all

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.719 
theory it could be driving around all
the<00:01:17.189> time<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:18.140> if<00:01:19.140> that's<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.650> case<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:20.250> mean

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
the time and if that's the case I mean

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.600 
the time and if that's the case I mean
Sheree<00:01:21.479> we<00:01:21.869> wouldn't<00:01:22.140> need<00:01:22.350> as<00:01:22.619> many<00:01:23.070> cars

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
Sheree we wouldn't need as many cars

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.910 
Sheree we wouldn't need as many cars
that<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.600> what's<00:01:25.290> going<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.470> happen<00:01:25.770> uh

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
that is that what's going to happen uh

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.070 
that is that what's going to happen uh
we'll<00:01:26.670> need<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.880> lot<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.150> cars<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.600> move<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
we'll need a lot of cars to move the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.810 
we'll need a lot of cars to move the
miles<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.470> people<00:01:28.829> want<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.100> travel<00:01:29.369> but<00:01:29.670> the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
miles that people want to travel but the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.359 
miles that people want to travel but the
car<00:01:30.060> will<00:01:30.150> be<00:01:30.329> used<00:01:30.930> up<00:01:31.229> much<00:01:31.439> faster<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:32.340> a

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
car will be used up much faster so a

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.429 
car will be used up much faster so a
shared<00:01:32.759> car<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.450> capacity<00:01:33.689> would<00:01:34.259> have

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
shared car in this capacity would have

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.410

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
nice job with safety feature so full

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.360

the<00:03:57.959> loop<00:03:58.169> so<00:03:58.470> now<00:03:58.620> you're<00:03:58.769> adding<00:03:58.980> things<00:03:59.430> to

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
the loop so now you're adding things to

the loop so now you're adding things to
the<00:03:59.699> car<00:03:59.819> which<00:04:00.209> make<00:04:00.419> them<00:04:00.599> more<00:04:00.810> costly<00:04:01.470> so<00:04:02.069> I

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
the car which make them more costly so I

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:03.949 
the car which make them more costly so I
believe<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.639> companies<00:04:03.090> that<00:04:03.239> can<00:04:03.389> prove<00:04:03.720> the

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
believe the companies that can prove the

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.530 
believe the companies that can prove the
cars<00:04:04.199> driverless<00:04:04.889> change<00:04:05.819> the<00:04:06.030> game<00:04:06.239> why

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
cars driverless change the game why

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.330 
cars driverless change the game why
because<00:04:07.169> we're<00:04:07.410> tethered<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:07.949> that<00:04:07.980> car

brands and you're going to have some

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.940 
brands and you're going to have some
great<00:04:46.510> technology<00:04:47.260> and<00:04:47.470> I<00:04:47.500> think<00:04:47.710> there<00:04:47.830> could

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
great technology and I think there could

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.890 
great technology and I think there could
be<00:04:48.010> some<00:04:48.370> possibilities<00:04:49.060> for<00:04:49.300> that<00:04:49.720> future

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
be some possibilities for that future
