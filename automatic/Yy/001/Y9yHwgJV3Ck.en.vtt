00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
okay so I'm doing this video to show the

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.360 
okay so I'm doing this video to show the
Rolex<00:00:05.549> Daytona<00:00:06.350> because<00:00:07.350> I<00:00:07.470> see<00:00:07.710> so<00:00:08.040> many

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
Rolex Daytona because I see so many

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.749 
Rolex Daytona because I see so many
fakes<00:00:08.760> of<00:00:08.970> these<00:00:10.340> compared<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.429> lot<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:11.639> the

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
fakes of these compared to a lot of the

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.289 
fakes of these compared to a lot of the
other<00:00:11.880> Rolexes<00:00:13.400> if<00:00:14.400> you're<00:00:14.519> looking<00:00:14.790> for<00:00:14.940> news

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
other Rolexes if you're looking for news

other Rolexes if you're looking for news
on<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.509> youth<00:00:15.690> market<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.800> need<00:00:16.949> a

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
on the youth market and you need a

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.650 
on the youth market and you need a
couple<00:00:17.220> things<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.550> look<00:00:17.789> for<00:00:18.650> as<00:00:19.650> far<00:00:20.010> as<00:00:20.250> a

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
couple things to look for as far as a

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.070 
couple things to look for as far as a
rolling<00:00:21.660> out<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:21.990> replicas<00:00:22.699> um<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.970> big<00:00:24.510> myth<00:00:24.810> is

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
rolling out of replicas um a big myth is

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.550 
rolling out of replicas um a big myth is
that<00:00:25.289> if<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:26.160> has<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.310> sweeping<00:00:26.910> hand<00:00:27.199> it's<00:00:28.199> real

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
that if it has a sweeping hand it's real

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.560 
that if it has a sweeping hand it's real
and<00:00:30.650> that's<00:00:31.650> not<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.189> case<00:00:32.399> at<00:00:32.790> all

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.740 

most<00:00:36.570> replicas<00:00:37.200> now<00:00:37.700> have<00:00:38.700> sweeping<00:00:39.120> hands

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
most replicas now have sweeping hands

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.639 
most replicas now have sweeping hands
and<00:00:39.930> there<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.040> actually<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> couple<00:00:42.649> authentic

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
and there is actually a couple authentic

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.430 
and there is actually a couple authentic
Rolexes<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.460> have<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:45.629> quartz<00:00:46.020> movement

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
Rolexes that have the quartz movement

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.400 
Rolexes that have the quartz movement
and<00:00:46.590> have<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.739> tick<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.160> hand<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.760> don't<00:00:48.410> ever

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
and have a tick in hand so don't ever

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.529 
and have a tick in hand so don't ever
fall<00:00:49.710> for<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:50.360> you<00:00:51.360> want<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.629> make<00:00:51.809> sure<00:00:53.539> on

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
fall for that you want to make sure on

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.830 
fall for that you want to make sure on
the<00:00:55.530> actual<00:00:55.920> crown<00:00:56.390> you<00:00:57.390> want<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.660> make<00:00:57.809> sure

the actual crown you want to make sure

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.500 
the actual crown you want to make sure
that<00:00:58.379> it's<00:00:58.649> not<00:00:58.859> flat<00:00:59.399> it's<00:00:59.910> got<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.090> little<00:01:00.359> bit

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
that it's not flat it's got a little bit

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.200 
that it's not flat it's got a little bit
a<00:01:02.420> three-dimensional<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:05.090> then<00:01:06.090> you

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
a three-dimensional to it and then you

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.550 
a three-dimensional to it and then you
want<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.450> look<00:01:06.600> at<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.780> dial<00:01:07.170> make<00:01:07.439> sure

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
want to look at the dial make sure

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.100 
want to look at the dial make sure
everything's<00:01:07.979> flawless<00:01:11.510> these<00:01:12.510> watches<00:01:12.960> are

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
everything's flawless these watches are

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.660 
everything's flawless these watches are
pretty<00:01:13.680> hard<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.920> tell<00:01:14.100> if<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.280> haven't<00:01:14.490> seen

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
pretty hard to tell if you haven't seen

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.070 
pretty hard to tell if you haven't seen
a<00:01:14.700> lot<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:14.970> them<00:01:15.180> but<00:01:15.330> one<00:01:15.509> thing<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.780> can<00:01:15.930> do

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
a lot of them but one thing you can do

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.310 
a lot of them but one thing you can do
is<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.640> can<00:01:17.790> look<00:01:17.909> at<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.180> back<00:01:18.450> look<00:01:19.140> at<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
is you can look at the back look at the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.800 
is you can look at the back look at the
pinhole<00:01:19.740> cutouts<00:01:20.479> make<00:01:21.479> sure<00:01:21.659> they're

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
pinhole cutouts make sure they're

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.590 
pinhole cutouts make sure they're
completely<00:01:22.259> smooth<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.460> don't<00:01:24.330> want

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
completely smooth you don't want

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.230 
completely smooth you don't want
choppiness<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.590> them<00:01:25.740> that's<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.580> sure<00:01:26.850> sign<00:01:26.880> of

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
choppiness in them that's a sure sign of

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.359 
choppiness in them that's a sure sign of
a<00:01:27.509> replica<00:01:27.990> make<00:01:28.170> sure<00:01:28.350> they're<00:01:28.500> rounded<00:01:29.180> and

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
a replica make sure they're rounded and

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:38.240 
a replica make sure they're rounded and
really<00:01:32.369> really<00:01:32.670> clean<00:01:32.970> cut

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.709 

another<00:01:39.250> way<00:01:39.460> is<00:01:39.640> obviously<00:01:40.119> to<00:01:40.210> take<00:01:40.360> off<00:01:40.570> the

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:40.719 
another way is obviously to take off the

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:42.120 
another way is obviously to take off the
back<00:01:40.930> I'm<00:01:41.110> not<00:01:41.259> going<00:01:41.409> to<00:01:41.469> take<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:41.710> back<00:01:41.950> off

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
back I'm not going to take the back off

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.490 
back I'm not going to take the back off
this<00:01:42.340> one<00:01:42.579> but<00:01:42.700> if<00:01:42.789> you<00:01:42.909> want<00:01:43.119> to<00:01:43.210> see<00:01:43.500> the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
this one but if you want to see the

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.969 
this one but if you want to see the
movement<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:46.570> have<00:01:47.200> pictures<00:01:47.590> on<00:01:47.710> my<00:01:47.829> website

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
movement I have pictures on my website

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.660 
movement I have pictures on my website
you<00:01:48.369> can<00:01:48.399> go<00:01:48.670> to<00:01:48.729> that<00:01:48.939> to<00:01:49.750> compare<00:01:50.460> real<00:01:51.460> and

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
you can go to that to compare real and

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.690 
you can go to that to compare real and
replica<00:01:52.090> movements<00:01:53.069> you<00:01:54.069> also<00:01:54.189> want<00:01:54.490> to<00:01:54.520> make

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
replica movements you also want to make

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.300 
replica movements you also want to make
sure<00:01:54.729> that<00:01:55.259> where<00:01:56.259> the<00:01:56.350> band<00:01:56.649> hooks<00:01:56.950> into<00:01:57.130> the

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
sure that where the band hooks into the

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.330 
sure that where the band hooks into the
case<00:01:57.549> right<00:01:57.819> here<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:59.590> it<00:01:59.710> fits<00:01:59.950> flush<00:02:02.340> there

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
case right here that it fits flush there

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.249 
case right here that it fits flush there
are<00:02:03.460> some<00:02:03.640> fake<00:02:03.850> ones<00:02:04.060> at<00:02:04.179> fit<00:02:04.360> flush<00:02:04.600> also<00:02:05.049> but

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
are some fake ones at fit flush also but

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.550 
are some fake ones at fit flush also but
a<00:02:05.289> lot<00:02:05.500> of<00:02:05.590> them<00:02:05.710> have<00:02:05.950> and<00:02:06.750> overlap<00:02:07.750> overlaps

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
a lot of them have and overlap overlaps

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.630 
a lot of them have and overlap overlaps
on<00:02:08.799> the<00:02:08.920> case<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:11.410> now<00:02:11.709> we<00:02:11.769> can<00:02:12.040> go<00:02:12.190> to<00:02:12.250> the

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
on the case so now we can go to the

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.620 
on the case so now we can go to the
clasp<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:15.250> want<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.489> look<00:02:15.610> at<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.849> crown<00:02:16.150> make

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
clasp you want to look at the crown make

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.410 
clasp you want to look at the crown make
sure<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.930> crown<00:02:17.549> looks<00:02:18.549> really<00:02:18.910> good

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
sure the crown looks really good

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.600 
sure the crown looks really good
a<00:02:22.349> lot<00:02:23.349> of<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.560> replicas<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.130> Crown's<00:02:24.430> a

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
a lot of the replicas the Crown's a

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.360 
a lot of the replicas the Crown's a
little<00:02:24.849> off<00:02:25.030> I<00:02:25.650> know<00:02:26.650> that's<00:02:26.829> probably<00:02:26.950> kinda

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
little off I know that's probably kinda

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.690 
little off I know that's probably kinda
hard<00:02:27.549> to<00:02:27.610> tell<00:02:27.910> on<00:02:28.150> that<00:02:28.360> one<00:02:29.069> but<00:02:30.069> also<00:02:30.489> you

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
hard to tell on that one but also you

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.850 
hard to tell on that one but also you
want<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:30.970> make<00:02:31.030> sure<00:02:31.299> that<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.569> crown<00:02:31.840> is<00:02:32.140> one

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
want to make sure that the crown is one

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.460 
want to make sure that the crown is one
piece<00:02:33.360> with<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.510> bracelet<00:02:35.019> a<00:02:35.049> lot<00:02:35.319> of<00:02:35.410> the

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
piece with the bracelet a lot of the

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.589 
piece with the bracelet a lot of the
replicas<00:02:35.980> you<00:02:36.220> can<00:02:36.640> tell<00:02:36.849> that<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.150> crown<00:02:37.420> was

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
replicas you can tell that the crown was

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.289 
replicas you can tell that the crown was
made<00:02:37.660> and<00:02:38.110> then<00:02:38.230> kind<00:02:39.010> of<00:02:39.099> set<00:02:39.400> on<00:02:39.640> there<00:02:39.880> glued

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
made and then kind of set on there glued

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.870 
made and then kind of set on there glued
on<00:02:40.510> there<00:02:40.750> and<00:02:41.280> sometimes<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.430> can<00:02:42.579> even<00:02:42.609> see

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
on there and sometimes you can even see

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.920 
on there and sometimes you can even see
the<00:02:43.000> pin<00:02:43.299> that<00:02:44.200> holds<00:02:44.440> it<00:02:44.680> in<00:02:44.829> on<00:02:45.069> the<00:02:45.760> back<00:02:46.000> on

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
the pin that holds it in on the back on

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.300 
the pin that holds it in on the back on
the<00:02:47.079> replicas<00:02:49.350> so<00:02:50.350> then<00:02:50.620> you<00:02:50.709> can<00:02:50.859> open<00:02:51.130> it<00:02:51.220> up

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
the replicas so then you can open it up

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.099 
the replicas so then you can open it up
this<00:02:51.579> is<00:02:51.700> a<00:02:51.730> newer<00:02:51.970> style<00:02:52.120> clasp<00:02:52.660> so<00:02:53.459> um<00:02:55.109> make

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
this is a newer style clasp so um make

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.340 
this is a newer style clasp so um make
sure<00:02:56.139> it's<00:02:56.410> got<00:02:56.500> all<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.709> proper<00:02:56.920> markings<00:02:58.350> as

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
you can see right there in there a lot

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.360 
you can see right there in there a lot
of<00:03:07.989> times<00:03:08.200> these<00:03:08.410> markings<00:03:08.920> don't<00:03:09.130> really

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
ones but one thing I do know is even on

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.190 
ones but one thing I do know is even on
the<00:03:14.319> high<00:03:14.440> dollar<00:03:14.500> ones<00:03:15.040> I've<00:03:16.019> noticed<00:03:17.019> those

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
the high dollar ones I've noticed those

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.289 
the high dollar ones I've noticed those
cutouts<00:03:17.650> aren't<00:03:18.010> clean<00:03:18.280> so<00:03:18.609> always<00:03:18.940> take<00:03:19.239> a

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
cutouts aren't clean so always take a

look at that and if you see they're not

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.970 
look at that and if you see they're not
it's<00:03:22.510> a<00:03:22.690> sure<00:03:22.930> sign<00:03:22.959> that's<00:03:23.620> not<00:03:23.829> authentic

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
it's a sure sign that's not authentic
