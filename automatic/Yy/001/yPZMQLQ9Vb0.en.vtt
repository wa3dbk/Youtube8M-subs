00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
uh flat the super flat world and how

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.600 
uh flat the super flat world and how
that<00:00:39.030> works<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:39.950> basically<00:00:40.950> for<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.370> super

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
that works so basically for the super

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.479 
that works so basically for the super
flat<00:00:41.790> world<00:00:42.000> start<00:00:42.450> with<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:43.100> how<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.160> doing

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
flat world start with that how you doing

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.889 
flat world start with that how you doing
you<00:00:44.550> have<00:00:44.730> more<00:00:44.910> options<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.510> world<00:00:45.660> and

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
you have more options in the world and

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.119 
you have more options in the world and
then<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.020> just<00:00:46.230> hit<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.410> super<00:00:46.649> flat<00:00:46.800> option

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
then you just hit the super flat option

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.430 
then you just hit the super flat option
really<00:00:47.280> easy<00:00:47.550> really<00:00:47.730> simple<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.420> then<00:00:49.230> it'll

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
really easy really simple and then it'll

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.610 
really easy really simple and then it'll

then you hold via or you push the right
analog<00:02:13.420> stick<00:02:13.600> down<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.500> go<00:02:14.950> down<00:02:15.160> because

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
analog stick down to go down because

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.670 
analog stick down to go down because
that<00:02:15.400> is<00:02:15.610> Crouch<00:02:15.850> so<00:02:16.120> jump<00:02:16.480> is<00:02:16.690> go<00:02:16.930> up<00:02:17.110> crouches

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
that is Crouch so jump is go up crouches

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.670 
that is Crouch so jump is go up crouches
go<00:02:17.830> down<00:02:18.040> pretty<00:02:18.730> self-explanatory<00:02:19.320> and<00:02:20.320> see

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
go down pretty self-explanatory and see

animation you hit the button twice the

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.170 
animation you hit the button twice the
left<00:02:31.930> analog<00:02:32.290> stick<00:02:32.350> up<00:02:32.800> twice<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:33.430> you<00:02:34.060> will

definitely see you know some really cool

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.460 
definitely see you know some really cool
structures<00:04:10.450> being<00:04:10.930> built<00:04:11.200> in<00:04:11.410> here<00:04:11.860> um<00:04:12.519> so

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
structures being built in here um so

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.630 
structures being built in here um so
that's<00:04:14.470> pretty<00:04:14.680> much<00:04:14.739> it<00:04:14.920> the<00:04:15.340> floor

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
that's pretty much it the floor

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.729 
that's pretty much it the floor
obviously<00:04:16.419> stays<00:04:16.780> a<00:04:16.810> little<00:04:17.049> fire

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
obviously stays a little fire

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.289 
obviously stays a little fire
we're<00:04:18.310> gonna<00:04:18.400> head<00:04:18.609> back<00:04:18.639> to<00:04:18.790> the<00:04:19.030> other<00:04:19.150> one

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
we're gonna head back to the other one

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.920 
we're gonna head back to the other one
though<00:04:19.450> and<00:04:19.479> I<00:04:20.639> just<00:04:21.639> want<00:04:21.760> to<00:04:21.850> say<00:04:22.030> that<00:04:22.450> on

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
though and I just want to say that on

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.140 
though and I just want to say that on
here<00:04:23.760> because<00:04:24.760> you<00:04:25.060> were<00:04:25.690> three<00:04:26.139> above

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
here because you were three above

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.730 
here because you were three above
bedrock<00:04:28.150> you<00:04:28.720> were<00:04:28.810> actually<00:04:28.990> on<00:04:29.200> level<00:04:29.500> five

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
bedrock you were actually on level five

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.690 
bedrock you were actually on level five
so<00:04:30.040> you<00:04:30.100> have<00:04:30.400> a<00:04:30.430> a<00:04:31.979> tremendous<00:04:32.979> amount<00:04:33.340> of<00:04:33.460> um

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
so you have a a tremendous amount of um

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.600 
so you have a a tremendous amount of um
space<00:04:34.600> to<00:04:34.840> actually<00:04:35.169> build<00:04:35.440> on<00:04:35.740> to<00:04:36.250> the<00:04:36.370> height

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
space to actually build on to the height

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.610 
space to actually build on to the height
limit<00:04:36.640> which<00:04:37.120> I<00:04:37.360> forget<00:04:37.870> what<00:04:37.990> it<00:04:38.110> is<00:04:38.229> but<00:04:38.440> it's

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
limit which I forget what it is but it's

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.610 
limit which I forget what it is but it's
you<00:04:38.979> know<00:04:39.070> get<00:04:39.280> a<00:04:39.690> good<00:04:40.690> amount<00:04:41.410> of<00:04:41.500> ways

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
you know get a good amount of ways

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.469 
you know get a good amount of ways
because<00:04:41.860> usually<00:04:42.039> the<00:04:42.460> building<00:04:43.090> or<00:04:43.330> the

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
because usually the building or the

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.810 
because usually the building or the
ground<00:04:44.320> would<00:04:44.770> start<00:04:45.100> at<00:04:45.250> like<00:04:45.370> right<00:04:45.610> now

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
ground would start at like right now

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.790 
ground would start at like right now
like<00:04:46.150> at<00:04:46.270> seventy<00:04:46.660> five<00:04:46.690> ish<00:04:47.140> that's<00:04:47.380> usually

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
like at seventy five ish that's usually

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.740 
like at seventy five ish that's usually
the<00:04:47.830> default<00:04:48.520> layer<00:04:49.000> or<00:04:49.390> something<00:04:49.419> like<00:04:49.690> that

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
the default layer or something like that

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.040 
the default layer or something like that
and<00:04:50.550> you<00:04:51.550> can<00:04:51.700> tell<00:04:51.850> you<00:04:51.940> can<00:04:51.970> just<00:04:52.180> go<00:04:52.300> really

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
and you can tell you can just go really

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.120 
and you can tell you can just go really
high<00:04:53.260> and<00:04:53.740> I<00:04:55.350> mean<00:04:56.350> it<00:04:56.530> should<00:04:56.740> be<00:04:56.770> really<00:04:57.010> cool

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
high and I mean it should be really cool

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.469 
high and I mean it should be really cool
because<00:04:57.340> I<00:04:57.610> can't<00:04:57.880> wait<00:04:58.030> to<00:04:58.120> see<00:04:58.270> what<00:04:58.360> people

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
because I can't wait to see what people

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.800 
because I can't wait to see what people
build<00:04:58.900> in<00:04:59.169> creative<00:04:59.890> mode<00:04:59.919> in<00:05:00.580> flat<00:05:01.360> world

build in creative mode in flat world

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.460 
build in creative mode in flat world
because<00:05:02.350> of<00:05:02.590> that<00:05:03.460> option<00:05:04.300> or<00:05:04.810> the<00:05:04.840> ability<00:05:05.440> to

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
because of that option or the ability to

because of that option or the ability to
do<00:05:05.650> that<00:05:05.800> at<00:05:05.979> least<00:05:07.380> so<00:05:09.360> this<00:05:10.360> promotion<00:05:10.690> of
