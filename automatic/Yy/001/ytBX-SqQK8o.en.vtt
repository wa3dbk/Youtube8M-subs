00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.210
 in reverse the content of this issue produced by the board 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.329
 federal 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.159
 so in fact if you want to set the mood and the timer counts the 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:33.310
 mountain we staged sober 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.460
 we will have to learn to manage the field because there is a time that is 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.790
 like a line that will last at least 23 24 minutes for the best 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.470
 the terrain is very changeable for all who have been to see a little bit of 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.870
 foot there are wrongs start a little bit in a meadow to pay 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.870
 we have to deal with a possible technical failure or 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.090
 legal 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.430
 the more you pay attention it's still pretty serious a nice descent 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.250
 we can reach you in the Sagnes meadow where we are after 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.900
 to make a big loop in the direction of Saint Jacques so for 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.260
 all those who have never come are very careful look good especially 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.530
 do not forget that the race is long a time of 25 minutes you need it 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.200
 manage because want field is very loaded 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.870
 not to mention that he was in private law 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.329
 yes it's a lot of pebbles 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:18.029
 so I will ask you to karim boudouda around to resort to several 

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:21.999
 hours according to the interests of tripoli the conditions of his closing of 

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:23.450
 busy because m 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.600
 these stuff like that he means what does it mean the German toni is 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.690
 all the more stupid cautious 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.600
 on the whole we talk to him more per year than the days of places that 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.000
 have 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.040
 or how to dry the animal so it will still be necessary 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.750
 I see how it's going to unfold in three places of typo3 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.060
 however seems to be in a hurry or four on the bank in those words that manage them 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.060
 now the first round this resort with velochrono 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.140
 in this demo is organized to set the starting order of tomorrow 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.180
 and after the real race to this day of rest 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.590
 so I tell you we watched a good day I'm not at 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.590
 running this problem thanks to you all 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.039
 the descent of the rescue team 

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:47.529
 in reality any other 

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:49.489
 why the right against very well 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.489
 on landing 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:15.939
 the controller 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.960
 marc bellemare 

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:36.809
 Libya 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:42.569
 third place 

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:49.469
 to the vote of the iOC 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:59.559
 so I'm waiting for tomorrow in Pau 

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:02.559
 I see arrive arrive 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.300
 ok the next morning 

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:14.749
 now that it is important 

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:17.389
 I think the same kind 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:19.960
 but good this year 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.960
 5 

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:30.610
 we are on the right track for now concentrated on him 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.930
 all the way it would be good the world the authors do not have the right to 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.159
 look at the landscape 

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:37.969
 north paris 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:40.969
 a glimpse of what it looks like 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.650
 reindeer 

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:52.550
 it's here 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.849
 the opah I really enjoyed 

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:59.060
 their only chance to come here early this week 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.930
 he was first 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.999
 really welcome everywhere 

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:08.219
 passionate bike club went well be with us 

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:12.240
 the last debate before addressing a week I discovered the place and its 

00:07:12.239 --> 00:07:13.580
 magnificent 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.360
 a superb 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.740
 this same circuit 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.419
 very difficult very technical with a little fast in places and their 

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:21.729
 party subscription 

00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:24.729
 when he was a little guy it's true he's in good standing 

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.949
 we have made good progress 

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:31.949
 because it went well the race for its part added 

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.189
 roger federer it's true that 

00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:39.949
 in fact it's a bit of a framework 

00:07:39.949 --> 00:07:41.009
 how to surpass 

00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:43.899
 and obviously it's one of those places season 

00:07:43.899 --> 00:07:46.899
 but the man feels that it's still a great weekend on the pebbles 

00:07:52.399 --> 00:07:54.319
 if everything went well I'm happy to win this first 

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:57.439
 victory and we can follow their example in classic 

00:07:57.439 --> 00:07:59.740
 I hope the raddho viewers 

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:00.910
 for the appointment for next year
