00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:13.019
 hello to everyone and welcome back in the company 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:16.230
 black of tutorial today I owe you 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:20.160
 to say that it has finally come out is reported 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.600
 in Italian only for devices with ios 6 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.970
 with jailbreak 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.210
 I have tested my opinion works 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.070
 really very well almost like Syrians 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.739
 original iphone 4s 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:40.890
 I clearly have ahi ahi s6 jailbroken 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:43.320
 I installed Syrians and I must say that if there 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.989
 it gets really good a little more 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.289
 I have seen difficulty on dictation 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.020
 vocal but still things that already from 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.410
 yesterday there was a light one 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.670
 I will now explain to you how 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.010
 install it first followed 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.120
 my jailbreak video 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.519
 on ios and 6 and subsequently as 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.420
 install cydia and then once 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:15.420
 installed cydia open it again I repeat that 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:19.280
 you must be his s6 and clearly siri 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.020
 can be installed on all devices 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.009
 and then we wait a moment for the 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.060
 loading 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:31.829
 ok now you have to add a new one 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:36.890
 source then go to manage then 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:39.110
 go to sources and make changes e 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.100
 adds 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:46.940
 now in this box you have to write http 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:50.360
 two points if you slash repo point yes 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.850
 reports ruth you will find the link 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.020
 both in a banner in this video and in the 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:03.290
 link in description and will be added 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:06.920
 this network goes against opening it e 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:11.180
 once opened you must install yes 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:14.450
 rest original on ice 6 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.550
 once installed this tweak where 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.090
 will ask you to restart the springboard 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:24.530
 and it is possible as in my case that the 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:27.830
 your ipod or iphone or even the crazy ones 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:31.220
 blocks on the apple logo 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:34.070
 if, as in my case, it is not blocked 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.770
 went into a panic because it is not necessary 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.860
 do a restore but i did a 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:43.580
 boot tethered with red noemi is back 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:46.519
 to the normal screen then one 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:53.750
 Once installed, open it again 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:58.120
 settings and go up here you carry 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:02.269
 punto rui original and click on install 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:10.760
 certificates will bring you a page of 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:12.620
 safari and you will have to press on here 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.750
 sorry if the first interrupted the video 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.200
 but it was because as you see he gave me that 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.540
 the site was not reachable is 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.519
 simply because as it serves some 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.950
 developers are literally caught 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:28.519
 of assault in the sense that many 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:31.459
 people are using this new port 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:34.150
 which then is quite the same as that 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.150
 original 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.490
 many times you when you press from 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.830
 safari certified crystal settings 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.530
 tells you that the server 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.620
 currently you don't have to 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:53.360
 do so many refreshes by clicking on this 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:55.190
 upload symbol this here and a 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.920
 at some point this will appear 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.200
 page you press install certificates 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.420
 I don't do it because I've already done it 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.240
 will bring you a page of 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.190
 settings where there will be a certificate 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.740
 and click on install 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.020
 don't worry if it tells you it's not 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.630
 reliable but it is simply because 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.000
 it is not an official signature but this is not 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.890
 it absolutely means that it is not 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.120
 trusted so you install the 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:26.180
 certificate is once installed 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.400
 you have to do a correct but the red 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:38.420
 but once done go in 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:40.610
 general settings go to Syrians and 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.440
 now since I have already accepted it now 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.260
 no longer sets me the first one 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.240
 time you will have to enable it and set it 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.690
 the language in Italian now I already have it 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.040
 done and therefore now no longer does it do 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:56.600
 anyway 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:59.150
 in fact once the language is quoted in 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:02.419
 some cases like mine won't make you anymore 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.280
 it will not make you change it then one 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.470
 Once the language has been set I advise you 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.350
 still to boot a tethered then 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:13.160
 rebooting your device is once 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:15.200
 rebooted if you try to open siri vi 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.930
 will say that it is currently not available 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.660
 but that you will receive a warning when 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.610
 you can start using Syrians 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.449
 so it happened to me after a quarter 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:28.330
 from now on my ipod my sector 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:31.719
 notice that said now you can start 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:41.349
 use Syrians and voice dictation 

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:44.050
 in fact I activated it bye siri vi 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:52.029
 I will show that they work well but of 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:54.009
 here it is here now I after this video 

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:56.830
 I will load another one in which I will make one 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:59.080
 also try quite long on in 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:03.310
 function on how this works new 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:05.439
 port the certificate is absolutely 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:09.909
 identical to the original iPhone 

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:13.150
 4s therefore in fact also supports the new ones 

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:16.960
 commands implemented by ios 6 precisely on 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:20.349
 iphone 4s is also iphone 5 clearly 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:23.259
 how the sport was introduced or 

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:26.529
 support for 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:30.789
 facebook and twitter you can find out who it is 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:32.800
 the director of a film rather than being 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:35.279
 many things have been improved because it is 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.279
 exactly 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:41.590
 like that of the iphone 4s so this 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:45.700
 in my opinion it is really complete 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:48.820
 very very functional apart from a few 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:51.160
 crash with voice dictation but yes 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:54.460
 I must say that on my ipod touch it does not have 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.260
 never worked so well especially 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:59.110
 whereas it also supports new ones 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:02.080
 languages ​​including Italian so I have 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:03.640
 I absolutely recommend you to install 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.260
 this door 

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.630
 I hope this video is there 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.970
 liked then if you want to get an idea a 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:13.990
 a little more in-depth looked at mine 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:16.540
 video in which I will do a sea port test 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:19.270
 what I showed you in this 

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:21.580
 video how to install and then 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:23.170
 subscribe to my channel and put me 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.360
 like my videos thanks 

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:28.170
 attention to the next guide 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.170
 Hello
