maybe have made these which i think is

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:39.729 
maybe have made these which i think is
always<00:02:37.469> a<00:02:37.680> plus

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
always a plus

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.190 
always a plus
usually<00:02:40.739> my<00:02:40.889> shoes<00:02:41.129> start<00:02:41.459> talking<00:02:42.299> which<00:02:43.019> is

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
usually my shoes start talking which is

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.379 
usually my shoes start talking which is
quite<00:02:43.469> good<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:44.040> that's<00:02:44.970> usually<00:02:45.180> when

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:45.389 
quite good and that's usually when

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:47.059 
quite good and that's usually when
people<00:02:45.419> tell<00:02:45.720> me<00:02:45.750> it's<00:02:46.319> time<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.620> get<00:02:46.709> some<00:02:46.919> new

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.429 
people tell me it's time to get some new
ones<00:02:47.099> but<00:02:47.669> to<00:02:47.760> me<00:02:47.939> they've<00:02:48.659> got<00:02:48.870> years<00:02:49.019> left<00:02:49.290> in

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:49.439

ones but to me they've got years left in
them<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:49.829> think<00:02:50.280> if<00:02:50.730> they<00:02:51.389> start<00:02:51.659> to<00:02:51.780> get<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:51.930> hole

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:52.169 
them I think if they start to get a hole

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:54.920 
them I think if they start to get a hole
in<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.349> toe<00:02:52.560> they're<00:02:53.549> a<00:02:53.579> peep<00:02:53.819> toe<00:02:54.060> if<00:02:54.329> it

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
in the toe they're a peep toe if it

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.360 
in the toe they're a peep toe if it
starts<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.260> tear<00:02:55.500> off<00:02:55.709> from<00:02:55.950> sort<00:02:56.159> of<00:02:56.220> they're
