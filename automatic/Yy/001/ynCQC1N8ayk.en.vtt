to call and let's talk about this so we

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:18.810 
to call and let's talk about this so we
have<00:00:17.619> our<00:00:17.740> three<00:00:17.919> options<00:00:18.249> we<00:00:18.369> can<00:00:18.460> fold<00:00:18.640> we

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:18.820 
have our three options we can fold we

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.179 
have our three options we can fold we
can<00:00:18.939> call<00:00:19.089> it<00:00:19.210> come<00:00:19.480> over<00:00:19.570> the<00:00:19.779> top<00:00:19.919> well<00:00:20.919> as<00:00:21.130> a

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:21.189 
can call it come over the top well as a

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:23.220 
can call it come over the top well as a
default<00:00:21.699> of<00:00:21.820> not<00:00:21.970> going<00:00:22.119> to<00:00:22.179> fold<00:00:22.449> I<00:00:22.599> assume

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
default of not going to fold I assume

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.130 
default of not going to fold I assume
that<00:00:23.259> any<00:00:23.710> REO<00:00:24.609> reseal<00:00:25.179> range<00:00:25.480> is<00:00:25.810> going<00:00:26.050> to

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
that any REO reseal range is going to

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.859 
that any REO reseal range is going to
include<00:00:26.409> a<00:00:26.800> range<00:00:27.159> that<00:00:27.310> Queens<00:00:27.939> does<00:00:28.179> just

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
include a range that Queens does just

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.769 
include a range that Queens does just
fine<00:00:29.109> against<00:00:29.650> so<00:00:30.310> I<00:00:30.730> assume<00:00:31.419> that<00:00:31.569> I'm<00:00:31.659> ahead

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
fine against so I assume that I'm ahead

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.870 
fine against so I assume that I'm ahead
plenty<00:00:32.470> enough<00:00:32.529> for<00:00:32.739> the<00:00:32.800> time<00:00:32.980> folding<00:00:33.640> is

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:33.880 
plenty enough for the time folding is

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.430 
plenty enough for the time folding is
not<00:00:34.000> a<00:00:34.120> question<00:00:34.450> for<00:00:34.660> me<00:00:34.810> so<00:00:35.140> I'm<00:00:35.260> just

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
not a question for me so I'm just

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.410 
not a question for me so I'm just
between<00:00:35.650> Colleen<00:00:36.550> or<00:00:36.790> coming<00:00:37.150> over<00:00:37.300> the<00:00:37.390> top

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
between Colleen or coming over the top

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
between Colleen or coming over the top
and<00:00:37.750> for<00:00:37.960> bidding

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
bet stack arranged as I do very well

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.420 
bet stack arranged as I do very well
against<00:00:43.570> particularly<00:00:44.170> one<00:00:44.560> like<00:00:44.740> say<00:00:44.950> tens

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430

plus<00:00:48.100> or<00:00:48.370> if<00:00:48.970> it's<00:00:49.120> even<00:00:49.330> wider<00:00:49.570> than<00:00:49.840> that

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
plus or if it's even wider than that

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.750 
plus or if it's even wider than that
then<00:00:50.740> I'm<00:00:50.890> definitely<00:00:51.100> feeling<00:00:51.490> very

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
then I'm definitely feeling very

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.790 
then I'm definitely feeling very
comfortable<00:00:52.360> going<00:00:52.390> to<00:00:52.660> a<00:00:52.930> four<00:00:53.440> bet<00:00:53.620> for

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
comfortable going to a four bet for

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.520 
comfortable going to a four bet for
something<00:00:54.160> like<00:00:54.400> 250<00:00:54.970> and<00:00:55.480> snap<00:00:55.960> call<00:00:56.260> when<00:00:56.380> he

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
something like 250 and snap call when he

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.560 
something like 250 and snap call when he
shoves<00:00:56.800> very<00:00:57.430> simple<00:00:57.790> and<00:00:57.910> if<00:00:58.000> he<00:00:58.090> calls<00:00:58.390> the

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
shoves very simple and if he calls the

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.910 
shoves very simple and if he calls the
four<00:00:58.750> bet<00:00:58.930> creates<00:00:59.290> a<00:00:59.350> super<00:00:59.530> small

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
four bet creates a super small

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.730 
four bet creates a super small
one-and-a-half<00:01:00.460> SPR<00:01:00.970> pot<00:01:01.210> very<00:01:01.690> easy<00:01:02.050> to<00:01:02.320> play

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:02.740 
one-and-a-half SPR pot very easy to play

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.360 
one-and-a-half SPR pot very easy to play
on<00:01:02.980> the<00:01:03.250> flop<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.750> in<00:01:05.170> a<00:01:05.350> situation<00:01:05.920> like<00:01:05.950> this

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 
on the flop so in a situation like this

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.060 
on the flop so in a situation like this
if<00:01:06.909> I<00:01:07.210> think<00:01:07.270> that<00:01:07.480> he<00:01:07.690> has<00:01:07.810> a<00:01:07.840> lot<00:01:07.990> of<00:01:08.070> strong

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
if I think that he has a lot of strong

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.730 
if I think that he has a lot of strong
stuff<00:01:09.670> then<00:01:09.970> I<00:01:10.000> still<00:01:10.300> beat<00:01:10.570> in<00:01:10.810> his<00:01:11.020> range<00:01:11.290> go

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
stuff then I still beat in his range go

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.320 
stuff then I still beat in his range go
for<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:11.950> format<00:01:12.280> stack<00:01:12.490> it<00:01:12.640> off<00:01:12.760> if<00:01:13.000> I<00:01:13.090> think

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
for the format stack it off if I think

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.630 
for the format stack it off if I think
that<00:01:13.450> he's<00:01:13.570> super<00:01:13.870> aggro<00:01:14.500> I<00:01:14.800> could<00:01:15.250> consider

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
that he's super aggro I could consider

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.250 
that he's super aggro I could consider
going<00:01:15.970> for<00:01:16.150> a<00:01:16.180> four<00:01:16.450> bet<00:01:16.600> if<00:01:16.750> I<00:01:16.870> think<00:01:17.020> he'll

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
going for a four bet if I think he'll

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.990 
going for a four bet if I think he'll
five<00:01:17.500> bet<00:01:17.710> shove<00:01:17.979> some<00:01:18.250> of<00:01:18.340> that<00:01:18.430> junk<00:01:18.790> or<00:01:18.970> a

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
five bet shove some of that junk or a

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.750 
five bet shove some of that junk or a
large<00:01:19.270> chunk<00:01:19.570> of<00:01:19.750> that<00:01:19.780> junk<00:01:20.140> if<00:01:20.890> I<00:01:21.100> don't<00:01:21.430> have

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
large chunk of that junk if I don't have

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.690 
large chunk of that junk if I don't have
that<00:01:22.030> read<00:01:22.330> and<00:01:22.630> I<00:01:22.720> still<00:01:22.990> think<00:01:23.260> that<00:01:23.440> he's

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
that read and I still think that he's

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.649 
that read and I still think that he's
for<00:01:24.700> betting<00:01:24.880> I'm<00:01:25.180> sorry<00:01:25.390> that<00:01:25.510> he's

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
for betting I'm sorry that he's

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.660 
for betting I'm sorry that he's
resealing<00:01:26.229> kind<00:01:26.409> of<00:01:26.500> aggressively<00:01:26.979> then<00:01:27.640> I

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
resealing kind of aggressively then I

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.960 
resealing kind of aggressively then I
don't<00:01:27.970> mind<00:01:28.180> calling<00:01:28.450> and<00:01:28.870> letting<00:01:29.830> him<00:01:30.100> kind

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
don't mind calling and letting him kind

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.850 
don't mind calling and letting him kind
of<00:01:31.060> value<00:01:31.360> tone<00:01:31.570> himself<00:01:31.990> letting<00:01:32.500> him<00:01:32.650> make

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
of value tone himself letting him make

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.980 
of value tone himself letting him make
bad<00:01:33.159> see<00:01:33.460> that's<00:01:33.670> letting<00:01:33.970> him<00:01:34.270> make<00:01:34.690> bad

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990

decisions<00:01:35.170> post<00:01:35.770> flop<00:01:35.950> go<00:01:36.280> from<00:01:36.520> there<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.930> at

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
decisions post flop go from there so at

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.700 
decisions post flop go from there so at
the<00:01:39.250> micros<00:01:40.000> I<00:01:40.450> do<00:01:40.840> assume<00:01:41.350> that<00:01:41.530> people

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
the micros I do assume that people

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.240 
the micros I do assume that people
reseal<00:01:42.549> incorrect<00:01:43.330> ranges<00:01:43.870> and<00:01:44.250> overvalue

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
reseal incorrect ranges and overvalue

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.430 
reseal incorrect ranges and overvalue
things<00:01:45.549> differently<00:01:46.180> preflop<00:01:46.630> so<00:01:47.110> there's

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
things differently preflop so there's

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.630

that can be great so it's really

that can be great so it's really
dependent<00:02:42.400> on<00:02:42.760> what<00:02:43.630> kind<00:02:43.870> of<00:02:43.959> range<00:02:44.230> you're

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
going to make the most amount of

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.160 
going to make the most amount of
mistakes<00:02:48.300> again<00:02:49.300> if<00:02:49.480> you<00:02:49.600> thought<00:02:49.780> that<00:02:50.050> he

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
mistakes again if you thought that he

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.930 
mistakes again if you thought that he
had<00:02:50.230> a<00:02:50.290> lot<00:02:50.500> of<00:02:50.590> say<00:02:50.739> like<00:02:50.890> nines<00:02:51.250> plus<00:02:51.700> right

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
had a lot of say like nines plus right

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.580 
had a lot of say like nines plus right
here<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.360> you<00:02:52.480> thought<00:02:52.690> about<00:02:52.810> raising<00:02:53.380> to

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
here and you thought about raising to

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.430 
here and you thought about raising to
four<00:02:53.890> bucks<00:02:54.130> stack<00:02:54.400> it<00:02:54.580> off<00:02:54.810> if<00:02:55.810> he<00:02:56.019> had<00:02:56.230> that

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
four bucks stack it off if he had that

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.979 
four bucks stack it off if he had that
here<00:02:56.799> he<00:02:56.950> had<00:02:57.160> that<00:02:57.340> preflop<00:02:57.880> and<00:02:58.150> thus<00:02:58.870> you

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
here he had that preflop and thus you

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.300 
here he had that preflop and thus you
could<00:02:59.200> have<00:02:59.290> considered<00:02:59.680> going<00:02:59.709> for<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.100> four

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
could have considered going for the four

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.520 
could have considered going for the four
bet<00:03:00.489> then<00:03:00.730> so<00:03:01.180> again<00:03:01.510> if<00:03:01.630> I'm<00:03:01.780> gonna<00:03:02.110> call<00:03:02.410> it

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
bet then so again if I'm gonna call it

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.960 
bet then so again if I'm gonna call it
free<00:03:02.769> I'm<00:03:02.890> probably<00:03:03.190> just<00:03:03.340> gonna<00:03:03.519> call<00:03:03.790> this

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970

and<00:03:20.380> say<00:03:20.560> he<00:03:20.829> did<00:03:21.100> end<00:03:21.280> up<00:03:21.340> having<00:03:21.670> a<00:03:21.760> Buffy

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
and say he did end up having a Buffy

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.020 
and say he did end up having a Buffy
hand<00:03:22.269> like<00:03:22.420> a<00:03:22.480> seventy<00:03:22.989> or<00:03:23.230> forty<00:03:23.650> five<00:03:23.859> is<00:03:24.400> he

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
hand like a seventy or forty five is he

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.460 
hand like a seventy or forty five is he
really<00:03:25.180> gonna<00:03:25.359> make<00:03:25.570> any<00:03:25.720> mistakes<00:03:26.079> with<00:03:26.230> it

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
really gonna make any mistakes with it

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.500 
really gonna make any mistakes with it
is<00:03:26.950> he<00:03:27.130> really<00:03:27.280> gonna<00:03:27.430> continue<00:03:27.970> in<00:03:28.150> series

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
is he really gonna continue in series

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.599 
is he really gonna continue in series
with<00:03:28.690> those<00:03:28.810> kind<00:03:29.019> of<00:03:29.079> hands<00:03:29.400> probably<00:03:30.400> not

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
with those kind of hands probably not

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.180 
with those kind of hands probably not
fs:i<00:03:31.150> probably<00:03:31.570> don't<00:03:31.750> like<00:03:31.959> it<00:03:32.170> yeah<00:03:32.859> if<00:03:33.040> we

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
fs:i probably don't like it yeah if we

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.520 
fs:i probably don't like it yeah if we
raise<00:03:33.430> we<00:03:33.730> still<00:03:34.000> get<00:03:34.180> value<00:03:34.720> from<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.290> draws

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
raise we still get value from the draws

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.349 
raise we still get value from the draws
that<00:03:35.769> he<00:03:35.829> can't<00:03:36.070> fold<00:03:36.340> but<00:03:36.730> how<00:03:36.970> many<00:03:37.030> draws

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
that he can't fold but how many draws

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:38.880 
that he can't fold but how many draws
are<00:03:37.570> there<00:03:37.690> really<00:03:37.870> in<00:03:38.049> his<00:03:38.140> range<00:03:38.410> in<00:03:38.709> two

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
are there really in his range in two

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.250 
are there really in his range in two
draws<00:03:39.160> that<00:03:39.700> heavily<00:03:40.150> dominate<00:03:40.690> his<00:03:40.870> range

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
draws that heavily dominate his range

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.740 
draws that heavily dominate his range
I'd<00:03:41.440> say<00:03:41.620> that's<00:03:41.769> kind<00:03:42.130> of<00:03:42.190> up<00:03:42.340> for<00:03:42.489> debate<00:03:43.060> so

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
I'd say that's kind of up for debate so

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.590 
I'd say that's kind of up for debate so
taking<00:03:44.410> here<00:03:44.650> a<00:03:44.680> line<00:03:45.010> of<00:03:45.340> calling<00:03:46.090> here<00:03:46.420> and

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
taking here a line of calling here and

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.360 
taking here a line of calling here and
again<00:03:46.780> trying<00:03:47.170> to<00:03:47.230> induce<00:03:47.500> more<00:03:47.799> bets<00:03:48.070> on<00:03:48.250> the

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
again trying to induce more bets on the

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.340 
again trying to induce more bets on the
river<00:03:48.549> I'm<00:03:48.850> totally<00:03:49.359> on<00:03:49.630> board<00:03:49.660> with<00:03:49.930> and<00:03:50.230> it's

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
river I'm totally on board with and it's

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.020 
river I'm totally on board with and it's
something<00:03:50.560> that<00:03:50.680> I'm<00:03:50.799> probably<00:03:51.160> gonna<00:03:51.370> be

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
something that I'm probably gonna be

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.520 
something that I'm probably gonna be
doing<00:03:52.209> here<00:03:52.570> a<00:03:52.600> very<00:03:52.810> large<00:03:53.019> chunk<00:03:53.320> of<00:03:53.470> the

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
doing here a very large chunk of the

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.580 
doing here a very large chunk of the
time<00:03:53.739> again<00:03:54.160> given<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:54.790> preflop<00:03:55.269> call<00:03:55.810> given

time again given the preflop call given

time again given the preflop call given
the<00:03:56.650> assumptions<00:03:57.100> that<00:03:57.160> go<00:03:57.400> into<00:03:57.640> making<00:03:58.000> that

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
the assumptions that go into making that

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.069 
the assumptions that go into making that
action<00:03:58.900> as<00:03:59.760> played<00:04:00.760> we<00:04:01.090> catch<00:04:01.269> the<00:04:01.480> over<00:04:01.840> card

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
action as played we catch the over card

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:03.990 
action as played we catch the over card
on<00:04:02.170> the<00:04:02.260> river<00:04:02.440> which<00:04:02.739> kind<00:04:03.010> of<00:04:03.100> sucks<00:04:03.310> and<00:04:03.609> he

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
on the river which kind of sucks and he

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.680 
on the river which kind of sucks and he
checks<00:04:04.299> so<00:04:05.170> at<00:04:05.709> this<00:04:06.010> point<00:04:06.370> we<00:04:07.299> have<00:04:07.450> our<00:04:07.480> two

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
checks so at this point we have our two

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.660 
checks so at this point we have our two
options<00:04:07.840> we<00:04:08.170> can<00:04:08.319> check<00:04:08.500> or<00:04:08.650> we<00:04:08.739> can<00:04:08.890> bet<00:04:09.100> if<00:04:09.430> we

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
options we can check or we can bet if we

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.550 
options we can check or we can bet if we
bet<00:04:09.940> do<00:04:10.329> we<00:04:10.450> ever<00:04:10.569> get<00:04:10.900> worse<00:04:11.200> hands<00:04:11.440> to

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
bet do we ever get worse hands to

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.460 
bet do we ever get worse hands to
continue<00:04:11.950> or<00:04:12.069> a<00:04:12.100> better<00:04:12.310> hands<00:04:12.549> default

continue or a better hands default

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.330 
continue or a better hands default
definitely<00:04:14.470> not<00:04:14.590> getting<00:04:14.829> better<00:04:14.920> hands<00:04:15.190> to

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
definitely not getting better hands to

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.099 
definitely not getting better hands to
fold<00:04:15.519> King<00:04:15.910> ax<00:04:16.120> sets<00:04:16.450> and<00:04:16.660> he<00:04:16.720> that<00:04:16.870> kind<00:04:17.079> of

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
fold King ax sets and he that kind of

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.990 
fold King ax sets and he that kind of
stuff<00:04:17.380> hidden<00:04:18.039> two<00:04:18.310> pairs<00:04:18.579> none<00:04:18.820> of<00:04:18.940> that's

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
stuff hidden two pairs none of that's

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.539 
stuff hidden two pairs none of that's
gonna<00:04:19.209> fold<00:04:19.510> so<00:04:20.500> it's<00:04:20.769> just<00:04:20.859> can<00:04:21.160> we<00:04:21.250> get<00:04:21.370> worse

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
gonna fold so it's just can we get worse

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.820 
gonna fold so it's just can we get worse
hands<00:04:21.789> to<00:04:21.910> continue<00:04:22.330> would<00:04:22.900> he<00:04:23.080> cry<00:04:23.350> call<00:04:23.650> with

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
hands to continue would he cry call with

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.029 
hands to continue would he cry call with
8<00:04:24.010> X<00:04:24.220> 9<00:04:24.820> X<00:04:25.090> pocket<00:04:25.990> tens<00:04:26.200> pocket<00:04:26.590> jacks<00:04:26.800> if<00:04:26.950> he

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039 
8 X 9 X pocket tens pocket jacks if he

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:28.950 
8 X 9 X pocket tens pocket jacks if he
has<00:04:27.220> those<00:04:27.580> or<00:04:28.120> like<00:04:28.539> a

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
has those or like a

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.710 
has those or like a
five<00:04:29.229> and<00:04:30.160> I'd<00:04:30.310> say<00:04:30.550> it's<00:04:30.759> kind<00:04:31.150> of<00:04:31.330> tough<00:04:31.569> to

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
five and I'd say it's kind of tough to

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.590 
five and I'd say it's kind of tough to
get<00:04:31.810> looked<00:04:31.990> up<00:04:32.169> by<00:04:32.319> that<00:04:32.470> kind<00:04:32.650> of<00:04:32.800> stuff<00:04:33.039> and

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
get looked up by that kind of stuff and

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.270 
get looked up by that kind of stuff and
thus<00:04:34.600> I<00:04:34.810> don't<00:04:35.080> mind<00:04:35.350> heroes<00:04:35.710> check<00:04:35.949> behind

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
thus I don't mind heroes check behind

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.370 
thus I don't mind heroes check behind
and<00:04:36.850> again<00:04:37.389> given<00:04:37.690> the<00:04:37.720> assumption<00:04:38.169> that<00:04:38.199> you

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
and again given the assumption that you

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.409 
and again given the assumption that you
thought<00:04:38.620> that<00:04:38.919> Pete<00:04:39.160> had<00:04:39.460> a<00:04:39.490> lot<00:04:39.789> of<00:04:39.970> air<00:04:40.150> balls

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
thought that Pete had a lot of air balls

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.629 
thought that Pete had a lot of air balls
in<00:04:40.599> his<00:04:40.750> range<00:04:40.990> it's<00:04:41.770> even<00:04:42.069> tougher<00:04:42.250> to<00:04:42.490> get

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
in his range it's even tougher to get

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:44.129 
in his range it's even tougher to get
looked<00:04:42.849> up<00:04:42.970> on<00:04:43.180> that<00:04:43.330> River<00:04:43.569> when<00:04:43.810> he<00:04:43.840> just

looked up on that River when he just

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.409 
looked up on that River when he just

decides to check I mean the check does

nothing<00:04:59.349> it<00:04:59.470> would<00:04:59.530> be<00:04:59.590> difficult<00:04:59.860> to<00:05:00.190> assume

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
nothing it would be difficult to assume

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.370 
nothing it would be difficult to assume
that<00:05:01.000> he's<00:05:01.150> always<00:05:01.360> going<00:05:01.630> to<00:05:01.720> do<00:05:01.900> that<00:05:02.080> if<00:05:02.289> you

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
that he's always going to do that if you

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.620 
that he's always going to do that if you
had<00:05:02.560> some<00:05:02.770> info<00:05:03.099> sure<00:05:03.430> but<00:05:04.120> if<00:05:04.210> you<00:05:04.270> had<00:05:04.419> some

had some info sure but if you had some

had some info sure but if you had some
info<00:05:04.900> chances<00:05:05.380> are<00:05:05.470> you<00:05:05.590> would<00:05:05.710> possibly<00:05:06.610> take

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
info chances are you would possibly take

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.219 
info chances are you would possibly take
in<00:05:06.940> a<00:05:07.030> different<00:05:07.360> line<00:05:07.479> getting<00:05:07.690> up<00:05:07.960> to<00:05:08.139> the

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
then if we do decide to just call

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.040 
then if we do decide to just call
preflop<00:05:24.190> thinking<00:05:24.909> about<00:05:25.120> his<00:05:25.300> line<00:05:25.539> thinking

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
preflop thinking about his line thinking

about<00:05:26.259> his<00:05:26.409> range<00:05:26.650> post<00:05:26.949> op<00:05:27.190> and<00:05:27.430> yeah<00:05:27.759> he

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
about his range post op and yeah he

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.370 
about his range post op and yeah he
ended<00:05:28.000> up<00:05:28.180> picking<00:05:28.360> up<00:05:28.539> equity<00:05:28.930> on<00:05:29.020> the<00:05:29.139> turn

ended up picking up equity on the turn

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.469 
ended up picking up equity on the turn
but<00:05:29.770> even<00:05:30.580> that's<00:05:30.699> the<00:05:30.909> thing<00:05:31.090> like<00:05:31.240> when<00:05:31.389> he

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
but even that's the thing like when he

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.330 
but even that's the thing like when he
is<00:05:31.659> double-barreling<00:05:32.289> draws<00:05:32.590> his<00:05:32.860> draws<00:05:33.070> only

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.969 
percentage of the time and it's not like
we<00:05:37.449> have<00:05:37.539> to<00:05:37.659> super<00:05:38.110> panic<00:05:38.470> about<00:05:38.620> draws

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
we have to super panic about draws

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:40.589 
we have to super panic about draws
