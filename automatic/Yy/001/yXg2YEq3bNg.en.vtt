right<00:00:22.200> here<00:00:22.380> it's<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:23.450> undercarriage<00:00:24.450> of<00:00:24.480> the

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
right here it's a undercarriage of the

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.019 
right here it's a undercarriage of the
k76<00:00:25.770> one<00:00:26.009> and<00:00:26.989> it<00:00:27.989> was<00:00:28.140> on<00:00:28.259> clearance<00:00:28.500> for<00:00:28.770> like

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
k76 one and it was on clearance for like

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.900 
k76 one and it was on clearance for like
$5<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.720> got<00:00:30.899> two<00:00:31.079> of<00:00:31.230> them<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.910> basically

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
$5 so I got two of them and basically

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.069 
$5 so I got two of them and basically
come<00:00:33.329> was<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.890> wheel<00:00:34.890> with<00:00:35.100> red<00:00:35.280> about<00:00:36.079> five

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
come was a wheel with red about five

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.260 
come was a wheel with red about five
inches<00:00:37.559> or<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.239> they're<00:00:39.239> both<00:00:39.420> wheels<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.320> a

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
inches or so they're both wheels and a

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:48.829 
inches or so they're both wheels and a
little<00:00:42.270> axle<00:00:46.429> random<00:00:47.429> little<00:00:47.699> bolts<00:00:48.629> and

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:48.839 
little axle random little bolts and

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:59.529 
little axle random little bolts and
washers<00:00:49.519> then<00:00:50.519> caps<00:00:52.699> and<00:00:56.210> heard<00:00:57.210> about<00:00:57.329> that

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
washers then caps and heard about that

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:33.350 
washers then caps and heard about that
these<00:01:00.539> instructions

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.960 

and<00:01:34.360> that's<00:01:34.810> per<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.170> instructions<00:01:35.860> it<00:01:36.790> goes

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
and that's per the instructions it goes

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.480 
and that's per the instructions it goes
ahead<00:01:37.119> and<00:01:37.540> asks<00:01:37.780> for<00:01:38.229> a<00:01:38.380> wash<00:01:38.619> running<00:01:39.160> on

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
ahead and asks for a wash running on

00:01:39.490 --> 00:02:09.639 
ahead and asks for a wash running on
each<00:01:39.700> side

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:03:07.479 

a<00:03:05.049> little<00:03:06.049> Wayne<00:03:06.170> Casper<00:03:06.620> gave<00:03:06.799> me<00:03:06.980> hell<00:03:07.189> there

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
a little Wayne Casper gave me hell there

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:13.059 
a little Wayne Casper gave me hell there
but<00:03:10.359> they're<00:03:11.359> in<00:03:11.540> there<00:03:11.750> and<00:03:12.069> the

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
but they're in there and the

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:14.319 
but they're in there and the
instructions<00:03:13.519> didn't<00:03:13.730> really<00:03:13.970> show<00:03:14.150> which

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
instructions didn't really show which

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:20.069 
instructions didn't really show which
side<00:03:14.569> of<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.199> wheel<00:03:15.349> win<00:03:15.560> which<00:03:15.739> way<00:03:18.459> but<00:03:19.459> uh

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
side of the wheel win which way but uh

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.289 
side of the wheel win which way but uh
has<00:03:21.079> like<00:03:21.260> a<00:03:21.290> little<00:03:21.410> quarter<00:03:21.859> inch<00:03:22.299> piece

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
has like a little quarter inch piece

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.319 
has like a little quarter inch piece
sticking<00:03:23.660> out<00:03:23.750> on<00:03:23.870> this<00:03:24.019> side<00:03:24.290> so<00:03:25.239> assume<00:03:26.239> that

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
sticking out on this side so assume that

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:27.939 
sticking out on this side so assume that
goes<00:03:26.599> towards<00:03:26.900> a<00:03:26.959> walrus<00:03:27.169> eye<00:03:27.530> to<00:03:27.590> give<00:03:27.859> it

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:27.949 
goes towards a walrus eye to give it

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:35.619 
goes towards a walrus eye to give it
some<00:03:28.299> some<00:03:29.299> space<00:03:29.659> between<00:03:30.109> here<00:03:34.090> and<00:03:35.090> it

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
some some space between here and it

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:38.649 
some some space between here and it
looks<00:03:35.780> like<00:03:35.930> we're<00:03:36.109> done<00:03:36.319> well<00:03:37.389> was<00:03:38.389> a<00:03:38.419> wheel

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:38.659 
looks like we're done well was a wheel

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:43.030 
looks like we're done well was a wheel
part<00:03:39.129> so<00:03:41.139> let's<00:03:42.139> go<00:03:42.260> ahead<00:03:42.440> and<00:03:42.590> flip<00:03:42.799> this

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
part so let's go ahead and flip this

00:03:43.040 --> 00:04:00.250 
part so let's go ahead and flip this
over

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.300 

you<00:04:01.260> came<00:04:01.470> with<00:04:01.670> this<00:04:02.670> boat<00:04:03.590> and<00:04:04.590> it's<00:04:04.860> a<00:04:04.980> small

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
you came with this boat and it's a small

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.460 
you came with this boat and it's a small
little<00:04:05.400> nut<00:04:05.670> here<00:04:06.000> a<00:04:06.210> bigger<00:04:06.840> sized<00:04:07.080> nut<00:04:07.350> on

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
little nut here a bigger sized nut on

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:23.570 
little nut here a bigger sized nut on
this<00:04:07.620> side<00:04:07.890> and<00:04:08.820> the<00:04:08.970> locknut<00:04:22.160> so<00:04:23.160> basically

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
this side and the locknut so basically

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.440 
this side and the locknut so basically
right<00:04:23.910> there<00:04:25.460> if<00:04:26.460> I<00:04:26.670> go<00:04:26.820> ahead<00:04:26.910> and<00:04:27.030> flip<00:04:27.270> it

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
right there if I go ahead and flip it

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:47.270 
right there if I go ahead and flip it
over<00:04:41.540> pretty<00:04:42.540> straight<00:04:42.930> of<00:04:43.110> me<00:04:43.260> I<00:04:46.010> also<00:04:47.010> gotta

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
over pretty straight of me I also gotta

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.400 
over pretty straight of me I also gotta
go<00:04:47.460> back<00:04:47.670> and<00:04:47.700> time<00:04:48.030> that<00:04:48.240> bone<00:04:48.480> nut<00:04:48.780> on<00:04:49.050> there

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
go back and time that bone nut on there

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:57.920 
go back and time that bone nut on there
but

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:11.330 

I<00:04:59.600> think<00:05:08.360> once<00:05:09.360> again<00:05:09.509> this<00:05:09.960> is<00:05:10.139> a<00:05:10.340> Lincoln

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
I think once again this is a Lincoln

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:17.090 
I think once again this is a Lincoln
accessory<00:05:11.880> kit<00:05:12.800> which<00:05:13.800> is<00:05:14.070> a<00:05:14.750> k76<00:05:16.100> 100

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
accessory kit which is a k76 100

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:23.480 
accessory kit which is a k76 100
carriage<00:05:18.259> so<00:05:21.139> you<00:05:22.139> know<00:05:22.289> you<00:05:22.979> can<00:05:23.130> do<00:05:23.250> this<00:05:23.340> by

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
carriage so you know you can do this by

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.159 
carriage so you know you can do this by
yourself<00:05:23.880> in<00:05:24.380> five<00:05:25.380> minutes<00:05:25.830> or<00:05:26.759> you<00:05:27.060> can<00:05:27.240> mess

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
yourself in five minutes or you can mess

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.610 
yourself in five minutes or you can mess
around<00:05:28.199> like<00:05:28.650> me<00:05:28.830> and<00:05:28.979> take<00:05:29.180> seven<00:05:30.180> minutes

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620
