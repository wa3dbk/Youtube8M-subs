00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:12.580
 That is the biggest advance in the world 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.150
 modern physics since cleavage of the atom 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:21.410
 rare metal 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:24.699
 it is very unstable 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.699
 they consist of this metal 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.820
 a bit more about this 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.100
 never seen 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.360
 you can not because I spend money 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.010
 I believe that there is no case 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.010
 I think that's a transformer 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:54.190
 I ask her again 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:57.040
 where is the team after all we are 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:01.839
 have done for they make the people 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:05.400
 Now hunt for us but I'm afraid now 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.400
 we are all in sight 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.760
 I decided that 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.270
 this is not a war 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.270
 that is the downfall of humanity 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.560
 how many of us still have to 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.570
 We had to be sacrificed 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.659
 maybe not there on the 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.659
 But we are on who we can be 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.830
 I do not know my day in the prick 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.390
 we need a new army
