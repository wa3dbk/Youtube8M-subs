00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.730
 to lower your arms and will not continue working with it with the same 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.060
 attitude 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.130
 all 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.650
 there are here and some things that have to be important there have to be objectives 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:12.949
 long-range 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:15.130
 medium-range objectives 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.450
 and objectives bounded range the bull is going to allow out there at some point 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:24.869
 stimulate them and keep growing for 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.869
 try 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.300
 but to motivate us 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.269
 would be the word motivate us 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:34.180
 to keep growing 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.379
 many times 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:37.309
 and another outside planning 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:38.370
 the block 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.050
 the fight that we have to the crosses 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.710
 at least in Argentina 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.380
 and out there and good and giving covarsí what was good of the South American 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.740
 what happens to us in this part of the continent that how many are the 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.740
 basketball projects that are very clear 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.370
 the long-range objective the medium-range objective 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.610
 and the goal 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.489
 immediate reach would practically tell you that if we get to thinking and 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.380
 we analyze we asked for one 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.420
 they are counted with the hand of the teams that have very clear that 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.710
 situation 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.730
 But if we can not raise 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.140
 on the team in the development of a team 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.310
 in the development of a program we can consider 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.610
 p 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.610
 quite clearly that as stated by the objectives 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.010
 I have started 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.410
 the first point to discuss the third point of view of the steps to follow 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.640
 the competition calendar 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.960
 the competition calendar 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.960
 and we can not do any planning 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.780
 if it is not clear what the competition calendar is 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.060
 this will allow us to be able to program and make another program of 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.840
 work 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.320
 there is not going to be a 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.610
 p a single competition more let's see 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.300
 ec competition 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.049
 What is p 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.940
 not so important and a competition that the most important of all 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.509
 that where we are going 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:17.780
 really to play in many cases you can pass it 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.020
 the job is the most important competition where we 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.350
 we have to aim and that we aim at the athletes our players 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.349
 our in having that competition at the highest point of performance 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:34.339
 it is impossible that throughout the year 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:37.189
 the player in television percent 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:38.990
 performance curve 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.109
 that we have to have it clear 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:46.129
 and we have to try in planning that maximum curve 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.919
 performance as high as possible where we play 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.269
 where we play it 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.659
 Really 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.659
 the job 1 the success of the team 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.149
 we have to keep in mind that there are competitions 

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:04.869
 long and short competitions will surely end some 

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:09.279
 is deleted and padel Chinese for example that he played a short competition with the 

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:10.479
 selection of 

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:12.869
 provincial 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:15.869
 Planning is totally different 

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:18.959
 play an annual planning 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.099
 then the elections marsé extremarse then the body has 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.709
 Argentine selection for the South American Cadet 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.529
 totally different 

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:29.469
 some planning 

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:32.499
 my case with the cadets and mouths joined 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:35.499
 and I have the whole year to work 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:38.259
 what for a hundred 

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:40.190
 be very clear about that 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.210
 to 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.140
 be successful when my dog ​​ma mini planning fails 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:47.179
 p 

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:49.310
 and you have to take into account also 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.869
 what is going to be 

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:52.219
 rivals 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:55.219
 what are they going to do 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.989
 the accessible ones in which I know I can get there 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.539
 the rivals 

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:07.649
 that if I do something different I can win and also know the rivals that do not 

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:10.809
 I can win and I'm not interested in winning because they are a game with them 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.199
 then each one you can set an example I put you stroke or not 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:18.519
 planned that my players are 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.189
 in April May June July or 

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:26.060
 because I know that when I regulate I will have equal success 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.330
 My idea is to get well to December when we play the final of the league 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.250
 national youth 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.320
 or the final the capital tournament 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.860
 For try 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.759
 to try that way that they are well there 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:40.580
 all that time sosec for example that Fridays between not too hard for 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.990
 the reality that indicates but on Saturday although there is no tension per hundred 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.990
 it's more useful for me on Friday's training 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.990
 that really quite hard people because today we train everything that is 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.879
 the bullfights but let it be to the fast attack the defense of the whole field
