00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
the third book in this as well and I'm

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.040 
the third book in this as well and I'm
pretty<00:04:34.700> sure<00:04:34.820> these<00:04:35.210> are<00:04:35.420> middle<00:04:35.690> grade<00:04:35.900> I

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
pretty sure these are middle grade I

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.340 
pretty sure these are middle grade I
picked<00:04:36.380> these<00:04:36.500> up<00:04:36.880> years<00:04:37.880> and<00:04:38.180> years<00:04:38.840> ago<00:04:39.140> and

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
picked these up years and years ago and

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.020 
picked these up years and years ago and
I<00:04:39.410> never<00:04:39.710> got<00:04:40.100> around<00:04:40.220> to<00:04:40.400> reading<00:04:40.580> them<00:04:40.820> I

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
I never got around to reading them I

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.670 
I never got around to reading them I
think<00:04:41.360> it<00:04:41.420> was<00:04:41.480> mainly<00:04:41.690> because<00:04:41.930> I<00:04:42.350> couldn't

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
think it was mainly because I couldn't

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.890 
think it was mainly because I couldn't
find<00:04:42.890> the<00:04:42.980> sequel<00:04:43.400> so<00:04:43.700> if<00:04:44.000> I<00:04:44.090> do<00:04:44.150> like<00:04:44.510> it<00:04:44.690> then

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
find the sequel so if I do like it then

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.960 
find the sequel so if I do like it then
I<00:04:45.200> might<00:04:45.560> even<00:04:45.590> pick<00:04:46.010> up<00:04:46.220> the<00:04:46.460> second<00:04:46.760> book<00:04:46.880> I

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
I might even pick up the second book I

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.030 
I might even pick up the second book I
would<00:04:47.090> also<00:04:47.150> like<00:04:47.450> to<00:04:47.510> read<00:04:47.840> the<00:04:48.320> alchemist<00:04:48.830> by
