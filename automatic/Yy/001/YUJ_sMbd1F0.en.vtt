maps<00:00:22.260> especially<00:00:22.680> when<00:00:22.800> they<00:00:22.890> come<00:00:22.920> out<00:00:23.070> with

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
maps especially when they come out with

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.740 
maps especially when they come out with
the<00:00:23.369> DLC<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.789> wish<00:00:24.029> they<00:00:24.150> were<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.300> separate

don't<00:00:48.270> like<00:00:48.420> them<00:00:48.660> but<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.350> really<00:00:49.710> like<00:00:49.829> this

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
don't like them but I really like this

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.709

map<00:00:50.219> they<00:00:50.550> made<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.789> tone<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.059> now<00:00:51.360> has<00:00:51.570> an

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
map they made a tone that now has an

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.930 
map they made a tone that now has an
underground<00:00:52.199> part<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.920> map<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.399> also<00:00:53.789> made

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
underground part of the map it also made

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.279 
underground part of the map it also made
it<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.480> starts<00:00:54.780> out<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.899> little<00:00:55.110> bit

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
it so that it starts out a little bit

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.020 
it so that it starts out a little bit
different<00:00:55.649> but<00:00:55.770> then<00:00:55.920> when<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.070> nuke<00:00:56.340> when<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
different but then when a nuke when the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.060 
different but then when a nuke when the
rocket<00:00:57.719> goes<00:00:57.870> off<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.199> explodes<00:00:58.559> as<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.949> can

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
rocket goes off and explodes as you can

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.299 
rocket goes off and explodes as you can
see<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.760> breaks<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:01.320> turns<00:01:01.559> into<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
see it breaks it and it turns into the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.359 
see it breaks it and it turns into the
old<00:01:02.550> map<00:01:02.789> from<00:01:03.000> scrap<00:01:03.300> yard<00:01:03.830> later<00:01:04.830> on<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
old map from scrap yard later on in the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.649 
old map from scrap yard later on in the
game<00:01:05.400> play<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.939> really<00:01:06.240> like<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.600> aspect

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
game play and I really like that aspect

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.960 
game play and I really like that aspect
they<00:01:07.320> added<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.740> new<00:01:07.860> rocket<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.310> which<00:01:08.820> they

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
they added a new rocket to which they

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.609 
they added a new rocket to which they
didn't<00:01:09.180> have<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.540> do<00:01:09.689> but<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.049> just<00:01:10.170> changes<00:01:10.470> up

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
didn't have to do but it just changes up

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.310 
didn't have to do but it just changes up
the<00:01:10.740> map<00:01:11.310> halfway<00:01:11.610> through<00:01:12.030> not<00:01:12.960> even<00:01:13.080> halfway

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
the map halfway through not even halfway

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.499 
the map halfway through not even halfway
through<00:01:13.439> but<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.920> few<00:01:14.340> minutes<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.299> think

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
through but a few minutes in and I think

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.700 
through but a few minutes in and I think
that's<00:01:15.659> kind<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:15.930> cool<00:01:16.049> what<00:01:16.200> changes<00:01:16.500> up<00:01:16.619> how

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
that's kind of cool what changes up how

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.350 
that's kind of cool what changes up how
things<00:01:16.979> are<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.369> get<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.580> rush<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.030> then

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
things are you get the rush in and then

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.450 
things are you get the rush in and then
it's<00:01:18.509> like<00:01:18.600> oh<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.920> only<00:01:20.009> thing<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.250> don't<00:01:20.310> like

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
it's like oh the only thing I don't like

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.830 
it's like oh the only thing I don't like
is<00:01:20.549> sometimes<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.150> might<00:01:21.299> get<00:01:21.540> killed<00:01:21.689> by

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
is sometimes you might get killed by

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.840 
is sometimes you might get killed by

for<00:01:53.399> three<00:01:53.579> ones<00:01:53.790> because<00:01:54.420> i<00:01:54.509> actually<00:01:54.720> really

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
for three ones because i actually really

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.780 
for three ones because i actually really
like<00:01:55.140> go<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:55.710> i<00:01:55.740> like<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.009> concept<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.670> and

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
like go so i like the concept of it and

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.219 
like go so i like the concept of it and
how<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.969> actually<00:01:57.090> works<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.689> does<00:01:57.840> get<00:01:57.990> boring

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
how it actually works it does get boring

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.959 
how it actually works it does get boring
and<00:01:58.619> i<00:01:58.680> think<00:01:58.920> more<00:01:59.219> maps<00:01:59.430> would<00:01:59.640> make<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.939> less

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
and i think more maps would make it less

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.240 
and i think more maps would make it less
boring<00:02:00.360> honestly<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.439> wish<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.740> would<00:02:01.799> be<00:02:01.979> free

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
boring honestly I wish it would be free

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.160 
boring honestly I wish it would be free
because<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.850> mean<00:02:03.000> I'm<00:02:03.149> just<00:02:03.180> gonna<00:02:03.390> be<00:02:03.719> dumping
