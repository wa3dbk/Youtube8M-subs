it<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.219> that<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.579> doctor<00:01:20.909> studies<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.689> it

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
it is that the doctor studies so it

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.870 
it is that the doctor studies so it
starts<00:01:22.110> out<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> research<00:01:22.680> lab<00:01:22.979> we<00:01:23.789> have

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
starts out in the research lab we have

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.969 
starts out in the research lab we have
to<00:01:24.000> provide<00:01:24.270> them<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.750> tools<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:25.350> get<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
cheap sequence done what they really

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.380 
cheap sequence done what they really
would<00:01:28.380> like<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.590> have<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.820> sequence<00:01:30.240> from

would like to have is the sequence from

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.539 
would like to have is the sequence from
everybody<00:01:30.899> so<00:01:31.259> we<00:01:31.409> can<00:01:31.590> compare<00:01:32.039> their

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
everybody so we can compare their

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.160 
predisposition to it which killed him at
the<00:02:13.319> age<00:02:13.440> of<00:02:13.590> 50

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
the age of 50

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.720 
the age of 50
and<00:02:15.240> do<00:02:16.240> I<00:02:16.300> have<00:02:16.690> that<00:02:16.930> in<00:02:17.170> myself<00:02:17.410> well<00:02:18.069> we

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
and do I have that in myself well we

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.510 
and do I have that in myself well we
could<00:02:18.880> sequence<00:02:19.150> him<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.569> figure<00:02:19.720> out<00:02:20.520> what

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
could sequence him and figure out what

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.120 
could sequence him and figure out what
it<00:02:21.640> was<00:02:21.850> that<00:02:22.270> that<00:02:22.660> that<00:02:23.440> caused<00:02:23.680> him<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:23.920> get

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
it was that that that caused him to get

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.830 
it was that that that caused him to get
prostate<00:02:24.490> cancer<00:02:25.000> so<00:02:25.209> it's<00:02:25.300> you<00:02:25.390> know<00:02:25.510> such<00:02:25.810> a
