00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:10.380
 guys back on the channel like any other 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.019
 then absurd questions then 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.420
 Let's start immediately what it is 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.310
 you understand the existence of the ants le 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.560
 ants will do on these cute have 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.050
 very trivially I don't understand 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.170
 the existence of the mosquitoes they serve 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.920
 exactly because mosquitoes exist 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.349
 dirty crap chickens put you and 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.890
 north when a mosquito bites me 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.829
 a duck is practically north of Rome 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.989
 so why what is it for and after 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.149
 tournament tremaghi at the doors would put the 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.070
 your name the chalices of fire and if you came 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.050
 chosen the right to bring 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.050
 with you a character of the saga which 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.910
 you would choose but yes I'll throw it down 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.420
 also each one is the cup of 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.670
 fire 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.640
 maybe hoping not to come along 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.160
 like courage moves that end 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.440
 after throwing my name in 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.799
 kick if you were probably squeezed 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.170
 bring with me the price is expensive hermione 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.420
 granger that would help me with all the 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.680
 spells of the world and I would try to 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:17.450
 put courage and physical abilities not 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.799
 I know but a pandemonium 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.229
 rightly if you could be part of one 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.409
 TV series which you would choose guess 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.780
 from discounted you like detective who 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.310
 balls we always end up talking about joe 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.780
 detectives though guys like it 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.820
 very much because if now it is me 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.500
 Coming to mind the frivolity of gossip 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.310
 girl a look that wouldn't be at all 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.750
 bad 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.360
 good morning design your life e 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.130
 they became musicals of the female cyclist 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.560
 work and suddenly the 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.110
 music for high school musicals e 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.130
 everyone starts dancing and singing 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.979
 how would you react 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.470
 bad valeria I would say very badly I have of 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.079
 musicals called the various videos and ti 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.490
 I swear that I would be nervous not 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.799
 for a lot of the kind I'd run 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.110
 units of andrea brushes slap 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.210
 all of them with practically brushstrokes 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.310
 not enough is not absurd but I would like so much 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.840
 know how the questions section was born 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.300
 absurd this france is a beautiful one 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.140
 good question was born because a weekend 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.420
 months ago months and months ago I didn't know 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.190
 well what to do and I was thinking of a 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.840
 video I was also thinking that 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.489
 answer your questions me 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.500
 always a lot of fun I thought 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.870
 why not put a twist then 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.560
 instead of answering the usual questions 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.350
 let's go and explore the fantasies 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.560
 of my users so let's throw it in 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.610
 cow we ask questions at random to whom 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.340
 can not think at all 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.110
 nothing for three minutes of clock 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.690
 I tried it once looks like bullshit 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.060
 but it's not so simple I don't think so 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.519
 that if it's bullshit probably not 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:54.160
 I could do that myself I should be in 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:56.260
 a very precise and therefore mindset mood 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.630
 Streams put us on the couch 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.670
 etc. I should concentrate on everything 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.859
 myself and enter a state of 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.420
 total relaxation 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:09.430
 maybe I could but like that now 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.370
 no it is impossible as you would explain 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.600
 colors to a blind I love you cute 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.340
 me too 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.030
 wow this is a question really 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:22.299
 tough then I would go of feelings 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:27.370
 like to make him understand the blue I would tell him 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:29.700
 it is as calm as you can 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.829
 imagine I do n't know how to think about serenity 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.989
 etc. etc. here is what the blues is 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.610
 and think of a really great emotion 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:40.790
 strong intense 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.740
 live since that is red 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.420
 I would throw on the sensations but look 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.490
 that really is a good question and it is not 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.860
 an easy cabbage then how would you explain 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.650
 colors to a blind man I am curious what it is 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:55.190
 your favorite regular stamp 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.470
 hexagon forever lol also a question 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.350
 very strange but I tell you the triangle 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.350
 equilatero a banal but perhaps we hold 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.410
 the more the pentagon is also true 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.180
 direct simple equilateral triangle s 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.980
 I had to live forever and I had to 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.200
 choose between staying young 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.690
 physically and spiritually grow old 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.489
 or aging physically but 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.340
 keeping your way of being by forever 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.019
 now what would you choose? 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.940
 consequences to the strange situations that 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.250
 it could cause the young man to emanate 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.640
 physically and spiritually grow old 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.980
 because I thought my grandmother headed it 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.890
 extracts for mega for example young 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.650
 central always tells me to split the 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:39.470
 world if I still had a physicist who 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.229
 so it holds and I thought and one to the physical 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.060
 can do what he wants so ok from 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:46.250
 key spiritually meanwhile acquires 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.370
 a lot of extra knowledge you can do 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.500
 a lot of things having a physique that 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.630
 I don't know if I'm managing to make you 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.550
 understand this Sunday guys too 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.470
 we finished I recommend leave me 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.400

 comments 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.330
