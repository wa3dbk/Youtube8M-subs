really nice woven fabric now this fabric

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.860 
really nice woven fabric now this fabric
once<00:00:57.750> it's<00:00:58.140> created<00:00:58.740> is<00:00:59.010> very<00:00:59.580> dense<00:01:00.450> and<00:01:00.810> very

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
once it's created is very dense and very

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.140 
once it's created is very dense and very
thick<00:01:01.770> now<00:01:01.980> part<00:01:02.400> of<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.640> because<00:01:02.940> I'm

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
thick now part of that is because I'm

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.520 
thick now part of that is because I'm
using<00:01:03.330> a<00:01:03.510> bulky<00:01:03.840> yarn<00:01:04.019> for<00:01:04.379> this

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
using a bulky yarn for this

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.730 
using a bulky yarn for this
demonstration<00:01:04.890> but<00:01:05.820> when<00:01:06.570> you're<00:01:06.719> doing<00:01:07.530> this

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
demonstration but when you're doing this

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.810 
demonstration but when you're doing this
many<00:01:08.130> cables<00:01:08.759> so<00:01:09.659> close<00:01:09.899> together<00:01:10.579> it<00:01:11.579> really

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
many cables so close together it really

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.779 
many cables so close together it really
pulls<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.810> on<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.229> fabric<00:01:13.679> and<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.100> it's<00:01:14.490> going

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:14.789 
pulls in on the fabric and so it's going

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:16.940 
pulls in on the fabric and so it's going
to<00:01:14.909> be<00:01:15.030> very<00:01:15.329> dense<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:16.079> it's<00:01:16.590> not<00:01:16.740> going<00:01:16.890> to

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
to be very dense so it's not going to

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.819 
to be very dense so it's not going to
have<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.130> very<00:01:17.429> nice<00:01:17.640> drape<00:01:18.229> but<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.499> will<00:01:19.710> be

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:19.829 
have a very nice drape but it will be

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.730 
have a very nice drape but it will be
great<00:01:20.219> for<00:01:20.490> things<00:01:20.670> like<00:01:20.850> pillows<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.740> it

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
great for things like pillows and it

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.069 
great for things like pillows and it
might<00:01:23.340> even<00:01:23.369> be<00:01:23.850> good<00:01:24.060> for<00:01:24.299> like<00:01:24.329> a<00:01:24.749> warm

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079
