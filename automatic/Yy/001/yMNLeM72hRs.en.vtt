00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 You see these curves, well, surely 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.519
 you remember this lg reflex 2 the 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.920
 second curved screen device 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.429
 generation that launched the axis in 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.559
 vegas' 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:18.049
 Well now they have gone a little bit further 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.049
 but they have gone further with the mid- range 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:27.769
 with these two devices that I have 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.720
 here medium spirit range the tiniest 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.579
 within the curved screen that is 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.120
 now the new design that are implemented 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.500
 on these devices 5 inches in this 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.050
 another that is a little bit bigger and that 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.640
 has another name that is called magna and 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.809
 is it seems that the people of the axis this 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.300
 of the curve must have worked 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.800
 pretty good and to us the truth is 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.239
 that the experience also because to the 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.789
 time to talk on the phone yes it is 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.680
 true that the screen fits 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.079
 enough more to the face and the projection 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.390
 of audio is better when the screen is 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.550
 curved the truth is that it shows 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.530
 quite more in the flex 2 because it has 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.820
 a bigger screen and it's 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.170
 to pick up more mask and more voice but the 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.810
 truth is that this also gives quite 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.040
 the touch especially in the big one 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.030
 good differences well we are talking 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.090
 How did I say 4.7 screen 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.509
 inches in the spirit 5 inches in the 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.009
 magna both of resolution hd so the 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.960
 density of pixels per inch 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.880
 It will be different depending on which 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.070
 we want another one of the features is 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.470
 that will be available in 3g and 4g version 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.240
 depending on those versions will depend 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.759
 also the processor that integrates the 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.950
 dual-core processor from mediatek to 1.2 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.429
 gigahertz or qualcomm processor of 4 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.500
 nuclei to 1.3 gigahertz in the case of 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:46.140
 that we want to have the 4g camera 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.280
 It will also depend on whether it is 3g or 4g 8 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.229
 megapixels in the case where 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.000
 we get for version 4g and 5 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.729
 megapixel rear camera in the case 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.039
 in which we get by the 3g version 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.020
 But how can we open them? 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.110
 open the gaps and we have here a 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.650
 eyelash 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.990
 to show you the back 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.050
 as you see in the back what 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.120
 we have is the little hole by which 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.040
 then we can see the little buttons 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.010
 buttons that are in the back 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.510
 that already are a classic of the axis and that 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.360
 make the front design a 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.370
 pretty cleaner design and also that 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.190
 the screen can be adjusted very much to 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.680
 the edges this device the magna 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.480
 has a battery of 2,540 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.700
 milliamps around here we can see 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.420
 different slots here we have a 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.220
 slot for a micro sim card 2 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.270
 this indicates without a doubt that 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.120
 there has to be a slot for a 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.400
 micro sim 1 that is in the part of the 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.010
 right and that is right next to the 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.930
 slot for microsd cards this 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.610
 microsd card slot makes that 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.020
 we can increase the storage that 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.480
 both in the case of the magna and in the 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.130
 of the spirit is 8 gigs by the way 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.110
 we have told you both also count 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.850
 with one gigabyte of ram memory on the other hand 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.830
 already removed the cap to the Spiritist of 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.050
 axis spirit and what we see are two 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.750
 Slots 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.490
 at the moment it will not come with dual sim with what 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.350
 which will have to use a single sim 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.970
 but we do have the slot for the 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.970
 microsd cards that as I said 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.160
 will expand the storage of 8gb in 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.280
 this case the battery as you can see is 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.530
 Removable 2100 milliamps review 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.470
 super fast to the sides of the 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.030
 spirit of the magna top part 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.650
 minijack microphone connector 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.750
 noise cancellation this side does not 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.750
 has nothing the bottom part have the 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.730
 microusb ports the other microphone and by 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.320
 here we only have the little eye for 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.390
 to lift the lid because because 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.230
 as I told you the rest of the buttons 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:43.960
 they're in the back so this one 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.900
 has been the preview of these new the 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.300
 axis spirit and two axis magna 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.130
 design phones for a mid-range 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.690
 something that is really interesting 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.690
 see you in the next program
