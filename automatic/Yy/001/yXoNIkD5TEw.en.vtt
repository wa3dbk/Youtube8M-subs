00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.700 
would agree he is a money whore in a way
in<00:05:02.099> that<00:05:02.310> sense<00:05:02.669> and<00:05:03.090> I<00:05:03.690> even<00:05:03.990> think<00:05:04.229> sometimes

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
in that sense and I even think sometimes

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.830 
in that sense and I even think sometimes
that<00:05:05.069> when<00:05:05.520> he<00:05:05.729> sees<00:05:06.000> trailers<00:05:06.539> for<00:05:06.630> call<00:05:06.810> of

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599 
duty and the DLC and shit he sits there

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:11.540 
duty and the DLC and shit he sits there
with<00:05:09.840> dollar<00:05:10.110> signs<00:05:10.199> on<00:05:10.680> his<00:05:10.770> eyeballs<00:05:11.159> I<00:05:11.400> can

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
with dollar signs on his eyeballs I can

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.399 
with dollar signs on his eyeballs I can
just<00:05:11.639> imagine<00:05:11.759> it<00:05:12.180> just<00:05:12.630> thinking<00:05:13.050> about<00:05:13.139> all

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:13.409 
just imagine it just thinking about all

just imagine it just thinking about all
that<00:05:13.560> money<00:05:13.800> rolling<00:05:14.280> in<00:05:14.370> but<00:05:14.909> at<00:05:15.000> the<00:05:15.090> end<00:05:15.120> of

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
that money rolling in but at the end of

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.600 
that money rolling in but at the end of
the<00:05:15.539> day<00:05:15.750> he<00:05:16.050> has<00:05:16.229> worked<00:05:16.710> for<00:05:17.039> what<00:05:17.220> he<00:05:17.370> has

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
the day he has worked for what he has

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.939 
the day he has worked for what he has
and<00:05:18.090> yet<00:05:18.419> maybe<00:05:18.630> took<00:05:18.930> advantages<00:05:19.590> of<00:05:19.620> the

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949
