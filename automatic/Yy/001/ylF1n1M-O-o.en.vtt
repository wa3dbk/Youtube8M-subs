so<00:02:07.930> I'm<00:02:08.050> just<00:02:08.200> going<00:02:08.350> to<00:02:08.380> go<00:02:08.560> all<00:02:08.800> the<00:02:09.399> way

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.430 
so I'm just going to go all the way

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.430 
so I'm just going to go all the way
around<00:02:09.789> and<00:02:10.300> do<00:02:10.450> that<00:02:10.630> so<00:02:10.899> it's<00:02:11.050> probably

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
around and do that so it's probably

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.440 
around and do that so it's probably
going<00:02:11.680> to<00:02:11.740> end<00:02:11.860> up<00:02:12.430> being<00:02:12.700> about<00:02:12.820> this<00:02:13.210> height

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
going to end up being about this height

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.890 
going to end up being about this height
right<00:02:13.720> here<00:02:14.370> all<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.940> way<00:02:16.090> around

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
right here all the way around

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.140 
right here all the way around
and<00:02:17.079> it<00:02:17.170> gets<00:02:17.319> rid<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:17.590> these<00:02:17.860> stems<00:02:18.549> because

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
and it gets rid of these stems because

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.390 
and it gets rid of these stems because
foliage<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.140> new<00:02:20.349> growth<00:02:20.620> is<00:02:20.890> not<00:02:21.099> going<00:02:21.340> to

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
foliage and new growth is not going to

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.940 
foliage and new growth is not going to
appear<00:02:21.700> on<00:02:21.879> these<00:02:22.290> unless<00:02:23.290> you<00:02:23.470> cut<00:02:23.680> it<00:02:23.769> down

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
appear on these unless you cut it down

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.429 
appear on these unless you cut it down
or<00:02:24.519> cut<00:02:24.790> it<00:02:24.879> back<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:25.360> you<00:02:25.420> could<00:02:25.540> cut<00:02:25.720> it<00:02:25.750> back

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:26.439 
or cut it back and you could cut it back

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:28.380 
or cut it back and you could cut it back
to<00:02:26.500> like<00:02:26.860> here<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.670> you<00:02:27.760> might<00:02:27.909> get<00:02:28.090> some<00:02:28.239> new

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
to like here and you might get some new

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.500 
to like here and you might get some new
growth<00:02:28.599> on<00:02:28.840> here<00:02:29.680> but<00:02:29.920> I<00:02:30.129> just<00:02:30.640> prefer<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.000> take

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
growth on here but I just prefer to take

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.050 
growth on here but I just prefer to take
it<00:02:31.659> out<00:02:31.810> or<00:02:32.049> cut<00:02:32.290> it<00:02:32.379> back<00:02:32.849> these<00:02:33.849> are<00:02:33.879> the

fibrous begonias right here the betting
begonias<00:02:38.049> that<00:02:38.170> you<00:02:38.260> might<00:02:38.439> be<00:02:38.920> familiar<00:02:39.099> with

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
begonias that you might be familiar with

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.500 
begonias that you might be familiar with
they<00:02:39.670> come<00:02:39.879> in<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.120> green<00:02:40.750> leaf<00:02:41.079> too<00:02:41.409> and<00:02:41.769> this

and go and cut this right in here

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.119 
and go and cut this right in here
because<00:02:55.420> there's<00:02:55.629> a<00:02:55.690> leaf<00:02:56.049> coming<00:02:56.590> right<00:02:56.920> on

because there's a leaf coming right on
there<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:57.579> I'm<00:02:57.700> just<00:02:57.760> going<00:02:58.030> to<00:02:58.120> cut<00:02:58.299> that

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
there and I'm just going to cut that

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.979

down<00:02:58.690> and<00:02:58.989> that<00:02:59.470> that<00:02:59.650> makes<00:02:59.920> this<00:03:00.659> this<00:03:01.659> plant

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
down and that that makes this this plant

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.729 
down and that that makes this this plant
just<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:03.340> little<00:03:03.670> bit<00:03:03.879> more<00:03:04.349> uniform<00:03:05.349> to<00:03:05.470> start

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
just a little bit more uniform to start

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.220 
just a little bit more uniform to start
it<00:03:05.889> to<00:03:06.340> him<00:03:06.549> to<00:03:06.670> start<00:03:06.909> out<00:03:07.030> its<00:03:07.299> life<00:03:07.900> in<00:03:08.170> the

it to him to start out its life in the

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.890 
it to him to start out its life in the
garden<00:03:08.829> or<00:03:09.340> in<00:03:09.579> a<00:03:10.000> pot<00:03:10.209> and<00:03:10.450> as<00:03:10.510> you<00:03:10.629> can<00:03:10.780> see

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
garden or in a pot and as you can see

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.720 
garden or in a pot and as you can see
you<00:03:11.019> have<00:03:11.170> a<00:03:11.200> whole<00:03:11.439> bunch<00:03:11.650> of<00:03:11.799> new<00:03:12.430> foliage

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
you have a whole bunch of new foliage

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.360 
you have a whole bunch of new foliage
coming<00:03:13.480> down<00:03:13.659> there<00:03:13.989> so<00:03:14.379> that's<00:03:15.159> going<00:03:15.310> to

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
coming down there so that's going to

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.399 
coming down there so that's going to
encourage<00:03:15.700> that<00:03:15.760> to<00:03:16.060> come<00:03:16.209> up<00:03:16.239> too<00:03:16.569> by

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409 
encourage that to come up too by

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:19.559 
encourage that to come up too by
pinching<00:03:17.980> it<00:03:18.129> out<00:03:18.250> and<00:03:18.549> then<00:03:19.180> on<00:03:19.389> these

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
pinching it out and then on these

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.360 
pinching it out and then on these
tuberous<00:03:20.290> begonias<00:03:22.169> what<00:03:23.169> I<00:03:23.440> actually<00:03:23.859> do<00:03:24.340> is

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
tuberous begonias what I actually do is

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.670 
tuberous begonias what I actually do is
I<00:03:24.669> cut<00:03:25.000> out<00:03:25.239> some<00:03:25.599> of<00:03:25.629> the<00:03:25.780> foliage<00:03:26.139> I<00:03:26.410> pinch

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
I cut out some of the foliage I pinch

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.890 
I cut out some of the foliage I pinch
out<00:03:26.859> some<00:03:27.069> of<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.250> foliage<00:03:27.569> anyway<00:03:28.569> because

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
out some of the foliage anyway because

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.509 
out some of the foliage anyway because
you<00:03:29.139> can<00:03:29.290> better<00:03:29.440> see<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.680> flowers<00:03:30.160> that<00:03:30.190> way

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
you can better see the flowers that way

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.780 
you can better see the flowers that way
and<00:03:30.790> there's<00:03:31.599> so<00:03:31.840> much<00:03:32.019> foliage<00:03:32.799> on<00:03:33.099> these

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
and there's so much foliage on these

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.759 
and there's so much foliage on these
that<00:03:34.060> sometimes<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:34.989> flowers<00:03:35.409> see<00:03:35.620> this

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
that sometimes the flowers see this

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.520 
that sometimes the flowers see this
flower<00:03:36.459> down<00:03:36.819> in<00:03:36.970> here<00:03:37.299> so<00:03:37.989> I'm<00:03:38.139> going<00:03:38.290> to<00:03:38.319> take

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
flower down in here so I'm going to take

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.640 
flower down in here so I'm going to take
up<00:03:38.769> this<00:03:39.340> leaf<00:03:40.060> here<00:03:40.419> and<00:03:40.659> it's<00:03:41.349> going<00:03:41.470> to<00:03:41.530> help

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
up this leaf here and it's going to help

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.319 
up this leaf here and it's going to help
the<00:03:41.829> flower<00:03:42.069> to<00:03:42.340> show<00:03:42.519> better<00:03:42.730> I'm<00:03:43.120> going<00:03:43.239> to

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
the flower to show better I'm going to

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.430 
the flower to show better I'm going to
take<00:03:43.510> out<00:03:43.690> this<00:03:43.870> one<00:03:44.109> so<00:03:44.980> you<00:03:45.040> can<00:03:45.220> just<00:03:46.440> pinch

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
take out this one so you can just pinch

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.979 
take out this one so you can just pinch
out<00:03:47.650> these<00:03:47.859> so<00:03:48.729> on<00:03:48.909> these<00:03:49.120> I<00:03:49.329> don't<00:03:49.389> really

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
out these so on these I don't really

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.729 
out these so on these I don't really
pinch<00:03:50.379> it<00:03:50.560> to<00:03:50.819> keep<00:03:51.819> it<00:03:52.000> lower<00:03:52.359> I<00:03:52.810> pinch<00:03:53.349> it<00:03:53.500> so

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
pinch it to keep it lower I pinch it so

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.759 
pinch it to keep it lower I pinch it so
the<00:03:53.859> flowers<00:03:54.430> show<00:03:55.329> a<00:03:55.659> little<00:03:56.229> bit<00:03:56.440> more<00:03:56.650> on

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
the flowers show a little bit more on

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.550 
the flowers show a little bit more on
these<00:03:56.889> tuberous<00:03:57.400> ones<00:03:58.229> so<00:03:59.229> some<00:03:59.409> of<00:03:59.440> the

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
these tuberous ones so some of the

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.379 
these tuberous ones so some of the
troopers<00:03:59.829> begonias<00:04:00.280> just<00:04:00.519> get<00:04:00.669> used<00:04:01.000> so<00:04:01.269> you

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:01.389 
troopers begonias just get used so you

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:03.360 
troopers begonias just get used so you
really<00:04:01.599> don't<00:04:01.780> have<00:04:01.930> to<00:04:02.019> worry<00:04:02.319> about<00:04:02.560> it<00:04:03.250> and

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
really don't have to worry about it and

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.949 
really don't have to worry about it and
some<00:04:03.519> of<00:04:03.609> them<00:04:03.729> hang<00:04:03.940> down<00:04:04.209> some<00:04:04.540> of<00:04:04.569> them<00:04:04.840> are

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
some of them hang down some of them are

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.899 
some of them hang down some of them are
upright<00:04:05.349> but<00:04:05.560> just<00:04:05.769> a<00:04:05.859> little<00:04:05.979> pinching<00:04:06.760> out

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:06.909 
upright but just a little pinching out

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.140 
upright but just a little pinching out
of<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.180> leaves<00:04:07.419> will<00:04:07.720> help<00:04:08.470> your<00:04:08.879> flowers<00:04:09.879> to

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
of the leaves will help your flowers to

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.780 
of the leaves will help your flowers to
show<00:04:10.810> more<00:04:11.169> you<00:04:11.409> can<00:04:11.949> get<00:04:12.250> right<00:04:12.400> in<00:04:12.579> there<00:04:12.729> and

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
show more you can get right in there and

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.409 
show more you can get right in there and
do<00:04:13.030> it<00:04:13.060> and<00:04:14.549> I<00:04:15.549> have<00:04:15.819> used<00:04:16.090> these<00:04:16.680> floral<00:04:17.680> nips

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
do it and I have used these floral nips

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.170 
do it and I have used these floral nips
but<00:04:19.419> if<00:04:19.570> you<00:04:19.720> have<00:04:20.400> bigger<00:04:21.400> pruners<00:04:21.880> you<00:04:22.030> can

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
but if you have bigger pruners you can

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.120 
but if you have bigger pruners you can
do<00:04:22.300> that<00:04:22.479> too<00:04:22.720> these<00:04:23.050> just<00:04:23.320> maneuver<00:04:23.770> a<00:04:23.800> little

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
do that too these just maneuver a little

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.190 
do that too these just maneuver a little
bit<00:04:24.250> better<00:04:24.400> as<00:04:25.240> I<00:04:25.389> said<00:04:25.599> you<00:04:25.690> can<00:04:25.810> use<00:04:25.840> your

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
bit better as I said you can use your

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.110 
bit better as I said you can use your
thumb<00:04:26.409> if<00:04:27.099> you<00:04:27.219> want<00:04:27.460> to<00:04:27.580> do<00:04:27.700> that<00:04:27.909> because

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
thumb if you want to do that because

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.570 
thumb if you want to do that because
these<00:04:28.450> stems<00:04:28.810> are<00:04:29.080> full<00:04:29.770> of<00:04:29.889> water<00:04:30.099> and<00:04:30.219> they

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
these stems are full of water and they

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.330 
these stems are full of water and they
really<00:04:30.879> easy<00:04:31.030> full<00:04:31.599> of<00:04:31.689> fluids<00:04:32.020> or<00:04:32.199> you<00:04:33.159> can

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
really easy full of fluids or you can

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.159 
really easy full of fluids or you can
use<00:04:33.520> a<00:04:33.550> pair<00:04:33.879> of<00:04:33.909> nice<00:04:34.389> sharp<00:04:34.750> kitchen

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
use a pair of nice sharp kitchen

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.350 
use a pair of nice sharp kitchen
scissors<00:04:35.409> -<00:04:35.800> and<00:04:36.039> that'll<00:04:36.759> do<00:04:36.970> the<00:04:37.120> trick<00:04:37.150> for

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
scissors - and that'll do the trick for

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.170 
scissors - and that'll do the trick for
you<00:04:37.599> so<00:04:38.590> if<00:04:38.710> you<00:04:38.830> keep<00:04:39.039> up<00:04:39.219> on<00:04:39.400> the<00:04:39.550> pinching<00:04:40.030> of

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
you so if you keep up on the pinching of

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.059 
you so if you keep up on the pinching of
your<00:04:40.419> begonias<00:04:40.960> it's<00:04:41.500> going<00:04:41.710> to<00:04:41.770> help<00:04:41.949> keep

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:42.069 
your begonias it's going to help keep

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:45.540 
your begonias it's going to help keep
them<00:04:42.719> in<00:04:43.719> a<00:04:43.870> more<00:04:44.080> compact<00:04:44.590> shape<00:04:45.280> because

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
them in a more compact shape because

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.830 
them in a more compact shape because
because<00:04:45.789> some<00:04:45.969> of<00:04:46.090> it<00:04:46.180> as<00:04:46.300> you<00:04:46.419> can<00:04:46.539> see<00:04:46.599> it's

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
because some of it as you can see it's

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.749 
because some of it as you can see it's
just<00:04:46.900> going<00:04:47.169> to<00:04:47.229> grow<00:04:47.740> out<00:04:48.009> and<00:04:48.310> be<00:04:48.430> really

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:48.759 
just going to grow out and be really

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:50.129 
just going to grow out and be really
tall<00:04:49.000> and<00:04:49.240> leggy<00:04:49.509> and<00:04:49.780> then<00:04:49.870> you're<00:04:49.990> going<00:04:50.080> to

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
tall and leggy and then you're going to

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.469 
tall and leggy and then you're going to
have<00:04:50.590> a<00:04:50.620> lot<00:04:50.860> of<00:04:50.889> growth<00:04:51.219> down<00:04:51.430> here<00:04:51.849> so<00:04:52.330> it

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
have a lot of growth down here so it

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.629 
have a lot of growth down here so it
just<00:04:52.780> makes<00:04:52.930> the<00:04:53.110> plant<00:04:53.379> look<00:04:53.680> better<00:04:53.919> if<00:04:54.159> you

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
just makes the plant look better if you

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.420 
just makes the plant look better if you
keep<00:04:54.849> it<00:04:55.030> pinched<00:04:55.389> this<00:04:56.259> is<00:04:56.409> no<00:04:56.590> Foster<00:04:57.159> and<00:04:57.370> I

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
keep it pinched this is no Foster and I

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.369 
keep it pinched this is no Foster and I
have<00:04:57.580> just<00:04:57.789> shown<00:04:58.419> you<00:04:58.449> how<00:04:58.629> to<00:04:58.810> pinch<00:04:59.139> a

00:04:59.369 --> 00:04:59.379 
have just shown you how to pinch a

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:01.710 
have just shown you how to pinch a
begonia
