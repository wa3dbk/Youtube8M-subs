00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.109
 sandpaper and dust one 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.289

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.609
 and any alabastine wall filler 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.680
 remove with the pair of wall knife

 plastered ceiling 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.989
 dust the ceiling had a lot 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.010
 any damage to 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.010
 alabastine wall filler 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.970
 sand the updated places and dust 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.150

 tape the edges carefully around the 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.860
 to reduce suction on the substrate 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.440
 first apply a layer of alabastine 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.000
 primer suction 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.520
 remove the tape immediately after it 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.080
 paint when the surface is dry 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.080
 tap the edges again 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.140
 apply the wall paint with an acrylic paint 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.850
 brush for edges and with a roller for 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.430
 large areas 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.920
 first roll in the lengthwise direction 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.289
 the width to distribute the paint and 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.620
 end in the longitudinal direction 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.200
 do this per two or three jobs simultaneously 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.760
 how to paint the wall well for an even

 remove the tape immediately after it 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:26.700
 painting or damage to the paint 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:29.100
 to be avoided when the first layer is dry 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.080
 tap the edges again 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.840
 apply a second layer of wall paints 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.400
 in the same way as the first 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.350
 remove the tape immediately after it 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.950
