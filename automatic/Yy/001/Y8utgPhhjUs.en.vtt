 that is to say 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:15.419
 and I will not leave 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:19.159

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:22.159
 in the north of Africa 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:24.929
 we divide 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:29.149
 surely we are enough that we would have liked to be 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:30.649
 detective 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:33.799
 be it in novels, television series or movies 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.080
 this profession the last one in particular since it catches a vast majority 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.710
 curiously, this genre has not been very lazy to find 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.250
 the mayor was not only to promote the black movies video games if not 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.250

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.300
 rockstar knows how to devote the necessary and precise time to all its 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.190
 productions focusing only on the development that port that 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.350
 until this one rapid intervention rate 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.810
 with each of its games the history of rockstar grows exponentially 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.280
 being all of them 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.240
 great best sellers 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.570
 ly and noar 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.930
 is slightly different from the usual titles that this 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:16.920
 company 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.950
 offering research dialogues and action 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.960
 in an approximate proportion 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.180
 of 35 35 and 30% respectively 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.390
 in this production we will assume the role of running police freshly 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.690
 arrived in the city of angels after returning 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.730
 of the Second World War 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.550
 We will accompany him in his career from police to exercise as 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.400
 detective down the road if we have to solve a score of cases many of 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.180
 them based on real rotten crimes 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.300
 and divided or classified into four types 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.410
 of traffic fires as it already influenced yourself 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.480
 although it is true that its development is not as open as in previous 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.990
 rockstar productions 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.360
 he will not be able to be considered as samba step offering missions 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.540
 main and secondary 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.670
 although the quantity and several of the latter may seem somewhat scarce 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.649
 if we compare them with those offered in 7 to 4 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:14.229
 for example 

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:17.789
 in any case presented masterfully by the way 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:22.559
 If with a common pattern we are presented with the case, we go to the place of the 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:26.749
 facts we look for clues we interrogate and finally we solve 

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:28.840
 each of these steps 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.079
 has its own gameplay ita inning 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.169
 It is usual that this structure will be expanded with varied punctually 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:37.629
 persecutions and threw texts 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.980
 the weight of the game relay know how to collect as many tracks to be able to 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.079
 interrogate the suspects and witnesses with the best chance of success of 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.629
 resolution 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.940
 focusing on the search for evidence the game took a pace 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:51.839
 slow 

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:56.669
 allows us to examine each nook of the stage by picking diop 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:58.729
 Serving them from every angle 

00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:01.349
 not all objects with tracks 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.659
 and these are not always found at first sight 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:07.689
 in counting them all will require us page 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:12.099
 For those of you who are not familiar with this type of CÃ¡ceres, the musical section will be a 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:16.989
 Perfect guide to locate time trends the tracks offering mild others 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.309
 musical when we are near an elm track I totally defend the escort 

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:22.999
 when we have found them 

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:24.159
 all 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:28.599
 It is advisable not to find as many clues as possible 

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:33.019
 the game allows us to continue anyway although our case may 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.349
 advance through other courses surely with little or no success 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.439
 we can go back to the crime scene whenever we want and as many times as 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:47.169
 we need in the same case the interrogations are the fundamental part 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:51.909
 where he and we do not do to his full potential and is that as a member of the 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:55.959
 law we not only have to learn to ask the concrete questions if we 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.309
 that we have to be attentive to the reactions we provoke 

00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:03.089
 Because the visual language will be equal, it is important that the answers 

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:04.529
 can you give us 

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:08.369
 facial expression especially with the movement of the head shoulders and hands 

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:09.349
 for example 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.469
 It can betray much more 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:12.879
 know how to press or not 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.910
 Derive the conversation until bonus and other questions or leave to interrogation 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.689
 to resume broken moment 

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:21.999
 will be decisions that we have to make on the fly 

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:25.080
 is the importance of this reaction is that it has been developed expressly 

00:04:25.079 --> 00:04:29.759
 a system of 32 cameras of capture of movement of the real actors for 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:34.169
 faithfully reproduce until the most useful facial movement this system and has 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.320
 called the attention of renowned filmmakers 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.020
 especially the animation specialists 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.379
 and visual effects 

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:44.459
 is there cation for the detail was reflected in the rest of the game 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:48.660
 from a faithful representation of the angels in the 40s 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.300
 to the clothes of the inhabitants of the same the vehicles the music the 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.970
 weapons 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.240
 the way of speaking 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.719
 and all the violence and tension that was breathed day after day in its streets 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.620
 the visual bar is at the height of the last you see 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.979
 although with less people wandering through its streets 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:09.069
 As for the gameplay a few dozen investigations the different buttons 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:12.070
 eyes are actions ofran if we can activate it 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.260
 and according to the actions we will open two new opi dialogue lines 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.650
 characters with whom to interact 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.919
 the moments of action will be mainly shootings in wax 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:22.570
 person 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.830
 intense and well dosed 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.710
 the system pointed that legacy from 7 to 4 and their presents 

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:32.809
 in the persecutions we can lead ourselves with our companions 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:34.990
 if they drive 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.770
 we will not be able to access secondary missions 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.340
 in this aspect we indicate that driving and this ends 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:46.180
 we also say that we are allowed to activate or deactivate functions for 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.870
 prevent us from getting stuck in games for example 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.669
 we can release action sequences in case we do not overcome the let us 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.400
 take by car to the indicated destination 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.569
 for example 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:05:59.860
 although it will be without any help when we will feel like an authentic 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.309
 detective can discover and take advantage of all secondary missions 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.599
 in each of the four types of crimes we have a different partner 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:13.199
 he learns of his virtues and defects because each one will have his own character and 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:14.339
 mythology 

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:16.619
 I want will always marry our 

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:19.719
 causing some friction between us 

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:24.119
 During our investigation we will give experience points with each certain 

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:26.600
 as well as a global assessment of the case 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.529
 this will help us to go up level as a researcher as a detective 

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:35.879
 and days blocking teething points that allow us to have advantages this is us 

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:37.139
 distill 

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:40.900
 we can replay each case if we want to win greater distinctions and 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.249
