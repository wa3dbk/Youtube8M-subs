00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
point and I just filmed it with all the

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.260 
point and I just filmed it with all the
camera<00:01:40.079> shake<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.530> wanted<00:01:41.270> camera

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
camera shake that I wanted camera

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.960 
camera shake that I wanted camera
movement<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.170> just<00:01:44.100> held<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.280> camera<00:01:44.549> like

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
movement so I just held the camera like

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.569 
movement so I just held the camera like
that<00:01:45.470> maybe<00:01:46.470> give<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.890> little<00:01:47.040> extra<00:01:47.220> shape

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
that maybe give it a little extra shape

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.980 
that maybe give it a little extra shape
because<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:47.970> can<00:01:48.149> hold<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.450> kind<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.750> steady

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
because I can hold it kind of steady

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.300 
because I can hold it kind of steady

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.839 
workspace and go to motion tracking if
you're<00:02:30.930> not<00:02:31.019> already<00:02:31.140> there<00:02:31.489> click<00:02:32.489> track

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
okay you're going to go to layer new not

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:01.879 
okay you're going to go to layer new not
solid<00:02:57.090> crap<00:02:58.010> where<00:02:59.010> new<00:03:00.109> null<00:03:01.109> object<00:03:01.650> there

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
solid crap where new null object there

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.129 
solid crap where new null object there
we<00:03:01.980> go<00:03:02.129> sorry<00:03:02.730> about<00:03:02.819> that<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.299> i'm<00:03:03.989> going<00:03:04.079> to

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:04.139 
we go sorry about that and i'm going to

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:12.520 
we go sorry about that and i'm going to
rename<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:05.000> motion<00:03:06.470> capture<00:03:07.849> data<00:03:09.200> ok<00:03:10.200> dad<00:03:10.470> and

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
rename it motion capture data ok dad and

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.409 
rename it motion capture data ok dad and
we're<00:03:13.530> going<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.799> click<00:03:14.220> track<00:03:14.459> motion<00:03:15.769> and

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:17.419 
we're going to click track motion and

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:30.379 
we're going to click track motion and
we're<00:03:18.419> going<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.690> get<00:03:21.650> this<00:03:22.650> file<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:29.389> some

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
we're going to get this file and some

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.569 
we're going to get this file and some
reason<00:03:30.660> to<00:03:30.750> pop<00:03:30.930> up<00:03:30.959> and<00:03:31.230> a<00:03:31.260> clip<00:03:32.190> position

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
reason to pop up and a clip position

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.240 
reason to pop up and a clip position
rotation<00:03:32.849> and<00:03:33.510> if<00:03:33.989> you<00:03:34.169> have<00:03:34.349> any<00:03:34.379> zooming<00:03:35.069> in

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
rotation and if you have any zooming in

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.729 
rotation and if you have any zooming in
or<00:03:35.459> just<00:03:36.449> like<00:03:36.629> moving<00:03:36.900> your<00:03:37.049> camera<00:03:37.410> forward

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
or just like moving your camera forward

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.729 
or just like moving your camera forward
or<00:03:37.829> backwards<00:03:38.250> then<00:03:38.579> you<00:03:38.730> scale<00:03:39.150> and<00:03:39.739> we're

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
or backwards then you scale and we're

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.640 
or backwards then you scale and we're
going<00:03:40.919> to<00:03:40.980> pick<00:03:41.160> our<00:03:41.310> contrast<00:03:41.819> points<00:03:42.650> for

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
going to pick our contrast points for

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.699 
going to pick our contrast points for
this<00:03:43.739> clip<00:03:44.129> they<00:03:44.549> need<00:03:44.730> to<00:03:44.819> be<00:03:44.879> fairly<00:03:45.269> big<00:03:45.709> so

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
this clip they need to be fairly big so

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.670 
this clip they need to be fairly big so
that<00:03:46.889> they<00:03:47.220> have<00:03:47.489> a<00:03:47.519> better<00:03:47.790> track<00:03:48.209> it<00:03:48.870> doesn't

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
that they have a better track it doesn't

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.710 
that they have a better track it doesn't
with<00:03:50.370> this<00:03:50.579> kind<00:03:50.790> of<00:03:50.910> motion<00:03:51.090> tracking<00:03:51.480> it

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
with this kind of motion tracking it

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.569 
with this kind of motion tracking it
doesn't<00:03:52.169> really<00:03:52.440> have<00:03:52.769> to<00:03:52.799> be<00:03:52.980> perfect

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
doesn't really have to be perfect

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.170 
doesn't really have to be perfect
because<00:03:54.709> you're<00:03:55.709> not<00:03:56.159> going<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.459> actually<00:03:56.609> see

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
because you're not going to actually see

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.699 
because you're not going to actually see
motion<00:03:57.810> tracking<00:03:59.540> so<00:04:00.540> I<00:04:00.569> think<00:04:00.900> that<00:04:01.230> that

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
motion tracking so I think that that

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.670 
motion tracking so I think that that
would<00:04:02.099> be<00:04:02.159> good<00:04:02.400> so<00:04:03.379> I'm<00:04:04.379> going<00:04:04.530> to<00:04:04.590> just

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
would be good so I'm going to just

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.259 
would be good so I'm going to just
render<00:04:05.069> the<00:04:05.159> first<00:04:05.370> I'm<00:04:05.579> going<00:04:05.699> to<00:04:05.760> analyze

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
render the first I'm going to analyze

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.349 
render the first I'm going to analyze
the<00:04:06.510> first<00:04:06.690> five<00:04:06.900> seconds<00:04:07.319> this<00:04:07.500> so<00:04:08.269> here<00:04:09.269> we

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
the first five seconds this so here we

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.719 
the first five seconds this so here we
go<00:04:09.859> and<00:04:10.859> it<00:04:11.280> seems<00:04:11.489> to<00:04:11.639> stay<00:04:11.849> on<00:04:12.000> very<00:04:12.449> well

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:13.729 
go and it seems to stay on very well

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:19.150 
go and it seems to stay on very well
it's<00:04:14.729> nice

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:29.590 

sorry<00:04:20.160> about<00:04:20.280> that<00:04:22.100> to<00:04:23.100> do<00:04:25.880> but<00:04:26.880> a<00:04:27.169> boom<00:04:28.169> and

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
sorry about that to do but a boom and

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.550 
sorry about that to do but a boom and
there<00:04:30.600> we<00:04:30.690> go<00:04:30.979> so<00:04:31.979> it<00:04:32.880> stays<00:04:33.600> on<00:04:33.810> pretty<00:04:34.380> well

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
there we go so it stays on pretty well

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.610 
there we go so it stays on pretty well
so<00:04:35.190> we're<00:04:35.280> going<00:04:35.370> to<00:04:35.639> go<00:04:35.669> to<00:04:35.900> edit<00:04:36.900> target<00:04:37.410> and

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
so we're going to go to edit target and

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.529 
so we're going to go to edit target and
make<00:04:37.919> sure<00:04:37.949> it's<00:04:38.310> on<00:04:38.400> motion<00:04:38.910> capture<00:04:39.360> data

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
make sure it's on motion capture data

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.680 
make sure it's on motion capture data
click<00:04:40.320> OK<00:04:40.650> and<00:04:40.889> then<00:04:40.949> click<00:04:41.699> apply<00:04:41.820> make<00:04:42.660> sure

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
click OK and then click apply make sure

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.510 
click OK and then click apply make sure
it's<00:04:42.960> x<00:04:43.169> and<00:04:43.410> y<00:04:43.639> click<00:04:44.639> OK<00:04:44.759> and<00:04:45.380> there<00:04:46.380> we<00:04:46.470> go<00:04:46.620> so

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
it's x and y click OK and there we go so

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:56.300 
it's x and y click OK and there we go so
now<00:04:47.550> as<00:04:48.030> you<00:04:48.270> can<00:04:48.419> see<00:04:52.580> here<00:04:53.580> here<00:04:53.940> it<00:04:54.000> is<00:04:55.310> it's

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
now as you can see here here it is it's

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.610 
now as you can see here here it is it's
moving<00:04:56.669> around<00:04:56.850> nice<00:04:57.260> so<00:04:58.260> what<00:04:58.410> we're<00:04:58.530> going

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
moving around nice so what we're going

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.219 
moving around nice so what we're going
to<00:04:58.830> do<00:04:58.979> is<00:04:59.280> we<00:04:59.910> can<00:05:00.030> delete<00:05:00.389> that<00:05:00.780> video<00:05:01.020> file

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
to do is we can delete that video file

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:06.740 
to do is we can delete that video file
of<00:05:04.229> the<00:05:05.039> motion<00:05:05.220> tracking<00:05:05.699> that<00:05:06.510> we<00:05:06.600> use<00:05:06.720> for

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
of the motion tracking that we use for

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.180 
of the motion tracking that we use for
motion<00:05:07.050> tracking<00:05:07.260> and<00:05:08.479> you<00:05:09.479> can<00:05:09.660> even<00:05:09.780> just

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
motion tracking and you can even just

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.100 
motion tracking and you can even just
make<00:05:11.190> that<00:05:11.340> invisible<00:05:11.880> so<00:05:12.539> now<00:05:12.690> you're<00:05:12.840> going

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
make that invisible so now you're going

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.830 
make that invisible so now you're going
to<00:05:13.229> take<00:05:13.500> the<00:05:13.740> video<00:05:14.010> file<00:05:14.460> go<00:05:15.120> to<00:05:15.150> this<00:05:15.360> parent

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
to take the video file go to this parent

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.010 
to take the video file go to this parent
tool<00:05:16.020> and<00:05:17.009> pick<00:05:17.280> whip<00:05:17.460> it<00:05:17.610> to<00:05:18.090> the<00:05:18.570> motion<00:05:18.750> to

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
tool and pick whip it to the motion to

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.770 
tool and pick whip it to the motion to
the<00:05:19.710> null<00:05:19.949> object<00:05:20.430> so<00:05:21.090> now<00:05:21.240> if<00:05:21.330> you<00:05:21.419> look<00:05:21.570> at<00:05:21.750> it

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
the null object so now if you look at it

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.659 
the null object so now if you look at it
it's<00:05:22.020> going<00:05:22.139> to<00:05:22.199> move<00:05:22.380> around<00:05:22.620> and<00:05:23.130> it<00:05:23.430> looks

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
it's going to move around and it looks

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.560 
it's going to move around and it looks
pretty<00:05:23.789> cool<00:05:23.970> but<00:05:24.270> still<00:05:25.400> what<00:05:26.400> the<00:05:26.490> crap<00:05:26.729> what

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
pretty cool but still what the crap what

well<00:06:14.959> I'm<00:06:15.259> levitating<00:06:16.219> whoa<00:06:17.119> and<00:06:17.839> then<00:06:18.110> it

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:18.229 
well I'm levitating whoa and then it

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:21.399 
well I'm levitating whoa and then it
stops<00:06:18.499> because<00:06:18.740> that's<00:06:19.129> all<00:06:19.279> I<00:06:19.309> did<00:06:19.580> so<00:06:20.409> there
