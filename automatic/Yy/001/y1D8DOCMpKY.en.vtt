2 1 bag every 4 days depending on how
cold<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.350> outside<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:23.220> you<00:00:24.150> pour<00:00:24.869> the

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
cold it is outside so you pour the

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.529 
cold it is outside so you pour the
pellets<00:00:25.439> in<00:00:25.619> here<00:00:26.060> each<00:00:27.060> one<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.449> these

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
pellets in here each one of these

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.769 
pellets in here each one of these
hoppers<00:00:28.130> takes<00:00:29.130> about<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.460> bag<00:00:29.789> bag<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.539> half

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
hoppers takes about a bag bag and a half

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.310 
hoppers takes about a bag bag and a half
and<00:00:31.140> that's<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.740> 40<00:00:32.130> pound<00:00:32.399> bag<00:00:32.630> so<00:00:33.630> there's<00:00:33.870> 50

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
and that's a 40 pound bag so there's 50

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.190 
and that's a 40 pound bag so there's 50
40<00:00:34.710> pound<00:00:34.950> bags<00:00:35.250> in<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.610> ton<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.210> ton<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.750> pellets

40 pound bags in a ton a ton of pellets

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.080 
40 pound bags in a ton a ton of pellets
is<00:00:37.350> roughly<00:00:37.710> equivalent<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.430> usage<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.030> a

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
is roughly equivalent in usage to a

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.170 
is roughly equivalent in usage to a
quart<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.480> wood<00:00:39.800> so<00:00:40.800> it's<00:00:41.280> gonna<00:00:41.489> last<00:00:41.760> you

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
quart of wood so it's gonna last you

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.139 
quart of wood so it's gonna last you
depending<00:00:42.660> on<00:00:43.020> how<00:00:43.079> cold<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.649> is

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
depending on how cold it is

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.630 
depending on how cold it is
you<00:00:45.450> know<00:00:45.570> most<00:00:46.320> cases<00:00:46.620> at<00:00:46.920> least<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.250> couple<00:00:47.430> of

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
you know most cases at least a couple of

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.939 
you know most cases at least a couple of
months<00:00:48.289> the<00:00:49.289> stove<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.829> easy<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.250> clean<00:00:51.920> what<00:00:52.920> I

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
months the stove is easy to clean what I

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.279 
months the stove is easy to clean what I
do<00:00:53.070> when<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.430> get<00:00:53.489> up<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.850> morning<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.300> I

do when I get up in the morning is I

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.250 
do when I get up in the morning is I
turn<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.890> temperature<00:00:56.100> from<00:00:56.760> 65<00:00:57.570> up<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.109> maybe

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
turn the temperature from 65 up to maybe

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.920 
turn the temperature from 65 up to maybe
75<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.070> leave<00:00:59.520> some<00:00:59.820> latent<00:01:00.270> heat<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.750> house

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
75 I leave some latent heat in the house

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.390 
75 I leave some latent heat in the house
and<00:01:01.289> then<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.399> get<00:01:02.579> up<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:02.910> turn<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.300> on<00:01:03.420> and

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
and then I get up and I turn it on and

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.910 
and then I get up and I turn it on and
and<00:01:05.659> then<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.689> let<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:06.960> operate<00:01:07.170> all<00:01:07.560> day

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
and then I let it operate all day

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.820 
and then I let it operate all day
it<00:01:08.159> controls<00:01:08.640> itself<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.540> modulates<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.500> feed

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
it controls itself it modulates the feed

particular temperature so to clean the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.030 
particular temperature so to clean the
stove<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.729> don't<00:01:17.729> need<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:18.360> don't<00:01:19.229> even<00:01:19.530> wait<00:01:19.799> for

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
stove I don't need I don't even wait for

stove I don't need I don't even wait for
the<00:01:20.310> stove<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:21.150> turn<00:01:21.630> off<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.650> can<00:01:22.799> open<00:01:23.159> it

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
the stove to turn off you can open it

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.690 
the stove to turn off you can open it
it's<00:01:23.880> going<00:01:25.490> as<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.520> cleaning<00:01:27.119> tool

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.569 

you<00:01:31.270> scrape<00:01:31.659> the<00:01:31.869> burn<00:01:32.110> pot<00:01:32.409> maybe<00:01:32.799> every<00:01:33.369> day

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
you scrape the burn pot maybe every day

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.109 
you scrape the burn pot maybe every day
or<00:01:33.729> two<00:01:33.969> to<00:01:34.659> make<00:01:34.689> sure<00:01:35.079> that<00:01:35.289> you<00:01:35.880> scrape<00:01:36.880> out

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
or two to make sure that you scrape out

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.060 
or two to make sure that you scrape out
any<00:01:37.329> carbon<00:01:37.960> buildup<00:01:39.390> aside<00:01:40.390> from<00:01:40.630> that<00:01:41.070> the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
any carbon buildup aside from that the

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.700 
any carbon buildup aside from that the
ash<00:01:42.250> is<00:01:42.670> just<00:01:42.939> going<00:01:43.149> to<00:01:43.210> blow<00:01:43.450> over<00:01:43.659> the<00:01:44.079> side

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
ash is just going to blow over the side

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.700 
ash is just going to blow over the side
and<00:01:45.100> into<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:45.939> tray<00:01:46.570> down<00:01:46.840> below

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
and into the tray down below

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.230 
and into the tray down below
you<00:01:48.310> only<00:01:48.460> need<00:01:48.819> to<00:01:48.850> empty<00:01:49.659> the<00:01:49.810> tray<00:01:50.049> below

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
you only need to empty the tray below

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.719 
you only need to empty the tray below
maybe<00:01:52.240> every<00:01:52.600> month<00:01:53.009> six<00:01:54.009> weeks<00:01:54.100> something

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
maybe every month six weeks something

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.100 
maybe every month six weeks something
like<00:01:54.909> that

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.639 

so<00:01:59.110> four<00:01:59.710> people<00:02:00.159> are<00:02:00.460> used<00:02:00.729> to<00:02:00.819> a<00:02:00.909> wood<00:02:01.179> stove

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
so four people are used to a wood stove

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.859 
so four people are used to a wood stove
this<00:02:02.649> is<00:02:02.920> wonderful<00:02:03.490> it's<00:02:03.819> a<00:02:03.939> lot<00:02:04.270> less<00:02:04.539> work

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
this is wonderful it's a lot less work

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.050 
this is wonderful it's a lot less work
you<00:02:05.619> could<00:02:05.770> control<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:06.399> heat<00:02:06.610> a<00:02:06.640> little<00:02:06.729> bit

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
you could control the heat a little bit

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.150 
you could control the heat a little bit
better<00:02:07.240> you<00:02:07.569> don't<00:02:08.080> have<00:02:08.319> the<00:02:08.470> mess<00:02:08.679> of<00:02:08.890> wood

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
better you don't have the mess of wood

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.120 
better you don't have the mess of wood
and<00:02:09.429> it's<00:02:10.119> an<00:02:10.269> excellent<00:02:10.539> option<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.829> the

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
and it's an excellent option the the

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.339 
and it's an excellent option the the
principle<00:02:12.670> of<00:02:12.790> how<00:02:12.940> this<00:02:13.150> works<00:02:13.540> is<00:02:13.870> you<00:02:14.170> have

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
principle of how this works is you have

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.039 
principle of how this works is you have
a<00:02:14.380> small<00:02:14.860> fire<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.549> it's<00:02:16.360> heating<00:02:16.660> up<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:16.870> heat

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
a small fire and it's heating up a heat

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.650 
a small fire and it's heating up a heat
exchanger<00:02:17.769> and<00:02:17.950> then<00:02:18.430> fans<00:02:18.819> are<00:02:19.120> picking<00:02:19.510> up

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
exchanger and then fans are picking up

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.420 
exchanger and then fans are picking up
room<00:02:19.930> air<00:02:20.170> blowing<00:02:20.890> it<00:02:21.010> through<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.280> heat

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
room air blowing it through the heat

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.850 
room air blowing it through the heat
exchanger<00:02:21.459> and<00:02:22.120> blowing<00:02:22.390> it<00:02:22.510> out<00:02:22.599> the<00:02:22.780> top<00:02:23.019> so

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
exchanger and blowing it out the top so

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.009 
exchanger and blowing it out the top so
this<00:02:24.040> is<00:02:24.190> where<00:02:24.370> your<00:02:24.489> heats<00:02:24.760> coming<00:02:25.180> from<00:02:25.420> you

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
this is where your heats coming from you

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.630 
this is where your heats coming from you
don't<00:02:26.049> get<00:02:26.319> a<00:02:26.380> lot<00:02:26.620> of<00:02:26.680> heat<00:02:26.920> off<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.340> glass

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
don't get a lot of heat off the glass

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.789 
don't get a lot of heat off the glass
and<00:02:27.670> off<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.299> stove<00:02:28.569> body<00:02:28.870> itself<00:02:29.319> like<00:02:29.650> you

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
and off the stove body itself like you

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.579 
and off the stove body itself like you
do<00:02:29.920> with<00:02:30.069> the<00:02:30.160> wood<00:02:30.340> stove
