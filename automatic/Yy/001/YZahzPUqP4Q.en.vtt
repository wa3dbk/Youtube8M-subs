00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.120 
hopefully we'll have a successful second
feeding<00:03:33.370> without<00:03:34.370> them<00:03:34.880> being<00:03:35.030> assisted<00:03:36.130> you

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
feeding without them being assisted you

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.380 
feeding without them being assisted you
know<00:03:37.220> you're<00:03:37.490> growing<00:03:37.610> up<00:03:37.850> now<00:03:38.060> they<00:03:38.240> don't

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
know you're growing up now they don't

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.280 
know you're growing up now they don't
need<00:03:38.510> to<00:03:40.330> if<00:03:41.330> somebody<00:03:41.690> assist<00:03:42.020> in<00:03:42.170> their

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
need to if somebody assist in their

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.580 
need to if somebody assist in their
whole<00:03:42.410> life<00:03:43.840> well<00:03:44.840> they're<00:03:45.020> both<00:03:45.140> holding<00:03:45.500> on

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
whole life well they're both holding on

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.620 
whole life well they're both holding on
so<00:03:45.770> that's<00:03:45.890> a<00:03:46.040> good<00:03:46.160> sign<00:03:46.390> maybe<00:03:47.390> i'll<00:03:47.540> just
