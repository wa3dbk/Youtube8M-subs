okay guys we're gonna be doing a couple
of<00:00:03.830> sound<00:00:04.830> tests<00:00:05.250> as<00:00:05.370> well<00:00:05.640> as<00:00:07.280> timer<00:00:08.280> tests

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
of sound tests as well as timer tests

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.669 
of sound tests as well as timer tests
and<00:00:09.000> I<00:00:09.450> have<00:00:09.599> this<00:00:09.719> stopwatch<00:00:10.170> right<00:00:10.349> here<00:00:10.590> on

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
and I have this stopwatch right here on

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.860 
and I have this stopwatch right here on
my<00:00:10.800> phone<00:00:11.010> that<00:00:11.040> counts<00:00:11.580> minutes<00:00:12.330> seconds<00:00:12.750> in

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
my phone that counts minutes seconds in

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.189 
my phone that counts minutes seconds in
milliseconds<00:00:13.440> here<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:13.799> I<00:00:14.929> probably<00:00:15.929> not

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
milliseconds here and I probably not

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.429 
milliseconds here and I probably not
going<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.470> do<00:00:17.460> anything<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:18.359> zoom<00:00:19.020> in<00:00:19.170> on<00:00:19.289> it

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
going to do anything to zoom in on it

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.650 
going to do anything to zoom in on it
but<00:00:19.619> I'll<00:00:20.070> be<00:00:20.340> able<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.580> keep<00:00:20.820> track<00:00:21.119> of<00:00:21.330> the

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
but I'll be able to keep track of the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.929 
but I'll be able to keep track of the
seconds<00:00:22.289> as<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.470> goes<00:00:22.650> by<00:00:22.830> so<00:00:23.189> without<00:00:23.730> further

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939

all right and as you can tell on here if
I<00:00:53.410> can<00:00:53.730> zoom<00:00:54.730> it<00:00:54.820> in<00:00:54.880> close<00:00:55.180> enough

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
I can zoom it in close enough

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.710 
I can zoom it in close enough
they<00:00:56.050> took<00:00:56.260> exactly<00:00:56.860> 19<00:00:57.550> seconds<00:00:58.090> in<00:00:58.239> 256

they took exactly 19 seconds in 256
milliseconds<00:00:59.650> in<00:00:59.739> order<00:00:59.920> for<00:01:00.100> it<00:01:00.160> to<00:01:00.190> start<00:01:00.460> up

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
milliseconds in order for it to start up

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.580 
milliseconds in order for it to start up
on<00:01:00.730> the<00:01:00.820> elbow<00:01:01.059> and<00:01:03.089> let's<00:01:04.089> try<00:01:04.479> it<00:01:04.540> on<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:05.229> new

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
on the elbow and let's try it on the new

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.270 
on the elbow and let's try it on the new
one<00:01:05.770> shall<00:01:06.010> we

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
one shall we

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.219 
one shall we
all<00:01:06.460> right<00:01:06.670> I'll<00:01:06.850> plug<00:01:07.450> in<00:01:07.600> the<00:01:07.690> new<00:01:07.840> one<00:01:08.020> and

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
all right I'll plug in the new one and

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.900 
all right I'll plug in the new one and
we'll<00:01:08.440> see<00:01:08.650> if<00:01:08.770> we<00:01:08.860> get<00:01:08.979> the<00:01:09.130> exact<00:01:09.400> same<00:01:09.580> start

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 
we'll see if we get the exact same start

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.890 
we'll see if we get the exact same start
up<00:01:09.970> time<00:01:10.180> on<00:01:10.360> that<00:01:10.540> one<00:01:10.720> so<00:01:11.369> here<00:01:12.369> we<00:01:12.490> go<00:01:12.640> okay

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
up time on that one so here we go okay

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.570 
up time on that one so here we go okay
we're<00:01:13.900> back<00:01:14.080> with<00:01:14.440> the<00:01:14.710> newer<00:01:14.890> one<00:01:15.190> now

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
we're back with the newer one now

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.880 
we're back with the newer one now
remember<00:01:16.000> that<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.240> oldest<00:01:16.660> one<00:01:16.900> add<00:01:17.140> a

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
remember that the oldest one add a

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.580 
remember that the oldest one add a
second<00:01:18.520> of<00:01:18.640> nineteen<00:01:19.630> point<00:01:19.990> five<00:01:20.229> six

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
second of nineteen point five six

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.550 
second of nineteen point five six
milliseconds<00:01:21.280> or<00:01:21.940> 19<00:01:22.479> seconds<00:01:23.020> in<00:01:23.140> 56

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
milliseconds or 19 seconds in 56

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.920 
milliseconds or 19 seconds in 56
milliseconds<00:01:24.190> so<00:01:24.369> let<00:01:25.180> me<00:01:25.270> clear<00:01:25.479> this<00:01:25.780> out

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
milliseconds so let me clear this out

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.749 
milliseconds so let me clear this out
right<00:01:26.170> here<00:01:26.440> and<00:01:27.039> we're<00:01:27.160> gonna<00:01:27.250> start<00:01:27.520> the<00:01:27.640> new

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
right here and we're gonna start the new

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:52.780 
right here and we're gonna start the new
one<00:01:27.970> and<00:01:28.539> your<00:01:28.660> mark<00:01:28.840> ready<00:01:29.200> three<00:01:30.100> two<00:01:30.280> one<00:01:30.910> go

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.830 

all<00:01:53.390> right<00:01:53.810> we<00:01:54.620> have<00:01:54.860> that<00:01:55.010> one<00:01:55.420> showing<00:01:56.420> up<00:01:56.660> on

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
all right we have that one showing up on

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.520 
all right we have that one showing up on
Xbox<00:01:57.440> Live<00:01:57.770> in<00:01:58.300> sixteen<00:01:59.300> point<00:01:59.870> four<00:02:00.290> eight

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
Xbox Live in sixteen point four eight

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.490 
Xbox Live in sixteen point four eight
seconds<00:02:01.270> we<00:02:02.270> try<00:02:02.450> to<00:02:02.510> get<00:02:02.660> that<00:02:02.810> zoomed<00:02:03.260> in<00:02:03.410> on

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
seconds we try to get that zoomed in on

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.140 
seconds we try to get that zoomed in on
there<00:02:03.680> there<00:02:03.860> it<00:02:03.980> goes<00:02:04.160> sixteen<00:02:04.640> point<00:02:04.910> four

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
there there it goes sixteen point four

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.970 
there there it goes sixteen point four
eight<00:02:05.360> seconds<00:02:05.870> so<00:02:06.380> that's<00:02:06.530> about<00:02:06.590> three

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
eight seconds so that's about three

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.510 
eight seconds so that's about three
seconds<00:02:07.340> faster<00:02:07.730> than<00:02:07.760> the<00:02:07.970> old<00:02:08.119> one<00:02:09.280> so<00:02:10.280> let's

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
seconds faster than the old one so let's

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.300 
seconds faster than the old one so let's
try<00:02:10.820> and<00:02:10.970> do<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.300> next<00:02:12.170> test<00:02:12.560> here<00:02:12.890> which<00:02:13.100> is

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
try and do the next test here which is

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.090 
try and do the next test here which is
going<00:02:14.180> to<00:02:14.300> be<00:02:14.480> just<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:14.960> sound<00:02:15.410> test<00:02:15.710> so<00:02:15.980> I'm

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
going to be just a sound test so I'm

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.390 
going to be just a sound test so I'm
gonna<00:02:16.280> turn<00:02:16.490> off<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:17.350> TV<00:02:18.350> for<00:02:18.710> the<00:02:18.800> next<00:02:19.100> test

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
gonna turn off the TV for the next test

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.150 
gonna turn off the TV for the next test
so<00:02:20.240> without<00:02:20.750> further<00:02:21.140> ado<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.620> next<00:02:21.860> test<00:02:22.010> is

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
so without further ado the next test is

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.440 
so without further ado the next test is
going<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:22.310> be<00:02:22.370> sound<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:23.000> it's<00:02:23.180> going<00:02:23.270> to<00:02:23.330> be

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
going to be sound and it's going to be

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.990 
going to be sound and it's going to be
