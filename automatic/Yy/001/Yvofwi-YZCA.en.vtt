00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.060
 and greet everyone his mails and 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.380
 welcome for this new video on 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.720
 is found for this video a little 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.960
 special because indeed today we are going 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.220
 talk about exclusivity on diablo iii in 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.990
 effect this video it is performed in 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.050
 partnership with gamers origin it's a 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.090
 fan official website of diablo iii 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.640
 I fell on it after a video of 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.430
 datamining where he had actually pulled out 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.050
 current game files from its future 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.840
 which will be integrated in the pvp it is 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.829
 something that interests me enormously 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.640
 I fall and on it I entered 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.179
 contact with them 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.649
 we talked a bit and we still have 

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:46.269
 quotation marks makes some small theory 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.750
 on the future of pvp so I'm here to 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.800
 you share them with you I remember 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.449
 that all that will be said in this 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.809
 video these are just suppositions 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:58.030
 we can not be sure that it will be 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.679
 integrated into the game or not that it will be put 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.420
 as it is currently everything can be 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:03.280
 still modified until we have it 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.720
 in the hands so the few 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.820
 little things we discovered 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.560
 firstly there will be vendors 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.560
 pvp wow like frei 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:25.600
 we have sounds of sellers bp that 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:28.480
 explains that for example only sells his 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.340
 equipment to the best fighters and 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.310
 from there we can think that he 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.860
 there is surely a grade system and that has 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.890
 been more or less the bed that there is a 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:43.420
 stolen picture of jay wilson one screen 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.320
 see the pvp graphical interface and we 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.980
 can see at the top left 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.320
 scout rank if I 'm not mistaken and 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.660
 so here we can imagine that some 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.030
 sellers are open only if we have 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.320
 such a talent grade 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.150
 there is also a tablecloth that reserved for 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.410
 sellers while I speak 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.330
 Normally you will have all the pictures 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.470
 who parade in the background so here it is 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.300
 there will be a map that will be reserved for 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.090
 sellers I could not exactly you 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.920
 explain what is worried this 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.330
 which represents what on this map 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.080
 even for me it's really blurry we have 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.380
 the big three black dot and we have seven 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.180
 this kind of wall we'll say in the middle 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.550
 which is a little reminiscent of the walls of 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.750
 quoted in act 2 this is for now 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.340
 does not have more information at this level 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.420
 there and we do not know yet that this 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.580
 could sell and what they will sell 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.560
 basic equipment or equipment 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.120
 special pvp or ancillary rewards 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.680
 who are going to be right there to make for 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.210
 have fun at play and who are not 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.630
 necessarily important does not have the 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.510
 less idea 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.380
 the other part of information that we have 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.560
 managed to recover 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.370
 is that the game will be is for now 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.260
 scheduled in four against four players 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.120
 only because as you can see 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.650
 right now there is the image of the 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.240
 grid of scores that is really done 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.280
 for four players there is no more than 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.180
 place we can not interposed 1 between 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.770
 each grid is really the case 34 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.350
 and in addition we can a little supported again 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.860
 this argument about the fact that there is 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.500
 no of his quad that must be above 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.330
 quad that so we double it 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.890
 triple kill quad that's it's all we 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.470
 does not have tactile bread so in the 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.890
 theory if we stop there there is no more 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.890
 than four players 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.920
 there will most likely be a mode 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.330
 deathmatch in the sense that we have 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:35.350
 killing fields ie series 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:36.730
 disposal but so you we 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.830
 more than 4 that there will surely be 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.800
 repairs limited in time 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.880
 because we can also have an opinion 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.350
 means there is no more 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.770
 adversary present on the ground 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.550
 currently hate so here is there 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.110
 will surely have a deathmatch mode 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.900
 that is, apparition goes on with 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.000
 a maximum time is a number 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.140
 of maximum eliminations to finish there 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.800
 will surely have a system of 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.720
 matchmaking 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.250
 which is more or less logical 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.470
 not yet know if the creation of 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.710
 custom parts like turin 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.270
 starcraft ii is possible it smells like 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.160
 still managed to find it by 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.330
 against when we are in a match making 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
 that is when we found a 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.750
 party with three other people in 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.150
 knowing that if we base ourselves on 4.24 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.680
 that we do not know it may be that 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.510
 during a game they disconnect 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.020
 and abolished the sounds we managed to 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.480
 recover 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:25.450
 we know that if the person disconnects 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.760
 she can reconnect and if she 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.050
 leave the party there is possibility that 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.700
 someone else join her 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.590
 it's just a hypothesis we do not know if 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.970
 these are sounds that we have at the beginning 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.270
 of the game while the game is 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:54.280
 creates here it will be during the game 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:56.650
 enjoy the game here in our 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.940
 hypothesis if someone leaves the game 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.540
 he always has the possibility someone 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.820
 others join 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.680
 if someone as well leave the 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.990
 part we have the same sound as if we are 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.300
 in a normal part that announces that 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.790
 our opponents lose a loss of their 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.500
 power and so that part fits 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.790
 equilibrium and that even in three against 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.300
 four chances are we can 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.169
 make it out 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:19.120
 that was our hypotheses I hope 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.919
 that this little video will have pleased you 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.900
 I recall that she realizes 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:24.020
 partnership with gamers origin that we 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.870
 provides all 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.419
 and sound that you see via their their data 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:32.509
 personal mining there is also an article 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:33.949
 more accurate with all the images that 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:35.210
 you can find yourself at your leisure 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:36.770
 in the description of the video 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.090
 take care of yourself and see you soon for 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.090
 more videos on my lives
