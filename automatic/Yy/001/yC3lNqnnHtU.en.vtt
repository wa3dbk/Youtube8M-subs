00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.940 
a properly fitted boot super important
probably<00:00:37.660> the<00:00:37.809> most<00:00:37.930> common<00:00:38.410> complaints

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.680 
probably the most common complaints
about<00:00:39.190> ski<00:00:39.520> boots<00:00:39.760> is<00:00:39.970> that<00:00:40.239> they're<00:00:40.390> really

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
about ski boots is that they're really

about ski boots is that they're really
uncomfortable<00:00:41.410> and<00:00:42.070> often<00:00:42.430> really<00:00:42.730> cold<00:00:43.059> you

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
uncomfortable and often really cold you

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.810 
uncomfortable and often really cold you
know<00:00:44.230> the<00:00:44.410> thing<00:00:44.590> is<00:00:44.620> if<00:00:45.070> they<00:00:45.220> fit<00:00:45.430> properly

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820

know the thing is if they fit properly
it<00:00:46.390> might<00:00:46.600> alleviate<00:00:47.110> that<00:00:47.140> so<00:00:47.530> a<00:00:47.559> custom<00:00:48.010> fit

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
it might alleviate that so a custom fit

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.799 
it might alleviate that so a custom fit
is<00:00:48.430> a<00:00:48.460> worthwhile<00:00:48.760> investment<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:52.600> best

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
thing I'll be looking at is a really

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.240 
thing I'll be looking at is a really
good<00:01:10.390> foot<00:01:10.570> bed<00:01:10.750> properly<00:01:11.260> fully<00:01:11.650> posted<00:01:12.070> foot

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
good foot bed properly fully posted foot

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.640 
good foot bed properly fully posted foot
bed<00:01:12.430> then<00:01:12.970> I<00:01:13.060> do<00:01:13.120> a<00:01:13.240> sheltered<00:01:13.930> and<00:01:14.080> make<00:01:14.500> sure

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
bed then I do a sheltered and make sure

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.410

that<00:01:14.770> the<00:01:14.890> boot<00:01:15.040> had<00:01:15.190> the<00:01:15.280> right<00:01:15.430> flex<00:01:15.729> flex<00:01:16.270> is

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
that the boot had the right flex flex is

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.350 
that the boot had the right flex flex is
absolutely<00:01:17.140> critical<00:01:17.470> to<00:01:17.979> making<00:01:18.970> a<00:01:19.030> bit<00:01:19.180> work

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
absolutely critical to making a bit work

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.450 
absolutely critical to making a bit work
anyone<00:01:20.200> we've<00:01:20.320> got<00:01:20.409> a<00:01:20.440> footbed<00:01:20.830> a<00:01:21.070> boot<00:01:21.430> that
