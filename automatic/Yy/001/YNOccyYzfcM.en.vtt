00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
hello I'm here today to give a review of

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.870 
hello I'm here today to give a review of
the<00:00:09.240> Omega<00:00:09.510> Speedmaster<00:00:09.690> professional<00:00:10.880> this

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
the Omega Speedmaster professional this

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.610 
the Omega Speedmaster professional this
is<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.150> sapphire<00:00:12.509> Sandwich<00:00:12.900> model<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:13.410> I've

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
is the sapphire Sandwich model and I've

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.020 
is the sapphire Sandwich model and I've
had<00:00:13.769> this<00:00:13.889> watch<00:00:14.070> for<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.400> year<00:00:14.580> so<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:14.849> thought

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
had this watch for a year so I thought

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.550 
had this watch for a year so I thought
I'd<00:00:15.150> give<00:00:15.330> my<00:00:15.480> impressions<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.199> watch<00:00:16.320> up

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
I'd give my impressions of the watch up

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.710 
I'd give my impressions of the watch up
to<00:00:16.710> this<00:00:16.800> point<00:00:17.039> overall<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.090> really<00:00:18.330> enjoyed

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
to this point overall I really enjoyed

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.820 
to this point overall I really enjoyed
this<00:00:18.869> wash<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.260> I<00:00:19.289> think<00:00:19.470> it's<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.650> great

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
this wash and I think it's a great

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.710 
this wash and I think it's a great
addition<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.250> any<00:00:20.340> watch<00:00:20.640> collection<00:00:21.150> both

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
addition to any watch collection both

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.269 
addition to any watch collection both
because<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.260> its<00:00:22.410> historical<00:00:23.070> and

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
because of its historical and

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.779 
because of its historical and
horological<00:00:23.730> value<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:25.670> thought<00:00:26.670> this

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
horological value I thought this

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.310 
horological value I thought this
particular<00:00:27.300> model<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.630> best<00:00:27.779> quality<00:00:28.170> was<00:00:28.289> the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
particular model is best quality was the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.410 
particular model is best quality was the
Open<00:00:28.680> sapphire<00:00:29.369> case<00:00:29.580> back<00:00:29.820> which<00:00:30.000> allows<00:00:30.269> you

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
Open sapphire case back which allows you

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.020 
Open sapphire case back which allows you
to<00:00:30.449> see<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.779> movement<00:00:31.579> this<00:00:32.579> watch<00:00:32.820> is

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
to see the movement this watch is

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.889 
to see the movement this watch is

which is an 18 jewel movement with a

manual wind and chronograph complication
it's<00:00:41.550> made<00:00:42.390> in-house<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.079> features<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> 12

hand

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.069 
hand
I<00:00:47.000> thought<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.149> jumpring<00:00:48.450> minutes<00:00:48.719> added<00:00:48.989> a

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
I thought the jumpring minutes added a

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.350 
I thought the jumpring minutes added a
lot<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.500> watches<00:00:49.829> legibility<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:51.030> dials

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
lot to the watches legibility the dials

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.510 
lot to the watches legibility the dials
are<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.539> little<00:00:51.719> small<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.230> read<00:00:52.410> but<00:00:52.770> having

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
are a little small to read but having

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.520 
are a little small to read but having
the<00:00:53.760> hand<00:00:54.270> exactly<00:00:54.449> on<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.899> minute<00:00:55.140> mark<00:00:55.260> made

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
the hand exactly on the minute mark made

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.189 
the hand exactly on the minute mark made
it<00:00:55.710> quite<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.340> bit<00:00:56.460> more<00:00:56.579> legible<00:00:57.050> the<00:00:58.050> only

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
it quite a bit more legible the only

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.330 
it quite a bit more legible the only
thing<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.469> thought<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:58.800> movement<00:00:59.219> really

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
thing I thought this movement really

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.810 
thing I thought this movement really
lacked<00:00:59.640> was<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.239> stop<00:01:00.780> seconds<00:01:01.350> function

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
lacked was the stop seconds function

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.250 
lacked was the stop seconds function
when<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.910> go<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.090> set<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.420> time<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.899> seconds

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
when you go to set the time the seconds

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.960 
when you go to set the time the seconds
hand<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.619> not<00:01:04.799> automatically<00:01:05.519> locked<00:01:05.790> into

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
hand is not automatically locked into

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.450 
hand is not automatically locked into
place<00:01:06.409> with<00:01:07.409> little<00:01:07.680> practice<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.220> can<00:01:08.340> get

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
place with little practice you can get

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.590 
place with little practice you can get
just<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.880> right<00:01:08.970> amount<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.240> pressure<00:01:09.390> and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
just the right amount of pressure and

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.630 
just the right amount of pressure and
you<00:01:09.930> can<00:01:10.110> hold<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.619> seconds<00:01:10.979> hand<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.490> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
you can hold the seconds hand in the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.730 
you can hold the seconds hand in the
same<00:01:11.820> position<00:01:12.240> for<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.479> little<00:01:12.659> while<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:13.590> is

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
same position for a little while this is

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.899 
same position for a little while this is
usually<00:01:13.860> enough<00:01:14.189> time<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.549> get<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> pretty

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
usually enough time to get a pretty

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.200 
usually enough time to get a pretty
accurate<00:01:15.000> sync<00:01:15.689> with<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.020> atomic<00:01:16.409> time<00:01:17.210> with

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
accurate sync with the atomic time with

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.490 
accurate sync with the atomic time with
too<00:01:18.390> much<00:01:18.509> pressure<00:01:18.810> though<00:01:19.020> sometimes<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
too much pressure though sometimes the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.070 
too much pressure though sometimes the
seconds<00:01:19.770> hand<00:01:19.830> will<00:01:20.070> roll<00:01:20.310> back<00:01:20.780> Omega<00:01:21.780> says

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
seconds hand will roll back Omega says

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.570 
seconds hand will roll back Omega says
this<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.409> fine<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.920> doesn't<00:01:23.280> damage<00:01:23.430> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
this is fine and doesn't damage the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.859 
this is fine and doesn't damage the
movement<00:01:24.000> but<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.479> can<00:01:24.630> be<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> little

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
movement but it can be a little

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.950 
movement but it can be a little
disconcerting<00:01:25.530> when<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.680> see<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:27.240> 1863

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
disconcerting when you see it the 1863

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.960 
disconcerting when you see it the 1863
calibre<00:01:28.590> does<00:01:28.740> not<00:01:28.890> have<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> column<00:01:29.490> wheel<00:01:29.640> but

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
calibre does not have a column wheel but

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.530 
calibre does not have a column wheel but
instead<00:01:30.270> has<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> lever<00:01:31.200> actuated<00:01:31.740> chronograph

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
to read at some points during the year I

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.060 
to read at some points during the year I
replace<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.660> stainless<00:03:10.440> steel<00:03:10.620> band<00:03:10.830> with

replace the stainless steel band with
this<00:03:11.190> NATO<00:03:11.430> strap<00:03:11.730> I<00:03:12.000> thought<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.630> made<00:03:12.750> the

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
this NATO strap I thought it made the

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.970 
this NATO strap I thought it made the
watch<00:03:12.989> a<00:03:13.080> little<00:03:13.260> more<00:03:13.350> comfortable<00:03:13.739> to<00:03:13.860> wear

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.800 
watch a little more comfortable to wear
in<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.250> summer<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.730> it<00:03:15.360> made<00:03:15.480> it<00:03:15.600> look<00:03:15.690> a

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
in the summer and it made it look a

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.350 
in the summer and it made it look a
little<00:03:15.900> bit<00:03:16.140> more<00:03:16.320> sporty<00:03:17.269> replacing<00:03:18.269> the

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
little bit more sporty replacing the

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.120 
little bit more sporty replacing the
strap<00:03:18.600> is<00:03:18.780> pretty<00:03:18.989> easy<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.650> spring<00:03:19.920> pins

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
strap is pretty easy the spring pins

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.770

just<00:03:20.250> had<00:03:20.519> to<00:03:20.610> be<00:03:20.700> compressed<00:03:21.060> with<00:03:21.269> this<00:03:21.540> tool

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
just had to be compressed with this tool

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.810 
just had to be compressed with this tool
here<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:22.140> then<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.160> stainless<00:03:23.610> steel

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
here and then the stainless steel

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.130

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.270

thought<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.260> overall<00:03:28.590> quality<00:03:28.860> of<00:03:29.130> the
