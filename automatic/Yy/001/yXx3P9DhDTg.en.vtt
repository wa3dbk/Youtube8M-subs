 right those you have understood what is the 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.469
 bull is not a phenomenon but the face 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.329
 humble of the suburban fighter and two 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.129
 dinghies instead of the lungs 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.079
 bitch begins to bite every 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.030
 teker gets tough our start to 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.830
 sink the studs with nastiness e 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.990
 meanwhile lucarelli notices under the

 they think it is an occasional drop of 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.520
 those that only for the flag but a 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.259
 sound of making the big ones begin to 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.640
 underestimate the bull that will also be 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.500
 kept with scotch but knows how to suffer 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.030
 begins to believe it 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.440
 at that moment, captain catches 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.390
 a ball in midfield and pulls straight 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.470
 those nuclear reactors on a descent

 scream that anger joy liberation of 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.119
 nip 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.520

 the marathon understood the half stage 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.720
 rigatino falls silent while the choirs 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.030

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.200
 from behind of bullying hunting on the net 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.250
 pride balloon blasphemies all 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.489
 worse things in the world 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.340
 3 to 3 poem 3 in the mister poetry garnets 

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:11.860
 the most calm marathon has been done 18 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.379
 flight steps to glide the cigar not 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.610
 it smokes more but in the ninetieth it conceals 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:18.069
 pricked that comes out of the cylinder 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.370
 rigor for them hands in the face between 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.319
 we 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.470
 the feeling of the same old story 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.150
 he repeats he thinks but I hope to skin a 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.129
 po disk while it ignites the controversy 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.540
 against the bad dressed in their blue 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.970
 they have a bomber who calls himself the 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.890
 matador and you want the hole you want us 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.239
 place the ball right on top or want it 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.190
 whelk kept 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.540
 in short, we are privileged to 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.540
 launch of the new shopper space 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.230
 and a page of history is written 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.950
 grenade among the sweetest of the last 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.680
 generation 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.150

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.610
 game 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.380
 a miracle that has little value just for 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.930
 who always thinks only that victory 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.390
 justify everything we enjoy st 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.890
 incredible comeback and every evening we throw away 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.050
 an eye to the stars for ten years 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.010
