definition and using the resource
assistant<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.099> look<00:00:08.250> up<00:00:08.429> stuff<00:00:09.650> found<00:00:10.650> that

they ran into something they didn't know
which<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:13.799> haven't<00:00:14.130> covered<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.839> that's<00:00:15.839> the

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
which I haven't covered and that's the

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:24.800 
which I haven't covered and that's the
objective<00:00:16.289> c<00:00:16.920> category<00:00:22.279> now<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:24.060> categories

the<00:00:25.289> collection<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.920> methods<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.789> can<00:00:26.970> be

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
the collection of methods that can be

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.269 
the collection of methods that can be
used<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.480> add<00:00:27.570> functionality<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.470> an<00:00:29.130> already

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
existing class if this sounds like

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.729 
existing class if this sounds like
something<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.300> can<00:00:33.570> be<00:00:33.600> done<00:00:33.719> by<00:00:34.140> creating<00:00:34.649> a

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
something that can be done by creating a

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.510 
something that can be done by creating a
child<00:00:35.010> class<00:00:35.510> well<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:37.070> so<00:00:38.070> I'm<00:00:38.219> going<00:00:38.250> to

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
child class well it is so I'm going to

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.060 
child class well it is so I'm going to
go<00:00:38.670> into<00:00:38.850> why<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.600> would<00:00:39.719> use<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.930> category

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.069 

well<00:00:44.070> one<00:00:44.250> advantage<00:00:44.820> over<00:00:45.000> subclassing<00:00:45.899> is

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
well one advantage over subclassing is

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.690 
well one advantage over subclassing is
that<00:00:46.379> if<00:00:46.500> you've<00:00:46.680> already<00:00:46.860> got<00:00:47.070> some<00:00:47.460> code

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
that if you've already got some code

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.580 
that if you've already got some code
word<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.690> don't<00:00:48.899> need<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.110> bother<00:00:49.320> to

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
word you don't need to bother to

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.090 
word you don't need to bother to
refactor<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.280> classrooms<00:00:51.680> now<00:00:52.680> another

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
refactor the classrooms now another

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.709 
refactor the classrooms now another
advantage<00:00:53.699> over<00:00:53.879> subclassing<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:56.449> it<00:00:57.449> could

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
advantage over subclassing is it could

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.330 
advantage over subclassing is it could
be<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.079> methods<00:00:58.559> declared<00:00:58.980> within<00:00:59.160> a

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
be that methods declared within a

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.330 
be that methods declared within a
category<00:00:59.550> don't<00:01:00.359> have<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.719> be<00:01:00.840> implemented<00:01:01.340> so

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
category don't have to be implemented so

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.039 
category don't have to be implemented so
if<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.550> want<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.879> add<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.480> methods<00:01:03.840> later

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
if you want to add the methods later

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.270 
if you want to add the methods later
then<00:01:04.439> that's<00:01:04.739> fine<00:01:04.860> with<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.610> category<00:01:06.119> and

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
then that's fine with a category and

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.399 
then that's fine with a category and
just<00:01:08.280> like<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> child<00:01:08.790> class<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:10.020> don't<00:01:10.049> need

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
just like a child class you don't need

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.620 
just like a child class you don't need
the<00:01:10.560> source<00:01:10.799> code<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.460> class<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.540> add

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
the source code of a class to add

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.820 
the source code of a class to add
functionality<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:15.080> categories<00:01:16.080> can<00:01:16.650> make

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
functionality and categories can make

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.490 
functionality and categories can make
your<00:01:17.009> code<00:01:17.189> easier<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.790> understand<00:01:18.409> so<00:01:19.409> if

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
your code easier to understand so if

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.320 
your code easier to understand so if
you've<00:01:19.619> got<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.890> really<00:01:20.189> large<00:01:20.490> class<00:01:20.909> with

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
you've got a really large class with

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.570 
you've got a really large class with
lots<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.689> methods<00:01:22.220> maybe<00:01:23.220> just<00:01:23.490> for

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
lots of methods maybe just for

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.490 
lots of methods maybe just for
readability<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.659> might<00:01:24.869> want<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.140> separate

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
readability you might want to separate

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.960 
readability you might want to separate
your<00:01:25.650> methods<00:01:26.040> into<00:01:26.280> categories<00:01:30.530> okay<00:01:31.530> this

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
your methods into categories okay this

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.850 
your methods into categories okay this
just<00:01:32.150> a<00:01:32.240> simple<00:01:32.450> class<00:01:32.840> here<00:01:33.170> known<00:01:33.680> as

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
just a simple class here known as

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.090 
just a simple class here known as
greeting<00:01:34.750> you<00:01:35.750> see<00:01:35.930> I<00:01:35.960> have<00:01:36.260> one<00:01:36.530> method<00:01:36.980> to

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
okay here I've got i'm using the actual

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.640 
okay here I've got i'm using the actual
methods<00:02:25.100> within<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.340> greeting<00:02:26.670> class<00:02:26.940> and

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
methods within the greeting class and

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.920 
methods within the greeting class and
within<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.860> category<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.580> you<00:02:30.570> can<00:02:30.720> see<00:02:30.900> that

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
within the category and you can see that

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.050 
within the category and you can see that
using<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.560> methods<00:02:31.950> within<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.340> category<00:02:32.820> is

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
using the methods within the category is

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.090 
using the methods within the category is
just<00:02:34.020> like<00:02:34.230> using<00:02:34.440> them<00:02:34.680> in<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:34.920> original

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
just like using them in the original

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:41.150
