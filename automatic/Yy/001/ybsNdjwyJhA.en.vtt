00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.300
 hello now a tutorial about this ball 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.789
 This one will kindly know you 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.090
 Clever ikon provided first 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.480
 once they start with aluta zion 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:30.840
 For this we really only need raf 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.420
 and he needs time not he would 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.719
 if we turn the right side here 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.250
 and he means in judgment 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.649
 and he strokes meant against the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.289
 So judge would not tell you 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:48.329
 Turn the right side here by 180 degrees 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:51.149
 He stroked there with the rope 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.600
 horizon the site once against 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.390
 Turned clockwise so with and 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.129
 that meant that stroke was important 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.800
 is that we are not 90 degrees rotation 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.439
 if I can do such a 90 here 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.600
 I've got my turn here in the 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.630
 middle a gear and no center stone 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.299
 So this is a ridge of the middle and 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.990
 i can not take this level anymore 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.180
 that will not do 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.880
 that's why it's very important that we do 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.220
 Only wise in this case say that we 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.619
 really 89 degrees you should ring them 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:30.080
 back in center stone only then can 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:30.080
 we de the more in there so now de 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:39.810
 clockwise and the stroke 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:48.000
 against the clock then I still f that 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:51.320
 their the front so of 81 degrees and f 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.399
 counterclockwise by 180 degrees 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.689
 But that was it with the 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.219
 situation more you do not need it 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.840
 we do not really need much 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.820
 algorithms cube that one really only 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.310
 two or three 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.020
 me is very simple and very easy me 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.820
 I'll start over here now 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.090
 As always, you can easily choose the menu 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.879
 where you just wanted to jump now 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.840
 of course if you start with the 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.840
 first level solve
