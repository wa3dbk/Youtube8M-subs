the video game we should go stealth you

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:36.900 
the video game we should go stealth you
just<00:05:35.710> see<00:05:35.800> that<00:05:35.950> could<00:05:36.099> glow<00:05:36.340> in<00:05:36.400> her<00:05:36.639> eyes

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
like moving around so that's cool that

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.600 
like moving around so that's cool that
he<00:05:40.210> made<00:05:40.389> her<00:05:40.539> eyes<00:05:40.750> and<00:05:41.229> daggers<00:05:41.919> hello

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
he made her eyes and daggers hello

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.159 
he made her eyes and daggers hello
even<00:05:42.849> though<00:05:42.940> in<00:05:43.090> the<00:05:43.180> game<00:05:43.360> her<00:05:43.660> daggers<00:05:44.020> do

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
even though in the game her daggers do

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:48.810 
even though in the game her daggers do
not<00:05:44.320> glow<00:05:44.729> and<00:05:46.500> for<00:05:47.500> the<00:05:47.590> undead<00:05:47.949> characters<00:05:48.550> I

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
not glow and for the undead characters I

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.089 
not glow and for the undead characters I
think<00:05:49.449> it's<00:05:49.599> cool<00:05:49.810> that<00:05:49.840> the<00:05:50.139> Elise<00:05:50.410> made<00:05:50.650> the
