00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.920
 and everyone got our bones 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.600
 today we find ourselves on a small 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.770
 tutorial on cinema where assets have to 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.439
 I speak fast and I do it fast 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.090
 because I'm going to monitor this tutorial at 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.369
 the graphic speed chain is for the 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.720
 yes it takes rather less hard hard of 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.119
 less than 10 minutes I give you a try 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.450
 it lasted ten minutes to five minutes finally 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.800
 good it's a little hot so I have 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.219
 taken from the advanced so you see I have 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.210
 does the logo with a lava texture on 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.670
 should trouble there enthroned in 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.250
 description exist on lava a little 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.379
 like this one here only there that I milla 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.230
 and then I looked back a bit I put 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.809
 the skulls I moan grunge textures 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.949
 behind so we're going to copy his three 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.480
 kids will go cut with the 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.850
 troubles so did a very beautiful 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.570
 week for quality has and makes you 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.340
 200 pieces 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.170
 so I'm going to cut the time to cut 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.650
 the hair cut the video the time of 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.790
 cut just three and we'll know 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.540
 once you've cut the 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.940
 three that will give you 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.370
 so finally I do not know it gave that 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.750
 there are seven names that nasa pieces 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.030
 not give that bsa give it all as 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.540
 me so you delete everything except good 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.180
 sure the important parts you make word 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.500
 thanks fractures were all 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.440
 interview pieces did have select 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.960
 its object you press control you from 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.229
 selected piece who is or who had 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.510
 in 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.600
 where such is done select its 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.550
 object you do a check and you 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:43.960
 stay I do not know about mac what is it 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:47.350
 touch to control sea â€‹â€‹tracker so 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.290
 here you put all your fractured 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.820
 fractured actually at the effector celebrations 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:57.330
 organization that you are going to lay bare 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.330
 his parents 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.000
 it's not bad all that normally I 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.140
 put a little less I hold like this 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.200
 in fact so we can still 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.850
 see them 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.899
 the lava texture but not so good 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.039
 to be really hot to do in 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.270
 kind of minutes without I really would have 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.650
 no time it's been three minutes of 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.800
 I hope it will happen when 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.180
 even 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.880
 so here is then you 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.580
 select your break you do 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.230
 effector seems so I'll tell you 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.150
 just what will it look like 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.560
 I can tell you now 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.350
 looked like what I had done in 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.130
 the in the focus of the super actually you 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.600
 see there are tips there is no he 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.370
 there is no fracture and in Asia 'in 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.830
 where it is there is there 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.769
 not so you do simple effector 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:44.360
 you uncheck position in ladder you 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:48.810
 put uniform scale - 1 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:51.660
 you are in opa form held 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.790
 bottom you put this doing so here 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.480
 you see that in fact it's going to take off the 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:01.110
 wii to the sphere so you do 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.660
 I love left-handed people here it is going to do 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.100
 a spin need 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.720
 you will finally be able to do too 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.760
 with many more pieces either 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.830
 much more beautiful I believe that out of 26 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.590
 I believe that the effect 500 may have 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.480
 not 60 300 400 pieces I think that's it 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.110
 so never add a second so 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:22.270
 effector parameters we uncheck position 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:28.190
 we are fishing uniform scale - 1 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:32.180
 mitigation the one at the helaba where he is 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:37.519
 placed it's not bad anymore right there 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.480
 yes yes and yes but echo here 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.579
 so suddenly it gives something 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.489
 like that so I'm going to stop everything from 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.719
 I 'm sorry I cut too fast 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.599
 what I'm pausing there the time of 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:49.340
 to render and we meet again and 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.329
 so that's their in-end have I finished 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.700
 will show the result 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:55.579
 and so that's what it gives you see there 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.569
 there are all the parts and where this 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.760
 that she is doing this there is no 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.409
 good parts there it's not going too much I you 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.500
 advises to make more than 100 pieces 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:05.420
 usually takes the goff have to do 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:09.170
 like yours 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.830
 the sound background so there I make him 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:16.120
 300 that she I think it's also pity 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.739
 so that's so small and nitro blast or 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.440
 too much to do but no troubles at this 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.669
 even more beautiful finally good do what 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.870
 you want to after that you apply 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.340
 the textures bear to shock everything 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.290
 that one time show you because there I 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.150
 did not have time well ben here is jean 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.330
 stemi nuptials thank you for listening to this tutorial 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.400
 and thanks to the graphic speed chain of 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.199
 two shots of the video this breach 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.520
 sorry that it's over two minutes 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.740
 but I think it can really be 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.229
 interesting to make edges in style 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.960
 mock-ups of low prices big 3d finally 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:46.900
 so here's the next you'll be 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.590
 to use the plugin and vibrate on 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.330
 cinema 4d 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.470
 we meet for a next video 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.470
 show bye bye track and jean
