let me take you through a chord
progression<00:02:00.790> that<00:02:01.570> is<00:02:01.780> going<00:02:02.020> to<00:02:02.110> go<00:02:02.260> two

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
progression that is going to go two

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.250 
progression that is going to go two
measures<00:02:03.220> of<00:02:03.340> G<00:02:03.550> and<00:02:04.000> measure<00:02:04.270> of<00:02:04.450> C<00:02:04.720> and<00:02:04.990> a

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
measures of G and measure of C and a

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.140 
measures of G and measure of C and a
measure<00:02:05.440> of<00:02:05.560> D<00:02:05.890> with<00:02:06.430> that<00:02:06.580> pattern<00:02:06.940> here<00:02:07.090> we

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
measure of D with that pattern here we

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:20.850 
measure of D with that pattern here we
go

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.280 

okay<00:02:21.790> so<00:02:21.850> that's<00:02:22.060> kind<00:02:22.210> of<00:02:22.540> pretty<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:23.080> kind

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
fifth string and that is a variation of

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.600 
fifth string and that is a variation of
a<00:03:15.880> D<00:03:16.060> chord<00:03:16.770> we've<00:03:17.770> taken<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.160> seat

- there so now let's hear what the

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.140 
- there so now let's hear what the
progression<00:03:22.740> sounds<00:03:23.100> like<00:03:23.250> when<00:03:23.760> we<00:03:23.880> put<00:03:24.060> it

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
progression sounds like when we put it

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:34.600 
progression sounds like when we put it
together<00:03:24.270> starting<00:03:24.960> with<00:03:25.050> the<00:03:25.140> G

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
down here but now the bass note is on a

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.059 
down here but now the bass note is on a
G

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.369 

and<00:03:58.430> so<00:03:58.580> this<00:03:58.760> is<00:03:58.879> a<00:03:58.909> high<00:03:59.269> inversion<00:03:59.959> and

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
and so this is a high inversion and

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.710 
and so this is a high inversion and
variation<00:04:00.890> on<00:04:01.010> a<00:04:01.040> G<00:04:01.310> chord<00:04:01.340> I<00:04:01.790> play<00:04:02.540> a<00:04:02.569> regular

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
variation on a G chord I play a regular

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.410 
variation on a G chord I play a regular

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
G chord you can hear how they're kind of

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.559 
G chord you can hear how they're kind of
in<00:04:05.510> the<00:04:05.629> same<00:04:05.810> ballpark<00:04:07.000> so<00:04:08.000> let's<00:04:08.209> start<00:04:08.450> our

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
in the same ballpark so let's start our

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:09.819 
in the same ballpark so let's start our
progression<00:04:09.049> up<00:04:09.170> there<00:04:09.319> we've<00:04:09.470> got<00:04:09.620> two

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
progression up there we've got two

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.039 
progression up there we've got two
measures<00:04:10.099> of<00:04:10.129> G<00:04:10.459> let's<00:04:10.700> start<00:04:10.939> way<00:04:11.060> up<00:04:11.090> here<00:04:11.480> G

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
measures of G let's start way up here G

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:27.580 
measures of G let's start way up here G
C<00:04:12.920> and<00:04:13.189> D<00:04:13.970> let's<00:04:14.239> see<00:04:14.629> how<00:04:14.750> that<00:04:14.810> sounds

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.270 

take<00:04:28.590> it<00:04:28.710> home<00:04:28.860> to<00:04:29.040> a<00:04:29.070> normal<00:04:29.460> G

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
take it home to a normal G

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.950 
take it home to a normal G
