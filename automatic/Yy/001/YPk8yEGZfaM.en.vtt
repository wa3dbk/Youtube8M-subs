you<00:02:33.190> heard<00:02:33.400> that<00:02:33.580> so<00:02:34.180> this<00:02:34.330> is<00:02:34.420> how<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.569> works

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
you heard that so this is how it works

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.600 
you heard that so this is how it works
which<00:02:35.110> TV<00:02:35.349> microphone<00:02:36.069> actually<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.489> volume

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
which TV microphone actually the volume

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.720 
which TV microphone actually the volume

really do on both your iPod on your then

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.910 
really do on both your iPod on your then
by<00:02:40.299> using<00:02:40.599> it<00:02:40.900> you<00:02:40.989> should<00:02:41.140> adjust<00:02:41.410> it<00:02:41.650> to<00:02:41.799> get

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
by using it you should adjust it to get
