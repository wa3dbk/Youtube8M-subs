more<00:02:33.150> we<00:02:34.150> are<00:02:34.270> developing<00:02:34.540> a<00:02:34.930> technique<00:02:35.380> to

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
more we are developing a technique to

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.650 
more we are developing a technique to

emissions in our coal power plants we

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.449 
emissions in our coal power plants we
are<00:02:40.720> increasing<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.500> use<00:02:41.800> of<00:02:41.830> climate

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
are increasing the use of climate

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.850 
are increasing the use of climate

plants<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.459> we'll<00:02:46.420> build<00:02:46.660> new<00:02:46.930> wind<00:02:47.260> power

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
plants and we'll build new wind power

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.979 
plants and we'll build new wind power
stations<00:02:48.220> that<00:02:48.790> will<00:02:49.000> deliver<00:02:49.270> energy<00:02:49.600> to

stations that will deliver energy to

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.700 
stations that will deliver energy to
over<00:02:50.350> a<00:02:50.380> million<00:02:50.680> households<00:02:51.340> every<00:02:51.580> year
