hybrid<00:00:18.449> guy<00:00:18.980> so<00:00:19.980> essentially<00:00:22.279> pitched<00:00:23.279> battle

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
hybrid guy so essentially pitched battle

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.250 
hybrid guy so essentially pitched battle
just<00:00:24.930> reminds<00:00:25.470> me<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.619> lot<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:27.260> counter-strike

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
just reminds me a lot of counter-strike

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.400 
just reminds me a lot of counter-strike
and<00:00:31.130> look<00:00:32.130> kind<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.369> like<00:00:32.840> it's<00:00:33.840> basically

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
and look kind of like it's basically

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.410 
and look kind of like it's basically
team<00:00:34.860> deathmatch<00:00:35.399> but<00:00:35.670> when<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.910> die<00:00:36.120> you're

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
team deathmatch but when you die you're

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.060 
team deathmatch but when you die you're
out<00:00:36.600> for<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:36.989> round<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.649> there's<00:00:37.860> more

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
out for the round so there's more

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.840 
out for the round so there's more
incentive<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.550> stay<00:00:38.670> alive<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:40.489> with<00:00:41.489> war<00:00:41.760> of

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
incentive to stay alive and with war of

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.330 
incentive to stay alive and with war of
the<00:00:41.910> roses<00:00:42.059> there's<00:00:42.600> more<00:00:42.930> incentive<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.680> heal

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
I'm a little bit rusty and I haven't

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.270 
I'm a little bit rusty and I haven't
played<00:00:56.160> war<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.760> roses<00:00:56.969> in<00:00:57.949> probably<00:00:58.949> a

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
played war of the roses in probably a

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.869 
played war of the roses in probably a
week<00:00:59.640> or<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:01.309> been<00:01:02.309> playing<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.609> lot<00:01:02.730> of

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
week or so and been playing a lot of

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.549 
week or so and been playing a lot of
counter-strike<00:01:03.390> actually<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.199> it's<00:01:04.350> kind<00:01:04.530> of

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
counter-strike actually so it's kind of

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.200 
counter-strike actually so it's kind of
funny<00:01:04.769> how<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.070> new<00:01:05.309> game<00:01:05.519> mode<00:01:05.729> was<00:01:05.970> pitched

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
funny how the new game mode was pitched

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.190 
funny how the new game mode was pitched
battle<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:07.290> here<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:07.890> get<00:01:08.220> snuck<00:01:08.520> up<00:01:08.729> on<00:01:09.020> they<00:01:10.020> do

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
battle so here I get snuck up on they do

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.230 
battle so here I get snuck up on they do
some<00:01:10.590> pretty<00:01:12.409> good<00:01:13.409> flanking<00:01:14.310> on<00:01:14.460> us<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.030> I

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
some pretty good flanking on us and I

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.780 
some pretty good flanking on us and I
get<00:01:15.479> killed<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.049> I've<00:01:16.140> decided<00:01:16.799> not<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.460> yield

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
get killed and I've decided not to yield

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.550 
get killed and I've decided not to yield
out<00:01:18.060> because<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.780> mean<00:01:19.070> it's<00:01:20.070> pitch<00:01:20.340> battle<00:01:21.560> and

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
out because I mean it's pitch battle and

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.789 
out because I mean it's pitch battle and
what's<00:01:22.890> funny<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.640> actually<00:01:24.799> distract

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
what's funny is I actually distract

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.710 
what's funny is I actually distract
these<00:01:25.950> guys<00:01:26.220> for<00:01:26.580> enough<00:01:26.820> time<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.299> wherever

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
these guys for enough time so wherever

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.230 
these guys for enough time so wherever
this<00:01:27.930> Archer<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.470> keeps<00:01:29.430> hitting<00:01:29.759> these<00:01:29.970> guys

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
this Archer is keeps hitting these guys

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.510 
this Archer is keeps hitting these guys
right<00:01:30.930> before<00:01:31.229> they're<00:01:31.890> going<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.070> finish<00:01:32.250> me

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
right before they're going to finish me

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.510 
right before they're going to finish me
off<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:33.000> yeah<00:01:33.329> it's<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.600> little<00:01:33.720> unrealistic<00:01:34.520> uh

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
off so yeah it's a little unrealistic uh

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.050 
off so yeah it's a little unrealistic uh
I've<00:01:36.450> had<00:01:36.750> how<00:01:37.140> many<00:01:37.170> shields<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.909> know

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
I've had how many shields you know

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.929 
I've had how many shields you know
pushed<00:01:39.509> into<00:01:39.810> my<00:01:40.140> my<00:01:40.680> neck<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.250> should<00:01:41.610> be<00:01:41.700> dead

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
pushed into my my neck I should be dead

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.359 
pushed into my my neck I should be dead
but<00:01:42.930> anyway<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.439> definitely<00:01:43.950> shows<00:01:44.159> the

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
but anyway it definitely shows the

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.319 
but anyway it definitely shows the
incentive<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.240> want<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:46.040> execute<00:01:47.329> enemy

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
incentive that you want to execute enemy

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.200 
incentive that you want to execute enemy
players<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.960> revive<00:01:49.470> your<00:01:49.740> own<00:01:50.030> so<00:01:51.030> right<00:01:51.180> now

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
players and revive your own so right now

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.639 
players and revive your own so right now
it's<00:01:51.479> kind<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.720> cool<00:01:51.899> as<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.140> can<00:01:52.290> still<00:01:52.530> watch

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
it's kind of cool as I can still watch

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.620 
it's kind of cool as I can still watch
your<00:01:52.829> battle<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.310> I'm<00:01:53.430> flipping<00:01:53.880> around<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.600> a

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
your battle so I'm flipping around to a

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.230 
your battle so I'm flipping around to a
few<00:01:54.689> different<00:01:54.960> guys<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.649> see<00:01:55.909> you<00:01:56.909> know<00:01:57.030> where

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
few different guys to see you know where

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.580 
few different guys to see you know where
the<00:01:57.390> action<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:57.899> at<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:59.119> it<00:02:00.119> seems<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.780> what

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
the action is at and it seems that what

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.429 
the action is at and it seems that what
I've<00:02:01.680> observed<00:02:01.860> anyway<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:03.020> pitched<00:02:04.020> battle

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
I've observed anyway in pitched battle

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.359 
I've observed anyway in pitched battle
there's<00:02:04.680> less<00:02:05.340> archers<00:02:05.969> than<00:02:06.390> there<00:02:06.600> are<00:02:06.630> in

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
there's less archers than there are in

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.420 
there's less archers than there are in
say<00:02:09.170> you<00:02:10.170> know<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.470> normal<00:02:10.800> conquest<00:02:11.580> or

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
say you know the normal conquest or

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.300 
say you know the normal conquest or
match<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:13.569> I<00:02:14.319> think<00:02:14.409> that's<00:02:14.620> because<00:02:14.799> archers

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
match and I think that's because archers

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.830 
match and I think that's because archers
are<00:02:15.459> pretty<00:02:15.670> vulnerable<00:02:16.000> so<00:02:16.480> a<00:02:16.510> lot<00:02:16.659> of<00:02:16.689> people

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
are pretty vulnerable so a lot of people

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.080 
are pretty vulnerable so a lot of people
don't<00:02:17.230> want<00:02:17.379> to<00:02:17.439> do<00:02:17.530> this<00:02:17.769> is<00:02:17.980> this<00:02:18.730> is<00:02:18.849> kind<00:02:19.060> of

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
don't want to do this is this is kind of
