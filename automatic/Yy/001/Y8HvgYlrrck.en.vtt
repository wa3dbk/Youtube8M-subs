piece what's the coolest thing that came

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.100 
piece what's the coolest thing that came
into<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.400> scope<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.790> think<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.060> think<00:02:12.330> we<00:02:12.630> were

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
into the scope you think I think we were

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.870 
into the scope you think I think we were
looking<00:02:13.470> through<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.680> we<00:02:13.860> wanted<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.160> make<00:02:14.520> one

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
looking through it we wanted to make one

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.120 
looking through it we wanted to make one
that<00:02:15.150> was<00:02:15.360> kind<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.900> head<00:02:16.710> of<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:16.920> pack

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
that was kind of the head of the pack

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.230 
that was kind of the head of the pack
and<00:02:17.340> we<00:02:17.430> figured<00:02:17.700> out<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:17.910> was<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.030> devastating

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
and we figured out it was a devastating

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.050 
and we figured out it was a devastating
loss<00:02:18.750> function<00:02:19.230> but<00:02:19.650> they<00:02:19.920> only<00:02:20.010> made<00:02:20.310> in<00:02:20.460> 96

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
loss function but they only made in 96

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.559 
loss function but they only made in 96
they<00:02:21.270> made<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.450> think<00:02:21.569> 500<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:22.380> them<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:23.130> just

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
they made I think 500 of them and just

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.480 
they made I think 500 of them and just
more<00:02:24.569> than<00:02:24.810> kept<00:02:25.110> its<00:02:25.290> resale<00:02:25.680> value<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.370> just

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
more than kept its resale value and just

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.030 
more than kept its resale value and just
a<00:02:26.550> neat<00:02:26.819> big<00:02:27.150> shot<00:02:27.569> you<00:02:28.170> know<00:02:28.290> coil<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.890> have
