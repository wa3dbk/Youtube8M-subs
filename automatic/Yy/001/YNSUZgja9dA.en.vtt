out<00:01:41.770> from<00:01:42.039> the<00:01:42.159> hole<00:01:42.959> and<00:01:43.959> go<00:01:44.200> all<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.649> way

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
out from the hole and go all the way

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:47.279 
out from the hole and go all the way
around<00:01:45.009> make<00:01:45.969> sure<00:01:46.000> you<00:01:46.450> get<00:01:46.630> a<00:01:46.689> good<00:01:46.750> thing

around make sure you get a good thing
feed<00:01:47.560> because<00:01:48.429> water<00:01:49.500> always<00:01:50.500> takes<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.069> path

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
feed because water always takes the path

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.609 
feed because water always takes the path
of<00:01:51.490> least<00:01:51.670> resistance<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:53.200> you<00:01:53.259> want<00:01:53.500> to<00:01:53.590> make

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
of least resistance so you want to make

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.520 
of least resistance so you want to make
sure<00:01:53.740> that<00:01:53.979> you<00:01:54.340> got<00:01:54.549> a<00:01:54.609> good<00:01:55.030> thick<00:01:55.959> liberal

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
down over there just like so and then

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.420 
down over there just like so and then
we're<00:02:49.300> going<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:49.450> mash<00:02:49.720> it<00:02:49.989> in<00:02:50.280> we're<00:02:51.280> going<00:02:51.370> to

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
we're going to mash it in we're going to

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.240 
we're going to mash it in we're going to
work<00:02:51.670> that<00:02:51.910> around<00:02:52.269> to<00:02:52.599> make<00:02:53.560> sure<00:02:53.590> what<00:02:54.130> we

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
work that around to make sure what we

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.820 
work that around to make sure what we
what<00:02:54.519> we<00:02:54.550> want<00:02:54.880> to<00:02:54.970> do<00:02:55.150> is<00:02:55.840> kind<00:02:56.110> of<00:02:56.290> flatten<00:02:56.739> it

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
what we want to do is kind of flatten it

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.460 
what we want to do is kind of flatten it
out<00:02:56.950> so<00:02:57.489> we<00:02:57.519> make<00:02:57.790> sure<00:02:57.819> that<00:02:58.269> the<00:02:58.930> liner<00:02:59.200> and

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
out so we make sure that the liner and

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.650 
out so we make sure that the liner and
the<00:02:59.769> pants<00:03:00.010> there's<00:03:00.400> no<00:03:00.580> air<00:03:00.880> in<00:03:00.910> between<00:03:01.120> them

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
the pants there's no air in between them

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.289 
the pants there's no air in between them
and<00:03:02.440> we<00:03:02.620> want<00:03:02.830> that<00:03:02.860> silicone<00:03:03.549> to<00:03:03.670> spread<00:03:04.060> out

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
and we want that silicone to spread out

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.690 
and we want that silicone to spread out
so<00:03:05.170> it's<00:03:05.319> a<00:03:05.379> good<00:03:05.560> thick<00:03:05.890> area<00:03:06.160> because<00:03:06.519> those

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
so it's a good thick area because those

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.130 
so it's a good thick area because those
beads<00:03:07.000> you<00:03:07.180> lay<00:03:07.299> down<00:03:07.330> once<00:03:07.840> you<00:03:07.959> apply

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
beads you lay down once you apply

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.839 
beads you lay down once you apply
pressure<00:03:08.470> then<00:03:08.769> silicones<00:03:09.280> going<00:03:09.519> to<00:03:09.580> spread

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
pressure then silicones going to spread

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.280 
pressure then silicones going to spread
out<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:10.660> that's<00:03:10.900> what<00:03:11.230> we<00:03:11.380> want<00:03:11.940> all<00:03:12.940> right<00:03:13.290> so

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
out and that's what we want all right so

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.319 
out and that's what we want all right so
we're<00:03:14.410> just<00:03:14.500> going<00:03:14.739> to<00:03:14.799> work<00:03:15.010> that<00:03:15.250> in<00:03:15.489> around

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
we're just going to work that in around

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.220 
we're just going to work that in around
the<00:03:16.510> area<00:03:16.780> now<00:03:16.930> if<00:03:17.019> we<00:03:17.170> pull<00:03:17.410> this<00:03:17.440> back<00:03:19.230> and

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
the area now if we pull this back and

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.839 
the area now if we pull this back and
this<00:03:20.590> is<00:03:20.769> going<00:03:20.920> to<00:03:21.010> be<00:03:21.069> tough<00:03:21.310> for<00:03:21.519> you<00:03:21.640> days

if you can zoom in right here you can
see<00:03:26.360> the<00:03:26.390> silicone<00:03:27.049> coming<00:03:27.500> through<00:03:27.709> and

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
see the silicone coming through and

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.009 
see the silicone coming through and
that's<00:03:28.069> what<00:03:28.400> you<00:03:28.579> want<00:03:28.879> you<00:03:29.659> want<00:03:29.870> that

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:31.849 
silicone coming through so you can see

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.360 
silicone coming through so you can see
it<00:03:31.970> on<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.150> back<00:03:32.390> side<00:03:32.720> we<00:03:33.680> don'twe<00:03:33.890> that<00:03:34.159> back

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
it on the back side we don'twe that back

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.720 
it on the back side we don'twe that back
over<00:03:34.780> and<00:03:35.780> just<00:03:35.989> work<00:03:36.200> that<00:03:36.439> around

over<00:03:49.489> here<00:03:49.810> this<00:03:50.810> is<00:03:50.989> where<00:03:51.140> our<00:03:51.200> old<00:03:51.500> skimmer

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
over here this is where our old skimmer

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.970 
over here this is where our old skimmer

in there plus about fifteen screw holes

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.520 
in there plus about fifteen screw holes
where<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.069> faceplate<00:03:58.670> was<00:03:59.019> so<00:04:00.019> we<00:04:00.230> did<00:04:00.410> the

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
where the faceplate was so we did the

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.130 
where the faceplate was so we did the
same<00:04:00.769> thing<00:04:00.879> if<00:04:01.879> we<00:04:02.030> caught<00:04:02.239> a<00:04:02.269> patch<00:04:02.599> you<00:04:03.019> can

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140
