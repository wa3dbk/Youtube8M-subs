more<00:01:52.360> of<00:01:52.510> an<00:01:52.660> indoor<00:01:53.020> fraction<00:01:53.470> there<00:01:53.800> are<00:01:53.860> a

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
more of an indoor fraction there are a

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.730 
more of an indoor fraction there are a
few<00:01:54.040> things<00:01:54.190> none<00:01:54.520> about<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:54.820> shoe<00:01:55.120> first<00:01:56.020> if

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
few things none about the shoe first if

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.040 
few things none about the shoe first if
you're<00:01:56.890> buying<00:01:57.130> it<00:01:57.460> before<00:01:58.210> you<00:01:58.240> buy<00:01:58.540> the<00:01:58.600> shoe

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
you're buying it before you buy the shoe

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.590 
you're buying it before you buy the shoe
note<00:02:00.010> that<00:02:00.250> the<00:02:00.310> traction<00:02:01.000> is<00:02:01.090> only<00:02:01.330> good<00:02:01.570> for

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
note that the traction is only good for

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.020 
note that the traction is only good for
indoor<00:02:02.290> use<00:02:02.440> and<00:02:03.040> it's<00:02:03.280> not<00:02:03.550> really<00:02:03.820> made<00:02:04.000> for

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
indoor use and it's not really made for

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.150 
indoor use and it's not really made for
outdoors<00:02:04.570> so<00:02:04.870> if<00:02:04.960> you're<00:02:05.080> looking<00:02:05.230> if<00:02:05.680> you

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
outdoors so if you're looking if you

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.890 
outdoors so if you're looking if you
usually<00:02:06.310> play<00:02:06.640> outside<00:02:06.790> along<00:02:07.330> then<00:02:07.630> this

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
usually play outside along then this

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.840 
usually play outside along then this
wouldn't<00:02:08.230> be<00:02:08.440> a<00:02:08.470> good<00:02:08.740> shoe<00:02:08.980> for<00:02:09.190> you<00:02:09.280> to

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
wouldn't be a good shoe for you to
