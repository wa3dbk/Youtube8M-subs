mission of molasses and dextrose as well

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.890 
mission of molasses and dextrose as well
so<00:00:29.259> first<00:00:30.009> of<00:00:30.189> all<00:00:30.279> the<00:00:31.090> barley<00:00:31.390> wine<00:00:31.509> has<00:00:31.720> come

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
so first of all the barley wine has come

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.509 
so first of all the barley wine has come
out<00:00:32.019> well<00:00:32.680> it's<00:00:33.400> going<00:00:33.550> beard<00:00:34.239> I'm<00:00:34.420> happy<00:00:34.750> wet

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:35.519 
out well it's going beard I'm happy wet

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:47.939 
out well it's going beard I'm happy wet
regrettably<00:00:36.519> bill<00:00:43.140> it's<00:00:44.140> messed<00:00:44.320> up<00:00:44.470> again<00:00:46.949> it

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
regrettably bill it's messed up again it

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:49.320 
regrettably bill it's messed up again it
looks<00:00:48.070> like<00:00:48.250> a<00:00:48.280> hump<00:00:48.519> it<00:00:48.640> enough<00:00:48.820> from<00:00:48.940> animals

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.330 
looks like a hump it enough from animals

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
looks like a hump it enough from animals
in<00:00:49.449> it<00:00:49.540> because<00:00:50.379> the<00:00:50.500> ABV<00:00:50.979> is<00:00:51.750> well<00:00:52.750> low<00:00:52.989> for<00:00:53.320> a

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
in it because the ABV is well low for a

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.560 
in it because the ABV is well low for a
barley<00:00:53.710> wine<00:00:53.830> oysters<00:00:54.430> come<00:00:54.670> in<00:00:54.790> a<00:00:54.820> five<00:00:55.180> point

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
barley wine oysters come in a five point

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.079 
barley wine oysters come in a five point
nine<00:00:55.659> percent<00:00:56.140> so<00:00:56.680> it's<00:00:56.769> just<00:00:56.890> one<00:00:57.430> notch<00:00:57.670> away

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
nine percent so it's just one notch away

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.770 
nine percent so it's just one notch away
from<00:00:58.269> six<00:00:58.510> I<00:00:58.979> think<00:00:59.979> it's<00:01:00.070> really<00:01:00.659> called<00:01:01.659> a

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
from six I think it's really called a

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.030 
from six I think it's really called a
barley<00:01:01.989> wine<00:01:02.229> I<00:01:02.409> would<00:01:02.530> need<00:01:02.650> to<00:01:02.799> be<00:01:02.890> at<00:01:03.010> least

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
barley wine I would need to be at least

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.960 
barley wine I would need to be at least
eight<00:01:03.460> percent<00:01:03.970> and<00:01:04.590> I<00:01:05.590> was<00:01:06.430> thinking<00:01:06.880> I<00:01:06.939> could

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
eight percent and I was thinking I could

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.170 
eight percent and I was thinking I could
come<00:01:07.240> like<00:01:07.360> a<00:01:07.479> bone<00:01:07.720> II<00:01:08.640> may<00:01:09.640> be<00:01:09.670> just<00:01:10.030> over

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
come like a bone II may be just over

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.740 
come like a bone II may be just over
eight<00:01:10.420> percent<00:01:10.600> but<00:01:10.930> I<00:01:11.729> think<00:01:12.729> I<00:01:12.909> haven't<00:01:13.330> hung

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
eight percent but I think I haven't hung

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.260 
eight percent but I think I haven't hung
doing<00:01:14.020> nothing<00:01:14.350> for<00:01:14.560> from<00:01:15.100> animals<00:01:15.460> so<00:01:16.119> there

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
doing nothing for from animals so there

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.179 
doing nothing for from animals so there
was<00:01:16.390> two<00:01:16.600> one<00:01:16.960> and<00:01:17.080> a<00:01:17.110> half<00:01:17.229> kilogram<00:01:17.770> barley

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
was two one and a half kilogram barley

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:22.980 
was two one and a half kilogram barley
wine<00:01:18.580> kits<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:21.520> so<00:01:22.240> there<00:01:22.600> was<00:01:22.660> also

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
wine kits and so there was also

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.510 
wine kits and so there was also
obviously<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:23.380> Clippers<00:01:23.800> better<00:01:24.070> kit<00:01:24.400> and

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
obviously the Clippers better kit and

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.500 
obviously the Clippers better kit and
I'll<00:01:24.580> be<00:01:24.700> one<00:01:24.820> point<00:01:25.120> seven<00:01:27.300> I'm<00:01:28.300> talking

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
I'll be one point seven I'm talking

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.200 
I'll be one point seven I'm talking

kilogram kids and a kilo of dextrose so
when<00:01:56.140> I<00:01:56.170> think<00:01:56.260> about<00:01:56.380> their<00:01:56.710> I<00:01:56.970> haven't<00:01:57.970> I

when I think about their I haven't I
you<00:01:59.170> know<00:01:59.260> there's<00:01:59.470> like<00:01:59.640> 200<00:02:00.640> grams<00:02:00.909> of<00:02:01.150> each

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
you know there's like 200 grams of each

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.640 
you know there's like 200 grams of each
of<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:01.659> barley<00:02:01.930> wine<00:02:02.049> kits<00:02:02.350> because<00:02:02.470> they

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
of the barley wine kits because they

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.719 
of the barley wine kits because they
were<00:02:02.740> both<00:02:02.860> 1.5<00:02:03.580> kilograms<00:02:03.970> kids<00:02:04.450> um<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:06.130> put

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
were both 1.5 kilograms kids um I put

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.070 
were both 1.5 kilograms kids um I put
454<00:02:07.600> grams<00:02:07.630> worth<00:02:08.289> of<00:02:08.909> dextrose<00:02:09.909> in<00:02:10.119> so<00:02:10.959> that's

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
454 grams worth of dextrose in so that's

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.800 
454 grams worth of dextrose in so that's
you<00:02:11.769> know<00:02:11.799> under<00:02:12.310> half<00:02:12.489> a<00:02:12.640> kilogram<00:02:12.909> even<00:02:13.690> with

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
you know under half a kilogram even with

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.940 
you know under half a kilogram even with
200<00:02:14.590> grams<00:02:14.860> worth<00:02:15.129> of<00:02:15.340> molasses<00:02:16.150> in<00:02:16.540> there<00:02:16.950> so

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
200 grams worth of molasses in there so

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.759 
200 grams worth of molasses in there so
really<00:02:18.099> I<00:02:18.280> shouldn't<00:02:18.819> be<00:02:19.140> I'm<00:02:20.140> not<00:02:20.379> sure<00:02:20.560> why<00:02:20.739> I

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
really I shouldn't be I'm not sure why I

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.160 
really I shouldn't be I'm not sure why I
was<00:02:20.950> expecting<00:02:21.549> I<00:02:21.670> suppose<00:02:22.090> such<00:02:22.749> a<00:02:22.779> high

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
was expecting I suppose such a high

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.890 
was expecting I suppose such a high
alcohol<00:02:23.379> content<00:02:23.769> but<00:02:24.489> as<00:02:24.609> it<00:02:24.730> stands<00:02:24.999> the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
alcohol content but as it stands the

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:26.980 
alcohol content but as it stands the
beer<00:02:26.139> that<00:02:26.290> has

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
beer that has

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.830 
beer that has
resulted<00:02:27.500> from<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:27.800> trouble<00:02:28.100> kit<00:02:28.540> of<00:02:29.540> them<00:02:29.780> a

resulted from the trouble kit of them a

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.540 
resulted from the trouble kit of them a
couple<00:02:30.080> of<00:02:30.140> gravity<00:02:30.530> tests<00:02:30.950> obviously<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:31.400> get

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
couple of gravity tests obviously to get

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.140 
couple of gravity tests obviously to get
my<00:02:31.730> ABV<00:02:32.270> and<00:02:32.710> it's<00:02:33.710> no<00:02:33.830> finished<00:02:34.220> remaining

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.890 
completely I'm about to rock that a
secondary<00:02:37.460> but<00:02:38.090> I'll<00:02:38.150> let<00:02:38.210> you<00:02:38.300> have<00:02:38.420> a<00:02:38.450> look<00:02:38.690> a

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
secondary but I'll let you have a look a

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.760 
secondary but I'll let you have a look a
minute<00:02:39.200> at<00:02:39.800> the<00:02:40.210> V<00:02:41.210> M<00:02:41.450> I'm<00:02:42.200> going<00:02:42.530> could<00:02:42.740> a

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
minute at the V M I'm going could a

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.590 
minute at the V M I'm going could a
picture<00:02:43.220> as<00:02:43.370> well<00:02:43.520> I'll<00:02:44.270> look<00:02:44.420> at<00:02:44.540> this

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
picture as well I'll look at this

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.040 
picture as well I'll look at this
picture

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.229 

so<00:02:50.050> that<00:02:50.530> was<00:02:51.270> however<00:02:52.270> 12<00:02:53.080> hours<00:02:53.430> after<00:02:54.430> yeast

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
so that was however 12 hours after yeast

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.020 
so that was however 12 hours after yeast
has<00:02:55.420> pitched<00:02:55.690> all<00:02:56.020> three<00:02:56.260> packs<00:02:56.950> of<00:02:57.190> yeast<00:02:57.459> 20

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
has pitched all three packs of yeast 20

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.150 
has pitched all three packs of yeast 20
kids<00:02:58.300> went<00:02:58.540> into<00:02:58.750> their<00:02:58.870> I'm<00:02:59.650> gonna<00:02:59.860> play<00:03:00.010> have

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
kids went into their I'm gonna play have

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.040 
kids went into their I'm gonna play have
a<00:03:00.220> link<00:03:00.430> it's<00:03:00.670> absolutely<00:03:01.239> man<00:03:01.420> Kayla<00:03:01.750> here's

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
a link it's absolutely man Kayla here's

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:08.910 
a link it's absolutely man Kayla here's
the<00:03:02.170> lid<00:03:02.790> of<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.849> Anthony<00:03:06.510> look<00:03:07.510> at<00:03:07.630> my<00:03:07.920> that's

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
the lid of the Anthony look at my that's

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.590 
the lid of the Anthony look at my that's
only<00:03:09.100> done<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.400> 20<00:03:09.640> liter<00:03:09.819> of<00:03:09.970> real<00:03:10.180> length<00:03:10.360> as

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
only done the 20 liter of real length as

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.920 
only done the 20 liter of real length as
well<00:03:11.250> so<00:03:12.250> imagine<00:03:12.670> if<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:12.880> than<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.090> fill<00:03:13.239> 23<00:03:13.750> I

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
well so imagine if it than the fill 23 I

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.440 
well so imagine if it than the fill 23 I
mean<00:03:14.110> it<00:03:14.200> was<00:03:14.319> spewing<00:03:14.709> out<00:03:14.950> of<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:16.090> lid<00:03:16.269> I

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
mean it was spewing out of the the lid I

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.800 
mean it was spewing out of the the lid I
had<00:03:16.900> to<00:03:17.019> keep<00:03:17.140> wiping<00:03:17.380> it<00:03:17.680> with<00:03:18.480> fresh<00:03:19.480> clean

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
had to keep wiping it with fresh clean

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.590 
had to keep wiping it with fresh clean
tissues<00:03:20.260> etc<00:03:20.830> and<00:03:21.550> you<00:03:21.940> know<00:03:22.030> throwing<00:03:22.420> them

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
tissues etc and you know throwing them

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.090 
tissues etc and you know throwing them
away

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
away

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.520 
away
it<00:03:24.100> did<00:03:24.250> calm<00:03:24.459> down<00:03:24.640> eventually<00:03:24.760> but

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
it did calm down eventually but

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.440 
it did calm down eventually but
essentially<00:03:26.530> this<00:03:26.709> brew<00:03:27.100> was<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.060> quickest

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
essentially this brew was the quickest

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.420 
essentially this brew was the quickest
one<00:03:28.540> I've<00:03:28.690> ever<00:03:28.750> done<00:03:29.019> and<00:03:29.410> it's<00:03:29.950> got<00:03:30.160> the<00:03:30.250> most

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
one I've ever done and it's got the most

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.090 
one I've ever done and it's got the most
ingredients<00:03:30.670> and<00:03:31.480> it<00:03:32.200> was<00:03:32.350> pretty<00:03:33.040> much

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
ingredients and it was pretty much

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.000 
ingredients and it was pretty much
finished<00:03:33.610> fermentation<00:03:34.209> in<00:03:34.299> three<00:03:34.510> days

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
finished fermentation in three days

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.830 
finished fermentation in three days
never<00:03:36.790> I'd<00:03:36.880> want<00:03:37.090> to<00:03:37.120> do<00:03:37.239> that<00:03:37.390> that<00:03:37.630> quick

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
never I'd want to do that that quick

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.360 
never I'd want to do that that quick
before<00:03:38.170> but<00:03:38.319> it<00:03:38.410> really<00:03:38.560> went<00:03:38.799> mental<00:03:38.980> I<00:03:39.250> was

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
before but it really went mental I was

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.370 
before but it really went mental I was
the<00:03:39.910> temperature<00:03:40.330> I<00:03:40.720> was<00:03:40.930> try<00:03:41.080> to<00:03:41.110> keep<00:03:41.290> the

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
the temperature I was try to keep the

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.800 
the temperature I was try to keep the
temperature<00:03:41.769> thing<00:03:41.950> because<00:03:42.910> it's<00:03:43.180> not<00:03:43.480> and

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
temperature thing because it's not and

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.270 
temperature thing because it's not and
you<00:03:44.049> know<00:03:44.140> it's<00:03:44.260> not<00:03:44.350> particularly<00:03:44.769> hot<00:03:45.160> in

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
you know it's not particularly hot in

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.059 
you know it's not particularly hot in
Scotland<00:03:45.790> but<00:03:45.970> it<00:03:46.630> is<00:03:46.780> technically<00:03:47.500> what<00:03:47.920> we

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
Scotland but it is technically what we

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.370 
Scotland but it is technically what we
consider<00:03:48.880> a<00:03:48.970> summer<00:03:49.209> thing<00:03:49.480> because<00:03:50.230> of<00:03:50.319> the

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
consider a summer thing because of the

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.190 
consider a summer thing because of the
weather's<00:03:50.650> crap<00:03:51.010> just<00:03:51.280> name<00:03:51.430> is<00:03:51.700> right<00:03:52.200> but

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
weather's crap just name is right but

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.319 
weather's crap just name is right but
the<00:03:53.470> temperature<00:03:53.890> was<00:03:54.130> creeping<00:03:54.850> up<00:03:54.970> even

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
the temperature was creeping up even

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.680 
the temperature was creeping up even
over<00:03:55.540> 26<00:03:56.079> degrees<00:03:56.410> Celsius<00:03:57.329> so<00:03:58.329> I<00:03:58.359> actually

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
over 26 degrees Celsius so I actually

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.190 
over 26 degrees Celsius so I actually
had<00:03:58.930> a<00:03:58.959> fan<00:03:59.260> on<00:03:59.560> it<00:03:59.769> to<00:04:00.220> try<00:04:00.430> and<00:04:00.549> keep<00:04:00.940> the<00:04:01.209> the

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
had a fan on it to try and keep the the

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.960 
had a fan on it to try and keep the the
temperature<00:04:02.709> day<00:04:02.859> and<00:04:03.280> that<00:04:03.400> product<00:04:03.700> down<00:04:03.820> by

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
temperature day and that product down by

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.729 
temperature day and that product down by
about<00:04:04.090> a<00:04:04.239> degree<00:04:04.420> but<00:04:04.870> Neil<00:04:05.049> I'm<00:04:05.380> still

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
about a degree but Neil I'm still

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.660 
about a degree but Neil I'm still
fermenting<00:04:06.130> about<00:04:06.310> 25<00:04:06.760> degrees<00:04:07.120> and<00:04:08.549> so<00:04:09.549> have

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
fermenting about 25 degrees and so have

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.920 
fermenting about 25 degrees and so have
a<00:04:09.730> leak<00:04:09.880> right<00:04:10.870> so<00:04:11.109> here's<00:04:11.320> those<00:04:11.470> AFV<00:04:12.810> look<00:04:13.810> at

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
a leak right so here's those AFV look at

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.310 
a leak right so here's those AFV look at
that<00:04:14.079> absolutely<00:04:14.680> Bank<00:04:15.370> you<00:04:15.519> see<00:04:15.670> it<00:04:15.760> was

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
that absolutely Bank you see it was

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.469 
that absolutely Bank you see it was
old-fashioned<00:04:17.320> doing<00:04:17.560> the<00:04:17.709> side<00:04:17.919> of<00:04:18.160> the

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
old-fashioned doing the side of the

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.390 
old-fashioned doing the side of the
fermenter<00:04:19.479> there<00:04:19.660> put<00:04:20.169> an<00:04:20.260> old<00:04:20.380> towel<00:04:20.769> on<00:04:21.340> the

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
fermenter there put an old towel on the

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.890 
fermenter there put an old towel on the
ground<00:04:21.820> to<00:04:22.030> stop<00:04:22.270> many<00:04:22.419> any<00:04:23.320> issues<00:04:24.900> and

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
ground to stop many any issues and

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.029 
ground to stop many any issues and
here's<00:04:26.229> the<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.710> resulting<00:04:27.160> in<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.370> earth

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
here's the the resulting in the earth

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.560 
here's the the resulting in the earth
not<00:04:30.039> sure<00:04:30.220> if<00:04:30.310> you<00:04:30.400> can<00:04:30.520> see<00:04:30.760> very<00:04:30.940> well<00:04:31.120> I'll

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
not sure if you can see very well I'll

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.050 
not sure if you can see very well I'll
push<00:04:31.840> it<00:04:31.870> back<00:04:32.200> a<00:04:32.229> little<00:04:32.580> that's<00:04:33.580> more<00:04:33.820> under

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
push it back a little that's more under

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.560 
push it back a little that's more under
the<00:04:34.150> light<00:04:34.380> there<00:04:35.380> we<00:04:35.470> go

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
the light there we go

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.810 
the light there we go
so<00:04:37.570> there<00:04:37.720> we<00:04:37.810> go<00:04:37.840> so<00:04:38.400> it's<00:04:39.400> a<00:04:39.460> dark<00:04:39.669> beer<00:04:40.260> it<00:04:41.260> is

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
so there we go so it's a dark beer it is

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.340 
so there we go so it's a dark beer it is
5.9%<00:04:42.820> so<00:04:43.479> it<00:04:43.600> you<00:04:43.690> know<00:04:43.810> it's<00:04:44.020> got<00:04:44.139> a<00:04:44.169> decent

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350
