00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello friends from the garden of jose I'm going 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.220
 to teach the new chicken coop that I've 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.380
 done but this time it's a complement 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:14.160
 as you see 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.220
 of the old henhouse since in the 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.840
 new chicken coop the chickens are going to be 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.780
 locked 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.630
 because it did not seem normal to me 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.330
 were always outdoors and less 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.260
 now with the cold that you do here you have 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.260
 the old chicken coop 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.210
 that I already taught you several times in 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.090
 the videos and still on top of this 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.620
 tree and it did not seem normal to me so I've 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.620
 made a new video 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.080
 that is, a new chicken coop closed there 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.750
 you have the door that communicates 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.460
 little girl communicates a chicken coop with 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.180
 the other 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.180
 here you have it 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.420
 and now I'm going to teach it inside 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.640
 there are the chickens 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.690
 all out 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.690
 eating grass 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.070
 and now I 'm going to show him the chicken coop 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.880
 inside 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.880
 here it is 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.510
 It has about 8 square meters 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.470
 approximately that is not small 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.470
 it's very good 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.110
 here it is 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.060
 is that they were on the street and I did not 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.370
 it seemed normal it seems normal to me 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.260
 true 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.850
 that they were in the street sleeping and 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.630
 less now with the cutting edge that does so 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.760
 I decided to make a chicken coop closed and the 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.590
 truth is that you notice here what 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.050
 you have the hole as I said 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.970
 before that is the one that communicates with what 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.250
 that the old money that out there 150 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.250
 4 meters approximately 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.820
 your drinker 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.820
 of water 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.540
 two feeders one in each way one 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.560
 automatic and the other hung 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.560
 and here you have 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.280
 where they lay the eggs 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:22.190
 I did not know how to do it and end as 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:24.600
 I had some empty paint drums, 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.890
 I made an invention 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.010
 and the truth is that I have been very 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.690
 all right 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.280
 you have it 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:36.250
 here where they lay eggs as you see 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.819
 and very well then I also did some 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.550
 hangers to make them sleep because 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:46.830
 you know that chickens like it 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.830
 sleep high on the floor 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.270
 here you have it the chicken coop is not very 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.770
 big but it's not small either 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.950
 said that about 8 meters pictures 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.180
 approximately 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.180
 totally isolated 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.700
 here you have it with the roof some woods 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.120
 with its corresponding beams 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.900
 and the truth is that I have stayed very 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.900
 well I think it has been very good 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.740
 and here 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.820
 you have 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.820
 one of the roosters 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.170
 and taught it from the outside 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.170
 this is the old chicken coop 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.030
 what is a complement to the chicken coop 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.980
 new closed 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.170
 here the cabin is completely all 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.110
 closed 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.110
 both above and below the 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.000
 It has a berry on the sides surrounding 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.469
 everything and then up a mosquito net 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.590
 so that no animal can enter and 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:06.140
 here as you see the two dogs 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.360
 and here the chickens come because they 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.989
 see that they are hungry and when they have 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.989
 hunger you know 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:20.549
 well nothing 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:24.919
 here I leave you 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.919
 an overview of the hens 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.080
 and another of the dog and nothing I hope you 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.020
 I liked it 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.569
 the video if you liked the video as 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.030
 you know I would appreciate it if you 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:42.400
 subscribe to the channel and you have a 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.130
 good like 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.250
 then nothing until a new video until 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.250
 then
