why<00:02:05.380> nothing<00:02:06.380> is<00:02:06.470> going<00:02:06.710> on<00:02:06.950> I<00:02:07.340> did<00:02:07.729> have<00:02:08.060> one

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
why nothing is going on I did have one

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.240 
why nothing is going on I did have one
get<00:02:08.780> buried<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:09.380> then<00:02:09.500> she<00:02:09.709> dropped<00:02:09.950> all<00:02:10.130> our

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
get buried and then she dropped all our

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.240 
get buried and then she dropped all our
eggs<00:02:11.020> but<00:02:12.020> I<00:02:12.050> haven't<00:02:12.380> had<00:02:12.470> any<00:02:12.709> losses<00:02:12.980> in

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
eggs but I haven't had any losses in

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.500 
eggs but I haven't had any losses in
this<00:02:13.370> tank<00:02:13.550> so<00:02:13.760> they've<00:02:13.910> been<00:02:14.030> doing<00:02:14.300> great

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
this tank so they've been doing great

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.150 
this tank so they've been doing great
they're<00:02:14.720> all<00:02:14.870> over<00:02:15.230> here<00:02:15.470> actually<00:02:18.069> because<00:02:19.069> I

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
they're all over here actually because I

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.760 
they're all over here actually because I
just<00:02:19.370> dropped<00:02:19.640> some<00:02:19.819> snowflakes<00:02:20.239> in<00:02:20.569> there<00:02:20.770> so

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
just dropped some snowflakes in there so

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.190 
just dropped some snowflakes in there so
they're<00:02:21.920> all<00:02:22.040> in<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.400> feeding<00:02:22.730> dish<00:02:23.200> grabbing

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
they're all in the feeding dish grabbing

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.020 
they're all in the feeding dish grabbing
some<00:02:24.350> snowflakes<00:02:24.709> so<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.550> bacterial

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
some snowflakes so the bacterial

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.270 
some snowflakes so the bacterial
infection<00:02:26.569> is<00:02:26.750> back<00:02:27.110> in<00:02:27.260> this<00:02:27.410> tank<00:02:27.680> I've<00:02:27.950> been

I<00:03:46.080> just<00:03:46.230> left<00:03:46.500> it<00:03:46.650> in<00:03:46.740> there<00:03:46.920> because<00:03:47.100> it's<00:03:47.340> a

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
I just left it in there because it's a

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.860 
I just left it in there because it's a
leave-in<00:03:47.640> food<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:48.240> I<00:03:48.300> just<00:03:48.510> wanted<00:03:48.720> to<00:03:48.750> see

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
if they would eat it it looks gone for

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.900 
if they would eat it it looks gone for
the<00:03:52.260> most<00:03:52.470> part<00:03:52.710> because<00:03:53.010> she<00:03:53.250> put<00:03:53.460> a<00:03:53.490> lot<00:03:53.790> in

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
the most part because she put a lot in

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
always hid like within the rock so I
