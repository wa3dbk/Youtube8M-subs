00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hi nice that you look in this get ready 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.029
 with me video i will show how i am 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.830
 getting ready for Christmas 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.540
 I show what kind of makeup I wear 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.820
 do I have to do my hair and what clothes 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.590
 I attract and we start with 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.010
 the makeup naturally went with one 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.380
 moisturize dry skin well 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.660
 then I get started with concealer and 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.550
 bibi with a cream and I stay 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.320
 with a brush 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.289
 so that everything is evenly distributed over 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.000
 my face as the east neatly up 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.160
 I support it off for mac on more 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.340
 coverage and for matte finish and do that 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.020
 I just use a skin-colored powder 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.760
 and if it's all over then I'll go 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.530
 my eyebrows-signing I throw a 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.469
 made a separate video about it so watch it 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.329
 just to see how I do that then go 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.309
 we get started with eyes and i put one 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.430
 base with a white eye pencil so that 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.469
 I look even better at colors 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.039
 and and my eyebrow bone I bring one 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.420
 Highlighter to optically yes my eyes 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.980
 what and lifts 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.079
 then I get started with a 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.750
 pink color that I bring to moving 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.119
 eyelid as a kind of base color and 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.680
 from there I continue to work I do one 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.110
 bit of a brown color in my 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.360
 arcade arc and then I blend very well 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.860
 to blur it nicely 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.720
 then you naturally want to go to 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.250
 good within the inner corner of the eye from 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.700
 let it jump and I do that through 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.950
 of a very beautiful silver color 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.890
 then i'm that color also one 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.720
 a little bit under my eyes until the 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.369
 half of my eyes and the other side 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.740
 I do that with a light brown 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.630
 color that I draw on to it 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.070
 line in the crisis that we mentioned earlier 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.950
 have put 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.460
 and all this blind I'm going to stick 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.259
 with the loose pigments and for that 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.360
 use a flat eye shadow brush and 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.170
 I dip that in my eye 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.299
 so you get the least fall-out and 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.950
 you just sit nicely and like you 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.540
 Then still fall if he can get it 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.530
 simply very easily with a fan 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.590
 tassel 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.600
 you can wipe that there is high line 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.200
 of course not to be missed and I do too 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.820
 just a moment and I use two mascaras and 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.780
 in combination I think that smart naughty 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.259
 very nice 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.050
 and give very full and long lashes and 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.630
 that is the eyes and then we continue with 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.770
 the warm i smart face briefly with a 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:21.019
 matte bronzer and above that I bring one 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.000
 very nice blog and above that again 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.980
 green highlighter on 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.830
 and so you get a very beautiful view 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.510
 healthy shape and shine and lipstick 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.530
 of course not to be missed with a beautiful 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.170
 Christmas look 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.819
 and I chose this one 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.200
 garden by catrice 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.790
 if you want to know which or five 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.440
 lipsticks I like for the 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.769

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.299
 video that also link below 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.370
 I powder this all off with one 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.989
 terrace of the powders so you make up 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.239
 stays in place all day long 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.829
 and so I blended the makeup 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.360
 from my cheeks that beautiful in 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.280
 overflowing 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.840
 and then it's all been powdering 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.250
 and some shell in my eyebrow because 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.799
 I also want it in place all day long 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.079
 and that's the makeup look ready 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.850

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.530
