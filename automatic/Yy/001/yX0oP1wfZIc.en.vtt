a<00:03:20.180> difference<00:03:20.269> but<00:03:21.019> I<00:03:21.049> don't<00:03:21.290> think<00:03:21.470> it's<00:03:21.590> as

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
a difference but I don't think it's as

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.590 
a difference but I don't think it's as
drastic<00:03:22.130> as<00:03:22.220> what<00:03:22.370> people<00:03:22.670> are<00:03:22.760> seeing<00:03:22.940> but
