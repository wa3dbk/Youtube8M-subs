00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
so far I feel pretty good pretty good

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:48.579 
so far I feel pretty good pretty good
you<00:00:46.100> had<00:00:46.370> I<00:00:46.699> think<00:00:47.089> Lord<00:00:47.629> artists<00:00:47.960> okay<00:00:48.379> also

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:48.589 
you had I think Lord artists okay also

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.500 
you had I think Lord artists okay also
colicky<00:00:49.159> and<00:00:49.339> removal<00:00:50.470> it<00:00:51.470> was<00:00:51.649> successful

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
colicky and removal it was successful

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.630 
colicky and removal it was successful
but<00:00:53.510> we<00:00:53.659> thought<00:00:53.930> we<00:00:54.140> could<00:00:54.379> go<00:00:54.470> ahead<00:00:54.559> and<00:00:54.860> go

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
but we thought we could go ahead and go

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.740 
but we thought we could go ahead and go
for<00:00:55.670> perfection<00:00:57.730> for<00:00:58.730> the<00:00:58.850> reducing<00:00:59.269> this<00:00:59.359> car

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
for perfection for the reducing this car

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.599 
for perfection for the reducing this car
so<00:01:00.230> that's<00:01:00.440> always<00:01:00.680> something<00:01:01.010> that<00:01:01.190> can<00:01:01.460> be

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
so that's always something that can be

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:08.139 
so that's always something that can be
done<00:01:05.350> in<00:01:06.350> what<00:01:06.590> way<00:01:06.830> is<00:01:06.890> it<00:01:07.009> better<00:01:07.310> it<00:01:07.700> is<00:01:07.880> much

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
done in what way is it better it is much

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:16.800 
done in what way is it better it is much
more<00:01:08.479> yeah<00:01:08.990> okay<00:01:09.619> it<00:01:09.679> is<00:01:09.800> much
