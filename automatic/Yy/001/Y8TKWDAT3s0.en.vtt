and when I do it euthanasia the first

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.130 
and when I do it euthanasia the first
injection<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.280> mixture<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:21.659> short-acting

the pet to become completely immobilized
and<00:01:32.040> at<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.790> point<00:01:33.060> he<00:01:33.900> has<00:01:34.110> no

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
and at that point he has no

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.140 
and at that point he has no
comprehension<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.280> what's<00:01:35.610> going<00:01:35.880> on<00:01:36.030> around

comprehension of what's going on around

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.520 
comprehension of what's going on around
him<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:37.530> second<00:01:37.920> injection<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:39.090> when<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.869> give

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
him the second injection is when I give

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.289 
him the second injection is when I give
the<00:01:40.680> medicine<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.220> actually<00:01:41.700> stops<00:01:42.060> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
the medicine that actually stops the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.440 
the medicine that actually stops the
heart<00:01:42.540> rate<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.430> that's<00:01:44.430> what<00:01:44.670> actually<00:01:44.909> puts

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
heart rate and that's what actually puts

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.480 
heart rate and that's what actually puts
the<00:01:45.570> little<00:01:45.689> pet<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.140> sleep<00:01:46.409> but<00:01:47.189> he<00:01:47.220> won't

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
the little pet to sleep but he won't

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.410 
the little pet to sleep but he won't
know<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:48.000> he<00:01:48.450> won't<00:01:48.659> feel<00:01:48.960> anything<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:50.420> once

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
know it he won't feel anything and once

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.950 
know it he won't feel anything and once
it's<00:01:51.600> over<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:51.990> over<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:53.340> it's<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.479> hard<00:01:54.869> thing

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
it's over it's over so it's a hard thing

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.980 
it's over it's over so it's a hard thing
to<00:01:55.229> do<00:01:55.530> but<00:01:56.250> at<00:01:56.430> least<00:01:56.670> we<00:01:56.939> have<00:01:57.180> in<00:01:57.540> veterinary

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
to do but at least we have in veterinary

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.969 
to do but at least we have in veterinary
medicine<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.979> ability<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.430> do<00:01:59.729> that
