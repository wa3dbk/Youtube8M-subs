00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.330
 hello everyone with you haunter on the channel 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.180
 long ago there were no vidos 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.669
 very long ago at all for a long time vidos 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.269
 of this type and finally I 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:30.119
 I spread the new one fresh not 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:35.250
 quite certainly fresh but new fight 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.800
 just say at E25 immediately spoiler such 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.680
 strange fight and I can show even than he 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.989
 will end at that moment when I 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.170
 recorded more accurately recorded which I played 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.420
 I did not have this fight, but 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.219
 now know i'm not surprised by this sink 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:56.190
 41 percent to win just well damn it 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.789
 yes, I was not so upset about someone as 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.579
 in that fight 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:03.170
 but no less master plum me 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:08.340
 pleased and so control on e25 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:10.530
 simply lift zashibennaya and your's 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.030
 your features on your screens yes 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.540
 I have already started talking long ago 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.900
 video quite a long time and so here so 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.520
 here I disguise as you see . 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.900
 I have a painted disguise 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.790
 fully pumped all therefore 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.040
 I should be hiding just fine 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.470
 see I immediately reloaded just now 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.710
 Gold since I got into battle to 8th lvlom 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.290
 and as we see on this flank I'm alone 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.090
 kv-5 creeps back there but more on it 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.360
 no one flank, and as you can see I 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.140
 I just do not climb further I need to press 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.909
 help to you square-1c to klacid these squares 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.600
 just but this is what the doctor says 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.320
 prescribed 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.600
 and as if smarting forward since i 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.710
 I see that 5 cuts off someone and he is now asleep 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:02.610
 already damage them and pull up to 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:06.240
 he was already nadamazhil in thick T32 and immediately 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.880
 went for a pebble that well damn he he already 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.890
 knew that here I was in the light of that 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.709
 less by the way you see there is art in battle and 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.920
 here and here su-14 one she throws me 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:20.370
 lucky you just covered 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.770
 i said i have a disguise yes 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.220
 but I just have no repair at all 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.520
 whom 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.920
 why yes because to me this perk 2 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.100
 perk not to head out this one percent and he 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.710
 just really pointless on ptshke 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.450
 seventh level which is killed with two 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.850
 shots and even from one she often 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.230
 burns she loves to burn this pawn since 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.080
 she's a little compact 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.960
 yes you can see criticism she 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:50.400
 small all internal modules 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:54.150
 very close to each other well she strongly 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:58.830
 too much stuffed too close 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:01.440
 We see as if not stupid until 50 wins 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.990
 Well, everything is fine, but here it leaves 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.540
 alpha slipper 47 percent then even mine 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.800
 there was no reindeer now I already started 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.350
 enjoy well and how would I blunted myself 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.360
 but my next action 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.970
 just be okay with for think you already 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:22.140
 guessed that given this 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.270
 fri-shkara recharges 2 seconds you 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.420
 see I already turned on the sniper scope 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.459
 and wait for the sneakers to roll out in order 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:34.560
 to put it on a caterpillar and i don't 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:37.730
 I realized how I sold 170 and I 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.380
 I realized that he already has just a cd 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.959
 quickly because of extinguishing stock gun 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.970
 see i'm hiding substitute u only 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.090
 he has a stock gun 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.760
 and he would ricochet be it top 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.700
 alpha slipper then he would have punched me easily 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.470
 would be on this board until support is not 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.500
 armored let's say well I so 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:02.790
 I understand I got into the mask once and yes everything 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:06.540
 the rest went to board 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:09.330
 lucky I have already imposed thousands of damage leaked 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.489
 alpha slipper helps art well 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.130
 helps someone 5 i see what they need 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.109
 help and just adore all this company 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.650
 so far i have spent only one gold 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.810
 projectile because the rink goes and so 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:25.380
 tried i wanted to pick this c2 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.400
 but but he did not have time and start to disassemble 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.110
 a game 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:34.910
 game 2 on home ass press see what he 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:37.680
 comes back and i'm let's get out of here ticking 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.120
 just the mobility dynamics of this birdie 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.850
 like a light tank 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:47.729
 it's just great i see that tiger 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:50.009
 coming here and I take him away from him while he 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:52.080
 how would pass away here in order 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:56.039
 To go for 30 deuce apparently on 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.080
 tank the stones ass and therefore it is necessary 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:00.510
 run to go there I get the light from 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.360
 tiger of the second as he enlightened me 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.090
 x-ray I run-run-run for 30 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.650
 deuce it to me for three or four shots 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.260
 so I just don't stop and 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:13.010
 I 'm starting to damage him as we see 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:16.380
 for two shots I took with 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:19.199
 at15 and let's go further because 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.750
 the rear has 2 tiger Meanwhile taip 59 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:24.300
 really got some kind of incomprehensible 50 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.039
 percent wins u dude and i have it 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.810
 I disassemble and he generally us Rodion on 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:32.880
 minimap doesnâ€™t look like many 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:35.760
 players generally see me trying 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:40.440
 hide well with my armor and against 8 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:42.479
 levla it does not help me until it 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.090
 quickly dismantled lucky dream right away 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:48.289
 royal tiger misses me and i 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.289
 clean up and 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:55.199
 You may notice that I do all my damage 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.990
 applied 8 ml oval found them too I 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:01.020
 and I also shot at them all my 200 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:04.919
 thousand and i stay shot for any 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:10.310
 here, but unless you're just here 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:13.450
 this is the moment we clearly met 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:16.760
 it's just an epic 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:20.380
 just hard, I did not expect to see him here 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:23.810
 he did not expect to see me here, too, and 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:27.950
 I see in the chat I write lol because under 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:34.730
 oherel further I think would just watch 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:37.040
 there is no need to understand that the drain is visible 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:40.880
 the results of the battle, I got a master 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:43.100
 got 100 one thousand for this birdie 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.800
 it's pretty much a lot like her 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:50.180
 farm is not such a big farm she 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:52.480
 Well, as it were relatively well but the 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:55.610
 relatively good for 7 left 

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:57.710
 twenty four shots from 24 in 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.980
 one hundred percent hit on intelligence 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:04.250
 even see 500 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:04.760
 Brin I 1 by experience it is understandable so 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.980
 like now 

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.260
 such thing yes for worthy 

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.180
 resistance counted me as 

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.360
 the winner 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:15.080
 that is, I got my pure experience yes 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.420
 like winning 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:20.000
 so I basically like everything 

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:23.710
 except for the percentage of wins on my account and 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.290
 on e25 we see that in general all my team 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:33.830
 really damn did it was and 

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:36.970
 so it is clear because the account that was on 

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:40.280
 scoreboard that moment nevertheless by the way 

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:43.220
 1704 experience yes it is not the maximum 

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:45.740
 just an experience I had on this experience ptshke 

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:48.440
 but for some reason the master would 

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:50.140
 I was given and in this they gave it like this 

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.910
 it's most likely because the drain 

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:56.240
 there would have been that victory knowing was 

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:57.680
 more experience in the one who was waiting for this video 

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.790
 who liked it at all 

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:05.530
 likes subscribe to the channel all 

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:05.530
