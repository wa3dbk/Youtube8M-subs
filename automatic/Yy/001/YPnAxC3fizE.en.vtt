you I think I just forgot but on the
case<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.590> controller<00:02:19.920> came<00:02:20.220> in<00:02:21.380> game

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
case that the controller came in game

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.650 
case that the controller came in game
you<00:02:22.500> might<00:02:22.530> send<00:02:22.980> me<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.220> controller

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
you might send me the controller

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.580 
you might send me the controller

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
that I paid for and it did take about 30

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.570

days<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.320> get<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.590> case<00:02:28.800> in<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.190> me<00:02:29.310> which<00:02:29.460> I

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
days to get the case in to me which I

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.250 
days to get the case in to me which I
was<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:29.820> little<00:02:30.090> upset<00:02:30.180> about<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.780> but<00:02:30.960> once<00:02:31.110> I

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
was a little upset about that but once I

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.410 
was a little upset about that but once I
got<00:02:31.290> it<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:31.710> was<00:02:31.860> happy<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.790> it's<00:02:32.940> kind<00:02:33.150> of<00:02:33.180> hard

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.199 
it's got the press button press spots
for<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.550> buttons<00:02:35.930> it's<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:37.020> nice<00:02:37.140> controller

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
for the buttons it's a nice controller

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.480 
for the buttons it's a nice controller
back<00:02:39.209> to<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.450> FPS<00:02:39.810> freeks<00:02:40.140> like<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:40.830> said<00:02:41.100> once

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
back to the FPS freeks like I said once

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.699 
back to the FPS freeks like I said once
you<00:02:41.610> get<00:02:41.790> used<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.090> using<00:02:42.330> them<00:02:42.570> you<00:02:43.380> can<00:02:43.560> never

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
you get used to using them you can never

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.820 
you get used to using them you can never
go<00:02:43.830> back<00:02:43.980> okay<00:02:44.850> so<00:02:45.390> but<00:02:46.170> when<00:02:46.320> you<00:02:46.410> first<00:02:46.650> try

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
go back okay so but when you first try

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.110 
go back okay so but when you first try
them<00:02:47.040> you're<00:02:47.190> going<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.370> hate<00:02:47.520> them<00:02:47.730> but<00:02:47.880> just

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
trust me stick stick in there and go to

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.660 
trust me stick stick in there and go to
combat<00:02:52.440> training<00:02:52.739> until<00:02:53.070> you<00:02:53.190> get<00:02:53.370> used<00:02:53.520> to

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
combat training until you get used to

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.310 
combat training until you get used to
them<00:02:53.850> once<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:54.570> get<00:02:54.690> used<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:54.989> them<00:02:55.230> it

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
them once you get used to them it

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.010 
them once you get used to them it
definitely<00:02:55.739> helps<00:02:56.010> when<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:56.280> try<00:02:56.459> to<00:02:56.489> stray

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
definitely helps when you try to stray

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.560 
definitely helps when you try to stray
when<00:02:58.020> you<00:02:58.140> try<00:02:58.380> to<00:02:58.489> stab<00:02:59.489> you<00:02:59.910> definitely<00:03:00.450> got

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
when you try to stab you definitely got

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.690 
when you try to stab you definitely got
a<00:03:00.600> vantage<00:03:01.320> on<00:03:01.650> people<00:03:01.950> when<00:03:02.070> you<00:03:02.220> go<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.400> staff

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
a vantage on people when you go to staff

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.120 
a vantage on people when you go to staff
that's<00:03:03.000> for<00:03:03.209> sure<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.600> panic<00:03:03.900> knife<00:03:04.080> I<00:03:04.350> don't

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
that's for sure the panic knife I don't

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.320 
that's for sure the panic knife I don't
know<00:03:05.190> how<00:03:05.340> many<00:03:05.370> people<00:03:05.580> have<00:03:05.880> been<00:03:06.000> able<00:03:06.150> to

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
know how many people have been able to

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.660 
know how many people have been able to
paint<00:03:06.510> nice<00:03:06.780> quicker<00:03:07.080> than<00:03:07.260> you<00:03:07.410> then<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.430> used

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
paint nice quicker than you then I used

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.590 
paint nice quicker than you then I used
to<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:11.010> black<00:03:11.250> directional<00:03:11.820> button<00:03:12.390> on<00:03:12.480> this

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
to the black directional button on this

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.720 
to the black directional button on this
controller<00:03:13.020> by<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.650> way<00:03:13.890> is<00:03:14.160> a<00:03:14.190> lot<00:03:14.520> better

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
controller by the way is a lot better

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.780 
controller by the way is a lot better
than<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.120> normal<00:03:15.390> controller<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.110> I<00:03:17.040> really

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
than the normal controller and I really

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.390 
than the normal controller and I really
enjoy<00:03:18.090> using<00:03:18.299> this<00:03:18.570> one<00:03:18.810> definitely<00:03:19.799> so

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400
