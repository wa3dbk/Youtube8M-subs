if you hold shift you're actually able

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.490 
to pre make the captain walk around
actually<00:02:52.980> preset<00:02:53.880> items<00:02:54.299> so<00:02:54.989> you<00:02:55.079> won't<00:02:55.380> even

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
actually preset items so you won't even

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.810 
actually preset items so you won't even
have<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:55.920> do<00:02:56.100> it<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:56.340> could<00:02:56.459> be<00:02:56.579> zooming

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
have to do it you could be zooming

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.009 
have to do it you could be zooming
around<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.150> screen<00:02:57.390> he'll<00:02:57.660> still<00:02:57.900> be

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
around the screen he'll still be

around the screen he'll still be
building<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:59.130> way<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.400> makes<00:02:59.430> it<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.760> little

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
building that way it makes it a little

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.229 
building that way it makes it a little
bit<00:02:59.970> easier<00:03:00.120> on<00:03:00.329> your<00:03:01.049> end<00:03:01.820> solar<00:03:02.820> collectors

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
bit easier on your end solar collectors

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.270 
bit easier on your end solar collectors
always<00:03:03.510> keep<00:03:03.660> them<00:03:03.780> on<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.170> all<00:03:04.260> that<00:03:04.470> if<00:03:05.190> you

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
always keep them on and all that if you

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.130 
always keep them on and all that if you
ever<00:03:05.310> shut<00:03:05.640> hang<00:03:05.850> your<00:03:06.239> off<00:03:06.390> you're

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
ever shut hang your off you're

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.610 
ever shut hang your off you're
going<00:03:07.319> to<00:03:07.380> be<00:03:07.470> doomed<00:03:07.739> probably<00:03:08.400> but<00:03:09.350> me<00:03:10.350> I

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
going to be doomed probably but me I

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.470 
going to be doomed probably but me I
haven't<00:03:11.010> had<00:03:11.160> very<00:03:11.310> much<00:03:11.489> trouble<00:03:11.940> okay<00:03:12.329> your

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
haven't had very much trouble okay your

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.110 
haven't had very much trouble okay your
solar<00:03:12.720> collectors<00:03:13.140> once<00:03:13.590> they're<00:03:13.799> built

solar collectors once they're built

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.240 
solar collectors once they're built
they're<00:03:15.120> going<00:03:15.269> to<00:03:15.329> look<00:03:15.510> like<00:03:15.540> that<00:03:16.250> that's

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
they're going to look like that that's

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.479 
they're going to look like that that's
if<00:03:17.430> you're<00:03:17.579> on<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.760> course<00:03:18.030> ID<00:03:18.299> and<00:03:18.569> your

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
if you're on the course ID and your

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.879 
if you're on the course ID and your
commander<00:03:20.489> will<00:03:20.760> look<00:03:20.940> like<00:03:21.090> this<00:03:21.530> okay<00:03:22.530> metal

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
commander will look like this okay metal

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:24.830 
commander will look like this okay metal
extractor<00:03:23.340> when<00:03:23.609> fully<00:03:23.970> done<00:03:24.239> all<00:03:24.389> kind<00:03:24.810> of

extractor when fully done all kind of

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.660 
extractor when fully done all kind of

like that there we go that's a fully

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
done metal extractor that actually picks

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.820 
done metal extractor that actually picks
up<00:03:29.760> metal<00:03:30.180> I'm<00:03:30.690> doing<00:03:30.959> a<00:03:31.049> full<00:03:31.260> metal<00:03:31.440> arena

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
up metal I'm doing a full metal arena

up metal I'm doing a full metal arena
just<00:03:32.099> to<00:03:32.190> show<00:03:32.370> you<00:03:32.430> how<00:03:33.330> quick<00:03:33.659> you<00:03:33.930> can

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
just to show you how quick you can

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.350 
just to show you how quick you can
actually<00:03:34.530> build<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:34.860> stuff<00:03:35.099> because<00:03:35.760> on<00:03:36.180> an

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
actually build the stuff because on an

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.089 
actually build the stuff because on an
old<00:03:36.510> map<00:03:36.810> you<00:03:37.019> won't<00:03:37.230> be<00:03:37.349> doing<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.650> too<00:03:37.890> damn

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
old map you won't be doing a too damn

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:43.280 
old map you won't be doing a too damn
quick<00:03:38.459> I<00:03:39.650> hate<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:40.879> say<00:03:41.879> this<00:03:42.000> but<00:03:42.290> making

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
quick I hate to say this but making

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.190 
quick I hate to say this but making
metal<00:03:43.769> and<00:03:43.890> energy<00:03:44.280> at<00:03:44.819> a<00:03:44.879> pretty<00:03:45.450> decent

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
metal and energy at a pretty decent

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.089 
metal and energy at a pretty decent
amount<00:03:46.470> is<00:03:46.680> not<00:03:47.579> an<00:03:48.000> easy<00:03:48.150> feat<00:03:48.829> some<00:03:49.829> of<00:03:49.950> you

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
amount is not an easy feat some of you

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:54.830 
amount is not an easy feat some of you
probably<00:03:50.519> already<00:03:50.760> know<00:03:51.180> that<00:03:52.730> okay<00:03:53.840> after

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
probably already know that okay after

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.619 
probably already know that okay after
you<00:03:54.989> have<00:03:55.400> your<00:03:56.400> guys<00:03:56.610> set<00:03:57.000> to<00:03:57.150> make<00:03:57.239> the<00:03:57.299> five

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
you have your guys set to make the five

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:00.890 
you have your guys set to make the five
set<00:03:58.470> them<00:03:58.590> to<00:03:58.620> make<00:03:58.950> three<00:03:59.489> more<00:03:59.790> so<00:04:00.420> then

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
set them to make three more so then

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.119 
set them to make three more so then
you'll<00:04:01.049> end<00:04:01.260> up<00:04:01.349> with<00:04:01.500> a<00:04:01.560> total<00:04:01.769> of<00:04:01.950> eight

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
you'll end up with a total of eight

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.729 
you'll end up with a total of eight

metal extractors and right after he's

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.080 
metal extractors and right after he's
getting<00:04:05.010> done<00:04:05.159> with<00:04:05.280> those<00:04:05.370> metal<00:04:05.640> extractors

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.150 
little bit ahead of myself but it's
always<00:04:14.940> better<00:04:15.209> to<00:04:15.299> be<00:04:15.420> ahead<00:04:15.629> than<00:04:16.079> behind<00:04:16.160> on

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
always better to be ahead than behind on

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.800 
always better to be ahead than behind on
this<00:04:17.310> game<00:04:17.579> because<00:04:17.820> people<00:04:18.269> can<00:04:18.419> attack<00:04:18.690> at

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
this game because people can attack at

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.810 
this game because people can attack at
any<00:04:18.870> time<00:04:19.820> also<00:04:20.820> make<00:04:21.419> an<00:04:21.600> aircraft<00:04:22.199> plant

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
any time also make an aircraft plant

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.080 
any time also make an aircraft plant
because<00:04:23.820> that<00:04:24.539> will<00:04:24.720> also<00:04:25.560> increase<00:04:25.940> just<00:04:26.940> how

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
because that will also increase just how

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.659 
because that will also increase just how
good<00:04:27.300> your<00:04:27.479> guy<00:04:27.630> can<00:04:27.979> actually<00:04:28.979> start<00:04:29.250> going

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
good your guy can actually start going

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.270 
good your guy can actually start going
aircraft<00:04:30.600> plants<00:04:30.990> are<00:04:31.110> very<00:04:31.470> good<00:04:31.770> because

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
aircraft plants are very good because

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.310 
aircraft plants are very good because
the<00:04:32.460> level<00:04:32.729> ones<00:04:32.940> and<00:04:33.210> level<00:04:33.449> twos<00:04:33.630> well<00:04:34.260> of

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
the level ones and level twos well of

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.379 
the level ones and level twos well of
course<00:04:34.410> they're<00:04:35.190> flying<00:04:35.550> which<00:04:35.940> means<00:04:36.180> they

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
course they're flying which means they

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.659 
course they're flying which means they
can<00:04:36.539> go<00:04:36.660> above<00:04:37.020> everything<00:04:37.470> else<00:04:37.740> and<00:04:38.010> they

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
can go above everything else and they

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.490 
can go above everything else and they
can<00:04:38.849> build<00:04:39.120> your<00:04:39.300> stuff<00:04:39.570> from<00:04:39.840> above<00:04:40.229> where

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
can build your stuff from above where

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.290 
can build your stuff from above where
your<00:04:40.680> ground<00:04:40.949> units<00:04:41.340> are<00:04:41.550> which<00:04:42.210> means

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
your ground units are which means

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.770 
your ground units are which means
they're<00:04:42.599> going<00:04:42.720> to<00:04:42.780> be<00:04:42.870> a<00:04:42.900> great<00:04:43.410> asset<00:04:43.710> to<00:04:44.010> you

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
they're going to be a great asset to you

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.839 
they're going to be a great asset to you
now<00:04:45.780> I've<00:04:46.440> actually<00:04:46.800> had<00:04:47.070> a<00:04:47.130> few<00:04:47.400> my<00:04:47.520> friends

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:47.849 
now I've actually had a few my friends

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:50.570 
now I've actually had a few my friends
comment<00:04:48.300> to<00:04:49.050> me<00:04:49.199> before<00:04:49.380> saying<00:04:50.010> that<00:04:50.340> my

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
comment to me before saying that my

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.689 
comment to me before saying that my
tactic<00:04:51.030> doesn't<00:04:51.389> work<00:04:51.570> very<00:04:51.599> good<00:04:52.349> but<00:04:53.340> it

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
tactic doesn't work very good but it

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:56.210 
tactic doesn't work very good but it
does<00:04:54.150> if<00:04:54.510> you<00:04:54.840> actually<00:04:54.990> try<00:04:55.410> it<00:04:55.470> you'll<00:04:55.919> see

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
does if you actually try it you'll see

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.460 
does if you actually try it you'll see
and<00:04:56.520> as<00:04:57.360> you<00:04:57.570> probably<00:04:57.690> notice<00:04:58.139> I'm<00:04:58.289> actually

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
and as you probably notice I'm actually

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.770 
and as you probably notice I'm actually
building<00:04:58.919> quite<00:04:59.250> quickly<00:04:59.610> I<00:04:59.940> don't<00:05:00.570> know<00:05:00.660> if

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
building quite quickly I don't know if

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.210 
building quite quickly I don't know if
you've<00:05:00.930> actually<00:05:01.169> ever<00:05:01.500> played<00:05:01.830> this<00:05:01.979> game

00:06:01.549 --> 00:06:01.559 
going to run into a lot of trouble I've

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:04.489 
going to run into a lot of trouble I've
actually<00:06:01.860> had<00:06:02.189> trouble<00:06:02.549> before<00:06:02.909> but<00:06:03.209> after<00:06:04.199> I

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:04.499 
actually had trouble before but after I

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:06.409 
actually had trouble before but after I
figure<00:06:04.739> out<00:06:04.860> this<00:06:04.979> tactic<00:06:05.429> I<00:06:05.639> haven't<00:06:06.119> had<00:06:06.269> it

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419 
figure out this tactic I haven't had it

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:09.799 
figure out this tactic I haven't had it
sense<00:06:07.369> all<00:06:08.369> you<00:06:08.549> got<00:06:08.699> to<00:06:08.729> do<00:06:08.879> is<00:06:08.909> really<00:06:09.539> keep

00:06:11.929 --> 00:06:14.059 
up on the middle keep up on the energy
