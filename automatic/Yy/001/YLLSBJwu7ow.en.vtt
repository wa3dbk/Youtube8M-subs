keep doing it even standing still just
clipping<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.030> clicking<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.990> also<00:01:16.740> as<00:01:17.310> you

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
clipping and clicking and also as you

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.070 
clipping and clicking and also as you
get<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> little<00:01:17.729> bit<00:01:17.939> more<00:01:18.119> advanced<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:18.930> your

click on leg and practice pulling and
pushing<00:02:46.390> it's<00:02:47.050> important<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:47.590> find<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.860> right

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
pushing it's important to find the right

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.270 
pushing it's important to find the right
gear<00:02:48.220> as<00:02:48.400> well<00:02:48.430> so<00:02:49.390> you<00:02:49.450> can<00:02:49.540> try<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:49.930> maintain

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
gear as well so you can try to maintain

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.580 
gear as well so you can try to maintain
constantly<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.670> chain<00:02:51.970> intention<00:02:52.780> so<00:02:53.530> you

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
constantly the chain intention so you

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.730 
constantly the chain intention so you
try<00:02:53.890> to<00:02:53.950> have<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.910> feel<00:02:55.180> of<00:02:55.470> feeling<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.590> old

toned<00:03:04.990> up<00:03:05.230> and<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:06.250> chain<00:03:06.550> intention<00:03:07.450> you

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
toned up and the chain intention you

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.020 
toned up and the chain intention you
know<00:03:08.140> then<00:03:08.860> you<00:03:08.980> unclick<00:03:09.280> one<00:03:09.489> you<00:03:09.700> click<00:03:09.910> the

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
know then you unclick one you click the

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.590 
know then you unclick one you click the
other<00:03:10.150> one<00:03:10.390> in<00:03:11.140> and<00:03:11.440> and<00:03:12.250> so<00:03:12.700> on<00:03:12.850> it's<00:03:13.360> a<00:03:13.420> very

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
other one in and and so on it's a very

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.770 
other one in and and so on it's a very
good<00:03:13.780> practice<00:03:14.170> it<00:03:14.350> makes<00:03:14.500> you<00:03:14.620> realize<00:03:15.780> the

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
good practice it makes you realize the

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.140 
good practice it makes you realize the
advantage<00:03:17.260> of<00:03:17.350> having<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.830> clipless<00:03:18.670> pedal
