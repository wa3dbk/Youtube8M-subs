00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
pretty soon so that was a good thing

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.550 
pretty soon so that was a good thing
about<00:04:29.580> this<00:04:29.819> chapter<00:04:30.330> I<00:04:30.569> was<00:04:31.199> under<00:04:31.409> the

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
about this chapter I was under the

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.399 
about this chapter I was under the
impression<00:04:31.710> that<00:04:32.479> Toby<00:04:33.479> was<00:04:33.509> just<00:04:33.900> using<00:04:34.110> some

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:34.409 
impression that Toby was just using some

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:37.850 
impression that Toby was just using some
kind<00:04:34.470> of<00:04:35.090> teleportation<00:04:36.090> jutsu<00:04:36.509> right<00:04:37.080> but

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
kind of teleportation jutsu right but

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.770 
kind of teleportation jutsu right but
only<00:04:38.009> transported<00:04:38.879> a<00:04:38.909> certain<00:04:39.240> portion<00:04:39.449> of

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
only transported a certain portion of

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.950 
only transported a certain portion of
his<00:04:39.900> body<00:04:40.039> so<00:04:41.039> that<00:04:41.069> you<00:04:41.580> when<00:04:42.330> you<00:04:42.449> see<00:04:42.690> him

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
his body so that you when you see him

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.399 
his body so that you when you see him
he's<00:04:43.470> really<00:04:43.800> just<00:04:44.009> only<00:04:44.750> some<00:04:45.750> of<00:04:45.780> his<00:04:46.080> body

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:46.409 
he's really just only some of his body

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:48.379 
he's really just only some of his body
parts<00:04:46.560> is<00:04:47.009> there<00:04:47.220> like<00:04:47.490> some<00:04:47.759> of<00:04:47.879> these<00:04:47.940> atoms

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
parts is there like some of these atoms

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:49.580 
parts is there like some of these atoms
or<00:04:48.539> something<00:04:48.780> like<00:04:48.840> that<00:04:48.900> is<00:04:49.169> really<00:04:49.319> there

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
or something like that is really there

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.559 
or something like that is really there
so<00:04:50.129> all<00:04:50.370> the<00:04:50.580> rest<00:04:50.759> of<00:04:50.849> his<00:04:50.909> body<00:04:51.060> somewhere

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:51.569 
so all the rest of his body somewhere

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:53.330 
so all the rest of his body somewhere
else<00:04:51.750> and<00:04:51.870> that's<00:04:52.289> why<00:04:52.440> you<00:04:52.500> can<00:04:52.710> pass<00:04:52.949> storm

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
else and that's why you can pass storm

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.059 
else and that's why you can pass storm
that's<00:04:53.759> what<00:04:53.940> I<00:04:54.000> was<00:04:54.210> under<00:04:54.500> suspicion<00:04:55.500> of<00:04:55.919> I

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:56.069 
that's what I was under suspicion of I

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:57.559 
that's what I was under suspicion of I
maybe<00:04:56.280> I<00:04:56.370> oughta<00:04:56.520> see<00:04:56.789> to<00:04:57.000> keep<00:04:57.180> you<00:04:57.479> can

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:57.569 
maybe I oughta see to keep you can

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:00.439 
maybe I oughta see to keep you can
teleport<00:04:58.050> but<00:04:58.979> and<00:04:59.610> I<00:05:00.030> thought<00:05:00.210> that<00:05:00.330> was

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 
teleport but and I thought that was

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:03.260 
teleport but and I thought that was
already<00:05:00.750> revealed<00:05:01.229> and<00:05:01.590> all<00:05:02.310> to<00:05:02.580> like<00:05:02.759> in<00:05:02.969> some

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
already revealed and all to like in some

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.260 
already revealed and all to like in some
earlier<00:05:03.419> chapters<00:05:04.400> but<00:05:05.400> maybe<00:05:05.669> I'm<00:05:05.969> mistaken

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
earlier chapters but maybe I'm mistaken

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.820 
earlier chapters but maybe I'm mistaken
about<00:05:06.750> I<00:05:06.840> thought<00:05:07.289> that<00:05:07.469> was<00:05:07.560> already

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
about I thought that was already

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.209 
about I thought that was already
revealed<00:05:08.310> so<00:05:09.090> when<00:05:09.479> uh<00:05:09.710> Kakashi<00:05:10.710> said<00:05:11.039> you're

00:05:11.209 --> 00:05:11.219 
revealed so when uh Kakashi said you're

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:13.070 
revealed so when uh Kakashi said you're
only<00:05:11.310> using<00:05:11.490> one<00:05:11.699> jutsu<00:05:12.090> I<00:05:12.539> thought<00:05:13.020> that

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
only using one jutsu I thought that

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.990 
only using one jutsu I thought that
sounded<00:05:13.620> pretty<00:05:13.860> obvious<00:05:14.400> because<00:05:14.550> I<00:05:14.699> thought

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
sounded pretty obvious because I thought

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.879 
sounded pretty obvious because I thought
that<00:05:15.240> was<00:05:15.360> revealed<00:05:15.780> before<00:05:15.990> but<00:05:16.500> maybe<00:05:16.680> I'm

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:16.889 
that was revealed before but maybe I'm

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:18.950 
that was revealed before but maybe I'm
wrong<00:05:17.099> now<00:05:17.849> that<00:05:18.300> we<00:05:18.419> got<00:05:18.449> this<00:05:18.750> little

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
wrong now that we got this little

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.629 
wrong now that we got this little
revelation<00:05:19.440> and<00:05:19.860> we<00:05:19.949> know<00:05:20.159> that<00:05:20.190> this<00:05:20.460> won't

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
revelation and we know that this won't

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.600 
revelation and we know that this won't
build<00:05:20.909> up<00:05:21.120> in<00:05:21.270> to<00:05:21.360> talk<00:05:21.569> no<00:05:21.870> be<00:05:22.280> tall<00:05:23.280> no

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
build up in to talk no be tall no

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.089 
build up in to talk no be tall no
because<00:05:24.060> I'm<00:05:24.629> up<00:05:24.810> here<00:05:25.940> Toby's<00:05:26.940> identity<00:05:28.099> Dave

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:29.099 
because I'm up here Toby's identity Dave

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:30.950 
because I'm up here Toby's identity Dave
good<00:05:29.520> I<00:05:29.550> get<00:05:30.060> this<00:05:30.210> feeling<00:05:30.270> like<00:05:30.599> they<00:05:30.750> gonna

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
good I get this feeling like they gonna

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.420 
good I get this feeling like they gonna
switch<00:05:31.199> over<00:05:31.380> to<00:05:31.500> something<00:05:31.860> else<00:05:31.979> late<00:05:32.219> been
