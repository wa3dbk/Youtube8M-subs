hands on an early copy of WRC now I had
a<00:00:08.580> quick<00:00:08.820> go<00:00:09.000> on<00:00:09.059> this<00:00:09.240> game<00:00:09.510> back<00:00:10.050> when<00:00:10.080> we

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
a quick go on this game back when we

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.520 
a quick go on this game back when we
went<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.830> landing<00:00:11.250> in<00:00:11.670> July<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:13.139> only

went to the landing in July and I only
looked<00:00:13.799> at<00:00:13.889> it<00:00:14.040> so<00:00:14.250> far<00:00:14.519> I'd<00:00:14.670> say<00:00:14.700> today<00:00:14.880> just<00:00:15.450> a

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
looked at it so far I'd say today just a

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.240 
looked at it so far I'd say today just a
quick<00:00:15.719> preview<00:00:15.960> for<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.590> before<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:16.949> get<00:00:17.130> to

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
quick preview for you before I get to

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.099 
quick preview for you before I get to
work<00:00:17.430> on<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.760> review<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.300> working<00:00:18.960> my<00:00:19.080> way

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
work on the review and working my way

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.230 
work on the review and working my way
through<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.650> game

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
through the game

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.519 
through the game
it's<00:00:21.240> definitely<00:00:21.449> leaning<00:00:21.930> towards<00:00:22.320> an

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
it's definitely leaning towards an

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.220 
it's definitely leaning towards an
arcade<00:00:22.920> style<00:00:23.340> more<00:00:24.330> than<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.660> simulations

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
arcade style more than a simulations

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.839 
arcade style more than a simulations
file<00:00:25.500> I<00:00:25.680> think<00:00:25.890> simulation<00:00:26.430> fans<00:00:26.670> who<00:00:26.820> are

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
file I think simulation fans who are

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.880 
file I think simulation fans who are
used<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.480> Richard<00:00:27.869> burns<00:00:28.050> rally<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.740> this

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
used to the Richard burns rally of this

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.800 
used to the Richard burns rally of this
world<00:00:29.160> are<00:00:29.429> probably<00:00:29.699> not<00:00:29.880> going<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.119> be<00:00:30.300> blown

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
world are probably not going to be blown

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.299 
world are probably not going to be blown
away<00:00:30.960> by<00:00:31.260> this<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:31.920> think<00:00:32.040> also

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
away by this and I think also

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.549 
away by this and I think also
graphically<00:00:33.180> as<00:00:33.300> well<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:34.079> thing<00:00:34.290> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
graphically as well the thing the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.709 
graphically as well the thing the
impressions<00:00:35.070> are<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.730> was<00:00:35.850> making<00:00:36.270> big<00:00:36.450> steps

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
impressions are it was making big steps

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.510 
impressions are it was making big steps
forward<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:37.110> July<00:00:37.440> but<00:00:37.920> they've<00:00:38.070> not<00:00:38.250> really

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
forward in July but they've not really

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.760 
forward in July but they've not really
moved<00:00:38.969> on<00:00:39.420> from<00:00:39.690> there<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:40.440> it's<00:00:40.590> still

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
moved on from there and so it's still

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.530 
moved on from there and so it's still
got<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.980> slightly<00:00:41.309> dated<00:00:41.610> look<00:00:41.940> when<00:00:42.450> you

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
got a slightly dated look when you

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.850 
got a slightly dated look when you
compare<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.050> some<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.440> bigger<00:00:43.620> rivals

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
compare it to some of the bigger rivals

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.610 
compare it to some of the bigger rivals
such<00:00:44.309> as<00:00:44.539> -<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.780> think<00:00:46.289> one<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.440> my<00:00:46.530> biggest

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
such as - I think one of my biggest

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.310 
such as - I think one of my biggest
concerns<00:00:47.270> early<00:00:48.270> on<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.690> think<00:00:48.899> if<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.079> look<00:00:49.200> at

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
concerns early on I think if you look at

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.139 
concerns early on I think if you look at
Richard<00:00:49.590> burns<00:00:49.860> rally<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.489> say<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.789> game<00:00:51.000> like

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
Richard burns rally and say a game like

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.209 
Richard burns rally and say a game like
Gran<00:00:51.360> Turismo<00:00:51.510> 5<00:00:51.960> use<00:00:52.770> them<00:00:52.920> where<00:00:53.039> they<00:00:53.100> can

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
Gran Turismo 5 use them where they can

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.619 
Gran Turismo 5 use them where they can
try<00:00:53.340> play<00:00:53.610> them<00:00:53.760> with<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.910> control<00:00:54.210> pad<00:00:54.420> and

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
try play them with a control pad and

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.420 
try play them with a control pad and
you're<00:00:55.440> not<00:00:55.590> really<00:00:55.770> getting<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.129> feeling

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
you're not really getting the feeling

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.250 
you're not really getting the feeling
you<00:00:56.910> know<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.149> get<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.570> get<00:00:57.660> nothing<00:00:58.050> from<00:00:58.170> it

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
you know you get you get nothing from it

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.560 
you know you get you get nothing from it
at<00:00:58.410> all<00:00:58.559> use<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.160> wheel<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.879> game<00:01:00.059> comes<00:01:00.359> to

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
at all use a wheel and the game comes to

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.260 
at all use a wheel and the game comes to
life<00:01:00.780> like<00:01:01.350> my<00:01:01.710> biggest<00:01:01.949> concerns<00:01:02.550> with<00:01:02.820> WRC

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
life like my biggest concerns with WRC

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.780 
life like my biggest concerns with WRC
is<00:01:03.960> user<00:01:04.290> pad<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.979> game<00:01:05.159> comes<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.610> life

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
is user pad and the game comes to life

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.820 
is user pad and the game comes to life
use<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> wheel<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.020> there's<00:01:07.470> something

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
use a wheel and there's something

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.320 
use a wheel and there's something
missing<00:01:08.250> from<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.880> couple<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.210> issues

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
missing from it and a couple of issues

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.359 
missing from it and a couple of issues
I've<00:01:09.630> found<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.080> far<00:01:10.320> I've<00:01:10.710> been<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:11.040> do<00:01:11.189> with

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
I've found so far I've been to do with

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.840 
I've found so far I've been to do with
steering<00:01:11.729> under<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.960> oversteer<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.890> braking

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
steering under and oversteer and braking

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.730 
steering under and oversteer and braking
a<00:01:15.030> high<00:01:15.210> speed<00:01:15.570> as<00:01:15.750> well<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.140> car<00:01:16.350> seems<00:01:16.590> to

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
a high speed as well the car seems to

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.469 
a high speed as well the car seems to
just<00:01:16.890> slide<00:01:17.310> out<00:01:17.460> when<00:01:17.700> braking<00:01:18.210> but<00:01:18.390> I'm

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
just slide out when braking but I'm

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.580 
just slide out when braking but I'm
going<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.659> show<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.930> couple<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.350> sections
