00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
at a bunch of different options and I

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.269 
at a bunch of different options and I
decided<00:00:23.400> mainly<00:00:23.910> because<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.300> price<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:25.279> the

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.060 
and some honing oil the perks of this is
like<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.510> said<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.079> guide<00:00:43.410> system<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:43.980> if

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
like I said it is a guide system so if

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.400 
like I said it is a guide system so if
you're<00:00:44.190> not<00:00:44.309> very<00:00:44.489> good<00:00:44.820> at<00:00:44.969> keeping<00:00:45.020> a<00:00:46.489> degree

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
you're not very good at keeping a degree

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.569 
you're not very good at keeping a degree
steady<00:00:50.000> then<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.360> have<00:00:51.750> these<00:00:52.260> set<00:00:52.710> angles<00:00:53.399> of

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
steady then you have these set angles of

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.069 
steady then you have these set angles of
17<00:00:54.120> 20<00:00:54.629> 25<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.530> 30<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.100> then<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.090> simply<00:00:57.570> take

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
17 20 25 and 30 and then you simply take

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.500 
17 20 25 and 30 and then you simply take
one<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.469> these<00:00:58.559> guide<00:00:58.920> rods<00:01:00.890> insert<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.100> into

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
one of these guide rods insert it into

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.310 
one of these guide rods insert it into
the<00:01:03.510> stone<00:01:04.640> what's<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.790> on<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.030> table<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:07.049> can

you<00:01:07.409> tighten<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.979> down<00:01:09.619> and<00:01:10.619> all<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.890> would

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.039 
you tighten it down and all you would
have<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.220> do<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.729> set<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.540> whichever<00:01:12.810> angle

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
have to do is set it in whichever angle

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.080 
have to do is set it in whichever angle
you<00:01:13.350> want<00:01:13.500> with<00:01:13.860> your<00:01:13.979> knife<00:01:14.130> clamped<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.790> and

to use these and you have a lot of guys
they<00:01:24.689> go<00:01:24.869> like<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:25.290> do<00:01:26.220> not<00:01:26.250> do<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.240> you

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
they go like this do not do this you

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.580 
they go like this do not do this you
don't<00:01:28.140> come<00:01:28.530> down<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.360> edge<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.350> go

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
don't come down on the edge you you go

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.880 
don't come down on the edge you you go
up<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.159> if<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.210> have<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.960> can<00:01:34.110> go<00:01:34.290> up<00:01:34.560> and

up and if you have to you can go up and

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.190 
up and if you have to you can go up and
then<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.430> lift<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.090> that's<00:01:36.780> how<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.049> would

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
then you lift and that's how you would

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.469 
then you lift and that's how you would
do<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.439> or<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:38.070> found<00:01:38.610> with<00:01:38.790> smaller<00:01:39.030> blades<00:01:39.360> you

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
do it or I found with smaller blades you

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.149 
do it or I found with smaller blades you
can<00:01:39.600> go<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.869> kind<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.200> just<00:01:40.350> make<00:01:40.530> an<00:01:40.680> arcing

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
can go and kind of just make an arcing

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.760 
can go and kind of just make an arcing
motion<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.729> works<00:01:41.939> good<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.720> way<00:01:42.930> too<00:01:42.990> but

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
motion that works good that way too but

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.830 
motion that works good that way too but
don't<00:01:44.009> don't<00:01:44.369> go<00:01:44.549> like<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.939> unless<00:01:45.509> you're

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
don't don't go like that unless you're

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.359 
don't don't go like that unless you're
trying<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.140> like<00:01:46.259> change<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.829> angle<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.250> a

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
trying to like change the angle of a

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.149 
trying to like change the angle of a
blade<00:01:48.590> so<00:01:49.759> this<00:01:50.759> one<00:01:51.590> you'll<00:01:52.590> see<00:01:52.860> them<00:01:52.979> online

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
about $35 it shows that this thing has a

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.139 
about $35 it shows that this thing has a
notch<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.990> end<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.500> clamp<00:02:04.920> for<00:02:05.790> small

to me they got back to me in about six
hours<00:02:17.190> so<00:02:17.580> good<00:02:17.760> support<00:02:18.530> they<00:02:19.530> don't<00:02:19.800> have

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
hours so good support they don't have

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.740 
hours so good support they don't have
that<00:02:20.280> anymore<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:20.760> don't<00:02:21.000> be<00:02:21.330> worried<00:02:21.630> if<00:02:21.720> you

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
that anymore so don't be worried if you

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.950 
that anymore so don't be worried if you
don't<00:02:21.990> have<00:02:22.140> that<00:02:22.760> another<00:02:23.760> little<00:02:24.120> thing<00:02:24.480> I

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
don't have that another little thing I

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.280 
don't have that another little thing I
have<00:02:25.080> found<00:02:25.320> that<00:02:25.530> this<00:02:26.630> clamp<00:02:27.630> design<00:02:28.020> has<00:02:28.260> a

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
have found that this clamp design has a

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.920 
have found that this clamp design has a
couple<00:02:28.980> problems<00:02:29.400> one<00:02:29.670> when<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.540> clamp<00:02:30.810> a

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
couple problems one when you clamp a

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.640 
couple problems one when you clamp a
blade<00:02:31.170> down<00:02:31.350> blades<00:02:32.100> tend<00:02:32.460> to<00:02:32.550> slip

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
blade down blades tend to slip

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.710 
blade down blades tend to slip
side-to-side<00:02:34.700> inside<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.940> clamp<00:02:36.240> so<00:02:36.480> take

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
side-to-side inside the clamp so take

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.780 
side-to-side inside the clamp so take
some<00:02:36.960> electrical<00:02:37.470> tape<00:02:37.500> or<00:02:37.950> in<00:02:38.040> my<00:02:38.190> case<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.610> put

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
some electrical tape or in my case I put

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.880 
some electrical tape or in my case I put
some<00:02:39.000> Gorilla<00:02:39.420> Tape<00:02:39.590> or<00:02:40.590> you<00:02:40.650> could<00:02:40.770> use

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
some Gorilla Tape or you could use

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.670 
some Gorilla Tape or you could use
masking<00:02:41.280> tape<00:02:41.340> on<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:42.630> inside<00:02:43.050> so<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:43.410> get<00:02:43.650> a

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
masking tape on the inside so you get a

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.790 
masking tape on the inside so you get a
little<00:02:43.890> bit<00:02:44.010> more<00:02:44.160> um<00:02:45.350> friction<00:02:46.350> in<00:02:46.500> there<00:02:46.620> and

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
little bit more um friction in there and

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.370 
little bit more um friction in there and
grip<00:02:47.240> another<00:02:48.240> problem<00:02:48.630> I<00:02:48.660> have<00:02:48.840> if<00:02:49.080> you<00:02:49.170> have

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
grip another problem I have if you have

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.400 
grip another problem I have if you have
a<00:02:49.980> thin<00:02:50.790> blade<00:02:51.209> it's<00:02:51.870> not<00:02:52.080> so<00:02:52.230> much<00:02:52.350> about

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
a thin blade it's not so much about

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.350 
a thin blade it's not so much about
length<00:02:52.860> although<00:02:53.190> linkit<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.910> length<00:02:54.090> is<00:02:54.300> a

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
length although linkit the length is a

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.670 
length although linkit the length is a
problem<00:02:54.990> let's<00:02:55.560> take<00:02:56.780> this<00:02:57.780> glock<00:02:58.140> blade<00:02:58.440> for

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
problem let's take this glock blade for

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.550 
problem let's take this glock blade for
example<00:02:59.190> if<00:02:59.940> you<00:03:00.030> put<00:03:00.240> it<00:03:00.360> in<00:03:00.510> here<00:03:00.810> you're

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
example if you put it in here you're

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.230 
example if you put it in here you're
gonna<00:03:01.680> have<00:03:01.740> to<00:03:02.010> move<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.490> blade<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:03.030> same

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
gonna have to move the blade the same

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.050 
gonna have to move the blade the same
with<00:03:03.420> like<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.570> kitchen<00:03:03.870> knife<00:03:04.459> that<00:03:05.459> this<00:03:05.910> is

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
with like a kitchen knife that this is

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.890 
with like a kitchen knife that this is
not<00:03:06.209> good<00:03:06.510> for<00:03:06.720> long<00:03:07.370> big<00:03:08.370> blades<00:03:08.760> but<00:03:09.750> I

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
not good for long big blades but I

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.840 
not good for long big blades but I
didn't<00:03:10.170> buy<00:03:10.290> it<00:03:10.350> for<00:03:10.590> that<00:03:10.709> but<00:03:11.340> getting<00:03:11.670> back

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
didn't buy it for that but getting back

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.460 
didn't buy it for that but getting back
to<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.090> another<00:03:12.690> problem<00:03:13.110> is<00:03:14.000> with<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.120> thin

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
to the another problem is with the thin

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.449 
to the another problem is with the thin
blades<00:03:16.850> if<00:03:17.850> you<00:03:18.720> can<00:03:18.870> see<00:03:19.110> right<00:03:19.320> here<00:03:19.530> you<00:03:20.250> see

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
blades if you can see right here you see

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.940 
blades if you can see right here you see
that<00:03:20.519> shiny<00:03:20.940> bit<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:22.200> problem<00:03:22.500> is<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:22.709> can't

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
that shiny bit the problem is you can't

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.280 
that shiny bit the problem is you can't
get<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.160> blade<00:03:23.400> far<00:03:23.730> enough<00:03:23.970> out<00:03:24.150> from<00:03:25.140> the

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
get the blade far enough out from the

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.710 
get the blade far enough out from the
clamp<00:03:25.650> so<00:03:26.010> you<00:03:26.430> tend<00:03:26.790> on<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.300> shallower

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
clamp so you tend on the shallower

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.400 
clamp so you tend on the shallower
angles<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.440> grind<00:03:28.920> away<00:03:29.160> at<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:29.640> clamp<00:03:30.019> so<00:03:31.019> if

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
angles to grind away at the clamp so if

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.900 
angles to grind away at the clamp so if
you're<00:03:31.590> looking<00:03:31.739> like<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.160> little<00:03:32.310> exacto

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
you're looking like a little exacto

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.350 
you're looking like a little exacto
blade<00:03:32.940> knife<00:03:33.570> I<00:03:33.780> try<00:03:33.989> to<00:03:34.050> sharpen<00:03:35.090> can't<00:03:36.090> do<00:03:36.239> it

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
blade knife I try to sharpen can't do it

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.830 
blade knife I try to sharpen can't do it
really<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:37.260> that<00:03:37.950> is<00:03:38.160> a<00:03:38.190> problem<00:03:38.690> other<00:03:39.690> than

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
really so that is a problem other than

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.540 
really so that is a problem other than
that<00:03:40.050> if<00:03:40.290> you're<00:03:40.620> looking<00:03:40.890> to<00:03:40.950> sharpen<00:03:41.340> like

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
that if you're looking to sharpen like

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.729 
that if you're looking to sharpen like
pocket<00:03:42.180> knives<00:03:42.390> or<00:03:43.140> in<00:03:43.230> this<00:03:43.320> case<00:03:43.530> is<00:03:43.709> a

razorsharp to the point where i am
cutting<00:03:54.860> my<00:03:55.010> hair<00:03:55.400> off<00:03:55.670> I<00:03:56.110> honestly<00:03:57.110> don't

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
cutting my hair off I honestly don't

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.080 
cutting my hair off I honestly don't
know<00:03:57.380> if<00:03:57.470> you<00:03:57.620> can<00:03:57.770> see<00:03:57.950> that<00:03:58.100> but<00:03:58.310> it<00:03:58.520> is

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
know if you can see that but it is

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.390 
know if you can see that but it is
cutting<00:03:59.510> hair<00:03:59.900> and<00:04:00.470> you<00:04:00.710> can<00:04:00.800> see<00:04:00.980> the<00:04:01.190> hair<00:04:01.370> on

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
the blade so you can get a very sharp

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.220 
the blade so you can get a very sharp
edge<00:04:05.300> and<00:04:05.750> I<00:04:06.230> even<00:04:06.550> got<00:04:07.550> a<00:04:07.840> pretty<00:04:08.840> good<00:04:09.050> edge

I've had zero issues with this it's

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.470 
I've had zero issues with this it's
worked<00:05:28.250> phenomenally<00:05:28.400> except<00:05:29.210> for<00:05:29.390> the

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
worked phenomenally except for the

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.930 
worked phenomenally except for the
little<00:05:29.830> problems<00:05:30.830> with<00:05:30.980> the<00:05:31.310> actual<00:05:31.610> clamp

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
little problems with the actual clamp

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.040 
little problems with the actual clamp
but<00:05:32.840> again<00:05:33.669> if<00:05:34.669> you<00:05:34.790> want<00:05:35.000> it<00:05:35.210> for<00:05:35.750> anything

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
but again if you want it for anything

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.550 
but again if you want it for anything
other<00:05:36.770> than<00:05:37.180> small<00:05:38.320> utilitarian<00:05:39.320> tight

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
other than small utilitarian tight

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.430 
other than small utilitarian tight
blades<00:05:39.980> and<00:05:40.640> this<00:05:40.850> really<00:05:41.180> doesn't<00:05:41.540> suit<00:05:42.169> you

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
blades and this really doesn't suit you

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.920 
blades and this really doesn't suit you
um<00:05:42.740> I<00:05:43.220> like<00:05:43.610> it

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
um I like it

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.320 
um I like it
I'm<00:05:45.290> pretty<00:05:45.740> novice<00:05:46.280> at<00:05:46.460> sharpening<00:05:47.030> blades

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
I'm pretty novice at sharpening blades

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.390 
I'm pretty novice at sharpening blades
but<00:05:47.540> this<00:05:47.690> allows<00:05:47.960> me<00:05:48.169> to<00:05:48.200> get<00:05:48.620> very<00:05:49.100> sharp

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
but this allows me to get very sharp

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.600 
but this allows me to get very sharp
blades<00:05:49.700> I<00:05:50.110> would<00:05:51.110> give<00:05:51.320> this<00:05:51.530> pretty<00:05:52.370> much<00:05:52.580> a

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
blades I would give this pretty much a

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.190 
blades I would give this pretty much a
recommendation<00:05:53.180> to<00:05:53.570> buying<00:05:53.840> if<00:05:54.050> you're

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200 
recommendation to buying if you're

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.230 
recommendation to buying if you're
looking<00:05:54.560> at<00:05:55.040> something<00:05:55.340> like<00:05:55.580> this<00:05:55.760> you<00:05:56.180> don't

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
looking at something like this you don't

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.460 
looking at something like this you don't
want<00:05:56.480> spend<00:05:56.660> a<00:05:56.690> lot<00:05:56.840> of<00:05:56.870> money<00:05:56.960> like<00:05:57.260> I<00:05:57.290> said

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
want spend a lot of money like I said

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.960 
want spend a lot of money like I said
it's<00:05:57.560> only<00:05:57.590> about<00:05:57.770> thirty<00:05:58.100> to<00:05:58.370> forty<00:05:58.640> dollars

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
it's only about thirty to forty dollars

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.170 
it's only about thirty to forty dollars
wherever<00:05:59.510> you<00:05:59.720> look<00:06:00.050> their<00:06:00.950> support<00:06:01.669> is<00:06:01.850> great

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
wherever you look their support is great

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.970 
wherever you look their support is great
so<00:06:03.080> I<00:06:03.380> like<00:06:03.830> it<00:06:04.070> recommend<00:06:04.580> it
