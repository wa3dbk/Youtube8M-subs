well my parents talked a lot about ways
that<00:00:54.500> the<00:00:54.920> school<00:00:55.160> could<00:00:55.280> be<00:00:55.430> better<00:00:55.670> and<00:00:56.059> they

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
that the school could be better and they

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.900 
that the school could be better and they

me

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.240 
me
and<00:00:59.270> sometimes<00:00:59.750> I<00:00:59.900> have<00:01:00.020> really<00:01:00.320> good<00:01:00.470> ideas<00:01:00.680> I

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
and sometimes I have really good ideas I

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.130 
and sometimes I have really good ideas I
think<00:01:01.820> that<00:01:02.000> they<00:01:02.150> should<00:01:02.390> tell<00:01:02.629> the

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
think that they should tell the

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.700 
think that they should tell the
principal<00:01:03.800> or<00:01:04.239> my<00:01:05.239> teacher<00:01:05.479> or<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:06.229> office

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
principal or my teacher or the office

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.050 
principal or my teacher or the office
and<00:01:06.979> then<00:01:07.070> they<00:01:07.190> could<00:01:07.400> all<00:01:07.520> discuss<00:01:07.910> it

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
and then they could all discuss it

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.080 
and then they could all discuss it
together<00:01:08.360> and<00:01:08.740> then<00:01:09.740> say<00:01:10.400> what<00:01:10.670> could<00:01:10.910> be

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
together and then say what could be

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.080 
together and then say what could be
better<00:01:11.270> for<00:01:11.780> the<00:01:12.080> school<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:13.220> teachers<00:01:13.250> and

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090
