things a lot along the bottom as you can

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.900 
things a lot along the bottom as you can
see<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:20.820> has<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.240> high<00:00:21.570> glossy<00:00:21.900> surface<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.910> slim

see it has a high glossy surface a slim

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.000 
see it has a high glossy surface a slim
design<00:00:24.060> it's<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.780> three<00:00:25.080> button<00:00:25.260> mouse<00:00:25.380> it's

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
design it's a three button mouse it's

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.910 
design it's a three button mouse it's
got<00:00:26.190> a<00:00:26.220> one<00:00:26.490> point<00:00:26.610> four<00:00:26.850> meter<00:00:27.030> cable<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.920> a

got a one point four meter cable and a
1000<00:00:29.580> DPI<00:00:29.850> optical<00:00:30.840> sensor<00:00:31.199> it's<00:00:31.440> apparently

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
1000 DPI optical sensor it's apparently

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.180 
1000 DPI optical sensor it's apparently
ultra<00:00:32.579> lightweight<00:00:33.260> it's<00:00:34.260> for<00:00:34.530> left<00:00:34.800> or<00:00:34.980> right

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
ultra lightweight it's for left or right

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.060 
ultra lightweight it's for left or right
and<00:00:35.370> use<00:00:35.699> which<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.059> really<00:00:36.690> good<00:00:36.930> it's<00:00:37.890> what

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
and use which is really good it's what

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.450 
and use which is really good it's what
an<00:00:38.190> exceptionally<00:00:38.879> like<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.270> design<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.460> so

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
an exceptionally like in design and so

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.910 
an exceptionally like in design and so
we'll<00:00:41.610> see<00:00:41.820> about<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.710> sensors<00:00:43.710> well

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
we'll see about that and sensors well

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.569 
we'll see about that and sensors well
function<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.840> so<00:00:45.840> it's<00:00:46.260> easy<00:00:47.130> installation

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
function and so it's easy installation

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.420 
function and so it's easy installation
no<00:00:48.000> driver<00:00:48.360> there's<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.530> touch<00:00:49.710> sensor<00:00:50.100> again

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
no driver there's the touch sensor again

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.370 
no driver there's the touch sensor again

the same things on the top and basically
the<00:01:11.549> exact<00:01:11.850> same<00:01:12.090> things<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:12.990> we're<00:01:13.110> going<00:01:13.170> to

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
the exact same things so we're going to

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.420 
the exact same things so we're going to
go<00:01:13.350> ahead<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.680> open<00:01:14.220> up<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.369> box<00:01:14.729> real<00:01:15.030> quick

go ahead and open up the box real quick

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.130 
go ahead and open up the box real quick
so<00:01:17.430> inside<00:01:17.670> we<00:01:17.850> get<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.210> white<00:01:18.600> cardboard

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
so inside we get this white cardboard

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.030 
so inside we get this white cardboard
box<00:01:19.530> with<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.799> mouse<00:01:20.040> on<00:01:20.310> top<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.740> USB<00:01:22.740> cable

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
box with the mouse on top and USB cable

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.410 
box with the mouse on top and USB cable
running<00:01:23.369> down<00:01:23.640> here<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.090> we're<00:01:24.210> going<00:01:24.330> to

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
running down here so we're going to

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:32.560 
running down here so we're going to
quickly<00:01:25.409> check<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.920> out<00:01:27.530> so<00:01:29.090> then<00:01:30.090> through

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.929 

count<00:01:33.570> there<00:01:33.810> we<00:01:33.930> go<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.830> the<00:01:35.100> mouse<00:01:35.250> itself<00:01:35.640> is

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
count there we go so the mouse itself is

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.679 
count there we go so the mouse itself is
in<00:01:36.330> a<00:01:36.720> white<00:01:37.350> plastic<00:01:37.619> piece<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.479> so<00:01:39.479> we<00:01:39.540> can

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
in a white plastic piece and so we can

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.830 
in a white plastic piece and so we can
just<00:01:39.840> pop<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.049> out<00:01:40.400> and<00:01:41.400> put<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.759> aside<00:01:41.909> so

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
just pop that out and put that aside so

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.870 
just pop that out and put that aside so
here<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.530> mouse<00:01:43.740> itself<00:01:44.130> as<00:01:44.400> you<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:44.700> see

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
here is the mouse itself as you can see

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.960 
here is the mouse itself as you can see
i<00:01:45.060> like<00:01:45.570> we<00:01:46.380> said<00:01:46.590> before<00:01:46.650> it<00:01:47.220> has<00:01:47.400> that<00:01:47.640> white

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
i like we said before it has that white

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.179 
i like we said before it has that white
glossy<00:01:48.290> surface<00:01:49.290> with<00:01:49.500> sort<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.920> matte

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
glossy surface with sort of a matte

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.469 
glossy surface with sort of a matte
white<00:01:50.990> sides<00:01:51.990> which<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.560> quite<00:01:52.890> nice<00:01:53.479> there's

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
white sides which is quite nice there's

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.230 
white sides which is quite nice there's
that<00:01:54.659> one<00:01:54.869> thousand<00:01:55.170> VPI<00:01:55.409> sensor<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:56.100> QR<00:01:56.970> code

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
that one thousand VPI sensor a QR code

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.800 
that one thousand VPI sensor a QR code
name<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.229> mouse<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:59.299> so<00:02:00.299> basically<00:02:00.420> you

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
name of the mouse and so basically you

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.740 
name of the mouse and so basically you
have<00:02:00.990> your<00:02:01.200> standard<00:02:01.560> left<00:02:02.400> and<00:02:02.670> right<00:02:03.450> click

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
have your standard left and right click

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.319 
have your standard left and right click
as<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.350> usually<00:02:04.500> would<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.070> then<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.149> area

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
as you usually would and then the area

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.789 
as you usually would and then the area
between<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.810> arrows<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.290> actually<00:02:07.619> touch

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
between the arrows is actually touch

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.589 
between the arrows is actually touch
sensitive<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:08.459> if<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.789> just<00:02:08.970> scroll<00:02:09.299> up<00:02:09.360> and

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
sensitive so if you just scroll up and

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.899 
sensitive so if you just scroll up and
down<00:02:09.659> this<00:02:09.750> area<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.500> your<00:02:11.310> page<00:02:11.579> will<00:02:11.730> move

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:11.909 
down this area and your page will move

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:14.179 
down this area and your page will move
up<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.180> down<00:02:12.269> and<00:02:12.659> this<00:02:13.470> little<00:02:13.650> dot<00:02:13.920> does

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:14.189 
up and down and this little dot does

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:16.699 
up and down and this little dot does
exactly<00:02:14.549> while<00:02:14.969> pushing<00:02:15.870> down<00:02:16.230> on<00:02:16.439> a<00:02:16.499> mouse

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
exactly while pushing down on a mouse

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
size comparison they go and and I'm

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.780 
size comparison they go and and I'm
going<00:02:44.819> to<00:02:44.849> do<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.239> quick<00:02:45.540> size<00:02:46.019> comparison

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
going to do a quick size comparison

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.380 
going to do a quick size comparison
beside<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:48.290> cyborg<00:02:49.290> rat<00:02:49.470> 7<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.250> so<00:02:50.940> there<00:02:51.299> you

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
beside the cyborg rat 7 and so there you

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.190 
beside the cyborg rat 7 and so there you
go<00:02:51.420> it's<00:02:51.930> sort<00:02:52.170> of<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:52.500> same<00:02:54.200> basically

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
go it's sort of the same basically

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.630 
go it's sort of the same basically
length<00:02:55.590> if<00:02:55.769> you<00:02:55.890> think<00:02:56.099> about<00:02:56.160> it<00:02:56.340> and

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
length if you think about it and

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.509 
length if you think about it and
obviously<00:02:57.599> it's<00:02:58.049> a<00:02:58.140> lot<00:02:58.319> thinner<00:02:59.010> than<00:02:59.250> the

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
obviously it's a lot thinner than the

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.349 
obviously it's a lot thinner than the
rat<00:02:59.700> 7<00:03:00.060> as<00:03:00.359> you<00:03:00.690> can<00:03:00.810> see<00:03:01.019> right<00:03:01.049> there<00:03:02.120> we<00:03:03.120> also

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
rat 7 as you can see right there we also

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.619 
rat 7 as you can see right there we also

believe there we go so it's just a

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.369
