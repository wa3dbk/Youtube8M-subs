00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 plus five men who were arrested 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.000
 by the military police 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.220
 in beautiful view of paradise to two 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.730
 police officers who are also in the same 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.590
 situation are collected in the battalion in 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.210
 15th military police battalion in 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.699
 Roland Captain 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.500
 how the military police are 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.020
 dealing with this matter 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.460
 the military police are dealing with this 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.449
 subject with the most absolute 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.160
 possible transparency is not so the 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.960
 sufficient evidence was found 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.780
 held in flagrante 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.510
 he's here on the 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.809
 barracks of the 15th at the disposal of justice 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.910
 always a fact that really calls 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.160
 attention to the fact that two 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.649
 the police involved at the moment 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.190
 are the elements that the police have in 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.800
 hands that prove or are not in the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.770
 his effective participation is this 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.410
 situation they still under investigation 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.010
 by the state military courts 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.780
 but what we can indicate is one where 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.170
 the money was stopped because the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:11.549
 criminals who carried out the robbery 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.299
 glad they were not in possession of this 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.970
 assets 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.000
 is that amount and the police and 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.060
 certain moment they have had 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.680
 access to the vehicle and then the doubt 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.720
 it exists there right? 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.090
 if the material was really in the 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.210
 vehicle the police get hold of or 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.200
 criminals have actually fled with a 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.750
 with these values 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.869
 but yesterday we found and 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.270
 sufficiency at least for now is to 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.189
 breach of the flagrante delicto and justice 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.270
 state military to whom to pronounce 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.490
 about this space 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.869
 the police are in jail right now 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.720
 the captain and from now on 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.729
 It happens and we are going to report to justice. 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.850
 state military that he finds himself in 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.689
 here in the 15th battalion at the disposal of 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.030
 justice 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.369
 the first situation we will only get 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.920
 to decide whether to decide 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.560
 their weight or will wait for the 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.149
 process but the process is 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.149
 military penalty will occur
