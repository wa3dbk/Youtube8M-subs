00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
weaker now since the changes the tier

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.419 
weaker now since the changes the tier
and<00:02:06.689> how<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.930> stacks<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.500> can't<00:02:07.740> quite<00:02:08.009> get<00:02:08.220> it

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
and how it stacks and can't quite get it

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.900 
and how it stacks and can't quite get it

fully stacked up past your man immune to

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.760 
fully stacked up past your man immune to
fast<00:02:12.209> but<00:02:12.989> I<00:02:13.200> never<00:02:13.379> actually

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
fast but I never actually

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.380 
fast but I never actually
built<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:13.950> item<00:02:14.400> on<00:02:14.520> Jase<00:02:14.760> as<00:02:14.970> much<00:02:15.120> as<00:02:15.270> it

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
built that item on Jase as much as it

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.180 
built that item on Jase as much as it
was<00:02:15.510> a<00:02:15.540> court<00:02:15.900> item<00:02:16.350> I<00:02:16.440> had<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.560> different<00:02:16.920> build

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
was a court item I had a different build

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.710 
was a court item I had a different build
that<00:02:17.370> was<00:02:17.490> a<00:02:17.520> little<00:02:17.760> bit<00:02:18.030> different<00:02:18.420> not<00:02:18.480> too

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
that was a little bit different not too

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.960 
that was a little bit different not too
crazy<00:02:19.020> but<00:02:19.770> worked<00:02:20.280> out<00:02:20.430> really<00:02:20.580> well<00:02:20.670> for<00:02:20.790> me

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
crazy but worked out really well for me

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.790 
crazy but worked out really well for me
so<00:02:21.240> I<00:02:21.270> still<00:02:21.570> think<00:02:21.780> he's<00:02:21.900> pretty<00:02:22.110> viable<00:02:22.440> if

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
so I still think he's pretty viable if

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.010 
so I still think he's pretty viable if
you<00:02:23.190> just<00:02:23.370> plain<00:02:23.670> well<00:02:24.150> so<00:02:24.690> if<00:02:24.870> you're<00:02:24.990> just

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020
