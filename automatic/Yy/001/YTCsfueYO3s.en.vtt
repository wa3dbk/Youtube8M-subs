00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.619
 Now I'm going to talk about how to do 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.470
 that the front lights can recover 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.910
 that bright color in the dark now 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.369
 I'm going to show you in a few steps 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.310
 simple how you can achieve that 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:28.090
 lights can shine again now 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.330
 I'm going to show you how it's done 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.100
 here this is the light on the right it 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.340
 you may notice that you do not have any 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.040
 shine and you can hardly see 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.960
 inwardly of what the lamp is 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.210
 also what is great for the hand 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.970
 left also has the same color 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.930
 you can not see what is the part of 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:52.720
 in because it's very opaque and this is 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.080
 through the time that retracts that color 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.250
 that is forming to use what is 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.100
 this 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.970
 this cream is one is a little boat that 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.610
 sold in the parts of cars and is for 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.590
 clean and it's for cleaning 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.700
 specifically what are the lights of the 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:15.729
 front and you can see what is the here 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.130
 the left part looks like it's 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.470
 opaque and the other part is like 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.270
 supposedly it has to be left once 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.270
 that has been cleaned what is the car 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.229
 to begin we will beat what is 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.270
 which is the boat so that it is stirred 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.270
 what is the product I think is the cream 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:42.280
 look for a cotton towel and we're going to 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:45.450
 gather about what it is about what it is 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.450
 all the lamp 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.810
 now that we have thrown it to the lamp 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.600
 let's wait for it to dry so 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.840
 does when the temperature is a bit 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.299
 strong would be better because that speeds up the 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.770
 process of what the product is and it 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.370
 dry more 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.870
 although in the indications of the boat 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.960
 according to indicates that we do not have to wait 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.960
 to dry it once you 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.770
 we throw to what is lamp we have to 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.450
 clean it but 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.480
 according 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.980
 at my own discretion and for the times 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.879
 I have done it 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.730
 letting it dry I think it makes the 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:39.129
 work now let's grab what is 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.540
 a towel a paper towel 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:44.739
 cotton 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.739
 we are going to clean it 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.900
 a certain part is already dry but certain 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:57.340
 parts are wet but I think that 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.340
 there will always be work 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.230
 now once we have cleaned the 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.070
 most of the lamp and that you already 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.330
 we take everything out and it has a good shine 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.620
 let's continue with the next 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.120
 lamp 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.670
 when we finish with the other one we are going to 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.410
 come back with this one to give it a 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.410
 last cleaned 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.770
 this is practically dry 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.490
 I do not know if you can tell the difference 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.950
 and do not forget to keep giving him 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:13.049
 crazy turns to the towel and says that 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.450
 I was messing the towel you can go 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.669
 spinning so that you can 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.370
 save you towels and you can not 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.290
 waste them 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.370
 now once we have finished with 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:27.949
 this is going to give the last touch to what 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.810
 is the lamp on the left side now 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:33.630
 here I have the final result 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:37.100
 you can really see 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.100
 extremely curious 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:45.160
 nothing to see as it was before 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:48.040
 and it's a very clear brightness that you can 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:51.600
 really see inside what is 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:55.230
 the lamp do a bit of reflection but 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:58.210
 Estela Club is that it is cloudy and 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:00.910
 at this time really it comes great 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.540
 storm but I'm making the video to 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.540
 the race 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.520
 here you can clearly notice what it is 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:12.960
 the bright 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:15.810
 it has changed extremely 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.680
 no more with a little time 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:24.080
 about 10 minutes you can do it looks 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:27.210
 that shines a little more than the other 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:30.139
 they are both really 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.139
 shiny 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.490
 good friends 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.200
 I have shown you in a short time how 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.950
 we can transform what are the 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:43.130
 lamps especially for us that 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:46.200
 we do not have enough money sometimes 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:49.110
 to buy us new lamps 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.420
 and we really do not have the money to 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:55.100
 do it then the only thing we have 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:59.160
 what to do is to resort to these methods and 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:03.600
 it really works and really hard as 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:06.000
 the effect to last like a week or two 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.280
 weeks you can really do it 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.889
 as many times as you want 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.050
 Marist depends on you if you want 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:15.570
 enter the car with the lamps all 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:18.000
 opaque and if you want to feel the car 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:23.370
 all opaque and that can not be seen in the 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.200
 Now it's your thing and it's now 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.760
 taking advantage of I send a greeting to the 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.030
 people who take the time in 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:32.310
 comment my videos and by the 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:37.050
 and for the time they also take in 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:39.690
 watch videos and also the people who 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:42.150
 no longer comment on the commenters alike 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:45.630
 I send a greeting 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:47.840
 I really wish you luck and even the 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.840
 next
