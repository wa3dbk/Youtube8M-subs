00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
but what I liked about what he did was

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.080 
but what I liked about what he did was
he<00:02:01.680> was<00:02:01.800> direct<00:02:02.220> and<00:02:02.490> then<00:02:02.580> obviously<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.940> buy

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
he was direct and then obviously I buy

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.880

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
him off well I have to say bit of team

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.890 
him off well I have to say bit of team
effort<00:02:05.190> there<00:02:05.340> those<00:02:06.150> are<00:02:06.300> techniques<00:02:06.660> of<00:02:06.840> the

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
effort there those are techniques of the

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.120 
effort there those are techniques of the
game<00:02:07.080> even<00:02:07.380> though<00:02:07.470> you<00:02:07.500> think<00:02:07.710> he's<00:02:07.920> just

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
game even though you think he's just

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.830 
game even though you think he's just
swinging<00:02:08.369> balls<00:02:08.700> it's<00:02:08.940> not<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.210> simple<00:02:09.420> so

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
swinging balls it's not that simple so

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.270 
swinging balls it's not that simple so
it<00:02:09.960> takes<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.259> bit<00:02:10.290> teamwork<00:02:10.740> the<00:02:10.979> man<00:02:11.130> on<00:02:11.250> your

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
it takes a bit teamwork the man on your

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.520 
it takes a bit teamwork the man on your
right<00:02:11.400> or<00:02:11.730> left<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:12.600> slow<00:02:12.810> them<00:02:12.960> down<00:02:12.990> just

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
right or left to slow them down just

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.140
