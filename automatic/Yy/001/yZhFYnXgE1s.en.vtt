00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.540
 hello to all here 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:12.920
 revoici montmagny racing lady 94 completed 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.920
 as I wanted it here it is 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:21.630
 almost original except the pot here 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:27.990
 otherwise I tried to put everything back 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:30.090
 consistent with the origin the painting is 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.360
 so unique l1 as in the first movie 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.020
 I did not need to do it again 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.020
 his original painting 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:46.020
 I managed to find the stickers 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.520
 without it, it's clear that those who 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.640
 know will understand what I'm saying 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.079
 not what to find them 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.050
 it's very complicated especially those of 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.739
 the career aco since the general 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:02.670
 many or even the 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.890
 the stickers from the head frame of 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.950
 fork finally the casings here but 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.409
 then the stickers of the coke 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:17.119
 it's catastrophic catastrophic 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:20.360
 so here it is as I said so 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:25.979

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:28.159

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.159

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:41.200

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.820
