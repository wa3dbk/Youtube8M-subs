00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
duplicating it needs to be parked very

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.330

or anything like that the best way I can
explain<00:01:57.690> it<00:01:58.050> is<00:01:58.350> fine<00:01:58.620> maybe<00:01:58.860> like<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.159> dumpster

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
explain it is fine maybe like a dumpster

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
and a wall or a pole in a wall but

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.100 
and a wall or a pole in a wall but
they're<00:02:02.820> everywhere<00:02:03.270> in<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.600> area<00:02:03.780> so<00:02:04.049> you

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
they're everywhere in that area so you

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.170 
they're everywhere in that area so you
shouldn't<00:02:04.380> have<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.530> big<00:02:04.740> deal<00:02:04.920> or<00:02:05.100> have<00:02:05.940> a<00:02:05.970> big

shouldn't have a big deal or have a big

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.869 
shouldn't have a big deal or have a big
problem<00:02:06.420> with<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.750> but<00:02:06.930> anyway<00:02:07.190> step<00:02:08.190> 5<00:02:08.429> once

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
problem with that but anyway step 5 once

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.190 
problem with that but anyway step 5 once
you're<00:02:09.030> there<00:02:09.179> parking<00:02:09.750> in<00:02:09.810> front<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:10.080> your

of vehicle and get into the car you

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.460 
of vehicle and get into the car you
parked<00:02:32.940> previously<00:02:33.600> which<00:02:34.140> would<00:02:34.290> be<00:02:34.380> the

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
parked previously which would be the

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.180 
parked previously which would be the
vehicle<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:34.830> you're<00:02:34.980> going<00:02:35.070> to<00:02:35.130> be

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
vehicle that you're going to be

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.220 
vehicle that you're going to be
duplicating<00:02:35.910> step<00:02:36.570> 9<00:02:36.780> it<00:02:36.990> should<00:02:37.140> then

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
duplicating step 9 it should then

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.140 
duplicating step 9 it should then
teleport<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:37.950> into<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.430> garage<00:02:38.610> with<00:02:39.090> a

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
teleport you into the garage with a

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.480 
teleport you into the garage with a
duplicated<00:02:39.810> vehicle<00:02:40.230> step<00:02:40.950> 10<00:02:41.160> you<00:02:41.370> could

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
duplicated vehicle step 10 you could

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.490 
duplicated vehicle step 10 you could
then<00:02:41.610> proceed<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.030> sell<00:02:42.390> or<00:02:42.690> keep<00:02:42.960> the<00:02:43.200> brand

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
then proceed to sell or keep the brand

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.980 
then proceed to sell or keep the brand
new<00:02:43.970> duplicated<00:02:44.970> vehicle<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.660> then<00:02:45.780> if<00:02:45.870> you

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
new duplicated vehicle and then if you

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.150 
new duplicated vehicle and then if you
want<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.230> keep<00:02:46.320> doing<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.650> glitch<00:02:46.830> all<00:02:47.040> you

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
want to keep doing the glitch all you

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.100 
want to keep doing the glitch all you
got<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.430> do<00:02:47.520> is<00:02:47.640> rinse<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.030> repeat<00:02:48.120> all<00:02:48.540> these

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
got to do is rinse and repeat all these

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.590 
got to do is rinse and repeat all these
steps<00:02:49.470> now<00:02:49.770> I'm<00:02:49.860> pretty<00:02:50.010> sure<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.730> duplicated

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
steps now I'm pretty sure the duplicated

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.140 
steps now I'm pretty sure the duplicated
vehicle<00:02:52.140> would<00:02:52.620> be<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:52.980> one<00:02:53.220> that<00:02:53.670> spawns

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
vehicle would be the one that spawns

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.210 
vehicle would be the one that spawns
outside<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:55.110> your<00:02:55.260> garage<00:02:55.410> like<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:55.950> one<00:02:56.100> you

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
outside of your garage like the one you

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.430 
outside of your garage like the one you
spawned<00:02:56.520> inside<00:02:57.030> your<00:02:57.240> garage<00:02:57.360> that's<00:02:58.170> not

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
spawned inside your garage that's not

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.960 
spawned inside your garage that's not
the<00:02:58.470> duplicated<00:02:59.040> vehicle<00:02:59.400> so<00:02:59.520> don't<00:02:59.730> sell

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
the duplicated vehicle so don't sell

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.640 
the duplicated vehicle so don't sell
that<00:03:00.000> one<00:03:00.300> walk<00:03:00.660> upside<00:03:00.960> your<00:03:01.140> garage<00:03:01.410> and

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
that one walk upside your garage and

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.470 
that one walk upside your garage and
sell<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.340> one<00:03:02.490> that's<00:03:02.640> parked<00:03:03.000> on<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.420> street

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
sell the one that's parked on the street

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.660 
sell the one that's parked on the street
I'm<00:03:03.930> pretty<00:03:04.350> positive<00:03:04.590> that's<00:03:05.100> how<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:05.370> is<00:03:05.490> if

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
I'm pretty positive that's how it is if

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.240 
I'm pretty positive that's how it is if
not<00:03:06.330> make<00:03:07.020> sure<00:03:07.050> drop<00:03:07.380> a<00:03:07.410> comment<00:03:07.680> below<00:03:07.830> and

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
not make sure drop a comment below and

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.160 
not make sure drop a comment below and
I'm<00:03:08.640> not<00:03:08.760> exactly<00:03:09.030> sure<00:03:09.210> how<00:03:09.600> that<00:03:09.780> works<00:03:09.990> to

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
I'm not exactly sure how that works to

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.420 
I'm not exactly sure how that works to
be<00:03:10.290> completely<00:03:10.680> honest<00:03:10.950> with<00:03:11.010> you<00:03:11.160> so<00:03:11.370> you

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
be completely honest with you so you

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.400 
be completely honest with you so you
