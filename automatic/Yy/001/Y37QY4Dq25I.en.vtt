00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.479
 a barbarism in addition to the hammers hitting the ropes 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.790
 look at gbagbo instead of that 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.090
 actor by staying very young converting them to a digital signal 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.540
 the pedals 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.670
