00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:08.220
 in this lesson we will create with you here 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.250
 such a daffodil let's see how it 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.509
 so do we need to start 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.760
 wire 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:20.039
 three colors of beads and here such 2 preparation 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.410
 how to create such a workpiece 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.430
 the fence and you already know the only thing 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.330
 here the amount of the set changes to be seen 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.320
 in every row 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.170
 here remember this sequence 321 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.170
 then just like we did in 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.300
 the previous lesson performing the bell we 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.690
 typed just such a sequence 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.820
 beads and the only difference is 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.750
 we got five bells 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.050
 petals 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.899
 and for doing daffodil us 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.020
 It will take 6 elements like this 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:59.149
 then the first two we weave like 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:03.049
 stand alone items get to the end 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:07.229
 fix the ends of the wire under the petal and 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:10.560
 we cut them and then weave 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.229
 together with under the weave to these already 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.820
 billet principle is exactly the same 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.840
 the only one we will capture 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.960
 side pads 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.270
 each and plexuses and so cut the ends 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:27.470
 wire at the first billet and now 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:30.630
 we begin to weave the core we capture 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.750
 wire first weave 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:39.530
 we collect on one end 2 beads on 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.530
 another tip 3 and closes the ring 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:47.240
 so you walked with two ends of two 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.909
 beads and now looking at one end 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.229
 in the center we catch the wire on 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:56.630
 adjacent element 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:02:00.220
 and recruit one bead the other end 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:04.250
 wire closes the ring 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.970
 bead and now just pass 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.190
 wire looking to the center 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:13.370
 grab the side wire on 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.190
 weaving we are gaining white bead and 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.500
 just as we close it in the ring here 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.890
 by such a principle weaving stitching two 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.130
 details move to the end of the third 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:28.480
 a row of white beads and then weaving 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:31.580
 will be conducted without the capture of the previous 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.420
 links in general can weave this flower 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.459
 in the old way weave three single ones 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.739
 just such a further element 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:44.209
 intermediate between them are the same 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:46.239
 elements to join immediately with two 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.239
 parties 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.840
 accordingly, you are faster to perform and 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.230
 this weaving by any of the listed 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.959
 Ways to hold 6 petals between 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.360
 yourself so that until the third 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:03.170
 row they were attached to each other a 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:07.760
 further diverged to such here 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:11.870
 petals and so the flower itself is ready 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:15.190
 we straighten it better to make it more 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:21.860
 naturally looked everybody give shape 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:24.560
 as a living thing, but now we will strengthen 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.820
 stalk for this we need two 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:31.250
 cut a piece of green wire 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.470
 first one wire through 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.470
 central 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.470
 bead 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.260
 like this 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.900
 and also in the opposite bead 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:57.180
 the other end of the wire now combine 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.850
 the ends of the wires like this between 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.950
 the cathedral and the ends must be the same 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.130
 size 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:09.540
 if they need to be cut in different sizes 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:13.410
 tip scissors dial 2 beads on 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:17.120
 one end of the wire go through these two 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.120
 beads on the other hand 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:30.080
 further free ends of the wires with 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:35.120
 the other side 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:42.930
 we pass under the same two beads and 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:47.820
 the last end of the wire go out with 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:52.470
 other side so we 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:57.030
 secured with just such a weave 2 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:05:00.120
 beads now dial on immediately a couple 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:03.710
 wires 2 beads and another pair of wires 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:06.630
 close the ring passing through 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.680
 the next 2 beads like this 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:13.500
 way and weave too 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.560
 further we will need to recruit more 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.010
 three such links 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.780
 after scoring five elements 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:24.320
 recruit single beads we are right on 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.699
 four wires like this and 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.770
 delay the number of beads you 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:30.900
 determine it yourself depends on 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.760
 what stalk you will have after 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:40.080
 as you reach the end you will need 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:44.310
 disassemble the wire ends in pairs and so 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:48.120
 now we collect 2 beads on one of 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:51.419
 wire and doubles to her pass 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.630
 through these two beads and now by 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:57.750
 the same principle weaving 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:06:00.139
 perform the leaf length you define 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.139
 yourself 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:09.350
 late foxes we will collect only one bead 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:12.650
 and hide the ends under the wire then them 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.830
 cut the leaf will be ready the same 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.360
 way we start weave second 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.350
 try it yourself 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.350
 such a flower
