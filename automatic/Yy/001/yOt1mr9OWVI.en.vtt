00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
front axle of the vehicle so you don't

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.520 
front axle of the vehicle so you don't
get<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.329> strange<00:01:54.750> motion<00:01:55.079> when<00:01:55.409> you're

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
get that strange motion when you're

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.950 
get that strange motion when you're
ahead<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.130> axle<00:01:56.640> wanted<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.479> right<00:01:57.659> up<00:01:57.810> on

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960

it is a blast to drive I mean the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.870 
it is a blast to drive I mean the
experience<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.719> having
