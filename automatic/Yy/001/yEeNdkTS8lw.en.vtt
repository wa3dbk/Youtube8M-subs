00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.939 

so<00:00:00.780> these<00:00:00.900> problems<00:00:01.290> are<00:00:01.350> gonna<00:00:01.500> go<00:00:01.680> as

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
so these problems are gonna go as

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.880 
so these problems are gonna go as
follows<00:00:02.520> whatever<00:00:03.480> it's<00:00:03.870> a<00:00:03.990> collecting<00:00:04.650> gas

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
follows whatever it's a collecting gas

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.629 
follows whatever it's a collecting gas
so<00:00:05.279> we're<00:00:05.400> liquid<00:00:05.879> and<00:00:06.589> you'll<00:00:07.589> do<00:00:07.859> something

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
so we're liquid and you'll do something

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.339 
so we're liquid and you'll do something
like<00:00:08.760> this<00:00:08.970> when<00:00:09.210> you<00:00:09.300> do<00:00:09.420> your<00:00:09.599> very<00:00:09.750> last<00:00:09.990> lap

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
like this when you do your very last lap

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.530 
like this when you do your very last lap
the<00:00:10.860> math<00:00:11.099> will<00:00:11.429> be<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.700> same<00:00:11.969> but<00:00:12.269> it'll<00:00:12.420> be<00:00:12.509> a

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
the math will be the same but it'll be a

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.349 
the math will be the same but it'll be a
different<00:00:12.900> setup<00:00:15.170> you<00:00:16.170> have<00:00:16.310> usually<00:00:17.359> like

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
different setup you have usually like

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.750 
different setup you have usually like
this<00:00:19.250> container<00:00:20.250> say<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.090> test<00:00:21.449> tube<00:00:22.550> and<00:00:23.550> you

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
this container say a test tube and you

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.660 
this container say a test tube and you
have<00:00:23.939> material<00:00:24.600> in<00:00:24.810> here<00:00:25.140> some<00:00:25.890> usually<00:00:26.640> a

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
have material in here some usually a

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.200 
have material in here some usually a
solid<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:28.109> doesn't<00:00:28.140> have<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.680> be

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
solid it doesn't have to be

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.280 
solid it doesn't have to be
and<00:00:30.410> then<00:00:31.410> it's<00:00:31.619> how's<00:00:32.160> this<00:00:32.369> -<00:00:33.050> this<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.230> a

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
and then it's how's this - this is a

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.560 
and then it's how's this - this is a
common<00:00:34.710> like<00:00:34.890> -<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.250> reaction<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.059> what<00:00:36.329> you're

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
common like - a reaction of what you're

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.560 
common like - a reaction of what you're
going<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.780> do<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:36.989> someone<00:00:37.440> later<00:00:38.329> and<00:00:39.329> then

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
going to do is someone later and then

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:47.389 
going to do is someone later and then
this<00:00:39.750> tube<00:00:43.250> goes<00:00:44.250> into<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.730> beaker<00:00:45.469> and<00:00:46.469> you

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
this tube goes into a beaker and you

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.740 
this tube goes into a beaker and you
have<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:47.730> upside-down<00:00:50.149> graduated<00:00:51.149> cylinder

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
have this upside-down graduated cylinder

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.900 
have this upside-down graduated cylinder
and<00:00:53.059> the<00:00:54.059> tube<00:00:54.329> goes<00:00:54.539> like<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:55.699> so<00:00:56.699> what

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
and the tube goes like this so what

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.389 
and the tube goes like this so what
happens<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.719> here<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:58.680> reactant

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
happens is this here this reactant

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.329 
happens is this here this reactant
honestok<00:01:00.059> on<00:01:00.180> arm<00:01:02.899> goes<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.439> let's<00:01:05.070> say

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
honestok on arm goes to let's say

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:12.170 
honestok on arm goes to let's say
product<00:01:05.790> one<00:01:06.270> was<00:01:06.900> product<00:01:07.590> two<00:01:10.490> and<00:01:11.490> one<00:01:11.909> of

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
product one was product two and one of

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.969 
product one was product two and one of
these<00:01:12.390> products<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.229> gas

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
these products is gas

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.050 
these products is gas
and<00:01:14.509> so<00:01:15.560> this<00:01:16.560> here's<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.460> speaker<00:01:17.880> has

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
and so this here's this speaker has

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.120 
and so this here's this speaker has
liquid<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.020> filled<00:01:19.320> with<00:01:19.590> liquid<00:01:19.860> to

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
liquid and this is filled with liquid to

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.149 
liquid and this is filled with liquid to
start<00:01:20.400> off<00:01:20.549> with<00:01:21.080> okay<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.380> have<00:01:22.650> liquid

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
start off with okay so you have liquid

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.010 
start off with okay so you have liquid
and<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.369> kind<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.580> invert<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.330> stick<00:01:24.990> it

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
and you kind of invert it and stick it

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.260 
and you kind of invert it and stick it
in<00:01:25.200> there<00:01:25.380> what<00:01:26.310> happens<00:01:26.700> when<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.060> gas

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
in there what happens when the gas

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.230 
in there what happens when the gas
starts<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.840> come<00:01:28.049> off<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.740> bubbles<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.729> those

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
starts to come off and bubbles and those

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.289 
starts to come off and bubbles and those
bubbles<00:01:30.570> come<00:01:31.200> up<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.680> top<00:01:31.920> here<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.460> at

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
bubbles come up to the top here and at

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.890 
bubbles come up to the top here and at
the<00:01:33.509> end<00:01:33.540> you'll<00:01:33.990> have<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.140> certain<00:01:34.530> amount<00:01:34.590> of

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
the end you'll have a certain amount of

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.830 
the end you'll have a certain amount of
gas<00:01:36.900> at<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.640> top<00:01:38.909> which<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.390> can<00:01:39.570> measure

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
gas at the top which you can measure

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.889 
gas at the top which you can measure
with<00:01:40.170> your<00:01:40.229> graduated

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
with your graduated

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.200 
with your graduated
it<00:01:42.899> has<00:01:43.049> graduation<00:01:43.649> marks

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
it has graduation marks

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.860 
it has graduation marks
so<00:01:44.300> you<00:01:44.390> can<00:01:44.570> measure<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:45.500> volume<00:01:46.130> of<00:01:46.280> gas

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
so you can measure the volume of gas

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:53.260 
so you can measure the volume of gas
okay<00:01:49.180> and<00:01:50.180> then<00:01:50.450> what<00:01:50.720> you<00:01:50.870> need<00:01:51.020> to<00:01:51.080> do<00:01:52.270> you'll

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
okay and then what you need to do you'll

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.440 
okay and then what you need to do you'll
have<00:01:53.360> to<00:01:53.540> do<00:01:53.810> some<00:01:54.260> little<00:01:54.530> calculation<00:01:55.450> to

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
have to do some little calculation to

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.600 
have to do some little calculation to
figure<00:01:56.840> out<00:01:57.020> you<00:01:57.710> know<00:01:57.740> want<00:01:58.100> to<00:01:58.220> know

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.710 

pressure<00:02:01.610> of<00:02:01.790> this<00:02:01.910> gas<00:02:03.010> so<00:02:04.010> what<00:02:05.000> you<00:02:05.150> do<00:02:05.360> is

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
pressure of this gas so what you do is

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.279 
pressure of this gas so what you do is
say<00:02:06.080> okay<00:02:06.590> hold<00:02:07.160> pressure<00:02:08.020> and<00:02:09.020> this<00:02:09.140> is

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
say okay hold pressure and this is

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.440 
say okay hold pressure and this is
always<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.649> same<00:02:09.979> set<00:02:10.280> up<00:02:10.429> that's<00:02:11.120> why<00:02:11.270> we're

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
always the same set up that's why we're

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.150 
always the same set up that's why we're
doing<00:02:11.570> it<00:02:11.780> like<00:02:12.050> this<00:02:12.290> was<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:12.860> same<00:02:13.040> it

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
doing it like this was the same it

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.550 
doing it like this was the same it
doesn't<00:02:13.310> matter<00:02:13.550> what<00:02:13.760> it<00:02:13.850> is<00:02:14.290> total<00:02:15.290> pressure

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
doesn't matter what it is total pressure

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.750 
doesn't matter what it is total pressure
isn't<00:02:16.010> me<00:02:16.280> to<00:02:16.340> pressure<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.820> gas<00:02:18.640> this<00:02:19.640> would

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
isn't me to pressure the gas this would

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.610 
isn't me to pressure the gas this would
be<00:02:19.880> some<00:02:20.120> partial<00:02:20.360> pressure<00:02:20.630> of<00:02:20.720> gas<00:02:20.959> there

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
be some partial pressure of gas there

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.190 
be some partial pressure of gas there
will<00:02:22.100> also<00:02:22.430> be<00:02:22.640> another<00:02:22.970> gas<00:02:23.330> in<00:02:23.600> there<00:02:23.780> though

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
will also be another gas in there though

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.440 
will also be another gas in there though
always<00:02:24.709> will<00:02:25.489> have<00:02:26.739> water<00:02:28.270> because<00:02:29.270> it's

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
always will have water because it's

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.060 
always will have water because it's
bubbling<00:02:29.900> through<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.260> water<00:02:30.440> so<00:02:30.830> it'll<00:02:30.980> be

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
bubbling through the water so it'll be

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.060 
bubbling through the water so it'll be
something<00:02:31.459> for<00:02:31.700> pressure<00:02:31.910> of<00:02:32.090> water<00:02:32.890> so<00:02:33.890> what

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
something for pressure of water so what

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.560 
something for pressure of water so what
you<00:02:34.220> do<00:02:34.430> when<00:02:34.610> you<00:02:34.760> do<00:02:34.910> these<00:02:35.060> kinds<00:02:35.480> of

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
you do when you do these kinds of

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.660 
you do when you do these kinds of
problems<00:02:36.880> this<00:02:37.880> total<00:02:38.570> pressure<00:02:38.840> right<00:02:39.170> here

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
problems this total pressure right here

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.949 
problems this total pressure right here
this<00:02:40.670> is<00:02:40.730> from<00:02:41.030> a<00:02:41.120> barometer<00:02:43.480> okay<00:02:44.480> this<00:02:44.780> is

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
this is from a barometer okay this is

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.590 
this is from a barometer okay this is
atmospheric<00:02:45.739> pressure<00:02:46.420> so<00:02:47.420> if<00:02:47.930> you're<00:02:48.769> in<00:02:48.920> lab

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
atmospheric pressure so if you're in lab

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.539 
atmospheric pressure so if you're in lab
you<00:02:50.600> look<00:02:50.810> at<00:02:50.930> this<00:02:51.080> thing<00:02:51.290> right<00:02:51.350> here<00:02:51.590> you

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
you look at this thing right here you

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.030 
you look at this thing right here you
read<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.910> number<00:02:53.180> off<00:02:53.330> of<00:02:53.360> it<00:02:53.769> otherwise<00:02:54.769> if

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
read the number off of it otherwise if

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.710 
read the number off of it otherwise if
they<00:02:55.190> tell<00:02:55.459> you<00:02:55.610> to<00:02:55.850> just<00:02:56.030> make<00:02:56.090> an<00:02:56.360> assumption

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
they tell you to just make an assumption

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.940 
they tell you to just make an assumption
you'll<00:02:57.530> say<00:02:57.799> it's<00:02:57.950> one<00:02:58.160> atmosphere<00:02:58.840> okay<00:02:59.950> this

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
you'll say it's one atmosphere okay this

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.410 
you'll say it's one atmosphere okay this
number<00:03:01.430> here<00:03:01.870> you<00:03:02.870> look<00:03:03.019> up<00:03:03.200> in<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:03.380> table

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
number here you look up in the table

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.190 
number here you look up in the table
which<00:03:05.420> will<00:03:05.600> give<00:03:05.870> you<00:03:06.049> on<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:06.380> exam<00:03:06.410> so<00:03:08.200> what

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
which will give you on the exam so what

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.259 
which will give you on the exam so what
it'll<00:03:09.440> have<00:03:09.680> is<00:03:10.040> they'll<00:03:10.250> be<00:03:10.489> a<00:03:13.269> temperature

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
it'll have is they'll be a temperature

up<00:03:55.330> a<00:03:55.450> little<00:03:55.660> patient<00:03:56.200> depending<00:03:56.620> on<00:03:56.769> what

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
up a little patient depending on what

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.250 
up a little patient depending on what
you<00:03:57.100> want<00:03:57.130> to<00:03:57.310> solve<00:03:57.489> for<00:03:57.610> but<00:03:58.480> say<00:03:58.720> a<00:03:58.750> common

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
you want to solve for but say a common

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.110 
you want to solve for but say a common
thing<00:03:59.440> that<00:03:59.470> solve<00:03:59.830> for<00:04:00.070> it<00:04:00.220> is<00:04:00.370> the<00:04:00.580> moles<00:04:00.820> of

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
thing that solve for it is the moles of

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.580 
thing that solve for it is the moles of
the<00:04:01.180> gas<00:04:01.800> example<00:04:02.800> so<00:04:03.700> you<00:04:03.760> just<00:04:03.970> say<00:04:04.090> moles<00:04:04.590> of

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
the gas example so you just say moles of

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:15.530 
the gas example so you just say moles of
your<00:04:05.830> gas<00:04:07.530> equals<00:04:08.530> P<00:04:08.830> V<00:04:09.180> over<00:04:10.180> R<00:04:10.440> T<00:04:13.920> so<00:04:14.920> P

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
your gas equals P V over R T so P

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.440 
your gas equals P V over R T so P
pressure<00:04:16.540> this<00:04:16.989> is<00:04:17.049> the<00:04:17.229> pressure<00:04:17.470> of<00:04:17.590> the<00:04:17.709> gas

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
pressure this is the pressure of the gas

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.370 
pressure this is the pressure of the gas
that's<00:04:19.450> from<00:04:19.900> here

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
that's from here

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.920

whatever your thermometer says but if
you're<00:04:35.740> doing<00:04:35.919> a<00:04:35.979> problem<00:04:36.460> they<00:04:36.580> have<00:04:36.669> to<00:04:36.820> tell

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
you're doing a problem they have to tell

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.820 
you're doing a problem they have to tell
you<00:04:37.090> that<00:04:37.240> and<00:04:37.510> then<00:04:37.660> ours<00:04:37.930> a<00:04:38.080> constant<00:04:38.590> so<00:04:38.800> you

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
you that and then ours a constant so you

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.740 
you that and then ours a constant so you
got<00:04:39.100> everything<00:04:39.490> you<00:04:39.789> can<00:04:40.000> find<00:04:40.180> the<00:04:40.270> moles<00:04:40.479> of

got everything you can find the moles of

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.040 
got everything you can find the moles of
your<00:04:41.130> gas<00:04:42.130> and<00:04:42.610> if<00:04:43.210> they<00:04:43.360> wanted<00:04:43.600> you<00:04:43.720> could<00:04:43.960> do

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
your gas and if they wanted you could do

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.600 
your gas and if they wanted you could do
a<00:04:44.080> straight<00:04:44.380> geometrical<00:04:44.560> calculation<00:04:45.430> or

a straight geometrical calculation or
whatever<00:04:45.910> is<00:04:46.810> that<00:04:46.870> okay<00:04:47.200> so<00:04:48.010> it's<00:04:48.160> really

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
whatever is that okay so it's really

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.050
