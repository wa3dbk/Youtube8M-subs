close so what we're gonna do is we're

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.050 
close so what we're gonna do is we're
going<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.769> get<00:00:28.890> into<00:00:29.070> our<00:00:29.160> stances<00:00:29.730> are<00:00:29.910> nice

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
going to get into our stances are nice

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.479 
going to get into our stances are nice
low<00:00:30.390> centers<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.170> then<00:00:31.920> we're<00:00:32.009> gonna<00:00:32.130> find

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
low centers and then we're gonna find

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.090 
low centers and then we're gonna find
our<00:00:32.850> distance<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:34.260> what<00:00:34.380> I'm<00:00:34.500> gonna<00:00:34.620> do<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:34.950> I'm

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
our distance so what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.209 
our distance so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna<00:00:35.219> walk<00:00:35.489> into<00:00:35.790> Liz<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.390> she's<00:00:36.840> gonna

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
gonna walk into Liz and she's gonna

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:43.520 
gonna walk into Liz and she's gonna
check<00:00:38.420> distance<00:00:39.420> then<00:00:40.320> into<00:00:40.590> close<00:00:42.170> by<00:00:43.170> simply

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
check distance then into close by simply

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.350 
check distance then into close by simply
parrying<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.280> she's<00:00:44.489> gonna<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.969> know<00:00:45.090> parry

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
parrying so she's gonna you know parry

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.400 
parrying so she's gonna you know parry
for<00:00:45.660> parry<00:00:46.500> 3<00:00:47.039> make<00:00:47.550> sure<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.989> all<00:00:49.170> works

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
for parry 3 make sure that it all works

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.610 
for parry 3 make sure that it all works
so<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.010> now<00:00:50.280> if<00:00:50.430> she<00:00:50.610> moves<00:00:50.820> her<00:00:50.969> blade<00:00:51.210> I

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
so that now if she moves her blade I

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.979 
so that now if she moves her blade I
can't<00:00:52.620> touch<00:00:52.829> her<00:00:53.090> at<00:00:54.090> all<00:00:54.390> no<00:00:54.600> matter<00:00:54.719> what

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
can't touch her at all no matter what

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.350 
can't touch her at all no matter what
happens<00:00:55.410> I'm<00:00:55.680> not<00:00:55.949> gonna<00:00:56.129> kill<00:00:56.399> her<00:00:56.520> which<00:00:57.120> is

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
happens I'm not gonna kill her which is

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.170 
happens I'm not gonna kill her which is
what<00:00:57.719> we<00:00:57.809> want<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.020> go<00:00:58.140> for<00:00:58.699> and<00:00:59.699> so<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.059> is

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
what we want to go for and so that is

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.180 
what we want to go for and so that is
how<00:01:00.300> we<00:01:00.359> find<00:01:00.629> distance<00:01:01.079> now<00:01:01.770> something

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
how we find distance now something

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.590 
how we find distance now something
that's<00:01:02.340> going<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.489> be<00:01:02.640> tricky<00:01:02.850> as<00:01:03.180> we<00:01:03.449> do<00:01:03.570> our

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
that's going to be tricky as we do our

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.600 
that's going to be tricky as we do our
fight<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.170> learning<00:01:04.710> how<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:04.949> maintain<00:01:05.250> your

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
fight is learning how to maintain your

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.820 
fight is learning how to maintain your
distance<00:01:06.080> that's<00:01:07.080> something<00:01:07.530> that's<00:01:07.740> going

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
distance that's something that's going

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.230 
distance that's something that's going
to<00:01:07.890> come<00:01:08.010> with<00:01:08.189> practice<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.970> it's<00:01:09.060> going<00:01:09.180> to

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
to come with practice and it's going to

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.890 
to come with practice and it's going to
come<00:01:09.450> with<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:10.049> lot<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.470> repetition<00:01:11.689> you<00:01:12.689> always

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
come with a lot of repetition you always

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.660 
come with a lot of repetition you always
have<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.140> make<00:01:13.170> sure<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.890> you're<00:01:14.220> at<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.400> safe

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
have to make sure that you're at a safe

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.910 
have to make sure that you're at a safe
distance<00:01:14.700> with<00:01:15.240> your<00:01:15.270> partner<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.900> if<00:01:16.619> for

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
distance with your partner and if for

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.830 
distance with your partner and if for
some<00:01:16.950> reason<00:01:17.520> you're<00:01:18.030> fighting<00:01:18.689> you're<00:01:18.810> in

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
some reason you're fighting you're in

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.359 
some reason you're fighting you're in
the<00:01:18.930> middle<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.140> your<00:01:19.229> fight<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:20.009> realize

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
the middle of your fight and you realize

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.499 
the middle of your fight and you realize
you're<00:01:20.580> too<00:01:20.820> close

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
you're too close

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.660 
you're too close
good<00:01:22.409> partnering<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.100> all<00:01:23.250> about<00:01:23.460> knowing

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
good partnering is all about knowing

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.510 
good partnering is all about knowing
when<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.060> stop<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:24.810> what<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:25.890> want<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.130> do<00:01:26.250> is

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
when to stop so what you want to do is

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.149 
when to stop so what you want to do is
if<00:01:26.729> we<00:01:27.240> start<00:01:27.450> off<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:27.840> way<00:01:28.049> we<00:01:28.710> do<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.890> few

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
if we start off this way we do a few

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.679 
if we start off this way we do a few
fight<00:01:29.400> moves<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.820> then<00:01:29.909> somehow<00:01:30.119> we<00:01:30.299> end<00:01:30.540> up

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
fight moves and then somehow we end up

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.160 
fight moves and then somehow we end up
like<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:31.049> should<00:01:31.979> we<00:01:32.009> keep<00:01:32.250> going<00:01:32.900> no<00:01:33.900> we

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
like this should we keep going no we

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.640 
like this should we keep going no we
shouldn't<00:01:34.470> because<00:01:34.799> now<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.430> can<00:01:35.970> hit<00:01:36.119> her<00:01:36.360> and

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
shouldn't because now I can hit her and

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.370 
shouldn't because now I can hit her and
this<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.829> real<00:01:38.130> dangerous<00:01:38.579> at<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.150> mean

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
this is real dangerous at that I mean

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.140 
this is real dangerous at that I mean
it's<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.530> blunt<00:01:40.829> weapon<00:01:41.280> right<00:01:41.460> now<00:01:41.520> because

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
it's a blunt weapon right now because

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.789 
it's a blunt weapon right now because
we're<00:01:42.329> not<00:01:42.450> gonna<00:01:42.630> actually<00:01:42.869> use<00:01:43.110> sharp<00:01:43.560> ones

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
we're not gonna actually use sharp ones

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.080 
we're not gonna actually use sharp ones
because<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.850> would<00:01:45.000> just<00:01:45.180> be<00:01:45.590> interesting

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
because that would just be interesting

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.550 
because that would just be interesting
but<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.299> could<00:01:48.509> still<00:01:48.689> hurt<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.140> could<00:01:49.350> still

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560
