00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.180
 Hi people 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.490
 I'm going to talk about rice cream today. 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.620
 this rice cream is for the skin of the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.790
 face or any part that has 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.429
 stains 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.529
 I used it on my face before I started to 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.480
 make this video prefer to test for 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.369
 three weeks to be sure not to 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.949
 say nothing to you without being sure 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.740
 proven in my leg 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.980
 This cream I made so is first class. 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.590
 it is for those who have acne and blackheads from 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.120
 who has spots on the face or for whom 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.160
 simply want to have more skin 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.320
 velvety 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.070
 so that's how the recipe is first you 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.620
 take a cup of rice and fill it with 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.090
 water cup full of rice and 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.850
 with water 15 minutes mixing to 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.640
 that water turns white 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.149
 then you run this rice but not 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.820
 throw away that water goes to the pot and 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.579
 you take decidesse cup of rice only 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.369
 four tablespoons of rice can be 4 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.140
 tablespoons of rice mixture in the 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.490
 water if you see that water is the 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.350
 enough to cook rice is cakes 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.150
 anyway if you need can add 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.880
 some more no problem depends 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.100
 of the size of the problem 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.240
 after the rice very well cooked without salt 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.670
 without anything 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.890
 It is important that this water from the 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.920
 rice is all blended in the street that goes 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.630
 cooking because it's the one that will have more 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.030
 already have more nutrients than if 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.900
 was a smooth water without having passed through 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.240
 This face, after being cooked, you hit or 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.829
 a blender or with a magic wand 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.009
 As you prefer, but here it is. 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.560
 turn a puree into the paste 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:50.579
 when this folder is made you get two 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:55.590
 teaspoons the rice paste and puts 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:57.719
 I put it in a little pot and 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.350
 I mixed it all right here in two 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:04.020
 teaspoons of the rice paste and a 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.710
 teaspoon of some cream that you 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:11.250
 want can be base can be filter 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.180
 can be day cream or 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.900
 so much does any cream 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.329
 already gives to your skin I use an anti- aging cream 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.790
 acne but he I tested it alone 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:25.329
 several times he did almost nothing but 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.819
 How was a test I caught him? 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:30.760
 because I do not use it anymore he explained 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.159
 so I mixed two teaspoons of 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.230
 cream of this rice paste with a 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:38.859
 Spoon some cream you want 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.379
 Facial mixes people three weeks ago 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:45.099
 that this mixture accepts in its place 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:48.099
 always in the fridge and she smells 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:51.370
 like you did today did not show up 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:53.530
 translating three weeks but I'll do 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.120
 a new one because I already started it 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.700
 starting to change color 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.819
 It means it's rusting but I 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.909
 I say two weeks is sure to last. 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.250
 I've done too much, it's still full. 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:07.900
 I made it with two tablespoons and for 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:13.000
 This is good for you to do with the 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:16.329
 spoons of rice a spoonful of 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:22.930
 some cream tea you want 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:25.780
 I was wearing it only at night in three days 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.689
 I do not have a drastic difference in 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:33.750
 skin to skin really got much more 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:36.489
 Congratulations, people are incredible. 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.099
 I honestly did not vote if I saw 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.260
 this recipe on a website that I usually 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:46.090
 often calls to do with doctors 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:48.489
 dot com I saw the recipe because I 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.709
 I was looking for things to take 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:54.250
 skin blemishes because I have always 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:56.439
 I had a lot of acne and that stain stays 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.180
 then you have very clear skin and 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:01.169
 I have Saturday then any little thing. 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:05.680
 The stain is on and I was searching 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:07.989
 creams to remove skin blemishes have 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.239
 many cosmetics that make the stain more 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.040
 I do not know, I 'm a nature thing. 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:16.570
 family, my father also liked to do 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.680
 lots of mixing of crowns for medicines 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.709
 homemade 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:24.969
 I think I inherited this from him so it's 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.000
 it worked on the spots I say it is 

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:28.970
 complicated 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.730
 that how it got to the whole skin a little 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.350
 more homogeneous so it can not be 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.540
 make a lot of difference because if the 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.360
 messages became clearer the boats 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.640
 I could also see exactly if 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.000
 I had a big stain and used it only 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:47.420
 on it or if I just put it on top of each 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.330
 stain but overall the skin became 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:53.750
 was more publicized and really 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:57.080
 the spines and and I have a lot of thorn and 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.820
 The day after that, I think 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.650
 which is because of the hair of the cream that 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:04.160
 slope in new points 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.950
 but anyway I've seen a lot of difference in 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.460
 three days and now complete three weeks 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:12.830
 and I will not stop ever again 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.660
 this rice cream 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.520
 you can make two you can mix 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.980
 and with evening cream 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.310
 you can mix it with the base instead 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:24.500
 of a cream can or base can or can 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.330
 base and sun cream like you 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.960
 prefer the important thing is that they are two 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.550
 rice measures for one than you 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.880

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:45.350
 of a new wine a few drops or if not 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.200
 have a brand new one can be the vitamin A 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.430
 also that I have been here before 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:06:01.340

00:05:49.430 --> 00:06:04.940
 I wore can for vitamin time too 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:09.830
 if you want I do not do anything just because 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:10.910
 rice in that first row and a cream and 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.070
 It worked 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:16.340
 now the next ones that I'm going to do I 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:20.419
 I'll do ordinary based and one with cream 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:21.940
 and all of them with vitamin A and are 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:24.979
 because they are great 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:27.440
 I hope you liked this 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:30.320

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.940
