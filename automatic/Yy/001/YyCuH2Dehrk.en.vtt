minutes before Minnesota's I took it it

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.830 
minutes before Minnesota's I took it it
would<00:02:04.380> hit<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:05.850> one<00:02:06.030> thing<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.299> did<00:02:06.509> not<00:02:06.630> like

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
would hit the one thing I did not like

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.529 
would hit the one thing I did not like
about<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:07.290> product<00:02:07.590> was<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.940> seemed

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
about that product was that it seemed

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.380 
about that product was that it seemed
that<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:10.140> would<00:02:10.590> peek<00:02:10.890> at<00:02:11.099> points

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
that I would peek at points

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.960 
that I would peek at points
and<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:13.230> it<00:02:13.950> wasn't<00:02:14.100> consistent<00:02:14.550> throughout

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
and and it wasn't consistent throughout

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.880 
and and it wasn't consistent throughout
the<00:02:15.150> whole<00:02:15.330> workout<00:02:15.720> felt<00:02:16.350> that<00:02:16.530> once<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:16.800> was

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
the whole workout felt that once I was

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.050 
the whole workout felt that once I was
getting<00:02:17.100> towards<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.370> end<00:02:17.459> of<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.670> workout<00:02:18.000> I

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
getting towards the end of the workout I

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.840 
getting towards the end of the workout I
mean<00:02:18.240> I<00:02:18.270> have<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.450> pretty<00:02:18.690> long<00:02:18.930> workout<00:02:19.850> maybe

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
mean I have a pretty long workout maybe

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.430 
mean I have a pretty long workout maybe
about<00:02:21.000> an<00:02:21.180> hour<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.480> half<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:22.050> even<00:02:22.260> two

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
about an hour and a half to even two

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.380 
about an hour and a half to even two
hours<00:02:22.500> when<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.490> was<00:02:23.610> getting<00:02:23.730> maybe<00:02:24.000> into<00:02:24.240> the

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
hours when I was getting maybe into the

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.640 
hours when I was getting maybe into the
hour<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:25.080> 10<00:02:25.620> minutes<00:02:25.800> 15<00:02:26.730> minute<00:02:27.410> part<00:02:28.410> of<00:02:28.530> it

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
hour and 10 minutes 15 minute part of it

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.240 
hour and 10 minutes 15 minute part of it
I<00:02:28.830> was<00:02:29.370> just<00:02:29.490> getting<00:02:30.110> weaker<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.470> was<00:02:31.590> my

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
I was just getting weaker and it was my

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.650 
I was just getting weaker and it was my
recovery<00:02:32.670> time<00:02:32.880> I<00:02:32.910> would<00:02:33.060> have<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.270> take<00:02:33.450> more

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
recovery time I would have to take more

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.860 
recovery time I would have to take more
of<00:02:33.690> a<00:02:33.840> break<00:02:34.080> in<00:02:34.320> between<00:02:35.240> my<00:02:36.240> sets<00:02:36.600> and

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
of a break in between my sets and

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.850 
of a break in between my sets and
basically<00:02:37.730> just<00:02:38.730> uh<00:02:38.850> I<00:02:39.470> didn't<00:02:40.470> think<00:02:40.590> that

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
basically just uh I didn't think that

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.220 
basically just uh I didn't think that
that<00:02:41.580> was<00:02:41.640> so<00:02:41.880> much<00:02:42.060> helpful<00:02:42.390> especially<00:02:42.840> if

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
that was so much helpful especially if

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.440 
that was so much helpful especially if
you're<00:02:43.319> trying<00:02:43.350> to<00:02:43.560> get<00:02:43.739> in<00:02:43.860> get<00:02:44.270> the<00:02:45.270> most

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
bang out of the bug I mean especially in

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.699 
bang out of the bug I mean especially in
the<00:02:48.120> amount<00:02:48.270> of<00:02:48.420> time<00:02:48.480> that<00:02:48.630> you<00:02:48.810> have<00:02:48.959> going

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709
