sure yeah yeah nine SKUs in the range
nine<00:01:44.340> SKUs<00:01:44.730> and<00:01:44.760> arranging<00:01:45.300> so<00:01:45.660> we<00:01:45.780> start<00:01:46.050> with

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
nine SKUs and arranging so we start with

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.320 
nine SKUs and arranging so we start with
the<00:01:46.290> radar<00:01:46.650> copter<00:01:47.040> which<00:01:47.130> spot<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.460> showed<00:01:48.180> you

very durable be fine I throw it on the

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.340 
very durable be fine I throw it on the
floor<00:02:12.920> just<00:02:13.690> you've<00:02:14.690> probably<00:02:14.900> heard<00:02:15.140> the

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
floor just you've probably heard the

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.110 
floor just you've probably heard the
sound<00:02:15.590> of<00:02:15.710> that<00:02:15.890> I'm<00:02:16.370> gonna<00:02:16.520> press<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:16.940> juice

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
sound of that I'm gonna press the juice

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.310 
sound of that I'm gonna press the juice
but<00:02:17.360> in<00:02:17.510> front<00:02:17.630> of<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.810> camera<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:18.200> it's

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
but in front of the camera and it's

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.559 
but in front of the camera and it's
gonna<00:02:18.440> work<00:02:18.650> first<00:02:19.010> time

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.619 

in<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.019> juice<00:02:24.200> hotel<00:02:25.189> after<00:02:25.489> all<00:02:25.939> so<00:02:26.450> that's

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
in the juice hotel after all so that's

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.789

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.770 
radar copter at $24.99 retail dollars
Emma<00:02:31.579> got<00:02:31.730> public<00:02:32.120> property<00:02:32.389> which<00:02:32.510> I<00:02:32.629> just

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
Emma got public property which I just

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.739 
Emma got public property which I just
showed<00:02:32.870> you<00:02:33.049> $29.99<00:02:34.389> then<00:02:35.389> we<00:02:35.450> have<00:02:35.540> hot<00:02:35.719> and

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:35.749 
showed you $29.99 then we have hot and

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:38.050 
showed you $29.99 then we have hot and
cold<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:36.170> grow<00:02:36.439> which<00:02:37.099> is<00:02:37.129> like<00:02:37.489> this<00:02:37.819> model

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
cold to grow which is like this model

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.720 
cold to grow which is like this model
but<00:02:38.780> now<00:02:38.930> comes<00:02:39.260> with<00:02:39.409> a<00:02:39.439> forceful<00:02:40.250> handset

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
but now comes with a forceful handset

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.660 
but now comes with a forceful handset
sling<00:02:41.659> TX<00:02:41.930> dancer<00:02:42.379> so<00:02:42.799> now<00:02:42.920> you<00:02:42.980> got<00:02:43.189> joystick

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
sling TX dancer so now you got joystick

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.569 
sling TX dancer so now you got joystick
control<00:02:44.090> so<00:02:44.750> it'll<00:02:44.930> do<00:02:45.049> everything<00:02:45.290> a<00:02:45.980> regular

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
control so it'll do everything a regular

control so it'll do everything a regular
to<00:02:47.000> channel<00:02:47.329> helicopter<00:02:47.870> so<00:02:48.799> it'll<00:02:49.069> fly<00:02:49.340> up

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
to channel helicopter so it'll fly up

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.270 
to channel helicopter so it'll fly up
it'll<00:02:49.969> fly<00:02:50.239> forwards<00:02:51.200> you<00:02:51.650> can<00:02:51.829> bring<00:02:52.010> it<00:02:52.129> back

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
it'll fly forwards you can bring it back

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.069 
it'll fly forwards you can bring it back
round<00:02:52.579> and<00:02:52.760> you<00:02:52.819> can<00:02:52.969> land<00:02:53.150> it<00:02:53.329> big

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
round and you can land it big

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.349 
round and you can land it big

artificial intelligence in a helicopter
for<00:03:22.819> the<00:03:22.879> first<00:03:23.120> time<00:03:23.329> so<00:03:23.989> put<00:03:24.230> that

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
for the first time so put that

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:25.869 
for the first time so put that
technology<00:03:24.560> into<00:03:24.980> this<00:03:25.219> it's<00:03:25.549> a<00:03:25.609> large

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
technology into this it's a large

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.179 
technology into this it's a large
helicopter<00:03:26.540> that's<00:03:27.169> working<00:03:27.799> on<00:03:27.919> three

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:28.189 
helicopter that's working on three

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:30.219 
helicopter that's working on three
channels<00:03:28.609> and<00:03:29.150> it's<00:03:29.299> got<00:03:29.479> a<00:03:29.509> gyro<00:03:29.810> so<00:03:30.049> it's

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:30.229 
channels and it's got a gyro so it's

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:32.830 
channels and it's got a gyro so it's
very<00:03:30.470> very<00:03:30.769> stable<00:03:31.030> so<00:03:32.030> again<00:03:32.299> you<00:03:32.479> start<00:03:32.750> off

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
very very stable so again you start off

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.929 
very very stable so again you start off
with<00:03:33.019> this<00:03:33.109> on<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.349> floor<00:03:33.560> hit<00:03:34.310> the<00:03:34.459> juice<00:03:34.639> but

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:34.939 
with this on the floor hit the juice but

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:37.030 
with this on the floor hit the juice but
not<00:03:35.239> the<00:03:35.359> accelerator<00:03:35.900> to<00:03:36.229> get<00:03:36.650> it<00:03:36.739> to<00:03:36.829> take

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
not the accelerator to get it to take

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.860 
not the accelerator to get it to take
off<00:03:37.280> so<00:03:38.000> hit<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.209> juice<00:03:38.419> button<00:03:38.750> it<00:03:38.810> will

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
off so hit the juice button it will

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.689 
off so hit the juice button it will
automatically<00:03:39.439> take<00:03:39.680> off<00:03:39.919> and<00:03:40.310> it'll<00:03:40.430> rise

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:40.699 
automatically take off and it'll rise

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:42.939 
automatically take off and it'll rise
3/4<00:03:41.449> of<00:03:41.509> a<00:03:41.599> meter<00:03:41.750> and<00:03:42.349> it<00:03:42.439> will<00:03:42.620> stay

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:42.949 
3/4 of a meter and it will stay

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:46.050 
3/4 of a meter and it will stay
perfectly<00:03:43.579> still<00:03:43.909> it

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
perfectly still it

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.759 
perfectly still it
combination<00:03:47.060> of<00:03:47.180> water<00:03:47.390> take<00:03:47.870> up<00:03:48.050> auto<00:03:48.349> cover

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
combination of water take up auto cover

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.820 
combination of water take up auto cover
an<00:03:49.340> auto<00:03:49.519> land<00:03:49.940> has<00:03:50.090> given<00:03:50.330> us<00:03:50.450> the<00:03:50.750> auto<00:03:51.049> pile

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
an auto land has given us the auto pile

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.509 
an auto land has given us the auto pile
so<00:03:52.400> even<00:03:52.640> an<00:03:52.730> apple<00:03:52.879> music<00:03:54.159> and<00:03:55.159> whether<00:03:55.340> you

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
so even an apple music and whether you

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.750 
so even an apple music and whether you
turn<00:03:55.670> on<00:03:55.760> that<00:03:55.879> one<00:03:56.090> and<00:03:56.390> that<00:03:56.420> one<00:03:56.629> is<00:03:56.870> $49<00:03:57.769> we

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
turn on that one and that one is $49 we

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.080 
turn on that one and that one is $49 we
have<00:03:58.849> a<00:03:58.879> rocket<00:03:59.629> shuttle

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
have a rocket shuttle

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.000 
have a rocket shuttle
so<00:04:01.690> this<00:04:01.840> is<00:04:01.959> a<00:04:01.989> rocket<00:04:02.440> measures<00:04:02.800> about<00:04:02.890> a

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
so this is a rocket measures about a

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.550 
so this is a rocket measures about a
foot<00:04:03.250> tall<00:04:03.520> as<00:04:04.120> propellers<00:04:04.630> at<00:04:04.750> the<00:04:04.810> base<00:04:04.989> and
