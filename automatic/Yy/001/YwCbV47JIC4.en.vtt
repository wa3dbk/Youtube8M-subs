00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.030
 with the move 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.730
 possible today again ratios 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.780
 ours without stories of ours collecting 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.470
 shuffle what's between them 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.460
 the stars 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:04.460
 that's the experiment really 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:09.270
 try the selection right in this 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:13.020
 this spirit just gray clinician 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:17.060
 and the direct retract and that 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:21.660
 optimal but the work uploads 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.670
 know the way so consistent and compatible 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.890
 been ministry because it's exactly like that 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.660
 that we are our program then you are 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:33.800
 easy free costs much more 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.800
 to concentrate 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.150
 on 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.300
 Bank metal scene is all about the 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.340
 decided place of transitions new 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.349
 interprets the only thing that exists 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.510
 the layer cover versions play or 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:23.400
 black sabbath cover versions and 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:27.459
 different benchmarks of his number 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.319
 that was just such an experiment for 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.040
 Just give us some songs on the private side 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:35.590
 stones and inspired andechs 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.810
 but sound to give only to the 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:43.569
 use as usual of the contemporary 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.849
 of alignment and 4x especially 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:50.140
 from the lyrics more so big of the interest 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:51.700
 the endgame in this fled into this 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:58.410
 concept one fit 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.410
 in which will work swing 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.330
 the first time really 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:41.519
 they are maximum interpretation or of 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:45.359
 Los Angeles with 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:47.069
 while we are often very very fine 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:50.780
 For example, the number one week now 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:54.750
 the air is at the same level 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.030
 need children of the sunrise 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.180
 currently very important for the time 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:04.349
 is the song stops with the students 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.599
 Children are ready to be born at night 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.790
 are and we are children the dawn 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:12.180
 look for the sunrise and that is 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:15.180
 actually very compatible it is 25 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.329
 or 30 o'clock forest swimming pool of one 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.220
 very extraordinary satellite 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:26.030
 There are noisy loud fires 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.030
 whisper record the album 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:33.550
 And this text is just emotional 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:37.030
 and I agree I just believe it 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.950
 set levels expanded 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.480
 the stove number sometimes behind whole 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:44.970
 number the relax this again 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:50.380
 reinterpretation of an original part of the 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:53.430
 Listen to three models quite like that on cyclists 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.430
 you do not do that at all 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:35.569
 continue text to say more there 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:38.419
 transmitter of the information is as 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:40.430
 the children and themselves but this game 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:43.279
 invest our release in one 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:46.449
 modern together modern modern 

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:51.050
 contemporary tune to intone and 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:53.090
 to find daniel to insert in 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.120
 this new musical construct 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:59.330
 even on the same ground construction 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:02.860
 this original that was what we loved 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.860
 very irritated 

00:07:54.689 --> 00:08:00.459
 The spider volume is totally always 

00:07:57.819 --> 00:08:03.389
 especially if muslime compatible or 

00:08:00.459 --> 00:08:03.389
 mainz from the clock
