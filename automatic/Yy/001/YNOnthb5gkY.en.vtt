mrs.<00:00:01.319> Cathy<00:00:01.800> she's<00:00:02.190> putting<00:00:02.520> any<00:00:02.700> threads

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
mrs. Cathy she's putting any threads

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.289 
mrs. Cathy she's putting any threads
here<00:00:03.300> on<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:04.370> machine<00:00:05.370> tying<00:00:05.970> them<00:00:06.150> together

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
here on the machine tying them together

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.830 
here on the machine tying them together
so<00:00:06.750> that<00:00:06.779> they<00:00:06.899> can<00:00:07.580> be<00:00:08.580> you<00:00:08.790> can't<00:00:09.240> explain

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
so that they can be you can't explain

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.580 
so that they can be you can't explain
what<00:00:10.019> you're<00:00:10.139> doing<00:00:10.349> there<00:00:11.750> I'm<00:00:12.750> putting<00:00:13.380> on

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
what you're doing there I'm putting on

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.890 
what you're doing there I'm putting on
different<00:00:14.280> colors<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:15.030> colors<00:00:15.330> I'll<00:00:15.480> use<00:00:15.660> for

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
different colors the colors I'll use for

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.090 
different colors the colors I'll use for
my<00:00:15.990> next<00:00:16.230> design<00:00:16.740> onto<00:00:17.250> each<00:00:18.210> spool<00:00:18.720> then<00:00:19.680> in

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
my next design onto each spool then in

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.220 
my next design onto each spool then in
order<00:00:20.310> not<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.640> have<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.150> actually<00:00:21.660> manually

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
order not to have to actually manually

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.689 
order not to have to actually manually
thread<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.250> whole<00:00:23.689> route<00:00:24.689> again<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:26.130> tie<00:00:26.640> the

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
thread the whole route again you tie the

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.140 
thread the whole route again you tie the
thread<00:00:27.449> from<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.650> last<00:00:29.070> spool<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.820> was<00:00:30.000> on

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
thread from the last spool that was on

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.600 
thread from the last spool that was on
here<00:00:30.449> onto<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.990> new<00:00:31.140> spool<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.859> then<00:00:32.369> once

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
here onto the new spool and then once

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.880 
here onto the new spool and then once
you<00:00:32.820> tie<00:00:33.090> all<00:00:33.570> these<00:00:33.840> knots<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.440> if<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.649> tie<00:00:34.860> a

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
you tie all these knots and if you tie a

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.380 
you tie all these knots and if you tie a
particularly<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:36.170> special<00:00:37.170> knot<00:00:37.410> here<00:00:38.059> that<00:00:39.059> is

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
particularly a special knot here that is

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.030 
particularly a special knot here that is
small<00:00:39.750> enough<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:40.200> actually<00:00:40.350> go<00:00:40.680> through<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
small enough to actually go through the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.100 
small enough to actually go through the
needle<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.579> can<00:00:41.610> pull<00:00:42.090> them<00:00:42.270> through<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:42.960> all

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
needle you can pull them through so all

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.090 
needle you can pull them through so all
of<00:00:43.320> these<00:00:43.469> now<00:00:43.800> are<00:00:45.230> ready<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.440> be<00:00:46.800> pulled

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
of these now are ready to be pulled

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.860 
of these now are ready to be pulled
through<00:00:47.899> onto<00:00:49.460> into<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.640> needle<00:00:52.670> now<00:00:53.870> sit

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
through onto into the needle now sit

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.130 
through onto into the needle now sit
down<00:00:54.899> here<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.940> grab<00:00:56.989> with<00:00:57.989> my<00:00:58.230> tweezers<00:00:58.620> a

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
down here and grab with my tweezers a

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.020 
down here and grab with my tweezers a
couple<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.559> threads<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.370> start<00:01:03.329> pulling

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
couple of the threads and start pulling

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.030 
couple of the threads and start pulling
so<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.060> just<00:01:06.450> pull<00:01:06.750> them<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.170> goes<00:01:07.350> all<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.740> way

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
so I just pull them it goes all the way

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.270 
so I just pull them it goes all the way
through<00:01:08.549> all<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.270> various<00:01:13.280> tension

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
through all of the various tension

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.030 
through all of the various tension
devices<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.780> then<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.710> pulls

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
devices and so on and then it pulls

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.530 
devices and so on and then it pulls
directly<00:01:17.490> through<00:01:18.439> the<00:01:19.439> needle<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:23.540> so

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
directly through the needle and so

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.970 
directly through the needle and so
here's<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.080> next<00:01:25.259> two

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.540 

and<00:01:30.980> I<00:01:31.160> pull<00:01:31.400> it<00:01:31.550> through<00:01:31.990> here<00:01:32.990> they<00:01:33.230> come<00:01:33.550> all

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
and I pull it through here they come all

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.940 
and I pull it through here they come all
the<00:01:35.030> way<00:01:35.180> around<00:01:35.570> just<00:01:35.690> the<00:01:35.960> way<00:01:36.170> they<00:01:36.350> should

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
the way around just the way they should

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.070 
the way around just the way they should
straight<00:01:37.430> through<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:37.820> needle<00:01:38.180> no<00:01:38.540> problem

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
straight through the needle no problem

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.920 
straight through the needle no problem
and<00:01:39.670> cut<00:01:40.670> them<00:01:40.850> off<00:01:42.070> so<00:01:43.070> I<00:01:43.400> do<00:01:43.910> that<00:01:44.240> with<00:01:44.600> all

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
and cut them off so I do that with all

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.860 
and cut them off so I do that with all
of<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.470> changes<00:01:45.740> there<00:01:46.580> are<00:01:46.780> ten<00:01:48.340> needles<00:01:49.340> in

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
of the changes there are ten needles in

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:56.670 
of the changes there are ten needles in
this<00:01:50.870> case<00:01:51.260> I've<00:01:51.940> changed<00:01:54.190> nine<00:01:55.190> of<00:01:55.550> the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
this case I've changed nine of the

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.680 
this case I've changed nine of the
thread<00:01:57.680> colors<00:01:58.130> and<00:01:58.580> left<00:01:59.500> needle<00:02:00.500> number<00:02:00.980> ten

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
thread colors and left needle number ten

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.280 
thread colors and left needle number ten
the<00:02:02.690> same<00:02:03.080> I<00:02:04.030> don't<00:02:05.030> say<00:02:05.300> buy<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.540> whole<00:02:05.870> three

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
the same I don't say buy the whole three

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.130 
the same I don't say buy the whole three
through<00:02:06.620> one<00:02:06.860> this<00:02:07.040> one<00:02:10.810> straight<00:02:11.810> through

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
through one this one straight through

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:22.960 
through one this one straight through
the<00:02:12.290> needle<00:02:17.080> so<00:02:18.080> it<00:02:19.870> saves<00:02:20.870> a<00:02:21.050> lot<00:02:21.080> of<00:02:21.260> time<00:02:21.970> so

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
the needle so it saves a lot of time so

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.320 
the needle so it saves a lot of time so
there<00:02:23.240> we<00:02:23.330> go<00:02:23.480> I'm<00:02:23.870> all<00:02:24.020> ready<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.470> sew<00:02:24.650> just

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
there we go I'm all ready to sew just

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.170 
there we go I'm all ready to sew just
like<00:02:26.330> that<00:02:26.600> I<00:02:28.450> take<00:02:29.450> my<00:02:29.690> item<00:02:30.200> that's<00:02:30.500> been

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
like that I take my item that's been

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:41.400 
like that I take my item that's been
cooped<00:02:32.180> with<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:33.940> proper<00:02:34.940> stabilizer<00:02:40.060> and

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
cooped with the proper stabilizer and

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.860 
cooped with the proper stabilizer and
place<00:02:42.410> it<00:02:42.709> on

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.220 

on<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:47.020> frame<00:02:47.850> now<00:02:48.850> just<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.330> make<00:02:49.540> sure<00:02:49.570> that

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
on the frame now just to make sure that

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.320 
on the frame now just to make sure that
this<00:02:50.440> is<00:02:50.590> going<00:02:50.860> to<00:02:50.950> fit<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.580> design<00:02:52.030> is

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
this is going to fit the design is

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.600 
this is going to fit the design is
centered<00:02:52.720> properly<00:02:53.050> I'm<00:02:53.740> going<00:02:54.190> to<00:02:54.250> come<00:02:54.430> back

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
centered properly I'm going to come back

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.200 
centered properly I'm going to come back
here<00:02:54.940> push<00:02:55.480> that<00:02:55.750> button<00:02:56.110> watch<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.430> needle

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
here push that button watch the needle

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.270 
here push that button watch the needle
that<00:02:58.330> comes<00:02:58.600> down<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:58.900> little<00:02:59.140> and<00:02:59.860> it's<00:03:00.100> gonna

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
that comes down a little and it's gonna

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.200 
that comes down a little and it's gonna
trace<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.730> outline<00:03:01.420> of<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.780> design<00:03:02.170> I<00:03:03.210> have

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
trace the outline of the design I have

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.930 
trace the outline of the design I have
to<00:03:04.270> make<00:03:04.540> sure<00:03:05.160> that<00:03:06.160> it's<00:03:06.340> not<00:03:06.490> going<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:06.730> come

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
to make sure that it's not going to come

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.280 
to make sure that it's not going to come
