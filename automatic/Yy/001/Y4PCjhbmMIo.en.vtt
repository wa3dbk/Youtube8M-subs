00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
in this quest for your own nine perks if

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.469 
in this quest for your own nine perks if
you<00:01:47.670> want<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.030> get<00:01:48.180> those<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:49.850> the<00:01:50.850> last<00:01:51.119> one

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
you want to get those and the last one

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.810 
you want to get those and the last one
the<00:01:52.170> last<00:01:52.200> perk<00:01:52.649> like<00:01:52.890> once<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.369> get<00:01:53.549> eight

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
the last perk like once you get eight

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.030 
the last perk like once you get eight
perk<00:01:54.270> slots<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.810> believe<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.680> maximum

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
perk slots I believe that is the maximum

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.389 
perk slots I believe that is the maximum
so<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:57.180> believe<00:01:57.990> four<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.740> maximum<00:01:59.250> of

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
so I believe four is the maximum of

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.880 
so I believe four is the maximum of
these<00:01:59.850> free<00:02:00.119> perk<00:02:00.360> swaps<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.990> can<00:02:01.200> collect<00:02:01.530> in

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
these free perk swaps you can collect in

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.090 
these free perk swaps you can collect in
one<00:02:02.340> game<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.000> then<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:04.320> purple<00:02:04.770> just

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
one game and then the purple just

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.219 
one game and then the purple just
disappears<00:02:05.670> because<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:06.299> managed<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:06.960> get

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
disappears because I managed to get

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.010 
disappears because I managed to get
eight<00:02:07.860> perk<00:02:08.429> slots<00:02:08.849> in<00:02:09.119> three<00:02:09.660> different

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
eight perk slots in three different

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.990 
eight perk slots in three different
games<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.619> never<00:02:10.860> got<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.280> ninth<00:02:11.489> one<00:02:11.790> so

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
games and I never got the ninth one so

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.470 
games and I never got the ninth one so
I'm<00:02:12.120> guessing

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
I'm guessing

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.890 
I'm guessing
