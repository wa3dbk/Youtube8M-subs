so<00:02:06.820> it's<00:02:06.939> nice<00:02:07.090> to<00:02:07.299> see<00:02:07.479> them<00:02:07.630> finally<00:02:07.869> with

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
so it's nice to see them finally with

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.360 
so it's nice to see them finally with
some<00:02:08.319> finish<00:02:08.619> fully<00:02:08.920> sanded<00:02:11.640> over<00:02:12.640> here<00:02:13.000> is<00:02:13.209> a

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
some finish fully sanded over here is a

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.220 
some finish fully sanded over here is a
small<00:02:15.370> bandsaw<00:02:15.909> that<00:02:16.150> I<00:02:16.329> recently<00:02:16.659> just<00:02:17.019> got

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
small bandsaw that I recently just got

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.760 
small bandsaw that I recently just got
set<00:02:17.530> up<00:02:17.560> finally<00:02:18.189> I<00:02:19.140> did<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.290> little<00:02:20.500> research

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
set up finally I did a little research

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.640 
set up finally I did a little research
on<00:02:21.190> it<00:02:21.370> there's<00:02:21.610> a<00:02:21.720> one<00:02:22.720> little<00:02:22.840> tag<00:02:23.200> on<00:02:23.470> it

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
on it there's a one little tag on it

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.350 
on it there's a one little tag on it
from

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
from

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.240 
from
I<00:02:24.390> assume<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.230> machinery<00:02:25.680> dealer<00:02:28.130> when<00:02:29.130> it

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
I assume the machinery dealer when it

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.350 
I assume the machinery dealer when it
came<00:02:29.430> in<00:02:29.640> or<00:02:30.480> when<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:30.810> got<00:02:30.990> sold<00:02:31.290> I<00:02:31.470> guess<00:02:31.650> I<00:02:32.360> can

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
came in or when I got sold I guess I can

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.190 
came in or when I got sold I guess I can
have<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.540> look<00:02:33.660> at<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:33.960> right<00:02:34.050> here<00:02:34.110> actually<00:02:36.200> so

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
have a look at it right here actually so

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.880 
have a look at it right here actually so
just<00:02:37.620> off<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:38.990> that<00:02:39.990> number<00:02:40.290> there<00:02:40.620> bu<00:02:41.300> 801<00:02:42.300> I

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
just off of that number there bu 801 I

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.880 
just off of that number there bu 801 I
was<00:02:43.890> able<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.190> determine<00:02:45.110> this<00:02:46.110> machine<00:02:46.710> was

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
was able to determine this machine was

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:54.470 
was able to determine this machine was
made<00:02:47.040> in<00:02:47.220> Bulgaria<00:02:49.070> around<00:02:50.570> 1979<00:02:51.890> 1980<00:02:53.480> which

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
made in Bulgaria around 1979 1980 which

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.090 
made in Bulgaria around 1979 1980 which
makes<00:02:54.720> sense<00:02:54.990> because<00:02:55.350> this<00:02:55.440> machine<00:02:55.770> came

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
makes sense because this machine came

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.330 
makes sense because this machine came
from<00:02:56.250> another<00:02:57.260> from<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.380> guy<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:58.590> I<00:02:59.010> got

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
from another from a guy that I got

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.790 
from another from a guy that I got
another<00:02:59.550> machine<00:03:00.110> which<00:03:01.110> it<00:03:01.260> actually<00:03:01.470> said

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
another machine which it actually said

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.030 
another machine which it actually said
1982<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:03.330> I<00:03:03.390> think<00:03:03.630> it's<00:03:04.640> same<00:03:05.640> type<00:03:06.240> of

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
1982 and I think it's same type of

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.040 
1982 and I think it's same type of
European<00:03:08.040> machine<00:03:08.790> as<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.870> 32<00:03:10.500> inch<00:03:10.530> throat<00:03:11.070> and

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
European machine as a 32 inch throat and

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.380 
European machine as a 32 inch throat and
close<00:03:13.050> to<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.230> 20<00:03:13.530> inch<00:03:13.680> resaw<00:03:14.240> although<00:03:15.240> I'll

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
close to the 20 inch resaw although I'll

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.260 
close to the 20 inch resaw although I'll
typically<00:03:15.959> be<00:03:16.200> using<00:03:16.380> my<00:03:16.700> minimax<00:03:17.700> bandsaw

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
typically be using my minimax bandsaw

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.930 
typically be using my minimax bandsaw
for<00:03:18.570> my<00:03:18.660> Reese<00:03:18.870> on<00:03:19.340> which<00:03:20.340> before<00:03:20.670> I<00:03:20.730> had<00:03:20.880> to

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
for my Reese on which before I had to

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.370 
for my Reese on which before I had to
switch<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.300> blade<00:03:21.480> on<00:03:21.660> and<00:03:21.810> off<00:03:21.900> all<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.200> time

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
switch the blade on and off all the time

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.220 
switch the blade on and off all the time
take<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.709> fence<00:03:22.980> off<00:03:23.250> do<00:03:23.550> this<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:23.970> that

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
take the fence off do this and that

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.810 
take the fence off do this and that
so<00:03:25.230> this<00:03:25.380> saw<00:03:25.590> here<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.160> fence<00:03:26.400> should<00:03:26.610> stay

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
so this saw here the fence should stay

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:27.680 
so this saw here the fence should stay
on<00:03:26.850> all<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.270> time

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
on all the time

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.560 
on all the time
and<00:03:28.190> this<00:03:29.190> is<00:03:29.340> actually<00:03:29.640> my<00:03:29.760> first<00:03:29.970> 1<00:03:30.390> inch

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
and this is actually my first 1 inch

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.820 
and this is actually my first 1 inch
wide<00:03:30.780> blade<00:03:32.660> that<00:03:33.660> I<00:03:33.750> got<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:34.080> try<00:03:34.350> on<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:34.680> and

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
wide blade that I got to try on it and

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.810 
wide blade that I got to try on it and
it<00:03:34.890> works<00:03:35.070> really<00:03:35.280> well

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.259 

it's<00:03:38.820> a<00:03:38.880> minimax<00:03:39.330> mm<00:03:39.810> 20<00:03:40.610> it's<00:03:41.610> done<00:03:41.790> done

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
it's a minimax mm 20 it's done done

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.390 
it's a minimax mm 20 it's done done
really<00:03:42.510> well<00:03:42.720> I've<00:03:42.959> really<00:03:43.709> had<00:03:43.890> no<00:03:44.040> issues

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
really well I've really had no issues

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.790 
really well I've really had no issues
with<00:03:44.550> it<00:03:45.200> it<00:03:46.200> may<00:03:46.380> be<00:03:46.410> time<00:03:46.739> to<00:03:48.260> replace<00:03:49.260> my

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
with it it may be time to replace my

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.870 
with it it may be time to replace my
thrust<00:03:50.280> bearing<00:03:51.320> but<00:03:52.320> other<00:03:52.500> than<00:03:52.620> that<00:03:52.880> it's

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
thrust bearing but other than that it's

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.400 
thrust bearing but other than that it's
done<00:03:54.030> really<00:03:54.239> well<00:03:55.370> although<00:03:56.370> this<00:03:56.519> one<00:03:56.700> here

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
done really well although this one here

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.840 
done really well although this one here
which<00:03:58.410> is<00:03:58.440> just<00:03:59.400> a<00:03:59.580> wee<00:03:59.760> bit<00:03:59.790> bigger<00:04:00.530> is<00:04:01.530> is<00:04:02.489> a

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
which is just a wee bit bigger is is a

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.210 
which is just a wee bit bigger is is a
just<00:04:03.720> pure<00:04:03.989> dream<00:04:04.290> to<00:04:04.410> use<00:04:04.620> you<00:04:04.860> almost<00:04:05.070> don't

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
just pure dream to use you almost don't

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.130 
just pure dream to use you almost don't
have<00:04:05.340> to<00:04:05.489> worry<00:04:05.700> about<00:04:05.820> what<00:04:06.120> side<00:04:06.390> you're

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
have to worry about what side you're

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.040 
have to worry about what side you're
starting<00:04:07.530> to<00:04:07.620> cut<00:04:07.800> any<00:04:07.950> of<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.100> curves<00:04:08.430> from

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
starting to cut any of the curves from

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.449 
starting to cut any of the curves from
just<00:04:10.050> because<00:04:10.320> of<00:04:10.410> the<00:04:10.500> size<00:04:10.709> of<00:04:10.830> the<00:04:10.920> throat<00:04:11.220> I

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
just because of the size of the throat I

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.440 
just because of the size of the throat I
have<00:04:11.700> a<00:04:11.730> 3/8<00:04:13.100> 3<00:04:14.100> TPI<00:04:14.489> blade<00:04:14.880> on<00:04:15.120> it<00:04:15.300> and

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
have a 3/8 3 TPI blade on it and

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.259 
have a 3/8 3 TPI blade on it and
actually<00:04:16.229> came<00:04:16.590> with<00:04:16.620> Carter<00:04:17.100> guides<00:04:17.340> so<00:04:18.150> the

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
actually came with Carter guides so the

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.780 
actually came with Carter guides so the
guides<00:04:18.479> have<00:04:18.660> already<00:04:18.989> been<00:04:19.220> replaced<00:04:20.220> on<00:04:20.580> it

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
guides have already been replaced on it

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.719 
guides have already been replaced on it
and<00:04:21.380> this<00:04:22.380> is<00:04:22.440> a<00:04:22.590> bandsaw<00:04:23.100> blade<00:04:23.370> just<00:04:23.550> from<00:04:23.700> a

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
and this is a bandsaw blade just from a

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.900 
and this is a bandsaw blade just from a
local<00:04:24.330> manufacturer<00:04:24.990> or<00:04:25.410> indie<00:04:26.160> band<00:04:26.430> saw<00:04:26.640> in

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
local manufacturer or indie band saw in

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.860 
local manufacturer or indie band saw in
Brampton<00:04:27.690> Ontario<00:04:28.700> it's<00:04:29.700> inexpensive<00:04:30.240> it's

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
Brampton Ontario it's inexpensive it's

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.010 
Brampton Ontario it's inexpensive it's
local<00:04:31.350> and<00:04:32.090> it<00:04:33.090> works<00:04:33.300> really<00:04:33.630> really<00:04:33.750> well

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
local and it works really really well

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:40.470 
local and it works really really well

I just haven't actually epoxy them on

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.420 
I just haven't actually epoxy them on
yet<00:04:52.350> sanding<00:04:53.350> has<00:04:53.470> really<00:04:53.770> come<00:04:53.920> along<00:04:54.190> this

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
yet sanding has really come along this

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.950 
yet sanding has really come along this
wood<00:04:54.640> has<00:04:54.760> a<00:04:54.790> lot<00:04:55.000> of<00:04:55.120> stress<00:04:55.390> in<00:04:55.420> a<00:04:55.630> lot<00:04:55.840> of

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
wood has a lot of stress in a lot of

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.940 
wood has a lot of stress in a lot of
cracks<00:04:56.310> so<00:04:57.310> there's<00:04:57.550> been<00:04:57.790> a<00:04:57.820> lot<00:04:58.090> of<00:04:58.240> extra

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
cracks so there's been a lot of extra

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.670 
cracks so there's been a lot of extra
extra<00:04:59.950> work<00:05:00.130> on<00:05:00.310> it<00:05:00.490> along<00:05:00.700> the<00:05:00.850> way<00:05:01.530> you<00:05:02.530> can

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
extra work on it along the way you can

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.790 
extra work on it along the way you can
see<00:05:02.890> here<00:05:03.250> some<00:05:03.640> of<00:05:03.670> the<00:05:03.820> black<00:05:04.030> epoxy<00:05:07.800> that

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
see here some of the black epoxy that

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.750 
see here some of the black epoxy that
fills<00:05:09.220> in<00:05:09.460> some<00:05:09.610> of<00:05:09.760> the<00:05:11.040> the<00:05:12.040> cracks<00:05:12.370> and

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.720 
fills in some of the the cracks and
whatnot<00:05:13.090> so<00:05:13.920> when<00:05:14.920> we<00:05:14.980> get<00:05:15.100> to<00:05:15.220> this<00:05:15.340> stage<00:05:15.550> I

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
whatnot so when we get to this stage I

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.790 
whatnot so when we get to this stage I
like<00:05:15.880> to<00:05:16.000> tape<00:05:16.180> off<00:05:16.390> the<00:05:16.420> area<00:05:16.870> around<00:05:17.080> the

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
like to tape off the area around the

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.040 
like to tape off the area around the
imperfection<00:05:18.490> that<00:05:19.480> way<00:05:19.600> you<00:05:19.660> can<00:05:19.870> use<00:05:20.020> a

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
imperfection that way you can use a

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.560 
imperfection that way you can use a
palette<00:05:20.470> knife<00:05:20.500> and<00:05:20.800> really<00:05:21.130> get<00:05:22.000> the<00:05:22.120> epoxy

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
palette knife and really get the epoxy

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.180 
palette knife and really get the epoxy
in<00:05:22.750> where<00:05:23.260> it<00:05:23.350> needs<00:05:23.530> to<00:05:23.710> be<00:05:24.180> and<00:05:25.770> then<00:05:26.770> sand<00:05:27.070> it

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
in where it needs to be and then sand it

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.410 
in where it needs to be and then sand it
away<00:05:27.430> from<00:05:27.640> there<00:05:28.320> so<00:05:29.320> it's<00:05:29.440> had<00:05:29.560> it<00:05:29.680> done<00:05:30.360> to<00:05:31.360> a

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.420 
away from there so it's had it done to a

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.730 
away from there so it's had it done to a
lot<00:05:31.600> of<00:05:31.630> different<00:05:31.780> places<00:05:32.110> on<00:05:32.380> the<00:05:32.470> chair

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
lot of different places on the chair

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.850 
lot of different places on the chair
give<00:05:33.550> you<00:05:33.610> a<00:05:34.110> little<00:05:35.110> bit<00:05:35.200> of<00:05:35.320> an<00:05:35.410> example<00:05:35.740> here

give you a little bit of an example here
kind<00:05:38.860> of<00:05:38.920> see<00:05:39.190> what<00:05:39.370> it<00:05:39.490> looks<00:05:39.670> like

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.140 

pretty<00:05:47.560> excited<00:05:47.950> to<00:05:48.010> get<00:05:48.100> this<00:05:48.190> chair<00:05:48.430> done

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.620 

never<00:05:52.150> worked<00:05:52.420> with<00:05:52.510> this<00:05:52.720> wood<00:05:52.900> before<00:05:54.630> kind

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
never worked with this wood before kind

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.430 
never worked with this wood before kind
of<00:05:55.720> fought<00:05:55.960> me<00:05:56.140> the<00:05:57.010> entire<00:05:57.250> time<00:05:57.310> but<00:05:57.910> in<00:05:58.450> the

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
of fought me the entire time but in the

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.420 
of fought me the entire time but in the
end<00:05:59.590> I<00:05:59.680> think<00:05:59.740> it's<00:06:00.010> really<00:06:00.190> going<00:06:00.310> to<00:06:00.370> be

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
end I think it's really going to be

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.520 
end I think it's really going to be
worth<00:06:00.670> it<00:06:03.210> here<00:06:04.210> we<00:06:04.420> have<00:06:04.600> the<00:06:04.990> dining<00:06:05.230> chair
