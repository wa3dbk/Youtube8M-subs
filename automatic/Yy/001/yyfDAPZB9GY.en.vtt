time digitally but I have to say this is

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.469 
time digitally but I have to say this is
for<00:01:10.890> somebody<00:01:11.130> who<00:01:11.369> appreciates<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:12.119> actual

work<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.840> art<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.350> what<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.920> time<00:01:14.189> displayed

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
work of art and what the time displayed

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.490 
work of art and what the time displayed
to<00:01:14.909> them<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.299> little<00:01:15.930> bit<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.140> different

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
to them in a little bit of a different

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.710 
to them in a little bit of a different
way<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.369> bet<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.939> probably<00:01:18.180> haven't<00:01:18.570> seen

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
way and I bet you probably haven't seen

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.899 
way and I bet you probably haven't seen
one<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.140> these<00:01:19.229> before<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.189> will<00:01:20.369> make<00:01:20.610> your

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
one of these before so it will make your

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.179 
one of these before so it will make your
device<00:01:21.330> unique<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.869> itself<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.740> very<00:01:23.100> easy

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
device unique to itself it is very easy

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.310 
device unique to itself it is very easy
to<00:01:23.490> install<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.240> see<00:01:24.479> just<00:01:24.630> plug<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:24.990> in<00:01:25.080> and

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
to install you see just plug it in and

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.499 
to install you see just plug it in and
it<00:01:25.439> does<00:01:25.650> match<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:25.979> same<00:01:26.520> thickness<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.330> the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
it does match the same thickness of the

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.420 
it does match the same thickness of the
iphone<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.170> width<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.740> really<00:01:28.920> does<00:01:29.220> have

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
iphone and width so it really does have

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.160 
iphone and width so it really does have
a<00:01:29.460> seamless<00:01:29.820> design<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.450> course<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.869> does<00:01:30.990> make

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
a seamless design of course it does make

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.260 
a seamless design of course it does make
your<00:01:31.320> iPhone<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.740> little<00:01:32.130> bit<00:01:32.220> longer<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:33.119> can

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
your iPhone a little bit longer you can

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.999 
your iPhone a little bit longer you can
very<00:01:33.450> easily<00:01:33.540> change<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.259> time<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.950> do

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
very easily change the time and I do

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.770 
very easily change the time and I do
have<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.310> white<00:01:35.490> iphone<00:01:35.700> with<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.180> black<00:01:36.479> piece

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
have a white iphone with the black piece

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.810 
have a white iphone with the black piece
here<00:01:37.079> but<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:37.979> guess<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.369> doesn't<00:01:38.430> really

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
here but I guess that doesn't really

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.310 
here but I guess that doesn't really
