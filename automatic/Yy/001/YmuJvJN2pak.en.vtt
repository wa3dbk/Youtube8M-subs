00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
simple but it also is very eye-catching

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.550 
simple but it also is very eye-catching
so<00:02:03.759> I<00:02:03.789> just<00:02:04.119> started<00:02:04.390> by<00:02:04.600> creating<00:02:05.050> two<00:02:05.080> braids

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
so I just started by creating two braids

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.830 
so I just started by creating two braids
on<00:02:05.770> both<00:02:05.979> sides<00:02:06.250> of<00:02:06.399> my<00:02:06.490> head<00:02:06.520> and<00:02:06.880> then<00:02:07.420> I<00:02:07.450> just

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
on both sides of my head and then I just

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.930 
on both sides of my head and then I just
swept<00:02:08.200> them<00:02:08.410> backwards<00:02:08.950> also<00:02:09.459> taking<00:02:09.819> a

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
swept them backwards also taking a

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.030 
swept them backwards also taking a
little<00:02:10.179> bit<00:02:10.300> of<00:02:10.450> unbraided<00:02:10.990> hair<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:11.560> then<00:02:12.010> I

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
little bit of unbraided hair and then I

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.309 
little bit of unbraided hair and then I
just<00:02:12.400> secured<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:12.850> with<00:02:12.880> a<00:02:13.240> hair<00:02:13.540> bow<00:02:13.750> because

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
just secured it with a hair bow because

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.170 
just secured it with a hair bow because
I'm<00:02:14.590> obsessed<00:02:15.190> you<00:02:15.400> can<00:02:15.550> also<00:02:15.730> just<00:02:16.000> use<00:02:16.060> a

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
I'm obsessed you can also just use a

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.480 
I'm obsessed you can also just use a
hair<00:02:16.390> tie<00:02:16.420> or<00:02:16.810> anything<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:17.440> you<00:02:17.560> prefer<00:02:17.980> but

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
hair tie or anything that you prefer but

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.010 
hair tie or anything that you prefer but
I<00:02:18.520> think<00:02:18.790> that<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:18.940> hair<00:02:19.150> bow<00:02:19.330> makes<00:02:19.660> this<00:02:19.870> a

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
I think that a hair bow makes this a

creating<00:04:07.170> a<00:04:07.530> French<00:04:07.890> braid<00:04:08.190> on<00:04:08.460> one<00:04:08.850> side<00:04:09.120> of

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
creating a French braid on one side of

creating a French braid on one side of
your<00:04:09.450> head<00:04:09.660> basically<00:04:09.930> it's<00:04:10.380> like<00:04:10.500> a<00:04:10.530> normal

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
your head basically it's like a normal

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.680 
your head basically it's like a normal
braid<00:04:11.100> but<00:04:11.580> you're<00:04:11.700> going<00:04:11.850> to<00:04:11.910> add<00:04:12.090> a<00:04:12.300> section

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
braid but you're going to add a section

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.840 
braid but you're going to add a section
of<00:04:12.960> hair<00:04:13.170> to<00:04:13.530> each<00:04:13.710> piece<00:04:14.100> before<00:04:14.370> you<00:04:14.580> braid

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
of hair to each piece before you braid

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.820 
of hair to each piece before you braid
it<00:04:15.000> in<00:04:15.120> and<00:04:15.360> you're<00:04:15.780> going<00:04:15.960> to<00:04:16.049> continue<00:04:16.200> doing

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
it in and you're going to continue doing

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.970 
it in and you're going to continue doing
that<00:04:17.010> step<00:04:17.520> until<00:04:17.970> you<00:04:18.090> have<00:04:18.239> no<00:04:18.690> more<00:04:19.140> hair<00:04:19.500> to

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
that step until you have no more hair to

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.860 
that step until you have no more hair to
braid<00:04:20.250> on<00:04:20.520> that<00:04:20.760> side<00:04:21.090> and<00:04:21.390> then<00:04:21.510> you<00:04:21.660> can<00:04:21.780> go

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
braid on that side and then you can go

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.230 
braid on that side and then you can go
