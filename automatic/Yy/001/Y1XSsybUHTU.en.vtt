adapter<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:43.110> USB<00:02:44.209> connection<00:02:46.190> there<00:02:47.190> looks

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
adapter and USB connection there looks

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.210 
adapter and USB connection there looks
to<00:02:47.550> be<00:02:47.670> okay<00:02:48.570> that<00:02:49.170> does<00:02:49.380> detach<00:02:49.740> from<00:02:49.770> the

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
to be okay that does detach from the

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.280 
to be okay that does detach from the
actual<00:02:50.490> connect<00:02:50.940> itself<00:02:51.330> so<00:02:51.660> it's<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.930> separate

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
actual connect itself so it's a separate

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.030 
actual connect itself so it's a separate
unit<00:02:52.650> but<00:02:53.520> once<00:02:53.730> again<00:02:54.530> that<00:02:55.530> is<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:55.740> power

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
unit but once again that is a power

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.100 
unit but once again that is a power
cable<00:02:56.430> than<00:02:56.940> if<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.180> can<00:02:57.330> have<00:02:57.570> a<00:02:57.600> look<00:02:57.690> there

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
cable than if you can have a look there

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.300 
cable than if you can have a look there
it<00:02:58.350> is<00:02:58.860> different<00:02:59.130> it<00:02:59.400> looks<00:02:59.430> similar<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.150> USB

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
it is different it looks similar to USB

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.430 
it is different it looks similar to USB
but<00:03:02.310> obviously<00:03:03.150> it's<00:03:03.480> not<00:03:03.570> that<00:03:04.020> is<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:04.380> know

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
guys can see there's the TV there it

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.070 
guys can see there's the TV there it
will<00:03:31.830> sail<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.400> top<00:03:32.610> here<00:03:32.940> it<00:03:33.420> works<00:03:33.810> out

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
will sail the top here it works out

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.610 
will sail the top here it works out
about<00:03:34.320> five<00:03:35.100> and<00:03:35.280> a<00:03:35.340> half<00:03:35.370> foot<00:03:35.850> so<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:37.320> should

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
about five and a half foot so it should

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.800 
about five and a half foot so it should
be<00:03:37.769> fine<00:03:37.980> i<00:03:38.040> think<00:03:38.280> that<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:39.180> height<00:03:39.360> ranges

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
be fine i think that the height ranges

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.320 
be fine i think that the height ranges
between<00:03:40.019> two<00:03:40.410> and<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.590> half<00:03:40.830> and<00:03:41.130> six<00:03:41.400> foot<00:03:41.700> so

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
between two and a half and six foot so

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.560 
between two and a half and six foot so
that<00:03:42.840> should<00:03:43.560> be<00:03:43.590> fine<00:03:43.830> anyway<00:03:44.670> as<00:03:45.269> you<00:03:45.420> can

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
that should be fine anyway as you can

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.550 
that should be fine anyway as you can
