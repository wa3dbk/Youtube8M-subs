yeah<00:02:00.000> Big<00:02:00.420> East<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:01.280> probably<00:02:02.280> at<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.430> top<00:02:02.759> of

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
yeah Big East is probably at the top of

yeah Big East is probably at the top of
the<00:02:03.509> college<00:02:03.780> soccer<00:02:03.990> world<00:02:04.290> right<00:02:04.500> now<00:02:04.530> I

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
the college soccer world right now I

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.319 
the college soccer world right now I
think<00:02:05.399> it's<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.579> most<00:02:05.700> competitive<00:02:06.119> who's

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
think it's the most competitive who's

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.150 
think it's the most competitive who's
ever<00:02:06.479> been<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:07.020> believe<00:02:07.530> there's<00:02:07.710> eight<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:08.069> the

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
ever been I believe there's eight in the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.490 
ever been I believe there's eight in the
top<00:02:08.340> 25<00:02:08.670> in<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.090> LPL<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:10.020> yeah<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.200> think<00:02:10.259> the

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
top 25 in the LPL so yeah I think the

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.980 
top 25 in the LPL so yeah I think the
league<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.860> League<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.580> as<00:02:11.700> good<00:02:11.849> as<00:02:11.970> it's<00:02:12.120> been
