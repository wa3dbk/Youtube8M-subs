00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.980
 who come in first 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.420
 as it has me really I bowled 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.790
 I've already seen a lot, but that 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.160
 is really down to the smallest detail to 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.660
 in the ashtray to the praline 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.350
 Almost said on the tray that is 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.369
 really great done so really 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.140
 international standard so right 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.050
 really great or beyond that though 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.670
 still and it just shows the games 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.969
 Again, a little bit of division 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.069
 So we just got the marble 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.260
 the ivory tongues from africa 

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:43.729
 from all colonies so here it is 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.739
 not in the world today where we online 

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:48.379
 order or else but it was 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.030
 piece by piece each wood each in asia 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.100
 Every investor works everything 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.460
 was brought and so so this 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.620
 The vision behind the idea 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.350
 the breathing is of this family art 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.969
 with the help of the Emperor and that's me 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.229
 only in the course of history also or 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.320
 I also recommend myself here so look around 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.969
 become aware of the power of one 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.880
 from a human by a visionary 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:13.950
 if he can just go out with this idea 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.039
 achieves and holds 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.549
 this is planned weeks in advance 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:22.619
 We've always had that too 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:25.530
 discusses what we can build there and 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.189
 what is possible there for it in this 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.140
 but already frame a gigantic construction 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:33.420
 this heart the lobby so the big one 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.700
 reception hall also with the stretcher the 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.929
 later the American bar becomes the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.030
 restaurant and with different others 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:44.610
 small section just had to 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.679
 be made at all 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.539
 basis to have this story 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.849
 play just at his historic 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.299
 fabric is here at the hotel adlon 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:56.670
 have the equipment with one of the 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:59.670
 main department and we have that 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.799
 such great people and professional people 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.959
 who make so much effort to enter 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.939
 little bit of that flair to tell you what 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:07.939
 the old anja should have had 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.770
 the exhibition madness is just 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.090
 just with twisted eagles so what they do 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.040
 yes have made everything from them 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.050
 because it was like it was then 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.210
 no longer exists that looks good 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.040
 impresive so if you that times 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.570
 film or see or that is really 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.040
 unbelievable, then really everybody 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.690
 departments did a great job 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.730
 it makes fun in such a frame 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.810
 that's what you call then we'll tell you too 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.150
 really such a small time travel 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.590
 Do you feel that way, yes, it will 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.600
 probably looked and so 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.610
 that helps us as an actor of course 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.010
 also we are an environment 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.510
 real works and also real historical 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.700
 it works or so then that's all 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.440
 a part of what we use that well 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.390
 can for our work i was totally 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.400
 slain when I came in I found it 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.860
 really amazing and so on 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.810
 love of detail and so there is something 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.760
 There are in the hairdressing where 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.040
 even horn hair clips somehow 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.690
 The stock is therefore down to the smallest 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.730
 detail this was somehow built 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.740
 and worked and that's natural 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.480
 great to also play a 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.980
 great from you is always irritated 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.660
 if you do not lie to the railing 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.210
 may because it looks real but it is 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.650
 all cardboard in paper mache partly yes 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.010
 but it is really very 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.970
 impressive construction and it makes big 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.720
 fun to play in it 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.910
 every detail has been put down 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.160
 he also has his mind and that was very 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.720
 impressively built in the movie play 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.760
 general very huge roll we 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.490
 For example, the outside built 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.670
 what you can still see in the background 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.740
 are part of the outside of the exterior facade of 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.930
 we have hotel in Bavaria in the 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.980
 bavaria studios rebuilt because that 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:49.159
 Hotel there also burns down 1900 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.440
 In 1984 the hotel is destroyed but already 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:51.860
 some years before that there is a big one 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.549
 fire 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:04:00.590
 the russians you whisper the wine cellar 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.970
 burned and it evolves 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.239
 a big fire what the whole hotel 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.120
 two-thirds of it is destroyed most beautiful 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:11.120
 Such activities are so colorful 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.310
 of course to dress up and get in 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.510
 move to move then as one 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:19.130
 dollhouse just old-fashioned historically 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.260
 that are not equipped that 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.699
 the heart of a film is that but always 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.130
 the people and the stories in the 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:28.370
 to become a center is also clear 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.270
 but with so much love for detail 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.889
 Of course it's fun 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.960
 I think that impresses me a lot 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:35.270
 So that's the way it is 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.800
 looks nothing after dad and after 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.630
 artificially somehow made but 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.600
 you really think you are here in the 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.220
 reception hall of the adlon and if then 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.500
 the many extras with their costumes 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.810
 and then beware and your hairstyles around then 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.750
 is one really in this other time 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.080
 built in a totally super true episode 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.080
 scenery 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.060
 This is for example a car that I am 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.210
 likes to wear josephine baker 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.650
 of course, with her dark skin very much 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.800
 beautiful in it shines completely forms 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.650
 nice color contrasts and there I have him 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.570
 tried the style of the twenties 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.720
 but we can maybe 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:25.980
 also to create a modern color 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:28.050
 So that would wear, for example, adlon 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.140
 if you are the first time this 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.970
 the famous gala stairs in the adlon 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:35.640
 comes down and yes luisi to the first 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:38.460
 let's see and that she really does 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.860
 more beautiful sparkles and shines and sam 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:44.640
 the 20s costume I have for 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.530
 much of london the really great 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.830
 entire repertoire of 1920s 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:52.169
 Clothes have special spiro costumes 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.330
 Blessed and small, you can tell that I am 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:58.200
 quite like sparkling like the actor 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:00.030
 and yes also shine in the light and the 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.280
 is just the beautiful of the twenties 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.110
 that you also see that the lifetime 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.290
 glad it was really cracking 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.880
 leave and beautiful dresses beautiful 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:12.180
 had cuts it is also again 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.910
 from the 20s were filled with pearls 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:17.130
 and the clothes moved beautiful 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.110
 if they danced in it and for 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.360
 many, which of course is important too 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.130
 also to play the role and the 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.470
 20s were a living and the 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.390
 physicality was another costumes 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:31.169
 an insane challenge alone 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:32.380
 by that already we start in 1907 and 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:35.170
 in the 90s 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.910
 1997 and museums do not say how many 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.920
 it is in various moods 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:41.290
 this time has given and should 

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:45.340
 and are served that leads to that 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:47.950
 we have several trucks I say extra trucks 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.360
 and no trucks with wax full of costumes 

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.400
 because they are not just these 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.500
 but also have seasons 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.480
 many actors and partly for the 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.890
 same role different actors 

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.240
 this is a very big one 

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:58.900
 challenge in the two areas 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.880
 been 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.380
 my palette is i believe 45 

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.520
 different costumes over the 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.990
 I have to go through different decades 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.720
 Of course cut but change something 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:10.600
 But I, as a hotelier asks him to 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.190
 cut and the georg and the tuxedo in 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.260
 different decades need 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.600
 and that will always be something different 

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:19.750
 is a costume battle 

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:21.640
 this is for example 1926 but me 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:24.430
 also have such a nice monocle because 

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.540
 Today I am so you can not do it that way 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.860
 Really recognize but actually one 

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:31.630
 little younger than me in real life 

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:33.400
 already have and then put even that is 

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.170
 but also a peculiar thing because 

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.820
 that stops now while we talk completely 

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:39.700
 good but turn longer talk talk is 

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:42.390
 at some point then we usually live little 

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.390
 that sometimes stuck 

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.830
 Of course, historical costumes 

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:49.870
 no matter what kind are always for that 

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:51.669
 It's just that 's easy, so to speak 

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:54.210
 the most personal transporter in the 

00:07:51.669 --> 00:07:54.210
 past
