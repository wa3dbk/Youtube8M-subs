00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
been not really well served by a lot of

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.050 
been not really well served by a lot of
the<00:01:06.990> main<00:01:07.200> institutions<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:08.220> kids<00:01:08.700> who<00:01:08.850> kind

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
the main institutions so kids who kind

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.490 
the main institutions so kids who kind
of<00:01:09.180> fall<00:01:09.390> through<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.690> cracks<00:01:09.720> which<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.350> I

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
of fall through the cracks which is I

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.320 
of fall through the cracks which is I
think<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.950> lot<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.280> times<00:01:11.550> what<00:01:12.119> most

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
think a lot of times what most

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.720 
think a lot of times what most
skateboarders<00:01:12.600> are<00:01:13.110> liked

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.730 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.890 

I<00:01:17.710> think<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:19.220> experience<00:01:19.460> of<00:01:19.940> going<00:01:20.630> to

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
I think the experience of going to

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.560 
I think the experience of going to
Woodward<00:01:21.290> really<00:01:21.920> opens<00:01:22.700> up<00:01:22.790> their<00:01:23.000> mind<00:01:23.270> to

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
Woodward really opens up their mind to

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.630 
Woodward really opens up their mind to
new<00:01:23.720> experiences<00:01:23.990> I<00:01:24.590> mean<00:01:24.980> I<00:01:25.070> see<00:01:25.280> it<00:01:25.370> as<00:01:25.490> sort

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
new experiences I mean I see it as sort

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.700 
new experiences I mean I see it as sort
of<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:25.760> first<00:01:26.120> step<00:01:26.480> we<00:01:27.080> want<00:01:27.260> to<00:01:27.410> kind<00:01:27.560> of

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
of the first step we want to kind of

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.370 
of the first step we want to kind of
progressively<00:01:28.310> open<00:01:29.180> them<00:01:29.300> up<00:01:29.330> to<00:01:29.660> bigger<00:01:30.260> and

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
progressively open them up to bigger and

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.320 
progressively open them up to bigger and
better<00:01:30.640> experiences<00:01:31.640> and<00:01:31.940> kind<00:01:32.120> of<00:01:32.180> go

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
better experiences and kind of go

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.940 
better experiences and kind of go
further<00:01:32.570> away<00:01:32.750> from<00:01:33.200> their<00:01:33.350> comfort<00:01:33.710> zones

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
further away from their comfort zones

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.860 
further away from their comfort zones
and<00:01:34.040> I<00:01:34.160> think<00:01:34.400> Woodward<00:01:34.700> is<00:01:34.820> a<00:01:34.880> perfect<00:01:35.390> place

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
and I think Woodward is a perfect place

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:45.370 
and I think Woodward is a perfect place
for<00:01:36.200> them<00:01:36.320> to<00:01:36.350> start<00:01:43.600> this<00:01:44.600> is<00:01:44.780> a<00:01:44.810> very<00:01:45.050> special

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
for them to start this is a very special

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.890 
for them to start this is a very special
place<00:01:45.740> on<00:01:46.010> earth<00:01:46.130> for<00:01:46.310> Harold<00:01:46.640> you<00:01:47.090> know<00:01:47.240> in

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
place on earth for Harold you know in

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.290 
place on earth for Harold you know in
creating<00:01:48.410> this<00:01:48.560> whole<00:01:48.830> process<00:01:49.370> of<00:01:49.850> providing

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
creating this whole process of providing

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.910 
creating this whole process of providing
opportunities<00:01:51.110> for<00:01:51.140> kids<00:01:51.440> that<00:01:51.560> just<00:01:51.650> don't

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920
