00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.070 
yes and we can go in here we can see it
has<00:02:34.540> 22<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:36.580> this<00:02:36.970> is<00:02:37.120> a<00:02:37.150> dual<00:02:37.450> core<00:02:37.750> arm

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
has 22 and this is a dual core arm

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.080 
has 22 and this is a dual core arm
cortex<00:02:38.470> a9<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:41.290> it's<00:02:41.470> it's<00:02:41.860> working<00:02:42.250> but<00:02:42.910> it's

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
cortex a9 so it's it's working but it's

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.229 
cortex a9 so it's it's working but it's
a<00:02:43.209> prototype<00:02:43.690> when<00:02:44.290> is<00:02:44.410> it<00:02:44.470> final<00:02:44.910> in<00:02:45.910> next

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
a prototype when is it final in next

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:52.470 
a prototype when is it final in next
week<00:02:46.450> next<00:02:47.170> week<00:02:47.410> I<00:02:47.739> look<00:02:48.670> like<00:02:48.820> this<00:02:49.410> no

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.340 

is<00:02:52.720> very<00:02:53.140> closely

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
is very closely

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.430 
is very closely
nice

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.840 

engineer<00:02:58.440> sample<00:02:58.950> engineer<00:02:59.400> sample<00:02:59.730> like

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
engineer sample engineer sample like

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.760 
engineer sample engineer sample like
this<00:03:00.000> but<00:03:00.210> this<00:03:00.330> is<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.570> final<00:03:00.900> one<00:03:01.020> yes<00:03:01.380> this

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
this but this is the final one yes this

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.220 
this but this is the final one yes this
is<00:03:01.920> your<00:03:02.130> mold<00:03:02.370> or<00:03:02.700> somebody<00:03:03.090> well<00:03:03.270> mod<00:03:03.690> is<00:03:03.990> not

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
is your mold or somebody well mod is not

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.900 
is your mold or somebody well mod is not
open<00:03:04.560> mold<00:03:04.710> and<00:03:05.600> we<00:03:06.600> really<00:03:07.040> hmmm<00:03:08.040> it<00:03:08.490> yes

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
open mold and we really hmmm it yes

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.420 
open mold and we really hmmm it yes
it'll<00:03:09.690> look<00:03:09.810> like<00:03:09.960> this<00:03:10.220> with<00:03:11.220> these

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
it'll look like this with these

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.620 
it'll look like this with these
connectors<00:03:12.500> so<00:03:13.500> let's<00:03:13.680> uh<00:03:14.210> like<00:03:15.210> what<00:03:15.480> else

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
connectors so let's uh like what else

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.020 
connectors so let's uh like what else
can<00:03:15.810> we<00:03:15.900> do<00:03:16.280> see<00:03:17.280> this<00:03:17.490> launches<00:03:18.740> see<00:03:19.740> if<00:03:20.030> going

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
can we do see this launches see if going

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:39.130 
can we do see this launches see if going
right<00:03:21.210> back

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.430
