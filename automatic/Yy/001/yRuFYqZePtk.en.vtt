through<00:00:37.380> United<00:00:37.770> which<00:00:37.920> i<00:00:38.100> think<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.489> pretty

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
through United which i think is pretty

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.240 
through United which i think is pretty
awesome<00:00:38.940> since<00:00:39.450> since<00:00:40.020> I'm<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> PSP<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.710> United

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
awesome since since I'm a PSP and United

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.190 
awesome since since I'm a PSP and United
supporter<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:41.820> I'm<00:00:41.969> very<00:00:42.000> really<00:00:42.329> excited<00:00:42.719> to

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200

see<00:00:43.410> how<00:00:43.590> he<00:00:43.649> how<00:00:44.100> he<00:00:44.129> will<00:00:44.399> perform<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:45.000> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
see how he how he will perform in the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.029 
see how he how he will perform in the
Premier<00:00:45.600> League<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.410> think<00:00:46.680> he's<00:00:46.800> going<00:00:46.980> to

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039

silver but it went over the bar I can

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.890 
silver but it went over the bar I can
see<00:01:17.430> from<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.729> final<00:01:18.060> stats<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.659> game

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
see from the final stats that this game

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.770 
see from the final stats that this game
was<00:01:19.080> very<00:01:19.680> very<00:01:19.950> even<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.580> think<00:01:20.909> 11<00:01:21.330> will

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
argentinian side would also a neo my

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.330 
argentinian side would also a neo my
think<00:01:54.119> from<00:01:54.659> la<00:01:54.780> liga<00:01:55.020> SS<00:01:55.409> right<00:01:55.710> back<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.219> I

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
think from la liga SS right back and I

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.980 
think from la liga SS right back and I
starts<00:01:56.790> off<00:01:56.939> there<00:01:57.119> chuckling<00:01:57.600> with<00:01:57.810> their

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
starts off there chuckling with their

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.330 
starts off there chuckling with their
with<00:01:58.110> Palacio<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.649> think<00:01:58.860> we<00:01:59.009> set<00:01:59.159> some

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
with Palacio I think we set some

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.340 
with Palacio I think we set some
pressure<00:01:59.579> then<00:02:00.329> we<00:02:00.659> picked<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:00.960> over<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.170> feed

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
pressure then we picked it over to feed

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.899 
pressure then we picked it over to feed
Allah<00:02:01.530> only<00:02:01.829> as<00:02:02.070> three<00:02:02.280> star<00:02:02.520> skin<00:02:02.759> was<00:02:02.880> I

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
Allah only as three star skin was I

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.399 
Allah only as three star skin was I
think<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:03.329> we<00:02:03.420> just<00:02:03.570> went<00:02:03.719> with<00:02:03.899> some<00:02:04.079> basic

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
think so we just went with some basic

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.080 
think so we just went with some basic

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.160 
the greatest either then a 39th when I
just<00:02:41.849> before<00:02:42.209> half-time<00:02:42.330> from<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:42.900> free-kick

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
just before half-time from a free-kick

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.720

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
something back in this game and I think

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.320 
something back in this game and I think
how<00:02:47.099> it<00:02:47.220> could<00:02:47.370> have<00:02:47.459> saved<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:47.819> because<00:02:48.150> you

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
how it could have saved it because you

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.850 
how it could have saved it because you
can<00:02:48.480> clearly<00:02:48.690> see<00:02:48.930> from<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.230> replay<00:02:49.590> that<00:02:49.769> the

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.800 
stay go I just stood there juggling and
then<00:05:09.340> I<00:05:09.370> just<00:05:09.639> decided<00:05:09.789> to<00:05:10.090> make<00:05:10.300> the<00:05:10.419> most<00:05:10.599> out

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
pretty big chance where we could have

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.379 
pretty big chance where we could have
completed<00:05:14.650> that<00:05:14.770> challenge<00:05:15.250> but<00:05:15.520> the<00:05:16.210> pie
