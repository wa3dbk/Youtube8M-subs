00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:10.200
 I do not understand why I 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.790
 always cravings in the day 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.860
 sweet cravings that take me 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.170
 like that a web shot to understand 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.420
 we must try to go back to the base 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.060
 of what is happening all his desires 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.039
 violent desire for sweet and sweet drive 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.410
 it's big cravings during the day 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.890
 they came mainly 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.939
 massively to hypoglycemia 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.890
 reactionary then what is it 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.510
 a hypoglycemia shareholders by 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.890
 example you are having lunch 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.870
 with your friends you take a big dish 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.820
 pasta white pasta you in 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.629
 eat a lot behind you go 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.340
 take a cake with a coffee that you 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.020
 go sweet what's going on 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.379
 you took the index foods 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.719
 very high glycemic your body he has 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.870
 a mass of sugar in the arrival 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.489
 blood 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.059
 that is, the blood glucose level 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.469
 brutally increases the body he is afraid 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.420
 of that right away he does not want to have a 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.649
 too high sugar level so he's going 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.439
 trigger the secretion of insulin 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.580
 insulin for storing this sugar and 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.619
 blow the sugar rate will drop 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.570
 brutally and what's going on 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.369
 a reaction hypoglycemia your 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.510
 brain tells you I need sugar 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.250
 I need sugar I need to 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.100
 sugar and so with this secretion 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.290
 of insulin the again your rate of 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.439
 blood sugar will drop and there your 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.479
 brain it will give you impulses 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.950
 cedents of sugar drives and in me 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.780
 saying I want sugar from the hair of 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.040
 sugar chauveau sugar and that's it 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.770
 your sweet punishment is that your 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.370
 craving after it must also distinguish 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.500
 because there is not all the time that 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.180
 that hypoglycemia reactional he 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.670
 There are also violent fires 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.240
 eat the greed we want to 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.890
 nibble 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.680
 but often we want to nibble 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.590
 because we go on a diet 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.570
 the very idea of diet conditions the 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.990
 frustration and we can not fit in 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.940
 the duration 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.530
 so these two things that must be avoided 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.600
 it's glycemic index foods 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.250
 high that they will trigger the 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.320
 reactive hypoglycaemia it takes 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.700
 avoid dieting the first of 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.160
 rules for not having his impulses 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.690
 sugar and its violent cravings that's 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.570
 consume foods with index 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.030
 low glycemic that is to say cereals 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.950
 complete unrefined products 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.060
 legumes 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.520
 finally products that will 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.000
 allow to have a slow absorption 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.620
 the sugars spread slowly while 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.250
 if you eat refined products 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.080
 transformed it will immediately induce 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.180
 a pose of your blood sugar and induce 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.100
 reaction hypoglycemia the 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.680
 second of the measures to be adopted 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.490
 it's never to skip a meal 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.290
 always remember that if you 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.120
 skip a meal you will take revenge 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.459
 on the next one and then you go 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.350
 eat more often a lot sweeter 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.739
 and that's the return to the same circle 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.330
 vicious 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.430
 you know when you have jump a 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.110
 meal you arrive at the evening meal and 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.900
 you are liquidating an ice pot or 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.920
 a spread in front of the TV and that 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.550
 I think you can very well 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.050
 what I want to talk about 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.300
 the third of the measures to be adopted to 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.220
 avoid cravings these two taste 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.100
 organized two snacks in the day 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.170
 at 10 and 16 o'clock 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.330
 first only to ensure a contribution 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.430
 constant nutritional that it will prevent 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.070
 hypoglycemia you will take a 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.540
 fruit a handful of dried fruits on 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.790
 low glycemic index fruit 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.680
 the handful of dried fruits from the fibers of the 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.450
 minerals and then proteins 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.890
 the other point that is not to neglect 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.870
 it's just making a snack 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.880
 it prevents you from having frustration 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.680
 is it a jar you do not have you have 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.410
 not be hungry and you can not get on 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.540
 the second meal being hungry so that 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.820
 it is an important point 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.830
 fourth and last point in my opinion the 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.540
 more important do not diet 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.030
 already nothing but the word diet is 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.580
 anxiety must not be all the time 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.110
 in the fight in violence with 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.260
 care it is better to register in the 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.820
 duration by having a way of life which 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.770
 will allow you to be focused on the 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.700
 quality of your contributions and you will avoid 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.100
 the real frustration 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.530
 if you can not do without one 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.910
 sweet little taste at the end of the meal me 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.150
 I recommend you buy yourself a 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.160
 super dark chocolate to over 70% of 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.810
 cocoa that will bring you this little 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.340
 touch of sugar and without 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.380
 trigger the insulin pump and 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.950
 caused severe hypoglycemia 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.950
 shareholders
