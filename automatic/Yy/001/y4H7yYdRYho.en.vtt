00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.240 
promise um I definitely liked it I feel
like<00:03:48.810> you<00:03:48.930> commanded<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.590> stage<00:03:49.890> and<00:03:50.130> that's

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
like you commanded the stage and that's

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.920 
like you commanded the stage and that's
something<00:03:50.430> I<00:03:50.610> look<00:03:50.790> for<00:03:51.060> from<00:03:51.540> a<00:03:51.630> lot<00:03:51.780> of<00:03:51.870> the

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
something I look for from a lot of the

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.270 
something I look for from a lot of the
artists<00:03:52.200> that<00:03:52.320> get<00:03:52.470> up<00:03:52.590> here<00:03:52.800> I<00:03:52.830> feel<00:03:53.130> like

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
artists that get up here I feel like

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.250 
artists that get up here I feel like
some<00:03:53.790> of<00:03:53.820> you<00:03:54.030> know<00:03:54.150> some<00:03:54.600> of<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.750> presents

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
some of you know some of the presents

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.630 
some of you know some of the presents
and<00:03:55.350> some<00:03:55.560> of<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.710> energy<00:03:56.040> you<00:03:56.280> could<00:03:56.490> have

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
and some of the energy you could have

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.370 
and some of the energy you could have
done<00:03:57.360> a<00:03:57.390> little<00:03:57.630> better<00:03:57.930> with<00:03:58.020> some<00:03:58.260> of<00:03:58.320> the

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
done a little better with some of the

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.320 
done a little better with some of the
notes<00:03:58.590> but<00:03:58.890> for<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.280> most<00:03:59.460> part<00:03:59.760> you<00:04:00.000> got<00:04:00.180> my

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
notes but for the most part you got my

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.360 
notes but for the most part you got my
yes<00:04:00.540> vote<00:04:00.810> because<00:04:01.200> you<00:04:01.320> commanded<00:04:01.770> that

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.150 

caption<00:04:05.370> I<00:04:05.660> actually<00:04:06.660> agree<00:04:07.410> with<00:04:07.440> Ludacris

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
caption I actually agree with Ludacris

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.580 
caption I actually agree with Ludacris
that<00:04:08.460> doesn't<00:04:08.760> happen<00:04:08.880> often<00:04:09.180> I<00:04:09.540> think<00:04:10.110> that

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
that doesn't happen often I think that

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.230 
that doesn't happen often I think that
you<00:04:10.740> were<00:04:11.040> commanding<00:04:11.580> the<00:04:11.670> stage<00:04:11.910> you<00:04:12.150> were

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
you were commanding the stage you were

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.210 
you were commanding the stage you were
awesome<00:04:12.570> tonight<00:04:12.720> there<00:04:13.470> are<00:04:13.590> a<00:04:13.620> couple<00:04:13.800> notes

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
awesome tonight there are a couple notes

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.500 
awesome tonight there are a couple notes
so<00:04:14.490> you<00:04:14.580> need<00:04:14.730> to<00:04:14.820> be<00:04:14.940> a<00:04:14.970> little<00:04:15.150> more<00:04:15.210> careful

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
so you need to be a little more careful

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.860 
so you need to be a little more careful
of<00:04:15.930> next<00:04:16.680> time<00:04:16.890> but<00:04:17.700> overall<00:04:18.270> I<00:04:18.420> thought<00:04:18.720> your

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
of next time but overall I thought your

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.990 
of next time but overall I thought your
performance<00:04:19.290> was<00:04:19.380> rad<00:04:20.780> 2015<00:04:21.780> right<00:04:23.000> bodacious

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
performance was rad 2015 right bodacious

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.830 
performance was rad 2015 right bodacious
