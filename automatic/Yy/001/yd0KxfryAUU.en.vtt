liquid<00:00:24.320> would<00:00:24.529> help<00:00:24.770> the<00:00:25.010> cucumber<00:00:25.520> seeds

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:25.700 
liquid would help the cucumber seeds

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.690 
liquid would help the cucumber seeds
girl<00:00:26.029> better<00:00:26.540> than<00:00:26.630> water

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:27.700 
girl better than water

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:34.510 
girl better than water
yeah<00:00:28.700> so<00:00:29.360> here<00:00:29.810> we<00:00:30.020> have<00:00:30.289> our<00:00:32.260> materials<00:00:33.520> which

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
yeah so here we have our materials which

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.869 
yeah so here we have our materials which
is<00:00:34.790> which<00:00:35.510> are<00:00:35.750> more<00:00:36.290> moist<00:00:36.949> potting<00:00:37.550> soil

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
is which are more moist potting soil

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.910 
is which are more moist potting soil
some<00:00:38.480> pots<00:00:39.230> and<00:00:40.809> our<00:00:41.809> liquids<00:00:42.379> which<00:00:42.680> are

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
some pots and our liquids which are

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.060 
some pots and our liquids which are
water<00:00:43.280> milk<00:00:44.000> ginger<00:00:44.570> ale<00:00:44.750> apple<00:00:45.320> apple<00:00:45.590> juice

water milk ginger ale apple apple juice
and<00:00:46.340> vinegar<00:00:46.910> and<00:00:47.530> we<00:00:48.530> have<00:00:48.739> our<00:00:48.950> cucumber

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
and vinegar and we have our cucumber

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.380 
and vinegar and we have our cucumber
seeds<00:00:50.329> and<00:00:51.190> here<00:00:52.190> we<00:00:52.340> have<00:00:52.550> our<00:00:52.790> pencil<00:00:53.239> which

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
seeds and here we have our pencil which

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.049 
seeds and here we have our pencil which
we<00:00:53.600> are<00:00:53.720> using<00:00:53.930> as<00:00:54.200> our<00:00:54.320> ruler<00:00:54.860> to<00:00:55.100> measure<00:00:55.309> how

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
we are using as our ruler to measure how

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.940 
we are using as our ruler to measure how
much<00:00:56.300> like<00:00:57.200> how<00:00:57.530> deep<00:00:58.390> we<00:00:59.390> should<00:00:59.630> put<00:00:59.950> holes

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
much like how deep we should put holes

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.180 
much like how deep we should put holes
in<00:01:01.219> so<00:01:01.520> then<00:01:01.670> we<00:01:01.820> can<00:01:02.000> put<00:01:02.180> our<00:01:02.360> cucumber<00:01:02.899> seeds

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
in so then we can put our cucumber seeds

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.620 
in so then we can put our cucumber seeds
right<00:01:04.190> now<00:01:04.369> i'm<00:01:04.550> putting<00:01:04.790> you<00:01:04.970> know<00:01:05.210> potting

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
right now i'm putting you know potting

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.990 
right now i'm putting you know potting
soil<00:01:06.080> in<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.380> pot<00:01:07.780> now<00:01:08.780> i<00:01:08.840> am<00:01:09.170> putting<00:01:09.470> a<00:01:10.369> half

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
soil in the pot now i am putting a half

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.240 
soil in the pot now i am putting a half
an<00:01:11.240> inch<00:01:11.390> hole<00:01:12.020> in<00:01:12.410> my<00:01:13.009> pots<00:01:13.580> now<00:01:14.330> i<00:01:14.360> am<00:01:14.750> putting

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
an inch hole in my pots now i am putting

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.149 
an inch hole in my pots now i am putting
the<00:01:16.250> cucumber<00:01:16.880> seeds<00:01:17.119> in<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:18.170> four<00:01:18.500> half-inch

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
the cucumber seeds in the four half-inch

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.940 
the cucumber seeds in the four half-inch
hole<00:01:19.400> that<00:01:20.030> we<00:01:20.299> did<00:01:20.600> that<00:01:20.960> I<00:01:21.200> did<00:01:21.530> with<00:01:21.770> the

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
hole that we did that I did with the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.820 
hole that we did that I did with the
ruler<00:01:22.390> and<00:01:23.390> now<00:01:24.320> and<00:01:25.250> then<00:01:25.970> I<00:01:26.440> probably<00:01:27.440> dress

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
ruler and now and then I probably dress

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.250 
ruler and now and then I probably dress
one<00:01:28.070> in<00:01:28.250> and<00:01:28.790> now<00:01:29.030> that<00:01:29.270> I<00:01:29.390> drop<00:01:29.720> one<00:01:29.750> and<00:01:30.140> I

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
one in and now that I drop one and I

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.020 
one in and now that I drop one and I
would<00:01:30.470> take<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:30.830> ruler<00:01:31.070> and<00:01:31.310> make<00:01:31.490> sure<00:01:31.790> that

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
would take the ruler and make sure that

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.920 
would take the ruler and make sure that
it<00:01:32.210> is<00:01:32.360> down<00:01:32.600> in<00:01:33.939> about<00:01:34.939> half<00:01:35.360> inch<00:01:36.909> to<00:01:37.930> Lance's

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
it is down in about half inch to Lance's

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:50.520 
it is down in about half inch to Lance's
of<00:01:38.960> liquid<00:01:39.530> to<00:01:39.680> each<00:01:39.950> pot

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.630 

and<00:01:51.530> now<00:01:51.829> we<00:01:51.890> are<00:01:52.069> adding<00:01:52.399> apple<00:01:52.969> juice<00:01:53.240> and

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
and now we are adding apple juice and

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.209 
and now we are adding apple juice and
and<00:01:55.640> we<00:01:55.999> will<00:01:56.179> add<00:01:56.390> additional<00:01:57.229> amounts<00:01:58.100> as

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
and we will add additional amounts as

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:18.100 
and we will add additional amounts as
needed

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
and now we will move the pots to over to

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.380 
and now we will move the pots to over to
the<00:02:22.650> window<00:02:22.890> so<00:02:23.280> they<00:02:23.460> can<00:02:23.700> absorb<00:02:24.060> light

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
the window so they can absorb light

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.940 
the window so they can absorb light
throw

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.470
