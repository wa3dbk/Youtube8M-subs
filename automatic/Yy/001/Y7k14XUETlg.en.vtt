learn a jump blues tune and I simply
call<00:00:09.240> it<00:00:09.420> jump<00:00:09.960> your<00:00:10.110> blues

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379

so<00:00:38.379> let's<00:00:38.559> go<00:00:38.739> over<00:00:38.950> the<00:00:39.040> head<00:00:39.280> for<00:00:39.309> this<00:00:39.640> tune

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
so let's go over the head for this tune

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.869 
so let's go over the head for this tune
in<00:00:40.690> jazz<00:00:41.079> music<00:00:41.559> the<00:00:41.890> melody<00:00:42.100> for<00:00:42.460> tune<00:00:42.699> is

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
in jazz music the melody for tune is

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.830 
in jazz music the melody for tune is
often<00:00:43.329> referred<00:00:43.690> to<00:00:43.719> as<00:00:44.079> the<00:00:44.379> head<00:00:45.030> I'm<00:00:46.030> going

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
often referred to as the head I'm going

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.700 
often referred to as the head I'm going
to<00:00:47.019> break<00:00:47.320> this<00:00:47.559> into<00:00:48.010> different<00:00:48.579> parts<00:00:48.970> and

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
to break this into different parts and

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:57.360 
to break this into different parts and
this<00:00:50.710> is<00:00:50.860> the<00:00:51.040> first<00:00:51.309> section<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.949> intervals

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
this is the first section the intervals

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.390 
this is the first section the intervals
on<00:00:57.550> playing<00:00:57.850> are<00:00:58.629> the<00:00:58.870> fifth<00:00:59.140> the<00:00:59.920> sixth<00:01:00.339> the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
on playing are the fifth the sixth the

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.859 
on playing are the fifth the sixth the
one<00:01:01.180> the<00:01:02.079> minus<00:01:02.500> third<00:01:02.710> the<00:01:03.399> major<00:01:03.730> third<00:01:04.089> the

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
one the minus third the major third the

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.840 
one the minus third the major third the
sixth<00:01:05.379> and<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:06.250> one<00:01:06.430> again<00:01:06.759> and<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:09.310> happens

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
sixth and the one again and that happens

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.200 
sixth and the one again and that happens
over<00:01:10.149> the<00:01:10.720> one<00:01:11.050> chord<00:01:11.380> over<00:01:11.649> the<00:01:12.280> C<00:01:12.520> dominant

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
over the one chord over the C dominant

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:20.870 
over the one chord over the C dominant
seven<00:01:13.780> chord<00:01:14.580> now<00:01:15.580> you<00:01:15.640> have<00:01:16.210> to<00:01:16.539> know<00:01:17.289> how<00:01:17.590> to

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.240 

let's<00:01:21.880> go<00:01:22.090> over<00:01:22.360> the<00:01:22.480> chord<00:01:22.750> progression<00:01:23.320> it's

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
let's go over the chord progression it's

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.610 
let's go over the chord progression it's
pretty<00:01:24.550> much<00:01:24.700> a<00:01:24.760> typical<00:01:25.120> 12<00:01:25.630> bar<00:01:25.960> blues<00:01:25.990> in

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
pretty much a typical 12 bar blues in

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.790 
pretty much a typical 12 bar blues in
the<00:01:26.680> key<00:01:26.830> of<00:01:27.040> C<00:01:27.810> but<00:01:28.810> it<00:01:28.930> also<00:01:29.080> features<00:01:29.770> a

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
the key of C but it also features a

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.900 
the key of C but it also features a
chord<00:01:30.220> movement<00:01:30.730> called<00:01:31.180> 2/5<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:33.490> it's<00:01:33.670> going

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
chord movement called 2/5 so it's going

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.310 
chord movement called 2/5 so it's going
from<00:01:34.030> D<00:01:34.600> minor<00:01:34.960> to<00:01:35.260> g7<00:01:36.010> in<00:01:36.190> a<00:01:36.370> couple<00:01:36.640> of<00:01:36.700> spots

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
from D minor to g7 in a couple of spots

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:51.480 
from D minor to g7 in a couple of spots
let's<00:01:38.320> have<00:01:38.530> a<00:01:38.560> look<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:50.320> the<00:01:50.500> D<00:01:50.680> minor<00:01:50.920> 7<00:01:51.220> on

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
let's have a look so the D minor 7 on

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.130 
let's have a look so the D minor 7 on
plan<00:01:51.760> it's<00:01:52.140> like<00:01:53.140> a<00:01:53.310> D<00:01:54.310> minor<00:01:54.550> Barre<00:01:54.820> chord<00:01:55.140> but

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
plan it's like a D minor Barre chord but

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.130 
plan it's like a D minor Barre chord but
I'm<00:01:56.290> lifting<00:01:56.470> up<00:01:56.800> to<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:57.130> pinkie<00:01:58.119> so<00:01:58.900> I<00:01:58.960> get

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
I'm lifting up to the pinkie so I get

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.520 
I'm lifting up to the pinkie so I get
the<00:01:59.290> 7th<00:01:59.650> note<00:01:59.830> in<00:02:00.070> here

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.680 

you<00:02:05.070> mind<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.580> might<00:02:05.760> know<00:02:05.940> this<00:02:06.119> version<00:02:06.600> of

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
you mind you might know this version of

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.050 
you mind you might know this version of
it

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.509 

same-same<00:02:11.060> notes<00:02:11.420> but<00:02:11.569> this<00:02:11.720> is<00:02:11.900> a<00:02:12.519> voicing

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
same-same notes but this is a voicing

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.759 
same-same notes but this is a voicing
when<00:02:14.239> you<00:02:14.330> use<00:02:14.420> bar<00:02:14.780> chords<00:02:15.230> which<00:02:15.409> can<00:02:15.620> be

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
when you use bar chords which can be

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.690 
when you use bar chords which can be
easier<00:02:16.459> to<00:02:16.670> strum<00:02:16.970> and<00:02:17.780> then<00:02:18.409> a<00:02:18.440> typical<00:02:18.799> g7

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
easier to strum and then a typical g7

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.960 
easier to strum and then a typical g7
like<00:02:19.849> this

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:30.950 

and<00:02:23.150> then<00:02:23.720> we're<00:02:23.930> on<00:02:23.960> bar<00:02:24.380> 11<00:02:24.920> back<00:02:25.160> to<00:02:25.340> see

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.900 

so<00:02:31.960> now<00:02:32.200> let's<00:02:32.530> have<00:02:32.710> a<00:02:32.740> look<00:02:32.980> at<00:02:33.220> how<00:02:33.610> we<00:02:33.670> can

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
so now let's have a look at how we can

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.440 
so now let's have a look at how we can
play<00:02:34.150> these<00:02:34.360> chords<00:02:34.720> in<00:02:35.110> a<00:02:35.530> variety<00:02:35.710> of<00:02:36.010> ways

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
play these chords in a variety of ways

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.960 
play these chords in a variety of ways
using<00:02:37.450> some<00:02:38.080> interesting<00:02:38.680> chord<00:02:39.100> inversions

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
using some interesting chord inversions

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.010 
using some interesting chord inversions
and<00:02:40.740> we're<00:02:41.740> also<00:02:41.920> going<00:02:42.280> to<00:02:42.400> add<00:02:42.610> some<00:02:43.020> notes

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
and we're also going to add some notes

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.780 
and we're also going to add some notes
to<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.440> chords<00:02:44.800> that<00:02:44.830> give<00:02:45.130> them<00:02:45.280> more<00:02:45.490> color

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
to the chords that give them more color

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.130 
to the chords that give them more color
so<00:02:46.120> to<00:02:46.180> speak<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:48.220> first<00:02:49.180> of<00:02:49.390> all<00:02:49.480> we're

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
so to speak so first of all we're

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.750 
so to speak so first of all we're
dealing<00:02:50.470> with<00:02:50.500> dominant<00:02:51.220> Sammon<00:02:51.700> chords

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.890 

or<00:02:55.030> we<00:02:55.659> can<00:02:55.840> just<00:02:55.870> call<00:02:56.170> them<00:02:56.319> dominant<00:02:56.950> chords

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
or we can just call them dominant chords

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.140 
or we can just call them dominant chords
what's<00:02:58.900> special<00:02:59.769> about<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.310> dominant<00:03:00.849> chord

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
what's special about the dominant chord

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.330 
what's special about the dominant chord
is<00:03:01.420> that<00:03:01.659> it<00:03:01.810> has<00:03:01.959> a<00:03:01.989> minor<00:03:02.470> seventh<00:03:03.010> in<00:03:03.159> it

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
is that it has a minor seventh in it

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.160 
is that it has a minor seventh in it
which<00:03:04.239> in<00:03:04.390> this<00:03:04.510> case<00:03:04.720> is<00:03:04.930> b-flat<00:03:06.989> it<00:03:07.989> has<00:03:08.140> a

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
which in this case is b-flat it has a

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.339 
which in this case is b-flat it has a
major<00:03:08.500> third<00:03:08.920> which<00:03:09.370> is<00:03:09.519> in<00:03:09.700> this<00:03:10.120> case<00:03:10.349> the

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
major third which is in this case the

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.040 
major third which is in this case the
note<00:03:11.590> E

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.770 

those<00:03:15.770> two<00:03:16.130> intervals<00:03:16.700> or<00:03:17.030> scale<00:03:17.420> degrees

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
those two intervals or scale degrees

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.400 
those two intervals or scale degrees
they<00:03:18.650> are<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.310> ones<00:03:19.550> that<00:03:19.820> gives<00:03:20.240> this<00:03:20.990> cord

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
they are the ones that gives this cord

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.350 
they are the ones that gives this cord
its<00:03:21.650> flavor<00:03:22.160> but<00:03:24.820> the<00:03:25.820> cool<00:03:26.030> thing<00:03:26.210> with

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
its flavor but the cool thing with

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.350 
its flavor but the cool thing with
dominant<00:03:26.810> courses<00:03:27.350> that<00:03:27.560> use<00:03:28.000> so<00:03:29.000> that's<00:03:29.090> 11

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
dominant courses that use so that's 11

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.140 
dominant courses that use so that's 11
cord<00:03:30.010> we<00:03:31.010> can<00:03:31.220> look<00:03:31.430> at<00:03:31.640> a<00:03:31.670> 13<00:03:32.650> cord<00:03:33.970> how<00:03:34.970> do<00:03:35.030> we

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
cord we can look at a 13 cord how do we

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.630 
cord we can look at a 13 cord how do we
do<00:03:35.270> that<00:03:35.390> well<00:03:35.690> this<00:03:36.140> is<00:03:36.200> the<00:03:36.380> 11th<00:03:36.800> keep

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
do that well this is the 11th keep

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.890 
do that well this is the 11th keep
counting<00:03:38.060> 12<00:03:38.740> 13<00:03:40.300> so<00:03:41.300> we're<00:03:41.420> gonna<00:03:41.510> add<00:03:41.720> the

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
counting 12 13 so we're gonna add the

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:48.210 
counting 12 13 so we're gonna add the
note<00:03:42.050> a<00:03:42.290> to<00:03:42.380> the<00:03:42.800> cord<00:03:43.040> somehow<00:03:46.120> then<00:03:47.120> we<00:03:47.270> get<00:03:47.450> a

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
note a to the cord somehow then we get a

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.260 
note a to the cord somehow then we get a
13<00:03:49.630> 13th<00:03:50.630> cord<00:03:50.990> now<00:03:51.740> there<00:03:52.280> are<00:03:52.490> a<00:03:52.670> few<00:03:52.730> ways

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
13 13th cord now there are a few ways

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.090 
13 13th cord now there are a few ways
you<00:03:53.480> can<00:03:53.660> do<00:03:53.780> that<00:03:53.810> of<00:03:54.140> course<00:03:54.380> we<00:03:54.740> don't<00:03:54.890> have

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
you can do that of course we don't have

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.500 
you can do that of course we don't have
enough<00:03:55.340> fingers<00:03:55.550> to<00:03:55.910> play<00:03:56.120> all<00:03:56.300> those<00:03:56.450> notes

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
enough fingers to play all those notes

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.460 
enough fingers to play all those notes
so<00:03:57.020> we<00:03:57.050> have<00:03:57.200> to<00:03:57.290> skip<00:03:57.530> a<00:03:57.560> few<00:03:57.680> so<00:03:59.290> let's<00:04:00.290> go

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
so we have to skip a few so let's go

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.740 
so we have to skip a few so let's go
back<00:04:00.650> to<00:04:00.890> playing<00:04:01.160> the<00:04:01.400> c9<00:04:04.300> I'll<00:04:05.300> show<00:04:05.570> you<00:04:05.630> a

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
back to playing the c9 I'll show you a

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.010 
back to playing the c9 I'll show you a
cool<00:04:06.140> way<00:04:06.290> to<00:04:06.320> do<00:04:06.560> it<00:04:07.060> we<00:04:08.060> often<00:04:08.240> play<00:04:08.600> a<00:04:08.630> scene

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
cool way to do it we often play a scene

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.310 
cool way to do it we often play a scene
in<00:04:09.260> this<00:04:09.530> way<00:04:11.140> we're<00:04:12.140> skipping<00:04:12.410> the<00:04:12.620> bass<00:04:13.190> note

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
in this way we're skipping the bass note

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.680 
in this way we're skipping the bass note
we're<00:04:15.320> borrowing<00:04:15.710> with<00:04:15.860> a<00:04:15.890> ring<00:04:16.100> finger<00:04:16.660> so<00:04:17.660> I

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
we're borrowing with a ring finger so I

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.320 
we're borrowing with a ring finger so I
get<00:04:17.989> the<00:04:18.739> fifth<00:04:19.340> interval<00:04:19.730> on<00:04:19.910> top<00:04:22.180> kind<00:04:23.180> of<00:04:23.240> a

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
get the fifth interval on top kind of a

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.200 
get the fifth interval on top kind of a
funky<00:04:23.750> chord<00:04:24.320> that<00:04:24.470> used<00:04:24.950> in<00:04:25.190> in<00:04:25.430> funk<00:04:25.760> musical

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
funky chord that used in in funk musical

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.430 
funky chord that used in in funk musical
as<00:04:26.450> well<00:04:26.750> and<00:04:27.260> RB<00:04:28.660> so<00:04:29.660> it's<00:04:29.810> the<00:04:29.870> same<00:04:30.050> thing<00:04:30.290> as

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
as well and RB so it's the same thing as

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.080 
as well and RB so it's the same thing as
this<00:04:30.950> one<00:04:31.190> we<00:04:31.310> just<00:04:31.810> add<00:04:32.810> that<00:04:33.050> note<00:04:33.290> on<00:04:33.650> top

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
this one we just add that note on top

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.940 
this one we just add that note on top
but<00:04:35.090> from<00:04:35.330> this<00:04:35.510> grip<00:04:35.840> if<00:04:36.200> we<00:04:36.410> play<00:04:36.620> it<00:04:36.770> with

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
but from this grip if we play it with

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.260 
but from this grip if we play it with
the<00:04:37.100> middle<00:04:37.280> finger<00:04:37.669> like<00:04:37.700> this<00:04:37.970> for<00:04:38.210> the

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
the middle finger like this for the

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.970 
the middle finger like this for the
boring

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
boring

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.250 
boring
I<00:04:40.010> can<00:04:40.730> reach<00:04:40.880> up<00:04:41.090> and<00:04:41.330> get<00:04:41.420> the<00:04:41.660> cert<00:04:41.990> Keynes

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
I can reach up and get the cert Keynes

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.279 
I can reach up and get the cert Keynes
here<00:04:42.800> with<00:04:42.950> my<00:04:43.100> pinky

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
here with my pinky

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.189 
here with my pinky
then<00:04:45.919> we<00:04:46.009> get<00:04:46.129> a<00:04:46.189> cool<00:04:46.460> sounding<00:04:46.879> chord<00:04:47.869> which

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 
then we get a cool sounding chord which

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:52.359 
then we get a cool sounding chord which
is<00:04:48.229> a<00:04:48.439> c-13<00:04:49.339> we<00:04:50.059> have<00:04:50.240> the<00:04:51.020> major<00:04:51.199> third<00:04:51.499> the

00:04:52.359 --> 00:04:52.369 
is a c-13 we have the major third the

is a c-13 we have the major third the
minor<00:04:52.550> seventh<00:04:53.169> we<00:04:54.169> have<00:04:54.349> the<00:04:54.589> ninth<00:04:55.119> we<00:04:56.119> don't

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.149 
minor seventh we have the ninth we don't
have<00:04:56.629> the<00:04:56.749> Levin's<00:04:57.139> but<00:04:57.860> we<00:04:57.949> have<00:04:58.069> the

00:04:58.149 --> 00:04:58.159

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:08.790 

cools<00:05:03.550> omnichord<00:05:04.150> very<00:05:04.659> useful<00:05:07.499> now<00:05:08.499> let's

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
cools omnichord very useful now let's

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.679 
cools omnichord very useful now let's
practice<00:05:09.039> some<00:05:09.400> of<00:05:09.430> these<00:05:09.550> voicings<00:05:10.090> to<00:05:10.509> this

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:10.689 
practice some of these voicings to this

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:13.739 
practice some of these voicings to this
tune<00:05:11.020> and<00:05:11.860> I<00:05:12.789> will<00:05:12.939> play<00:05:13.150> through<00:05:13.629> the

00:05:13.739 --> 00:05:13.749 
tune and I will play through the

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:16.739 
tune and I will play through the
progression<00:05:13.900> twice<00:05:14.860> and<00:05:15.389> I'm<00:05:16.389> basically

00:05:16.739 --> 00:05:16.749 
progression twice and I'm basically

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:19.290 
progression twice and I'm basically
going<00:05:17.289> to<00:05:17.409> improvise<00:05:17.800> the<00:05:18.729> grips<00:05:19.029> the

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
going to improvise the grips the

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.779 
going to improvise the grips the
voicings<00:05:19.719> for<00:05:20.020> each<00:05:20.139> chord<00:05:20.560> and<00:05:20.830> you<00:05:21.610> should

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
voicings for each chord and you should

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:23.640 
voicings for each chord and you should
do<00:05:21.879> the<00:05:21.999> same<00:05:22.240> use<00:05:22.539> some<00:05:22.749> of<00:05:22.840> these<00:05:22.930> voicings

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
do the same use some of these voicings

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.050 
do the same use some of these voicings
that<00:05:23.740> I've<00:05:23.949> shown<00:05:24.249> you<00:05:24.279> and<00:05:25.110> practice<00:05:26.110> finding

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
that I've shown you and practice finding

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.519 
that I've shown you and practice finding
you<00:05:28.060> know<00:05:28.180> good<00:05:28.419> options<00:05:28.930> for<00:05:29.020> each<00:05:29.229> of<00:05:29.439> the

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:29.529 
you know good options for each of the

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:34.080 
you know good options for each of the
chords<00:05:29.979> and<00:05:31.169> try<00:05:32.169> to<00:05:32.249> play<00:05:33.249> with<00:05:33.490> a<00:05:33.520> variety<00:05:33.729> of

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
chords and try to play with a variety of

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.179 
chords and try to play with a variety of
voicing<00:05:34.599> it's<00:05:34.689> not<00:05:34.810> just<00:05:35.050> the<00:05:35.439> same<00:05:35.650> ones<00:05:35.919> over

00:05:36.179 --> 00:05:36.189 
voicing it's not just the same ones over

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:39.689 
voicing it's not just the same ones over
and<00:05:36.370> over<00:05:36.930> now<00:05:37.930> as<00:05:38.169> far<00:05:38.379> as<00:05:38.439> the<00:05:38.680> rhythm<00:05:39.069> I'm

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:39.699 
and over now as far as the rhythm I'm

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:42.659 
and over now as far as the rhythm I'm
just<00:05:40.000> using<00:05:40.210> my<00:05:40.389> thumb<00:05:40.779> to<00:05:40.810> strum<00:05:41.439> down<00:05:41.680> trying
