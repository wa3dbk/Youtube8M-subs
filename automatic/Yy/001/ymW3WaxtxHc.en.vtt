Harvey<00:03:11.569> you<00:03:11.690> see<00:03:11.900> me<00:03:12.019> tape<00:03:12.230> it<00:03:14.079> okay<00:03:15.730> so<00:03:16.730> now<00:03:16.940> we

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
Harvey you see me tape it okay so now we

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.420 
Harvey you see me tape it okay so now we
have<00:03:18.579> our<00:03:19.579> sphere<00:03:20.090> but<00:03:20.959> it's<00:03:21.680> not<00:03:21.829> that<00:03:22.040> nicely

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
have our sphere but it's not that nicely

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.740 
have our sphere but it's not that nicely
shaped<00:03:22.639> because<00:03:23.000> there's<00:03:23.150> a<00:03:23.209> lot<00:03:23.329> of<00:03:23.419> pieces

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
shaped because there's a lot of pieces

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.849 
shaped because there's a lot of pieces
of<00:03:24.079> tape<00:03:24.829> on<00:03:25.220> the<00:03:25.459> outside<00:03:26.209> so<00:03:26.930> I'm<00:03:27.590> just<00:03:27.769> gonna

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
of tape on the outside so I'm just gonna

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.539 
of tape on the outside so I'm just gonna
look<00:03:28.130> through<00:03:28.430> and<00:03:29.620> release<00:03:30.620> pull<00:03:31.280> out<00:03:31.370> the

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
look through and release pull out the

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.970 
look through and release pull out the
little<00:03:31.790> pieces<00:03:31.970> of<00:03:32.239> tape<00:03:32.709> you<00:03:33.709> want<00:03:33.769> to<00:03:33.889> be<00:03:33.950> a

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
little pieces of tape you want to be a

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.470 
little pieces of tape you want to be a
little<00:03:34.190> more<00:03:34.250> careful<00:03:34.430> than<00:03:34.730> I<00:03:34.849> just<00:03:35.329> like

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
little more careful than I just like

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.330 
little more careful than I just like
because<00:03:35.720> I<00:03:35.780> just<00:03:35.930> rip<00:03:36.260> them<00:03:36.470> other<00:03:36.829> words<00:03:37.160> off

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
because I just rip them other words off

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.589 
because I just rip them other words off
but<00:03:38.329> this<00:03:38.510> is<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:39.319> original<00:03:39.709> base<00:03:40.280> that<00:03:40.700> where

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
but this is the original base that where

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.089 
but this is the original base that where
we<00:03:41.750> did<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:41.989> template<00:03:42.440> and<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.650> reason<00:03:42.980> why

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
we did the template and the reason why

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.030 
we did the template and the reason why
it's<00:03:43.340> oddly<00:03:43.609> shaped<00:03:44.000> is<00:03:44.269> because<00:03:44.829> you<00:03:45.829> want

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
it's oddly shaped is because you want

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.189 
it's oddly shaped is because you want
the<00:03:46.190> cylinder<00:03:46.849> to<00:03:47.269> just<00:03:47.750> reshape<00:03:48.260> itself<00:03:48.760> so

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:50.199 
the cylinder to just reshape itself so

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:52.779 
the cylinder to just reshape itself so
it's<00:03:51.199> not<00:03:51.410> and<00:03:51.799> we<00:03:51.979> didn't<00:03:52.190> do<00:03:52.340> a<00:03:52.370> perfect

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:52.789 
it's not and we didn't do a perfect

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:55.840 
it's not and we didn't do a perfect
Pentagon<00:03:53.690> on<00:03:53.959> the<00:03:54.079> bottom<00:03:54.380> so<00:03:54.739> that's<00:03:55.639> why

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
Pentagon on the bottom so that's why

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:56.600 
Pentagon on the bottom so that's why
it's<00:03:56.120> not

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
it's not

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:14.840 
it's not
perfectly<00:03:56.910> shaped<00:04:10.100> in<00:04:12.980> okay<00:04:13.980> so<00:04:14.580> I<00:04:14.610> think

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
perfectly shaped in okay so I think

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.039 
perfectly shaped in okay so I think
that's<00:04:15.150> all<00:04:15.270> the<00:04:15.390> piece<00:04:15.510> of<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:15.690> tape<00:04:15.840> scene

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
that's all the piece of the tape scene

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.960 
that's all the piece of the tape scene
so<00:04:16.290> once<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:16.560> remove<00:04:16.709> now<00:04:17.430> you<00:04:17.489> don't<00:04:17.730> want<00:04:17.880> to

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
so once you remove now you don't want to

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.120 
so once you remove now you don't want to
remove<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.359> pieces<00:04:18.600> of<00:04:18.750> tape<00:04:18.930> that<00:04:19.230> links<00:04:20.040> the

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
remove the pieces of tape that links the

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.530 
remove the pieces of tape that links the
two<00:04:20.310> sheets<00:04:20.549> together<00:04:20.790> you<00:04:21.090> want<00:04:21.269> to<00:04:21.359> just

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
two sheets together you want to just

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.090 
two sheets together you want to just
remove<00:04:21.780> the<00:04:21.959> T's<00:04:22.170> of<00:04:22.200> the<00:04:22.350> tape<00:04:22.530> that<00:04:22.740> you<00:04:22.830> use

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
remove the T's of the tape that you use

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.200 
remove the T's of the tape that you use
to<00:04:23.970> help<00:04:24.150> you<00:04:24.270> create<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:24.960> ball<00:04:25.790> so<00:04:26.790> once

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
to help you create the ball so once

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.070 
to help you create the ball so once
you're<00:04:27.450> finished<00:04:28.040> you<00:04:29.040> can<00:04:29.070> kind<00:04:29.880> of<00:04:30.080> shift

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
you're finished you can kind of shift

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.840 
you're finished you can kind of shift
everything<00:04:31.500> to<00:04:31.890> make<00:04:32.040> it<00:04:32.220> look<00:04:32.580> a<00:04:32.700> little

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
everything to make it look a little

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.700 
everything to make it look a little
nicer<00:04:33.120> you<00:04:33.960> can<00:04:34.110> even<00:04:34.260> if<00:04:34.530> you<00:04:34.800> if<00:04:35.160> where<00:04:35.760> the

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
nicer you can even if you if where the

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.400 
nicer you can even if you if where the
tape<00:04:37.710> is<00:04:37.890> where<00:04:38.160> you<00:04:38.280> that<00:04:39.060> you<00:04:39.330> connected<00:04:40.230> the

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
tape is where you that you connected the

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.930 
tape is where you that you connected the
strip's<00:04:40.710> you<00:04:40.919> want<00:04:41.100> to<00:04:41.220> hide<00:04:41.370> that<00:04:41.610> you<00:04:41.790> can

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
strip's you want to hide that you can

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.700 
strip's you want to hide that you can
just<00:04:44.000> twist<00:04:45.000> it<00:04:45.240> in<00:04:45.390> and<00:04:45.630> shift<00:04:46.050> it<00:04:46.200> down<00:04:46.230> so

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
just twist it in and shift it down so

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.580 
just twist it in and shift it down so
it's<00:04:46.830> under<00:04:47.100> it's<00:04:47.430> in<00:04:47.550> an<00:04:47.669> under<00:04:48.030> position<00:04:48.590> so

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
it's under it's in an under position so

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.430 
it's under it's in an under position so
it<00:04:49.740> looks<00:04:49.919> better<00:04:50.130> and<00:04:50.960> there<00:04:51.960> we<00:04:52.110> have<00:04:52.290> it

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
it looks better and there we have it

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.950 
it looks better and there we have it
that<00:04:52.650> is<00:04:53.370> our<00:04:53.669> ball<00:04:54.150> and<00:04:54.360> then<00:04:54.480> you<00:04:54.510> can<00:04:54.750> see

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
that is our ball and then you can see

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.170 
that is our ball and then you can see
the<00:04:55.590> Stars<00:04:58.250> and<00:04:59.250> it<00:04:59.730> makes<00:04:59.910> the<00:05:00.000> perfect

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
the Stars and it makes the perfect

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.340 
the Stars and it makes the perfect
ornament<00:05:00.690> you<00:05:00.750> can<00:05:00.870> just<00:05:01.020> take<00:05:01.140> a<00:05:01.169> little

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
ornament you can just take a little

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.190 
ornament you can just take a little
piece<00:05:02.160> of<00:05:02.280> yarn<00:05:02.520> or<00:05:02.760> something<00:05:03.180> and<00:05:03.479> hang<00:05:04.080> it
