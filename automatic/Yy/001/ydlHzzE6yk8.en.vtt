00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.900
You think Gotham's bad on the Joker?

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.400
Wait till Penguin has done with it!

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.250
Penguin's an animal.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.680
Help me!

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.730
So Batman, you're here for the cops? Or me?

00:00:41.731 --> 00:00:44.257
I was only here for the hostages.

00:00:44.258 --> 00:00:47.700
But now I'm taking you down too.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.200
Look around you.

00:00:51.201 --> 00:00:55.700
This horrible bunch of psychopaths are all begging to join up with me.

00:00:55.701 --> 00:00:59.320
But unfortunately for them, I only take the best.

00:00:59.321 --> 00:01:03.750
And today, best means whoever can kill you.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.800
Welcome to hell!

00:01:24.765 --> 00:01:26.900
You can't win, Batman.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.271
I've got a little surprise for you down there...

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.981
Solomon Grundy...

00:01:40.982 --> 00:01:43.800
Born on a Monday.
