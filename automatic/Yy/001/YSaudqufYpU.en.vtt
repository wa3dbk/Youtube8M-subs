00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
done first externally by getting them

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.520 
done first externally by getting them
away<00:00:36.420> from<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.690> elements<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.230> wet<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.470> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
away from the elements the wet and the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.320 
away from the elements the wet and the
cold<00:00:37.560> are<00:00:38.400> wrapping<00:00:38.760> up<00:00:38.820> like<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> baked<00:00:39.210> potato

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.330 
cold are wrapping up like a baked potato

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.299 
cold are wrapping up like a baked potato
secondly<00:00:40.110> we<00:00:40.260> can<00:00:40.410> do<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.620> by<00:00:40.710> getting<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:41.070> food

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
secondly we can do it by getting a food

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.330 
secondly we can do it by getting a food
and<00:00:41.489> water<00:00:42.350> reason<00:00:43.350> there<00:00:43.920> were<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.100> biggest

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
and water reason there were the biggest

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.740 
and water reason there were the biggest
reasons<00:00:44.580> people<00:00:44.670> stopped<00:00:45.030> shivering<00:00:45.270> it's

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
reasons people stopped shivering it's

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.940 
reasons people stopped shivering it's
because<00:00:45.900> they're<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.200> worn<00:00:46.440> out<00:00:46.620> they<00:00:46.830> have

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
because they're so worn out they have

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.380 
because they're so worn out they have
nothing<00:00:47.309> left<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.580> burn<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.940> their<00:00:48.030> muscles

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
nothing left to burn and their muscles

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.450 
nothing left to burn and their muscles
just<00:00:48.540> can't<00:00:48.780> shiver<00:00:49.050> anymore<00:00:49.470> so<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.220> burned

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460

what's gonna happen more often is I'm
gonna<00:06:12.150> turn<00:06:12.389> to<00:06:12.539> his<00:06:12.780> temperature<00:06:13.590> and<00:06:13.740> he's

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:13.889 
gonna turn to his temperature and he's

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:15.529 
gonna turn to his temperature and he's
not<00:06:14.069> gonna<00:06:14.190> turn<00:06:14.370> to<00:06:14.490> my<00:06:14.610> temperature<00:06:14.970> so<00:06:15.419> now

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:15.539 
not gonna turn to my temperature so now

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:16.999 
not gonna turn to my temperature so now
we<00:06:15.599> have<00:06:15.780> two<00:06:16.050> people<00:06:16.289> that<00:06:16.440> are<00:06:16.560> hypothermic

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:17.009 
we have two people that are hypothermic

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:20.089 
we have two people that are hypothermic
and<00:06:17.340> who<00:06:17.699> is<00:06:17.940> now<00:06:18.090> gonna<00:06:18.360> protect<00:06:18.720> us<00:06:18.919> who<00:06:19.919> is

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:20.099 
and who is now gonna protect us who is

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:21.200 
and who is now gonna protect us who is
actually<00:06:20.430> gonna<00:06:20.550> go<00:06:20.699> out<00:06:20.729> there<00:06:20.940> and<00:06:21.000> get

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
actually gonna go out there and get

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.149 
actually gonna go out there and get
those<00:06:21.360> foods<00:06:21.690> we<00:06:21.870> need<00:06:22.020> to<00:06:22.169> sustain<00:06:22.349> who's

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:23.159 
those foods we need to sustain who's

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:24.920 
those foods we need to sustain who's
gonna<00:06:23.310> give<00:06:23.550> us<00:06:23.669> the<00:06:23.789> water<00:06:23.970> so<00:06:24.360> we<00:06:24.389> can<00:06:24.509> start

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
gonna give us the water so we can start

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.110 
gonna give us the water so we can start
to<00:06:25.050> actually<00:06:25.860> turn<00:06:26.099> that<00:06:26.280> hypothermia<00:06:26.699> around

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
to actually turn that hypothermia around

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.850 
to actually turn that hypothermia around
instead<00:06:27.330> of<00:06:27.449> just<00:06:27.539> sustaining<00:06:28.229> it<00:06:28.349> so<00:06:28.740> we

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 
instead of just sustaining it so we

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.770 
instead of just sustaining it so we
could<00:06:29.009> take<00:06:29.159> this<00:06:29.340> guy<00:06:29.569> in<00:06:30.569> this

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
could take this guy in this

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.659 
could take this guy in this
configuration<00:06:31.159> maybe<00:06:32.159> even<00:06:32.430> do<00:06:32.550> the

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:32.669 
configuration maybe even do the

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:34.550 
configuration maybe even do the
configuration<00:06:32.940> in<00:06:33.509> a<00:06:33.629> spot<00:06:33.900> where<00:06:33.930> we've

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
configuration in a spot where we've

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.469 
configuration in a spot where we've
already<00:06:34.770> got<00:06:35.069> a<00:06:35.099> lean-to<00:06:35.520> type<00:06:35.909> shelter<00:06:36.270> set

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 
already got a lean-to type shelter set

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:38.149 
already got a lean-to type shelter set
up<00:06:36.569> with<00:06:36.690> another<00:06:36.870> space<00:06:37.169> blanket<00:06:37.620> build<00:06:38.069> a

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:38.159 
up with another space blanket build a

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:40.670 
up with another space blanket build a
fire<00:06:38.400> out<00:06:38.669> here<00:06:38.940> on<00:06:39.180> the<00:06:39.240> ground<00:06:39.449> beside<00:06:40.199> him

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 
fire out here on the ground beside him

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.559 
fire out here on the ground beside him
and<00:06:40.889> that<00:06:41.310> radiant<00:06:41.699> heats<00:06:41.909> getting<00:06:42.210> warm<00:06:42.389> him

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:42.569 
and that radiant heats getting warm him

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:44.659 
and that radiant heats getting warm him
up<00:06:42.629> being<00:06:42.810> that<00:06:42.960> much<00:06:43.139> more<00:06:43.409> absolutely<00:06:43.979> if

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:44.669 
up being that much more absolutely if

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:46.580 
up being that much more absolutely if
you<00:06:44.879> had<00:06:45.060> that<00:06:45.240> I<00:06:45.300> I<00:06:45.479> would<00:06:46.050> say<00:06:46.199> wouldn't<00:06:46.469> be

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:46.590 
you had that I I would say wouldn't be

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.200 
you had that I I would say wouldn't be
too<00:06:46.800> much<00:06:46.830> depend<00:06:47.340> upon<00:06:47.550> what<00:06:47.699> level<00:06:47.729> he<00:06:48.090> was

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.210 
too much depend upon what level he was

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:49.820 
too much depend upon what level he was
that<00:06:48.330> hypothermia<00:06:48.900> it<00:06:49.229> won't<00:06:49.379> be<00:06:49.500> too<00:06:49.650> long

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830 
that hypothermia it won't be too long

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.469 
that hypothermia it won't be too long
till<00:06:50.069> he<00:06:50.219> goes<00:06:50.400> hey<00:06:50.940> I'm<00:06:51.120> starting<00:06:51.300> to<00:06:51.389> sweat
