00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.800
 Nine people I 'm quite too close to the city 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.380
 a new video marginal today too 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.650
 a kind of battlefield 4 trivia so 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.090
 he should not know about battlefield 4 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.760
 Series is just as fun 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.590
 my little follower the very first 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.449
 Reveal of Battlefield 4 Endstand 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.949
 through an advertising banner for the 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.810
 pre-order from medal of honor 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.490
 warfighter in german store 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.720
 shortly thereafter, this gang was but 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.890
 directly removed but the 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.330
 message was already on the net 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.460
 that has something to do with it 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.630
 Battlefield 4 comes after that 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.110
 finally the official announcement 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.470
 to ea and dice for the first time 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.060
 the game was presented on 27 march 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.190
 2013 in san francisco with it then too 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.720
 the tv spot as well as the 70-minute 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.390
 seen gameplay trailer 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.700
 next , yes, actually can 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.990
 great part see all this picture there 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.840
 we a us marine 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:00.320
 however, he has a mk 14 in the 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.080
 hand and well in bed four gives this 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.830
 Weapon not well fit 4 is in china 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.049
 forbidden 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.360
 The reason for this is obviously not rising 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.220
 The general is part of one 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.620
 coup against the US forces 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.830
 however, the authorities feared the 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.990
 national security is endangered and 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.480
 that's why the action game is on 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.030
 landed the index and thus away from the index 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.430
 window in which you have ten minutes of gameplay 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.290
 be of phishing in Baku had players 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.540
 commander cut off the leg 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.340
 At this time , the game had to 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.790
 for that still the interacting button 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.890
 to press 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.970
 but now in the final version happened 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.370
 that by itself 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.770
 now you can just do a thing 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.210
 hear 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.909
 this thing is the same as in 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.280
 elevator at dice themselves besides still 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.750
 Mentioned these elevators have one 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.110
 speed on it that one 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.370
 many times of normal lift, however 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.380
 you would not do that one will 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.880
 maybe almost a minute or so in 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.220
 So far, this chair has been sitting at the top 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.540
 arrived and then you can do it 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.670
 Of course you understand that there is one 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.830
 Realism takes something back and prefer 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.170
 times the gameplay pushes a bit 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.909
 in the singleplayer there is an east prey man 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.099
 can do this in the third mission 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.690
 seen the battlefield 3 in the world 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.319
 it already has all but never 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.540
 one in the multiplayer 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.129
 pity drum in december was the 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.450
 Chief developer Patrick Bach of one 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.980
 Forgotten four servers with the 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.079
 reason fixed secret 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.209
 it has never been proven if that's true 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:26.099
 but in any case 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.170
 Battlefield 4 plays in two 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.930
 different years the main game 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.900
 itself plays in the year 2020 but the dlc 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.930
 s class plays at once in 2014 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.709
 there was one more during gamescom 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.359
 fully automatic 16 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.239
 which then but to a three 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:43.530
 shot version was changed to 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.409
 maybe you wanted a certain one 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.379
 scream prevent it allegedly 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:52.079
 here supposedly aha in battlefield 3 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:55.500
 already there was a certain in the 16 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.909
 a little was filed and last in 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.699
 one sees the multiplayer trailer one 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:02.780
 quad on the zittauer in play mode 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:12.359
 However, there is no conquest there 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:14.480
 Quads Yes that was it with this sample 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.650
 I do not know so it was 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.930
 to implement complicated is not mine 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.750
 But I found it in something together 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.650
 other or have fun in it and the 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.340
 It was with this video 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.340
 haut rein people
