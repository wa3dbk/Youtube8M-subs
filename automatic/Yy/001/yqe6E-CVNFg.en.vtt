the<00:00:15.499> brain<00:00:16.840> this<00:00:17.840> is<00:00:17.990> going<00:00:18.200> to<00:00:18.289> be<00:00:18.350> the<00:00:18.470> best

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:18.679 
the brain this is going to be the best

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:25.900 
the brain this is going to be the best
day<00:00:18.920> ever<00:00:19.179> so<00:00:20.179> what<00:00:20.449> have<00:00:20.539> we<00:00:20.570> got<00:00:20.660> G<00:00:24.910> alert

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
day ever so what have we got G alert

day ever so what have we got G alert
alert<00:00:27.160> whoa<00:00:28.160> what's<00:00:28.759> happening

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.390 

the<00:00:35.650> brains<00:00:36.010> power<00:00:36.550> is<00:00:36.940> at<00:00:37.180> an<00:00:37.300> all-time<00:00:37.540> low

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.400 
the brains power is at an all-time low

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.870 
the brains power is at an all-time low
we<00:00:39.400> need<00:00:39.700> a<00:00:39.730> volunteer<00:00:40.180> to<00:00:40.630> help<00:00:40.870> us<00:00:41.260> fix<00:00:41.560> this

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:41.880 
we need a volunteer to help us fix this

anyone this is it G this is my chance
I'll<00:00:49.570> do<00:00:49.960> it

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.360 

there's<00:00:55.540> a<00:00:55.630> power<00:00:55.960> leak<00:00:56.380> in<00:00:56.620> the<00:00:56.739> challenge

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
there's a power leak in the challenge

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.440 
there's a power leak in the challenge
zone<00:00:57.700> you<00:00:58.540> must<00:00:58.900> go<00:00:59.200> there<00:00:59.230> immediately<00:00:59.559> I

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
zone you must go there immediately I

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:13.020 
zone you must go there immediately I
won't<00:01:01.450> let<00:01:01.630> you<00:01:01.809> down<00:01:10.770> Here<00:01:11.770> I<00:01:11.830> am<00:01:11.979> to<00:01:12.430> save<00:01:12.759> the

brain<00:01:13.770> fellow<00:01:14.770> neurons<00:01:15.220> brain<00:01:15.850> power<00:01:16.180> is<00:01:16.479> um

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
brain fellow neurons brain power is um

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:29.370 
brain fellow neurons brain power is um
hello<00:01:24.869> Shh<00:01:25.900> I'm<00:01:26.520> concentrating<00:01:27.930> wait

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
hello Shh I'm concentrating wait

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:37.260 
hello Shh I'm concentrating wait
so<00:01:30.100> close<00:01:31.500> one<00:01:32.500> more<00:01:32.740> I<00:01:34.530> did<00:01:35.530> it<00:01:35.770> I'm<00:01:36.580> a<00:01:36.640> memory

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
so close one more I did it I'm a memory

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.810 
so close one more I did it I'm a memory
master<00:01:39.870> so<00:01:40.870> what's<00:01:41.710> this<00:01:41.950> about<00:01:42.159> brain<00:01:42.580> power

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
master so what's this about brain power

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:49.230 
master so what's this about brain power
I'm<00:01:43.570> Hugo<00:01:44.320> Ned<00:01:45.659> where<00:01:46.659> is<00:01:46.810> everyone<00:01:47.280> well<00:01:48.280> we

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
I'm Hugo Ned where is everyone well we

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.110 
I'm Hugo Ned where is everyone well we
were<00:01:49.390> just<00:01:49.420> playing<00:01:49.960> this<00:01:50.110> game<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:51.520> was<00:01:51.850> so

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
were just playing this game it was so

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.860 
were just playing this game it was so
fun<00:01:52.620> but<00:01:53.620> when<00:01:53.830> it<00:01:53.950> got<00:01:54.070> really<00:01:54.490> hard<00:01:54.909> they<00:01:55.659> all

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
fun but when it got really hard they all

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.730 
fun but when it got really hard they all
left

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.429 

so<00:01:59.740> is<00:01:59.979> that<00:02:00.219> what<00:02:00.460> you<00:02:00.610> do<00:02:00.850> here<00:02:01.119> you<00:02:01.869> play

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
so is that what you do here you play

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.230 
so is that what you do here you play
games<00:02:02.820> yeah

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
games yeah

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.649 
games yeah
games<00:02:04.960> and<00:02:05.200> puzzles<00:02:05.469> mostly<00:02:06.159> anything<00:02:07.149> that's

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
games and puzzles mostly anything that's

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.580 
games and puzzles mostly anything that's
extra<00:02:08.619> challenging<00:02:09.369> I<00:02:09.840> like<00:02:10.840> memory<00:02:11.349> games

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
extra challenging I like memory games

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.720 
extra challenging I like memory games
the<00:02:11.860> best<00:02:12.069> I<00:02:12.519> get<00:02:13.090> to<00:02:13.239> use<00:02:13.450> my<00:02:13.480> thinking<00:02:14.200> cap

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
the best I get to use my thinking cap

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.780 
the best I get to use my thinking cap
here<00:02:15.730> check<00:02:16.330> this<00:02:16.599> one<00:02:16.870> out

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
here check this one out

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.050 
here check this one out
Wow<00:02:20.430> wait<00:02:21.430> a<00:02:21.459> minute

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
Wow wait a minute

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.729 
Wow wait a minute
maybe<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.330> brain<00:02:25.630> power<00:02:25.930> went<00:02:26.230> down<00:02:26.470> because

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
maybe the brain power went down because

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.500 
maybe the brain power went down because
the<00:02:27.040> other<00:02:27.190> neuron<00:02:27.640> stops<00:02:27.970> playing<00:02:28.269> their

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
the other neuron stops playing their

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.309 
the other neuron stops playing their
challenge<00:02:29.019> games<00:02:30.299> Hugo<00:02:31.299> I<00:02:31.540> think<00:02:32.019> the<00:02:32.110> brain

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
challenge games Hugo I think the brain

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.199 
challenge games Hugo I think the brain
needs<00:02:32.680> us<00:02:32.799> to<00:02:32.920> do<00:02:33.040> challenges<00:02:33.670> in<00:02:33.880> order<00:02:34.000> to

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
needs us to do challenges in order to

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.580 
needs us to do challenges in order to
stay<00:02:34.390> strong<00:02:35.790> if<00:02:36.790> I<00:02:37.030> play<00:02:37.239> your<00:02:37.420> games<00:02:37.660> -<00:02:37.959> maybe

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
stay strong if I play your games - maybe

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.280 
stay strong if I play your games - maybe
we<00:02:38.769> can<00:02:38.920> grow<00:02:39.220> back<00:02:39.489> the<00:02:39.790> brain<00:02:40.000> power<00:02:40.290> it's

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
we can grow back the brain power it's

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.240 
we can grow back the brain power it's
worth<00:02:41.620> a<00:02:41.799> try

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.630 

let's<00:02:45.250> jumpstart<00:02:46.000> this<00:02:46.239> brain
