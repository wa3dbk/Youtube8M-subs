00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 and now let's go to the good technical news 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.680
 emater are taking the equipment 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.970
 which helps to treat the sewage of small 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.030
 rural properties 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.849
 The idea is simple the cost is low and the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.190
 solution can give quality to all 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.680
 the food produced around the 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.750
 your property. 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.240
 sebastiÃ£o has a force that collects water 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.220
 dirty bathroom but missing a way 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.650
 to treat the rest of the sewage 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.689
 contaminated water has so far been 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.300
 It left a bad smell in the yard. 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.850
 so this environmental technician the one 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.190
 different way of treating sewage is the 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.320
 treatment done by root zone 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.660
 the idea is quite simple the producer will 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.090
 need a treatment box that 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.100
 It can be made on the same property 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.700
 first step is to separate a tank as 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.530
 This one 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.809
 then you will need to make a 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.210
 pipe system to enter and exit 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.550
 water the stones and sand will help 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.609
 filter the dirt this fabric called 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.030
 bed blanket serves to prevent the 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.470
 sand holes 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.320
 the system functions as a filter 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.260
 the dirty water came in through the 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.540
 and is being purified according to 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.549
 passes through layers of debris 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.979
 now we are going to show the last step 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.590
 of the alternative treatment system for 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.970
 the drain to finish the box will be 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.470
 plant lined 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.390
 I'm agreeing that you're a technician. 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.390
 What are you going to tell us? 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.630
 the function of plants here the roots they 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.250
 have a biological relationship with some 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.500
 microorganisms that are very important 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.020
 in retention and purification of matter 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.390
 and also in capturing some of the 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.829
 heavy metals present in the effluents 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.619
 those species which we will 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.950
 planting in this treatment she can and will 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.170
 perspire up to 25% or to each of the 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.869
 every thousand liters of effluents it throws 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.970
 in the atmosphere 250 liters of air make a 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.649
 system like this does not cost much 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.899
 a box of this size of one by one 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.729
 family of two and does not cost more 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.829
 than 500 reais 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.780
 the state government has a project that 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.750
 finances treatment for producers 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.670
 who live near the river springs 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.539
 besides not polluting the environment to 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.959
 the producer 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.860
 the advantage is in the quality of production 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.200
 finally the cold 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.680
 another that comes out of the pure land is much more 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.270
 tasty for sure, I guess all 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.680
 world wants people who are right 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.680
 I'm glad happy even
