00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
are learning it and being able to cater

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.650

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
it to each individual child that's

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.990 
it to each individual child that's
appealing<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.440> us<00:00:49.469> both<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.550> us<00:00:50.670> didn't<00:00:50.969> really

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
appealing to us both of us didn't really

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.840 
appealing to us both of us didn't really
have<00:00:51.390> very<00:00:51.629> good<00:00:51.840> experiences<00:00:52.770> with<00:00:52.850> public

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.549 
have very good experiences with public
school<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:55.289> think<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.250> lot<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:57.260> issues<00:00:58.260> with

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
school I think a lot of the issues with

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.729 
school I think a lot of the issues with
public<00:00:59.460> school<00:00:59.760> is<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.230> everyone<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.379> more

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
public school is that everyone is more

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.050 
public school is that everyone is more
concerned<00:01:02.579> with<00:01:03.080> the<00:01:04.080> social<00:01:04.830> aspects<00:01:05.820> of

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
concerned with the social aspects of

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.280 
concerned with the social aspects of
public<00:01:06.390> school<00:01:06.659> rather<00:01:06.869> than<00:01:07.170> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
public school rather than the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.140 
public school rather than the
educational<00:01:08.100> aspects<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:09.210> public<00:01:09.780> school<00:01:10.049> I

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
educational aspects of public school I

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.760 
educational aspects of public school I
saw<00:01:12.150> something<00:01:12.479> on<00:01:12.570> Facebook<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.560> other<00:01:13.619> day

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
saw something on Facebook the other day

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.789 
saw something on Facebook the other day
it<00:01:14.189> was<00:01:14.490> an<00:01:14.909> article<00:01:15.689> about<00:01:16.610> okay<00:01:17.610> what<00:01:18.799> city

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
it was an article about okay what city

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.120 
it was an article about okay what city
or<00:01:19.860> town<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.310> was<00:01:20.460> but<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.330> some<00:01:21.630> state<00:01:22.130> there

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
or town it was but in some state there

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.130 
or town it was but in some state there
was<00:01:24.619> some<00:01:25.619> some<00:01:26.549> decision<00:01:27.210> made<00:01:27.450> with<00:01:27.869> their

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
was some some decision made with their

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.289 
was some some decision made with their
the<00:01:28.439> Board<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.680> Education<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.520> city<00:01:30.210> I

the Board of Education in that city I

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.140

truly are no I don't think it should be
like<00:04:58.520> that<00:04:58.550> I<00:04:58.759> think<00:04:59.180> that<00:05:01.060> there's<00:05:02.060> you<00:05:02.720> know

if you need somebody or you feel lost or
whatnot<00:05:10.370> but<00:05:11.030> I<00:05:11.060> don't<00:05:11.240> think<00:05:11.539> that<00:05:12.190> bringing

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
whatnot but I don't think that bringing

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.170 
whatnot but I don't think that bringing
gender<00:05:14.360> fluid<00:05:14.840> and<00:05:15.169> gent<00:05:15.440> like<00:05:16.180> gender

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
curriculum is really necessary but being

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.540

more decisions like that are scary

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.839 
more decisions like that are scary
