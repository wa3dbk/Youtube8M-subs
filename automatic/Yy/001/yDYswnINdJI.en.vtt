so crap on ultimate team in a way why is
that<00:01:20.150> and<00:01:20.600> I<00:01:20.840> feel<00:01:21.049> like<00:01:21.079> they've<00:01:21.290> just<00:01:21.500> based

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
that and I feel like they've just based

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.740 
that and I feel like they've just based
this<00:01:22.340> one<00:01:22.700> thief<00:01:23.030> all<00:01:23.240> about<00:01:23.540> dribbling

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
this one thief all about dribbling

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.660 
this one thief all about dribbling
because<00:01:24.140> of<00:01:24.259> messy<00:01:24.590> I<00:01:24.710> don't<00:01:24.890> know<00:01:24.950> and<00:01:25.189> that's

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
because of messy I don't know and that's

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.039 
because of messy I don't know and that's
probably<00:01:25.820> really<00:01:26.090> far-fetched<00:01:26.420> but<00:01:26.780> if<00:01:26.960> you

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
probably really far-fetched but if you

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.770 
probably really far-fetched but if you
look<00:01:27.259> at<00:01:27.409> it<00:01:27.530> he's<00:01:28.009> absolutely<00:01:28.460> amazing<00:01:29.450> he<00:01:29.659> is

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
just so good you can't stop him so every

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.270 
just so good you can't stop him so every
single<00:01:32.990> thing<00:01:33.020> I<00:01:33.229> do<00:01:33.290> here<00:01:33.710> is<00:01:33.860> pretty<00:01:34.100> much<00:01:34.220> a

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.080 
goal so you're gonna expect it to be a
goal<00:01:35.990> anyway<00:01:36.399> whenever<00:01:37.399> I'm<00:01:37.640> on<00:01:37.729> the<00:01:37.880> ball<00:01:38.060> but
