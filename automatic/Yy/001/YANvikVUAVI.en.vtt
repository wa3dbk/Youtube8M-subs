them you you obviously do more in in
this<00:01:17.909> case<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.299> I'm<00:01:18.390> just<00:01:18.570> trying<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.960> show<00:01:19.920> you

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
this case so I'm just trying to show you

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.010 
this case so I'm just trying to show you
how<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.520> works

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
how it works

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.770 
how it works
so<00:01:22.220> before<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.250> start<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.790> program<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.450> had<00:01:24.659> to

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
so before I start the program I had to

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.490 
so before I start the program I had to
do<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.200> little<00:01:25.590> reconnaissance<00:01:26.630> so<00:01:27.630> what<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.380> do

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
do a little reconnaissance so what I do

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.480 
do a little reconnaissance so what I do
is<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.280> find<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.090> level<00:01:30.750> NB<00:01:31.650> C's<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.159> want

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
is I find the level NB C's that I want

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.550 
is I find the level NB C's that I want
to<00:01:32.640> attack<00:01:33.829> which<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.130> case<00:01:35.340> I'll<00:01:35.579> say

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
to attack which in this case I'll say

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.660 
to attack which in this case I'll say
level<00:01:37.560> 5<00:01:39.710> so<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.740> know<00:01:40.920> there's<00:01:41.100> some<00:01:41.310> up<00:01:41.640> here

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
level 5 so I know there's some up here

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.609 
level 5 so I know there's some up here
because<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.390> used<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.810> attack<00:01:43.079> them<00:01:43.259> out<00:01:43.380> all

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
because I used to attack them out all

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:44.179 
because I used to attack them out all
the<00:01:43.799> time

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
the time

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.490 
the time
alrighty<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.360> write<00:01:46.320> down<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.770> coordinates

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
alrighty so I write down the coordinates

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.620 
alrighty so I write down the coordinates
on<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.530> piece<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.799> paper<00:01:49.979> or<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.729> hex<00:01:51.360> file

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
on a piece of paper or in a hex file

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.740 
on a piece of paper or in a hex file
however<00:01:52.579> you<00:01:53.579> would<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:53.729> for<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.329> NPC's

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
however you would like for the NPC's

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.700 
however you would like for the NPC's
