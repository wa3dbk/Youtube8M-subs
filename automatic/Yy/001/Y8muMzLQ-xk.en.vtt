of<00:00:16.199> this<00:00:16.350> game<00:00:16.590> maybe<00:00:16.859> because<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.490> last<00:00:17.670> two

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
of this game maybe because the last two

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.019 
of this game maybe because the last two
it<00:00:18.270> came<00:00:18.750> up<00:00:18.900> in<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.080> comment<00:00:20.039> recently<00:00:20.580> that

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
it came up in a comment recently that

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.540 
it came up in a comment recently that
the<00:00:21.119> game<00:00:21.300> kind<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.779> felt<00:00:21.990> unfinished<00:00:22.949> towards

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
the game kind of felt unfinished towards

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.660 
the game kind of felt unfinished towards
the<00:00:23.699> end<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.529> its<00:00:25.529> kind<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:25.890> felt<00:00:26.099> like<00:00:26.160> slap

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
the end and its kind of felt like slap

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.970 
the end and its kind of felt like slap
together<00:00:27.019> and<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.109> do<00:00:28.170> think<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.650> last<00:00:28.800> couple

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
together and I do think the last couple

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.830 
together and I do think the last couple
levels<00:00:29.189> had<00:00:29.490> good<00:00:29.910> potential<00:00:30.300> but<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.660> just

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
levels had good potential but I just

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.120 
levels had good potential but I just
think<00:00:31.189> clarksville<00:00:32.189> was<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.940> best<00:00:33.120> area<00:00:33.570> and

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
think clarksville was the best area and

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.560 
think clarksville was the best area and
lake<00:00:35.130> when<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.399> are<00:00:35.579> war<00:00:35.790> had<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.000> good<00:00:36.180> music

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
lake when you are war had a good music

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.889 
lake when you are war had a good music

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
there it doesn't feel that good but

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.729 
there it doesn't feel that good but
anyways<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.360> it's<00:00:42.870> kind<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.110> been<00:00:43.230> dragging<00:00:43.649> on

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.520 
anyways so it's kind of been dragging on
a<00:00:43.770> bit<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.250> know<00:00:44.370> it's<00:00:44.610> not<00:00:44.730> my<00:00:44.910> most<00:00:45.270> popular

guide the views I get the comments I get

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.720 
guide the views I get the comments I get
it's<00:00:48.930> low<00:00:49.289> compared<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.980> like<00:00:50.250> Ratchet<00:00:50.579> and

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
it's low compared to like Ratchet and

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.209 
it's low compared to like Ratchet and
Clank<00:00:50.760> but<00:00:51.239> you'd<00:00:51.360> expect<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:52.020> because<00:00:52.379> it's

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
Clank but you'd expect that because it's

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.229 
Clank but you'd expect that because it's
not<00:00:53.399> what<00:00:53.550> I'm<00:00:53.640> known<00:00:53.820> for

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
not many people do know this game so I'm

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.819 
not many people do know this game so I'm
glad<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.570> it's<00:00:57.719> finally<00:00:57.780> gonna<00:00:58.079> be<00:00:58.260> over<00:00:58.289> and

quicker

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.140 

now<00:01:15.500> this<00:01:15.860> chased<00:01:16.220> by<00:01:16.430> the<00:01:16.490> Doberman<00:01:16.970> is

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
now this chased by the Doberman is

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.910 
now this chased by the Doberman is
actually<00:01:17.780> quite<00:01:18.080> difficult<00:01:18.350> which<00:01:18.770> is<00:01:18.799> a

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
actually quite difficult which is a

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.649 
actually quite difficult which is a
surprise<00:01:19.310> because<00:01:19.670> this<00:01:19.820> one's<00:01:20.030> difficult

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
surprise because this one's difficult

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.600 
surprise because this one's difficult
but<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:21.440> one<00:01:21.560> we<00:01:21.650> actually<00:01:21.770> get<00:01:22.070> in<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:22.460> dog

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
but the one we actually get in the dog

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.219 
but the one we actually get in the dog
pound<00:01:22.909> isn't<00:01:23.300> that<00:01:23.630> difficult

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
pound isn't that difficult

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.170 
pound isn't that difficult
I'd<00:01:24.650> advise<00:01:25.070> turning<00:01:25.670> otherwise<00:01:25.909> it's<00:01:26.090> gonna

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
I'd advise turning otherwise it's gonna

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.840 
I'd advise turning otherwise it's gonna
catch<00:01:26.479> it<00:01:26.780> and<00:01:27.049> you're<00:01:27.170> gonna<00:01:27.259> fail<00:01:27.759> but<00:01:28.759> if

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
catch it and you're gonna fail but if

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.370 
catch it and you're gonna fail but if
your<00:01:28.940> turn<00:01:29.150> you<00:01:29.570> can<00:01:29.600> turn<00:01:29.869> better<00:01:30.110> than<00:01:30.259> him

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
your turn you can turn better than him

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.810 
your turn you can turn better than him
so<00:01:30.979> yeah<00:01:32.710> how<00:01:33.710> that<00:01:33.950> works<00:01:34.190> cuz<00:01:34.490> we<00:01:34.580> didn't

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
so yeah how that works cuz we didn't

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.620 
so yeah how that works cuz we didn't
actually<00:01:35.080> escape<00:01:36.080> really<00:01:36.530> from<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.729> Doberman

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
actually escape really from the Doberman

but we're actually gonna sneak straight

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.120 
but we're actually gonna sneak straight
past<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:41.360> Doberman<00:01:41.899> houses<00:01:42.649> running<00:01:42.770> back
