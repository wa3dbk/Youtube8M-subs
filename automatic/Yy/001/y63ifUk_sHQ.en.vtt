00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.090
 we have all these beautiful ones 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.350
 handmade is entrusted 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.920
 I hope I do not do much 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.920
 broken 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.930
 sounds good is already stretched 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.930
 a new car on it has 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.720
 there was quite a change something like that 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.930
 There were many new rules like this year 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.930
 never 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.989
 new and old cars in direct 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.660
 comparison were sebastian in his 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.129
 winner car from last year 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.750
 the idea was the new cars very much 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.750
 safer and more fuel efficient 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.310
 Here are the main changes 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.930
 new nose of wing text wing engine 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.580
 Another energy recovery 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.740
 system and much more 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.700
 the allowed amount of fuel was over one 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.830
 third less than 30 less in the tank 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.140
 spades and so much without loving 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.710
 we get a gear more out of seven 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.710
 become 8 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.970
 But the most revolutionary change is 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.620
 the new, more economical engine sucker 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.110
 but injectors with higher pressure 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:42.290
 for optimized fuel combustion 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:45.990
 two cylinder from v6 city ​​v8 the 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.909
 speed is limited to 15,000 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.490
 and the turbo is back and so on 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.320
 also the turbo cent 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.840
 the energy recovery system was 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.860
 expands the new he works with it 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.940
 two engine generators 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.660
 the new one is going to be hot 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.100
 exhaust gases driven the other 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.080
 continues to use the braking energy of the 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.159
 rear wheels and is significantly stronger 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.110
 born 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.170
 The battery stores ten times more energy 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.080
 enough for about 13 seconds round 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.379
 before 66 and twice as aware of 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.370
 160 ps 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.810
 There is also more torque 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.519
 The car is accelerating out 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.440
 harder to control 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.510
 we will probably be more 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.280
 two fighting 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.959
 outward in aerodynamics has become 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.939
 many things change our feet 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.370
 slip down a bit because the nose off 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:35.689
 For reasons of safety, he sits lower 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.939
 front wing becomes narrower 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:39.950
 with us is significantly reduced the 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:41.870
 blue the user falls off the cheap 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.750
 even the tail disappears must be supported 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.459
 be the main wing with flat and 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.230
 it is possible to continue the attacks 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.390
 with that it can be even more aggressive 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.770
 become 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.340
 only one drivetrain must now 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.340
 to hold even longer 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.780
 Instead of the earlier eight engines we have for 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.720
 the entire season now only five 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.160
 drive strands 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.570
 we want the first motor the same time 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.570
 a bit tickle let's golf 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:16.420
 the new rules reduce the engine 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:19.540
 from 24 liters v8 to 16 liters v6 the 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:23.140
 maximum turn drops from 18,000 to 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.660
 15,000 for a better and more efficient 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.030
 Performance comes a turbocharger and a 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.400
 gasoline direct injection for use 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.380
 the turbocharger will be with the hitherto 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.420
 driven unused exhaust 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.750
 this increases the performance and 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.630
 Efficiency The hybrid system consists of 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.410
 two units one part stores the 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.690
 braking energy 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:48.160
 the other part produces from exhaust 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:50.350
 turbocharger energy 160 instead of 80 so far 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.590
 Additive ps is therefore the pilots for 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.569
 33 seconds per round available 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.209
 every driver has this start to finish 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:02.230
 season a maximum of 100 kilos of fuel 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:05.140
 on board in 2013 it was still 150 kilograms 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.090
 So the new drive gets 30 percent 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:11.459
 more power out of every drop 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.459
 as the predecessor v8 engine
