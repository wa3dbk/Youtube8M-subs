00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
go ahead and activate but the 4s is

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.310 
go ahead and activate but the 4s is
smart<00:02:06.210> enough<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.450> go<00:02:06.689> ahead<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.170> go<00:02:07.290> through

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
smart enough to go ahead and go through

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.380 
smart enough to go ahead and go through
the<00:02:07.590> activation<00:02:08.160> process<00:02:08.340> just<00:02:08.940> whenever<00:02:09.149> you

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
the activation process just whenever you

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.720 
the activation process just whenever you
put<00:02:09.569> in<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.899> new<00:02:10.349> SIM<00:02:10.590> card<00:02:10.860> which<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.039> nice<00:02:11.370> at

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
put in a new SIM card which is nice at

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.920 
put in a new SIM card which is nice at

have kind of a novice at doing the
unlocks<00:02:17.500> bitch<00:02:17.739> it's<00:02:18.129> really<00:02:18.609> easy<00:02:18.790> it's

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
unlocks bitch it's really easy it's

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.089 
unlocks bitch it's really easy it's
super<00:02:19.510> straightforward<00:02:19.780> so<00:02:20.709> I<00:02:20.739> put<00:02:21.010> my

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
super straightforward so I put my

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.099 
super straightforward so I put my
t-mobile<00:02:21.579> SIM<00:02:21.700> card<00:02:22.239> in<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:23.019> I<00:02:23.980> hit<00:02:24.069> okay<00:02:25.109> I'll

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:26.109 
t-mobile SIM card in and I hit okay I'll

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:29.130 
t-mobile SIM card in and I hit okay I'll
just<00:02:26.290> give<00:02:26.500> it<00:02:26.590> a<00:02:26.650> second<00:02:27.420> now<00:02:28.420> this<00:02:28.689> takes<00:02:28.900> a

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
just give it a second now this takes a

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.539 
just give it a second now this takes a
little<00:02:29.439> while<00:02:29.739> you'll<00:02:30.040> see<00:02:30.189> in<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.370> upper

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
little while you'll see in the upper

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.069 
little while you'll see in the upper
left-hand<00:02:30.790> corner<00:02:30.939> it<00:02:31.209> says<00:02:31.329> no<00:02:31.569> service

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079 
left-hand corner it says no service

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:34.170 
left-hand corner it says no service
eventually<00:02:32.560> you'll<00:02:33.040> see<00:02:33.250> you<00:02:33.340> searching<00:02:33.849> as

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
eventually you'll see you searching as

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.720 
eventually you'll see you searching as
it<00:02:34.329> is<00:02:34.450> now<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.950> it's<00:02:36.189> gonna<00:02:36.370> just<00:02:36.579> keep

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
it is now and it's gonna just keep

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.610 
it is now and it's gonna just keep
searching<00:02:37.150> for<00:02:37.299> a<00:02:37.329> little<00:02:37.540> while<00:02:37.719> just<00:02:38.019> give

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
searching for a little while just give

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.640 
searching for a little while just give
it<00:02:38.709> a<00:02:38.739> few<00:02:38.799> seconds<00:02:39.430> here<00:02:40.349> but<00:02:41.349> this<00:02:41.500> whole

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
it a few seconds here but this whole

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.319 
it a few seconds here but this whole
process<00:02:41.889> I<00:02:42.159> was<00:02:42.579> really<00:02:42.819> shocked<00:02:43.090> with<00:02:43.269> how

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
process I was really shocked with how

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.280 
process I was really shocked with how
easy<00:02:43.480> this<00:02:44.019> was<00:02:44.079> it<00:02:44.709> was<00:02:44.829> just<00:02:44.980> super<00:02:45.639> fast<00:02:46.290> now

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
easy this was it was just super fast now

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.369 
easy this was it was just super fast now
granted<00:02:47.680> I<00:02:47.980> was<00:02:48.310> testing<00:02:49.269> this<00:02:49.359> out<00:02:49.599> and<00:02:49.870> so

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379 
granted I was testing this out and so

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:51.750 
granted I was testing this out and so
there<00:02:50.620> medic<00:02:50.889> did<00:02:51.069> provide<00:02:51.400> me<00:02:51.459> with<00:02:51.700> the

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
there medic did provide me with the

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.899 
there medic did provide me with the
unlock<00:02:52.239> free<00:02:52.569> of<00:02:52.689> charge<00:02:52.959> but<00:02:53.769> you<00:02:54.340> know<00:02:54.489> from

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:54.909 
unlock free of charge but you know from

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:56.640 
unlock free of charge but you know from
what<00:02:55.090> I've<00:02:55.209> seen<00:02:55.450> thus<00:02:55.689> far<00:02:55.989> it<00:02:56.200> seems<00:02:56.379> like<00:02:56.620> a

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
what I've seen thus far it seems like a

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.289 
what I've seen thus far it seems like a
pretty<00:02:56.980> straightforward<00:02:57.370> process<00:02:57.819> that

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
pretty straightforward process that

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.089 
pretty straightforward process that
turnaround<00:02:58.569> time<00:02:58.900> shouldn't<00:02:59.200> be<00:02:59.409> long<00:02:59.709> at<00:02:59.889> all

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
turnaround time shouldn't be long at all

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.129 
turnaround time shouldn't be long at all
and<00:03:00.340> it's<00:03:00.879> fairly<00:03:01.120> inexpensive<00:03:01.419> when<00:03:02.049> you

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:02.139 
and it's fairly inexpensive when you

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:04.110 
and it's fairly inexpensive when you
compare<00:03:02.560> it<00:03:02.650> to<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.980> other<00:03:03.010> unlock<00:03:03.579> services

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
compare it to the other unlock services

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.949 
compare it to the other unlock services
out<00:03:04.750> there<00:03:04.810> so<00:03:05.560> looks<00:03:06.519> like<00:03:06.609> we<00:03:07.000> are<00:03:07.030> coming
