I work from my studio in buxton
unfortunate<00:00:10.380> to<00:00:10.470> have<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.620> large-ish<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.580> do<00:00:11.790> so

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
unfortunate to have a large-ish to do so

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.820 
unfortunate to have a large-ish to do so
I<00:00:12.360> can<00:00:12.719> do<00:00:12.809> a<00:00:12.840> number<00:00:12.900> of<00:00:13.110> different<00:00:13.200> projects

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
I can do a number of different projects

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.730 
I can do a number of different projects
at<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:13.980> same<00:00:14.250> time<00:00:14.610> I<00:00:15.030> love<00:00:15.959> developing<00:00:16.590> a

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
at the same time I love developing a

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.560 
at the same time I love developing a
whole<00:00:16.980> series<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.490> works<00:00:17.850> that<00:00:18.150> are<00:00:18.270> related

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
whole series of works that are related

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.390 
whole series of works that are related
which<00:00:19.080> use<00:00:19.289> different<00:00:19.740> approaches<00:00:20.039> and

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
which use different approaches and

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.880 
which use different approaches and
different<00:00:20.430> media<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.539> can<00:00:21.750> seem<00:00:22.050> very<00:00:22.470> diverse

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
different media it can seem very diverse

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.100 
different media it can seem very diverse
but<00:00:23.340> if<00:00:23.520> the<00:00:23.880> works<00:00:24.060> are<00:00:24.300> all<00:00:24.360> together<00:00:24.540> it's

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
but if the works are all together it's

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.200 
but if the works are all together it's
evident<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.740> they're<00:00:25.950> related<00:00:26.580> for

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
evident that they're related for

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.540 
evident that they're related for
instance<00:00:27.600> these<00:00:27.900> fish<00:00:28.320> come<00:00:29.280> out<00:00:29.400> of

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
instance these fish come out of

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.640 
instance these fish come out of
developing<00:00:29.970> texture<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.690> pattern<00:00:30.870> something

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
developing texture and pattern something

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.160 
developing texture and pattern something
that<00:00:31.800> runs<00:00:31.980> through<00:00:32.460> all<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.640> my<00:00:32.850> work<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.660> out

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
that runs through all of my work and out

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
that runs through all of my work and out
of<00:00:34.410> these<00:00:35.039> paintings<00:00:35.809> came<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:37.260> my<00:00:37.379> car<00:00:37.980> graph

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
of these paintings came to my car graph

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.680 
of these paintings came to my car graph
techniques<00:00:38.700> which<00:00:38.969> I'll<00:00:39.180> talk<00:00:39.390> about<00:00:39.449> later

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
techniques which I'll talk about later

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.470 
techniques which I'll talk about later
in<00:00:40.499> the<00:00:40.739> process<00:00:40.949> of<00:00:41.219> making<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:41.670> painting<00:00:42.269> I

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
in the process of making this painting I

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.020 
in the process of making this painting I
was<00:00:42.780> playing<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.289> scales<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:44.129> they're<00:00:44.730> made

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
was playing the scales and they're made

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.689 
was playing the scales and they're made
by<00:00:45.059> painting<00:00:45.809> up<00:00:45.989> paper<00:00:46.469> with<00:00:47.280> beautiful

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
by painting up paper with beautiful

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:50.599 
by painting up paper with beautiful
abstract<00:00:48.089> colors<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:49.079> then<00:00:50.010> cut<00:00:50.280> out<00:00:50.339> the

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 
abstract colors I then cut out the

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:53.989 
abstract colors I then cut out the
scales<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.780> these<00:00:52.319> would<00:00:53.219> be<00:00:53.370> applied<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.879> the

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:53.999 
scales and these would be applied to the

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:55.849 
scales and these would be applied to the
painting<00:00:54.449> but<00:00:54.629> they<00:00:54.780> would<00:00:54.960> be<00:00:54.989> or<00:00:55.559> owned

00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:55.859 
painting but they would be or owned

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:58.459 
painting but they would be or owned
place<00:00:56.100> like<00:00:56.519> little<00:00:56.760> jewels<00:00:57.050> out<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.319> this

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
place like little jewels out of this

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.709 
place like little jewels out of this
came<00:00:58.889> the<00:00:59.129> fishermen's<00:00:59.550> trophy<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.359> skin<00:01:00.629> of

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
came the fishermen's trophy the skin of

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.349 
came the fishermen's trophy the skin of
the<00:01:00.809> mermaid's<00:01:01.170> tail<00:01:01.639> which<00:01:02.639> is<00:01:02.909> again<00:01:03.149> about

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
the mermaid's tail which is again about

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.870 
the mermaid's tail which is again about
pattern<00:01:03.899> but<00:01:04.350> it's<00:01:04.530> really<00:01:04.890> concentrates<00:01:05.670> on

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
pattern but it's really concentrates on

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.190 
pattern but it's really concentrates on
the<00:01:06.690> beauty<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.710> minut<00:01:08.220> detail<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.270> nature

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
the beauty of the minut detail in nature

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.070 
the beauty of the minut detail in nature
like<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:11.070> fisherman's<00:01:11.460> tale<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.300> use<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
like the fisherman's tale the use of the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.380 
like the fisherman's tale the use of the
repetitive<00:01:13.680> pattern<00:01:14.190> was<00:01:14.760> further<00:01:15.060> developed

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
repetitive pattern was further developed

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.090 
repetitive pattern was further developed
into<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:15.960> picture<00:01:16.790> each<00:01:18.140> piece<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.800> is

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
into this picture each piece in this is

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.900 
into this picture each piece in this is
like<00:01:20.370> an<00:01:20.520> individual<00:01:21.210> abstract<00:01:21.900> painting

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
like an individual abstract painting

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.590 
like an individual abstract painting
celebrating<00:01:23.910> color<00:01:24.300> but<00:01:25.290> it's<00:01:25.440> put<00:01:25.710> on<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> grid

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
celebrating color but it's put on a grid

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.160 
celebrating color but it's put on a grid
so<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:28.170> has<00:01:28.530> an<00:01:28.940> almost<00:01:29.990> mantra<00:01:30.990> light

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
so that it has an almost mantra light

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.820 
so that it has an almost mantra light
quality<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:32.010> i<00:01:32.790> think<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.510> like<00:01:34.410> a<00:01:34.440> meditation

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
quality and i think is like a meditation

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.030 
quality and i think is like a meditation
and<00:01:35.430> it's<00:01:35.730> very<00:01:36.180> calming<00:01:36.870> the<00:01:37.500> branches<00:01:38.010> of

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
and it's very calming the branches of

these trees are an intricate pattern in

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
with strings and canvas and with these I

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.620 
with strings and canvas and with these I

into all the textures let that dry apply

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.650 
into all the textures let that dry apply
another<00:03:40.739> another<00:03:41.250> glaze<00:03:41.640> of<00:03:41.850> paint<00:03:42.180> let<00:03:42.540> it
