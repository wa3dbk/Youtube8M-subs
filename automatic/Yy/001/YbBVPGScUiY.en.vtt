00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
bit of style let's take a look at what a

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.090 
bit of style let's take a look at what a
macaca<00:00:43.649> looks<00:00:44.100> like<00:00:44.809> so<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.739> macaque

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
macaca looks like so this is a macaque

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.410 
macaca looks like so this is a macaque
ooh<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.820> looks<00:00:48.000> like<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:49.700> whoo<00:00:50.730> like<00:00:51.390> a

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
ooh it looks like this whoo like a

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.569 
ooh it looks like this whoo like a
one-handed<00:00:52.050> backhands<00:00:52.590> from<00:00:52.770> kind<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.280> right

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
one-handed backhands from kind of right

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.790 
one-handed backhands from kind of right
but<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:54.120> guess<00:00:54.360> there's<00:00:54.840> different<00:00:55.320> ways<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.649> do

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
but I guess there's different ways to do

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.740 
but I guess there's different ways to do
it<00:00:55.980> if<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.219> want<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.370> get<00:00:56.520> real<00:00:56.789> Brazilian

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
it if you want to get real Brazilian

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.170 
it if you want to get real Brazilian
kept<00:00:58.109> wet<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.829> believe<00:00:59.399> they<00:00:59.640> even<00:00:59.670> go

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
kept wet on it I believe they even go

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.009 
kept wet on it I believe they even go
into<00:01:00.949> like<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:01.980> two-hand<00:01:02.699> thing<00:01:02.969> but<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.600> like<00:01:03.870> it

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
into like a two-hand thing but I like it

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.280 
into like a two-hand thing but I like it
for<00:01:04.229> one<00:01:04.379> hand<00:01:04.650> because<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.430> allows<00:01:05.640> me<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.290> do

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
for one hand because it allows me to do

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.120 
for one hand because it allows me to do
cool<00:01:07.560> stuff

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
cool stuff

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.859

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
there's one way to solve that god I'm

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.370 
there's one way to solve that god I'm
losing<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.420> anyway

you<00:01:35.070> are<00:01:35.310> going<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.520> solve<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.759> by<00:01:36.030> doing<00:01:36.270> a

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
you are going to solve that by doing a

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.420 
you are going to solve that by doing a
bridge<00:01:36.810> okay<00:01:37.439> there's<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.860> couple<00:01:38.130> different

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
bridge okay there's a couple different

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.640 
bridge okay there's a couple different
versions<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:39.000> bridges<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:40.079> have<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.409> start

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
versions of bridges you have to start

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.550 
versions of bridges you have to start
off<00:01:40.740> simply<00:01:41.070> by<00:01:41.340> just<00:01:41.880> lifting<00:01:42.270> here<00:01:42.750> if<00:01:42.930> this

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
off simply by just lifting here if this

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.649 
off simply by just lifting here if this
doesn't<00:01:43.950> feel<00:01:44.100> good<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:45.030> probably<00:01:45.299> shouldn't

doesn't feel good you probably shouldn't

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.840 
doesn't feel good you probably shouldn't
go<00:01:45.750> too<00:01:45.810> much<00:01:46.049> further<00:01:46.290> yet<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:47.340> next<00:01:47.640> bridge

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
go too much further yet the next bridge

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.520 
go too much further yet the next bridge
portion<00:01:48.360> you're<00:01:48.479> going<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.659> do<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:49.320> actually

fingers facing down and slowly start to

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.240 
fingers facing down and slowly start to
lift<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:57.329> can<00:01:57.420> stay<00:01:57.600> here<00:01:57.990> or<00:01:58.770> if<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.070> feel

you<00:02:30.510> need<00:02:30.630> to<00:02:30.660> know<00:02:30.950> there<00:02:31.950> are<00:02:31.980> progressions

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
you need to know there are progressions

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.400 
you need to know there are progressions
with<00:02:32.820> this<00:02:32.970> don't<00:02:33.630> worry<00:02:33.840> if<00:02:33.960> you<00:02:34.050> can't<00:02:34.290> get

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
with this don't worry if you can't get

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.660 
with this don't worry if you can't get
it<00:02:34.530> straight<00:02:34.710> over<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.040> top<00:02:35.100> right<00:02:35.460> away

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
it straight over the top right away

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.640 
it straight over the top right away
we'll<00:02:36.360> start<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.780> progress<00:02:36.990> it<00:02:37.230> out<00:02:37.380> and

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
we'll start to progress it out and

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.610 
we'll start to progress it out and
around<00:02:38.030> thing<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.300> it<00:02:39.840> looks<00:02:40.050> cooler<00:02:40.350> when<00:02:40.530> it

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
around thing is it looks cooler when it

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.100 
around thing is it looks cooler when it
goes<00:02:40.740> straight<00:02:40.860> over<00:02:41.040> I<00:02:41.520> think<00:02:42.360> well<00:02:42.630> that's

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
goes straight over I think well that's

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.170 
goes straight over I think well that's
up<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.350> you<00:02:43.470> I<00:02:43.590> guess<00:02:43.770> but<00:02:44.280> what<00:02:45.000> we're<00:02:45.150> going

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
up to you I guess but what we're going

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.230 
up to you I guess but what we're going
to<00:02:45.300> do<00:02:45.450> is<00:02:46.010> start<00:02:47.010> this<00:02:47.160> progression<00:02:47.490> first

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
to do is start this progression first

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.760 
to do is start this progression first
thing<00:02:48.390> we<00:02:48.480> need<00:02:48.600> to<00:02:48.690> know<00:02:48.840> is<00:02:49.050> hand<00:02:49.320> position

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
thing we need to know is hand position

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.160 
thing we need to know is hand position
is<00:02:49.890> important<00:02:50.490> if<00:02:50.760> my<00:02:51.360> hand<00:02:51.570> is<00:02:51.690> facing<00:02:52.050> this

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
is important if my hand is facing this

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.650 
is important if my hand is facing this
way<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.680> I<00:02:53.040> try<00:02:53.070> to<00:02:53.310> go<00:02:53.460> over<00:02:56.420> essentially<00:02:57.420> I'm

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
way and I try to go over essentially I'm

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.600 
way and I try to go over essentially I'm
going<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:57.900> break<00:02:58.080> my<00:02:58.110> arm<00:02:58.290> don't<00:02:59.100> want<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.490> do

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
going to break my arm don't want to do

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.960 
going to break my arm don't want to do
that<00:02:59.730> ok<00:03:00.120> so<00:03:00.600> at<00:03:00.900> least<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.830> very<00:03:02.160> least<00:03:02.400> make

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
that ok so at least the very least make

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.700 
that ok so at least the very least make
sure<00:03:03.150> that<00:03:03.360> your<00:03:03.510> hand<00:03:03.720> faces<00:03:04.170> behind<00:03:04.530> you

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
sure that your hand faces behind you

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.700 
sure that your hand faces behind you
which<00:03:05.130> will<00:03:05.280> allow<00:03:05.460> for<00:03:06.030> you<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:07.020> kind<00:03:07.380> of<00:03:07.530> get

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
which will allow for you to kind of get

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.910 
which will allow for you to kind of get
now<00:03:08.400> even<00:03:08.790> in<00:03:08.910> this<00:03:09.000> position<00:03:09.210> my<00:03:09.900> hand<00:03:10.230> from

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
now even in this position my hand from

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.280 
now even in this position my hand from
here<00:03:11.310> doesn't<00:03:12.210> seem<00:03:12.240> to<00:03:12.540> be<00:03:12.630> very<00:03:12.720> safe<00:03:12.990> right

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
here doesn't seem to be very safe right

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.770 
here doesn't seem to be very safe right
so<00:03:13.440> it's<00:03:13.530> gonna<00:03:13.620> end<00:03:13.830> up<00:03:13.950> pivoting<00:03:14.570> let's<00:03:15.570> keep

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
so it's gonna end up pivoting let's keep

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.710 
so it's gonna end up pivoting let's keep
in<00:03:15.990> mind<00:03:16.020> and<00:03:16.920> now<00:03:17.280> this<00:03:17.430> is<00:03:17.640> my<00:03:17.790> rule<00:03:18.090> general

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
in mind and now this is my rule general

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.750 
in mind and now this is my rule general
rule<00:03:18.900> I<00:03:19.080> think<00:03:19.110> works<00:03:19.560> out<00:03:19.770> from<00:03:19.980> ikkaku<00:03:20.340> is

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
rule I think works out from ikkaku is

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.990 
rule I think works out from ikkaku is
wherever<00:03:21.750> your<00:03:21.900> fingers<00:03:22.350> face<00:03:22.590> your<00:03:23.490> feet<00:03:23.760> can

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
wherever your fingers face your feet can

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.550 
wherever your fingers face your feet can
face<00:03:24.380> ok<00:03:25.640> and<00:03:26.640> that<00:03:26.820> exact<00:03:27.150> direction<00:03:27.600> so<00:03:28.440> when

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
face ok and that exact direction so when

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.160 
face ok and that exact direction so when
we<00:03:28.650> do<00:03:28.830> it<00:03:28.860> it<00:03:29.520> seems<00:03:29.820> a<00:03:29.970> little<00:03:30.030> weird<00:03:30.360> to<00:03:30.540> try

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
we do it it seems a little weird to try

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.930 
we do it it seems a little weird to try
to<00:03:31.260> get<00:03:31.440> our<00:03:31.530> hand<00:03:31.740> completely<00:03:32.070> backwards<00:03:32.730> and

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
to get our hand completely backwards and

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.300 
to get our hand completely backwards and
in<00:03:33.840> this<00:03:34.050> position<00:03:34.290> yeah<00:03:34.709> that<00:03:34.890> is<00:03:35.010> kind<00:03:35.250> of

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
in this position yeah that is kind of

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.070 
in this position yeah that is kind of
strange<00:03:35.580> right<00:03:35.730> it's<00:03:36.420> a<00:03:36.480> good<00:03:36.600> stretch<00:03:36.840> in<00:03:36.870> the

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
strange right it's a good stretch in the

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.460 
strange right it's a good stretch in the
arm<00:03:37.200> food<00:03:37.500> um<00:03:38.060> but<00:03:39.060> we<00:03:39.810> don't<00:03:39.959> need<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.260> get<00:03:40.380> it

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
arm food um but we don't need to get it

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.979 
arm food um but we don't need to get it
there<00:03:40.650> exactly<00:03:41.340> because<00:03:41.790> what<00:03:42.030> we<00:03:42.120> can<00:03:42.270> do<00:03:42.450> is

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
there exactly because what we can do is

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.770 
there exactly because what we can do is
from<00:03:43.140> here<00:03:43.500> as<00:03:44.130> long<00:03:44.280> as<00:03:44.370> we<00:03:44.489> stay<00:03:44.790> low<00:03:45.030> which

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
from here as long as we stay low which

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.110 
from here as long as we stay low which
is<00:03:45.810> a<00:03:45.959> very<00:03:46.320> good<00:03:46.620> thing<00:03:47.520> to<00:03:47.670> keep<00:03:47.790> in<00:03:47.970> mind

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
is a very good thing to keep in mind

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.640 
is a very good thing to keep in mind
keep<00:03:48.390> your<00:03:48.540> body<00:03:48.720> low<00:03:48.959> because<00:03:49.080> we<00:03:49.170> don't<00:03:49.470> want

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
keep your body low because we don't want

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.120 
keep your body low because we don't want
to<00:03:49.770> go<00:03:49.860> oh<00:03:50.600> it's<00:03:51.600> not<00:03:51.840> a<00:03:51.900> whip<00:03:52.290> of<00:03:52.320> the<00:03:52.470> head<00:03:52.770> in

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
to go oh it's not a whip of the head in

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.810 
to go oh it's not a whip of the head in
any<00:03:53.430> way<00:03:53.670> it's<00:03:54.270> actually<00:03:54.510> a<00:03:55.050> drive<00:03:55.860> of<00:03:56.190> the

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
any way it's actually a drive of the

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.540 
any way it's actually a drive of the
feet<00:03:57.060> if<00:03:57.720> my<00:03:57.930> left<00:03:58.140> hand<00:03:58.410> is<00:03:58.530> going<00:03:58.560> back<00:03:58.890> I'm

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
feet if my left hand is going back I'm

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.220 
feet if my left hand is going back I'm
going<00:03:59.700> to<00:03:59.760> get<00:03:59.880> my<00:04:00.030> hand<00:04:00.300> warm<00:04:00.840> up<00:04:00.959> your<00:04:01.080> wrist

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
going to get my hand warm up your wrist

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.740 
going to get my hand warm up your wrist
that's<00:04:01.410> probably<00:04:01.680> good<00:04:01.830> idea<00:04:02.100> um<00:04:02.750> backing

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
that's probably good idea um backing

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.260 
that's probably good idea um backing
around<00:04:03.989> fingers<00:04:04.560> pointing<00:04:05.040> back<00:04:05.640> at<00:04:05.880> me<00:04:06.060> so

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
around fingers pointing back at me so

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.500 
around fingers pointing back at me so
that<00:04:06.870> when<00:04:06.989> I<00:04:07.020> do<00:04:07.140> it<00:04:07.410> I'm<00:04:07.560> here<00:04:08.400> if<00:04:09.030> my<00:04:09.270> left

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.130 
it's not so technical Lo and flexibility
movement<00:05:56.590> it's<00:05:56.800> actually<00:05:57.520> just<00:05:57.910> a<00:05:58.180> control<00:05:58.840> of

00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.140 
movement it's actually just a control of

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.950 
movement it's actually just a control of
energy<00:05:59.410> so<00:05:59.740> that<00:05:59.770> if<00:05:59.980> I<00:06:00.070> am<00:06:00.250> falling<00:06:00.580> back<00:06:00.960> it's

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
energy so that if I am falling back it's

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:02.730 
energy so that if I am falling back it's
just<00:06:02.080> that

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
just that

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.830 
just that
and<00:06:02.830> it<00:06:03.370> can<00:06:03.490> be<00:06:03.580> that<00:06:03.760> simple<00:06:04.120> that<00:06:04.690> can

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
and it can be that simple that can

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.260 
and it can be that simple that can
actually<00:06:05.020> help<00:06:05.350> save<00:06:05.680> you<00:06:05.980> from<00:06:06.550> faceplant<00:06:07.060> or

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
actually help save you from faceplant or

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.400 
actually help save you from faceplant or
fall<00:06:07.510> or<00:06:07.720> anything<00:06:07.780> that's<00:06:08.110> kind<00:06:08.290> of

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
fall or anything that's kind of

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.490 
fall or anything that's kind of
dangerous<00:06:08.560> but<00:06:09.340> it's<00:06:10.330> not<00:06:10.540> just<00:06:10.960> a<00:06:11.080> break<00:06:11.290> fall

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
dangerous but it's not just a break fall

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.020 
dangerous but it's not just a break fall
in<00:06:11.620> some<00:06:11.830> way<00:06:12.010> it<00:06:12.100> could<00:06:12.220> also<00:06:12.400> be<00:06:12.700> used<00:06:12.940> for

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
in some way it could also be used for

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.350 
in some way it could also be used for
