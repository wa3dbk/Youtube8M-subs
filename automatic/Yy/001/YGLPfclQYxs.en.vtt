parts from you guys remember the power

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.270 
parts from you guys remember the power
supply<00:00:10.440> in<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.679> case<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.490> RAM<00:00:12.259> well<00:00:13.280> just

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
supply in the case and the RAM well just

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.829 
supply in the case and the RAM well just
to<00:00:14.370> refresh<00:00:14.580> your<00:00:14.790> memory<00:00:14.849> this<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.299> actually

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
to refresh your memory this is actually

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.300 
to refresh your memory this is actually
the<00:00:15.900> case<00:00:16.109> that<00:00:16.410> that<00:00:16.500> computer<00:00:16.949> that

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
the case that that computer that

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.760 
the case that that computer that
motherboard<00:00:17.760> was<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:18.090> for<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.390> while<00:00:18.619> was<00:00:19.619> this

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
motherboard was in for a while was this

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.120 
motherboard was in for a while was this
here<00:00:20.210> I<00:00:21.210> got<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.140> RAM<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.560> power<00:00:22.740> supply

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
here I got the RAM in the power supply

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.070 
here I got the RAM in the power supply
as<00:00:23.189> well<00:00:23.279> from<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.730> board<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.269> don't<00:00:24.300> think<00:00:24.990> it

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
as well from that board I don't think it

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.689 
as well from that board I don't think it
had<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.199> graphics<00:00:25.619> card<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:26.130> think<00:00:26.519> they<00:00:26.670> just

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
had a graphics card I think they just

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.140 
had a graphics card I think they just
used<00:00:27.029> onboard<00:00:27.449> video<00:00:27.570> I'm<00:00:28.170> really<00:00:28.230> not<00:00:28.680> sure

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
used onboard video I'm really not sure

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.730 
used onboard video I'm really not sure
greatful<00:00:30.150> 42<00:00:30.480> if<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.720> could<00:00:30.900> post<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.679> in

greatful 42 if you could post that in
the<00:00:31.800> comments<00:00:32.009> as<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.460> what<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.420> use<00:00:33.690> that'd

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
the comments as to what you use that'd

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.100

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
well yeah this is a pretty nice board

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.060 
well yeah this is a pretty nice board
actually<00:00:39.050> if<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.260> had<00:00:40.350> worked<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.890> would<00:00:40.950> have

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
actually if it had worked it would have

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.190 
actually if it had worked it would have
been<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> great<00:00:41.430> board<00:00:41.700> actually<00:00:42.210> it's<00:00:43.079> got

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
been a great board actually it's got

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.529 
been a great board actually it's got
four<00:00:43.440> SATA<00:00:43.680> ports<00:00:44.040> it's<00:00:44.969> got<00:00:45.950> one<00:00:46.950> PCIe<00:00:47.539> one

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
four SATA ports it's got one PCIe one

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.930 
four SATA ports it's got one PCIe one
PCIe<00:00:49.230> x16<00:00:49.910> and<00:00:50.910> two<00:00:51.120> regular<00:00:51.600> PCI<00:00:52.140> slots<00:00:52.940> it

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
PCIe x16 and two regular PCI slots it

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.639 
PCIe x16 and two regular PCI slots it
has<00:00:54.090> an<00:00:54.180> AMD<00:00:54.390> chipset<00:00:54.899> though<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.350> don't<00:00:55.410> know

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
has an AMD chipset though I don't know

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.260 
has an AMD chipset though I don't know
what<00:00:55.800> chipset<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.520> have<00:00:56.699> not<00:00:56.879> looked<00:00:57.090> up

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
what chipset it is I have not looked up

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.930 
what chipset it is I have not looked up
this<00:00:57.420> board<00:00:57.629> yet<00:00:57.840> I'll<00:00:58.829> probably<00:00:59.070> put<00:00:59.789> some

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
this board yet I'll probably put some

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.250 
this board yet I'll probably put some
more<00:01:00.030> details<00:01:00.390> about<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.930> description

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
more details about it in the description

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.399 
more details about it in the description
when<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.590> look<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.890> up<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.600> think<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.930> Foxconn

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
when I look it up I think it's a Foxconn

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.280 
when I look it up I think it's a Foxconn
board<00:01:04.790> but<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:05.820> am<00:01:06.330> not<00:01:06.540> too<00:01:06.720> sure<00:01:06.750> on<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.170> it

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
board but I am not too sure on it it

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.630 
board but I am not too sure on it it
could<00:01:07.409> be<00:01:07.560> something<00:01:07.920> else<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.220> could<00:01:08.369> be<00:01:08.460> like

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
could be something else it could be like

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.429 
could be something else it could be like
a<00:01:08.670> an<00:01:09.119> asus<00:01:09.450> board<00:01:09.689> or<00:01:09.780> something<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.200> have<00:01:10.290> no

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
a an asus board or something I have no

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.090 
a an asus board or something I have no
idea<00:01:11.750> I'll<00:01:12.750> find<00:01:13.049> out<00:01:13.200> for<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.470> guys<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.920> put

even though it's not home theater at all
anyway<00:01:40.820> yeah<00:01:41.820> there<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.360> go<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.630> takes<00:01:42.750> ddr2

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
anyway yeah there you go it takes ddr2

it<00:01:45.659> has<00:01:45.869> floppy<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.829> IDE<00:01:47.100> which<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.640> really

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
it has floppy and IDE which I really

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.330 
it has floppy and IDE which I really
like<00:01:48.229> so<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.290> can<00:01:49.500> deal<00:01:49.799> with<00:01:49.860> legacy

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
like so you can deal with legacy

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.609 
like so you can deal with legacy
hardware<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.790> way<00:01:51.290> you'll<00:01:52.290> have<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.500> deal

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
hardware that way you'll have to deal

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.109 
hardware that way you'll have to deal
with<00:01:52.740> USB<00:01:53.070> floppy<00:01:53.250> drives<00:01:53.670> if<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.939> need<00:01:54.060> to

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
with USB floppy drives if you need to

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:01.039 
with USB floppy drives if you need to
use<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.270> floppy<00:01:54.509> drive<00:01:59.479> it's<00:02:00.479> got<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.630> firewire

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
use a floppy drive it's got a firewire

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.370 
use a floppy drive it's got a firewire
header<00:02:02.450> that's<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.600> thing<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:03.930> board

header that's the thing this board
actually<00:02:04.619> has<00:02:04.799> has<00:02:05.399> firewire<00:02:05.880> which<00:02:06.090> is

actually has has firewire which is
pretty<00:02:06.420> nice<00:02:06.689> let<00:02:07.140> me<00:02:07.200> show<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.530> back<00:02:07.710> and

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
pretty nice let me show you the back and

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.130 
pretty nice let me show you the back and
this<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.129> what<00:02:08.369> saddens<00:02:08.819> me<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:09.899> board

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
this is what saddens me that this board

this is what saddens me that this board
is<00:02:10.259> dead<00:02:10.470> because<00:02:10.770> this<00:02:11.160> could<00:02:11.489> have<00:02:11.580> been<00:02:11.700> a

is dead because this could have been a

is dead because this could have been a
very<00:02:12.030> very<00:02:12.270> nicely<00:02:12.629> featured<00:02:13.140> board<00:02:13.379> if<00:02:13.440> it

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
very very nicely featured board if it

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.820 
very very nicely featured board if it
was<00:02:13.620> still

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
was still

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.170 
was still
I<00:02:14.010> would<00:02:14.460> be<00:02:14.610> using<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.060> somewhere<00:02:15.450> if<00:02:15.570> it<00:02:15.660> was

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
I would be using it somewhere if it was

I would be using it somewhere if it was
to<00:02:18.180> ps2<00:02:18.450> ports<00:02:19.160> onboard<00:02:20.160> HDMI<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:21.060> don't<00:02:21.330> know

if<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.570> carries<00:02:21.870> audio<00:02:22.170> or<00:02:22.350> not<00:02:22.500> but<00:02:22.740> it's

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
if it carries audio or not but it's

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.750 
if it carries audio or not but it's
still<00:02:23.070> HDMI<00:02:25.640> you<00:02:26.640> get<00:02:26.850> parallel<00:02:27.720> VGA<00:02:28.760> firewire

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
still HDMI you get parallel VGA firewire

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.940 
still HDMI you get parallel VGA firewire
400<00:02:30.030> right<00:02:30.420> there<00:02:31.100> USBs<00:02:32.690> Ethernet<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:33.950> looks

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
like a pretty darn nice onboard audio I

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.160 
like a pretty darn nice onboard audio I
bet<00:02:36.960> that's<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.260> real<00:02:37.410> tech<00:02:38.300> and<00:02:39.300> it's<00:02:39.930> an<00:02:39.990> AMD

I can get once I can look up this board

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.449 
I can get once I can look up this board
so<00:03:25.200> why<00:03:25.380> do<00:03:25.440> I<00:03:25.560> have<00:03:25.769> so<00:03:26.010> here's<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.310> question

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
so why do I have so here's the question

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:27.830 
so why do I have so here's the question
you<00:03:26.670> guys<00:03:26.760> probably<00:03:27.090> asking<00:03:27.480> it's<00:03:27.600> a<00:03:27.660> dead

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
you guys probably asking it's a dead

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.470 
you guys probably asking it's a dead
board<00:03:28.080> well<00:03:28.410> why<00:03:28.560> do<00:03:28.620> I<00:03:28.739> have<00:03:28.950> it<00:03:29.330> there's<00:03:30.330> some

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
board well why do I have it there's some

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.710 
board well why do I have it there's some
salvageable<00:03:30.930> parts<00:03:31.290> on<00:03:31.410> this<00:03:31.560> board<00:03:32.720> mainly

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
salvageable parts on this board mainly

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.030 
salvageable parts on this board mainly
the<00:03:34.709> bracket<00:03:35.780> these<00:03:36.780> AMD<00:03:37.170> brackets<00:03:37.620> sometimes

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
the bracket these AMD brackets sometimes

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.130 
the bracket these AMD brackets sometimes
they<00:03:38.220> break<00:03:38.459> so<00:03:39.090> it's<00:03:39.269> useful<00:03:39.450> to<00:03:39.600> have<00:03:39.780> spares

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
they break so it's useful to have spares

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.660 
they break so it's useful to have spares
and<00:03:40.260> this<00:03:40.709> one's<00:03:40.890> particularly<00:03:41.489> nice<00:03:41.640> because

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
and this one's particularly nice because

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.449 
and this one's particularly nice because
it<00:03:42.000> has<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.120> metal<00:03:42.330> backplate<00:03:42.709> so<00:03:43.709> that'll<00:03:44.370> be

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
it has a metal backplate so that'll be

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.330 
it has a metal backplate so that'll be
good<00:03:44.580> to<00:03:44.790> have<00:03:44.970> lying<00:03:45.239> around<00:03:46.340> these

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
good to have lying around these

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.360 
good to have lying around these
capacitors<00:03:47.910> on<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.150> VRM<00:03:48.890> might<00:03:49.890> be<00:03:50.010> handy<00:03:50.280> I'm

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
capacitors on the VRM might be handy I'm

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.710 
capacitors on the VRM might be handy I'm
probably<00:03:50.519> gonna<00:03:50.700> salvage<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.180> capacitors

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
probably gonna salvage the capacitors

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.170 
probably gonna salvage the capacitors
off<00:03:51.870> of<00:03:52.019> this<00:03:52.140> board<00:03:52.670> this<00:03:53.670> makes<00:03:53.910> me<00:03:54.060> really

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
off of this board this makes me really

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.940 
off of this board this makes me really
wish<00:03:54.420> I<00:03:54.510> had<00:03:54.660> an<00:03:54.780> ESR<00:03:55.200> meter<00:03:55.230> to<00:03:55.590> check<00:03:55.620> these

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
wish I had an ESR meter to check these

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.520 
wish I had an ESR meter to check these
to<00:03:56.160> make<00:03:56.280> sure<00:03:56.459> that<00:03:56.610> they're<00:03:56.760> still<00:03:56.940> good

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:33.719 
off of it I'll probably take this
