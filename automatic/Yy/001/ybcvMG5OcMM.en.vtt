guys<00:00:03.179> part<00:00:03.720> of<00:00:03.899> New<00:00:04.170> Albany<00:00:04.410> on<00:00:05.330> and<00:00:06.330> so<00:00:06.509> the

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
guys part of New Albany on and so the

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.660 
guys part of New Albany on and so the
city<00:00:06.990> name<00:00:07.200> actually<00:00:07.560> is<00:00:07.680> just<00:00:07.950> playing

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
city name actually is just playing

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.990 
city name actually is just playing
Abadan<00:00:09.120> but<00:00:09.420> since<00:00:09.719> we<00:00:09.900> are<00:00:10.759> rebuilding<00:00:11.759> the

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
Abadan but since we are rebuilding the

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.950 
Abadan but since we are rebuilding the
entire<00:00:12.090> city

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
entire city

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.450 
entire city
I<00:00:12.990> thought<00:00:13.469> it'd<00:00:13.590> be<00:00:13.620> good<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.889> distinguish<00:00:14.340> it

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
I thought it'd be good to distinguish it

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.090 
I thought it'd be good to distinguish it
a<00:00:14.490> little<00:00:14.639> bit<00:00:14.790> in<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.910> video<00:00:15.289> so<00:00:16.289> this<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.710> one

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
a little bit in the video so this is one

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.710 
a little bit in the video so this is one
of<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.250> first<00:00:17.400> bridges<00:00:17.940> that<00:00:18.150> was<00:00:18.390> ever<00:00:18.539> built

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
of the first bridges that was ever built

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.779 
of the first bridges that was ever built
on<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.050> server<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:20.070> links<00:00:20.369> new<00:00:20.550> shadow

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
on the server that links new shadow

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.490 
on the server that links new shadow
point<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.230> capital<00:00:22.740> city<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:23.010> Abaddon<00:00:23.490> and

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
point to the capital city of Abaddon and

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.720 
point to the capital city of Abaddon and
recently<00:00:25.500> we<00:00:25.740> did<00:00:25.890> widen<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.400> little<00:00:26.550> bit

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
recently we did widen it a little bit

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.849 
recently we did widen it a little bit
the<00:00:27.300> roads<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:27.869> they<00:00:28.140> fit<00:00:28.410> with<00:00:28.560> our<00:00:28.740> new

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
the roads so that they fit with our new

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.370 
the roads so that they fit with our new
three-wide<00:00:29.340> server<00:00:29.849> standard<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:31.050> fit<00:00:31.230> all

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
three-wide server standard to fit all

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.100 
three-wide server standard to fit all
the<00:00:31.529> trucks<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:31.949> stuff<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.130> we<00:00:32.369> have<00:00:33.110> and

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
the trucks and stuff that we have and

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.889 
the trucks and stuff that we have and
this<00:00:34.350> was<00:00:34.559> built<00:00:34.829> by<00:00:35.010> freek<00:00:35.399> 472<00:00:36.180> way<00:00:36.510> back<00:00:36.750> in

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
this was built by freek 472 way back in

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.770 
this was built by freek 472 way back in
the<00:00:37.020> day<00:00:37.489> and<00:00:38.489> then<00:00:40.460> updated<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:41.640> yeah<00:00:41.850> that's

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
the day and then updated so yeah that's

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.490 
the day and then updated so yeah that's
that<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.559> here<00:00:44.000> getting<00:00:45.000> off<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.480> bridge<00:00:45.750> here

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
that so here getting off the bridge here

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.380 
that so here getting off the bridge here
you<00:00:47.129> come<00:00:47.430> straight<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:47.910> heart<00:00:48.180> of

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
you come straight to the heart of

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.680 
you come straight to the heart of
Abaddon<00:00:48.840> which<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:50.100> as<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.820> said<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.149> capital

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
Abaddon which is as I said the capital

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.200 
Abaddon which is as I said the capital
and<00:00:51.930> with<00:00:52.800> our<00:00:53.100> new<00:00:53.309> project<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:53.850> we<00:00:54.030> have

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
and with our new project that we have

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.479 
and with our new project that we have
the<00:00:54.420> whole<00:00:54.570> reason<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:54.899> we<00:00:55.170> needed<00:00:55.590> what

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
the whole reason that we needed what

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.369 
the whole reason that we needed what
used<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.910> be<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> baton<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.629> make<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> new<00:00:58.020> one<00:00:58.230> is

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
used to be a baton and make a new one is

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.069 
used to be a baton and make a new one is
because<00:00:58.680> we<00:00:58.800> wanted<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.219> recreate<00:01:00.079> Washington

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
because we wanted to recreate Washington

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.500 
because we wanted to recreate Washington
DC<00:01:01.469> as<00:01:01.680> much<00:01:01.859> as<00:01:02.010> possible<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.300> turns

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
DC as much as possible and so it turns

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.270 
DC as much as possible and so it turns
out<00:01:03.660> we<00:01:03.840> can<00:01:03.960> only<00:01:04.080> fit<00:01:04.379> constitutional

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
out we can only fit constitutional

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.270 
out we can only fit constitutional
Avenue<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:06.810> few<00:01:07.020> other<00:01:07.170> little<00:01:07.560> bits<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.100> we

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
Avenue and a few other little bits so we

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.010 
Avenue and a few other little bits so we
can't<00:01:08.490> unfortunately<00:01:08.790> fit<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.360> whole<00:01:09.630> city

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
can't unfortunately fit the whole city

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.870 
can't unfortunately fit the whole city
but<00:01:10.350> we<00:01:10.920> are<00:01:11.040> trying<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.340> fit<00:01:11.490> as<00:01:11.580> much<00:01:11.700> as

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
but we are trying to fit as much as

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.730 
but we are trying to fit as much as
possible<00:01:12.680> and<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:14.220> if<00:01:14.340> we<00:01:14.490> come<00:01:14.729> around<00:01:15.479> here

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
possible and so if we come around here

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.800 
possible and so if we come around here
we<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.159> little<00:01:17.310> park<00:01:17.670> area<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.509> road

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
we have a little park area this road

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.770 
we have a little park area this road
goes<00:01:19.080> around<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:20.280> like<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.240> conference

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
goes around to like the conference

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.410 
goes around to like the conference
centre<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.080> believe<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.650> in<00:01:24.320> DC<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:26.420> these

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
centre I believe is in DC and these

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.630 
centre I believe is in DC and these
bridges<00:01:27.720> are<00:01:28.140> close<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:29.070> where<00:01:29.220> they<00:01:29.340> would<00:01:29.460> be

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
bridges are close to where they would be

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.060 
bridges are close to where they would be
in<00:01:29.729> real<00:01:29.909> life<00:01:30.119> obviously<00:01:30.570> they're<00:01:31.140> not<00:01:31.290> like

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
in real life obviously they're not like

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.520 
in real life obviously they're not like
these<00:01:33.030> types<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.659> bridges<00:01:34.079> they're<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.290> lot

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
these types of bridges they're a lot

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.550 
these types of bridges they're a lot
smaller<00:01:35.600> but<00:01:36.600> just<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.930> bridge<00:01:37.110> placement

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
smaller but just a bridge placement

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.530 
smaller but just a bridge placement
themselves<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.130> pretty<00:01:38.369> close<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.610> what<00:01:38.880> they

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
themselves is pretty close to what they

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:48.080 
themselves is pretty close to what they
are<00:01:39.720> in<00:01:40.880> DC<00:01:43.009> and<00:01:44.180> so<00:01:45.180> over<00:01:45.720> here<00:01:46.759> this<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:47.939> the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
are in DC and so over here this is the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.120 
are in DC and so over here this is the
second<00:01:48.450> bridge<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.810> goes<00:01:48.930> between<00:01:49.200> Avedon

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
second bridge that goes between Avedon

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.389 
second bridge that goes between Avedon
and<00:01:50.159> DC<00:01:50.689> there's<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.780> toad<00:01:52.079> or<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.560> baton<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.130> a

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
and DC there's a toad or a baton and a

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.530 
and DC there's a toad or a baton and a
new<00:01:53.549> shadow<00:01:53.790> point<00:01:54.060> there's<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.240> total<00:01:54.509> of

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
new shadow point there's a total of

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.109 
new shadow point there's a total of
three<00:01:54.770> so<00:01:55.770> let<00:01:55.920> me<00:01:56.040> go<00:01:56.219> this<00:01:56.549> for<00:01:56.729> real<00:01:56.850> quick

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
three so let me go this for real quick

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.600 
three so let me go this for real quick
in<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.509> previous<00:01:57.869> video<00:01:58.020> when<00:01:58.860> we<00:01:58.979> were<00:01:59.070> on<00:01:59.280> the

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
in a previous video when we were on the

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.510 
in a previous video when we were on the
your<00:02:00.090> shadow<00:02:00.299> point<00:02:00.570> tour<00:02:00.719> bus<00:02:00.960> route<00:02:01.520> you

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
your shadow point tour bus route you

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.179 
your shadow point tour bus route you
guys<00:02:02.700> saw<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.659> aquarium<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.799> coca-cola

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.900 
guys saw the aquarium and the coca-cola
factory<00:02:05.969> for<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.420> cola<00:02:06.689> factory<00:02:07.670> so<00:02:08.670> this<00:02:08.819> is

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
factory for the cola factory so this is

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.180 
factory for the cola factory so this is
that<00:02:09.060> same<00:02:09.300> exact<00:02:09.569> bridge<00:02:09.950> also<00:02:10.950> built<00:02:11.129> by

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
that same exact bridge also built by

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.890 
that same exact bridge also built by

this connects near shadow point to

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:23.850 
this connects near shadow point to
Abaddon<00:02:19.020> seahorse<00:02:22.320> when<00:02:23.320> it<00:02:23.410> comes<00:02:23.590> here

00:04:37.769 --> 00:04:37.779 
over this and this connects with new

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:40.439 
over this and this connects with new
shadow<00:04:38.050> point<00:04:38.409> really<00:04:38.860> close<00:04:39.279> to<00:04:39.639> Chinatown

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
shadow point really close to Chinatown

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.059 
shadow point really close to Chinatown
actually<00:04:40.870> Chinatown's<00:04:41.379> right<00:04:41.710> there

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:42.069 
actually Chinatown's right there

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:45.629 
actually Chinatown's right there
loading<00:04:42.460> in<00:04:42.699> the<00:04:42.819> distance<00:04:43.210> right<00:04:43.449> now<00:04:44.490> if<00:04:45.490> we

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
loading in the distance right now if we

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:47.700 
loading in the distance right now if we
go<00:04:45.789> underground<00:04:46.150> you<00:04:46.870> can<00:04:47.020> see<00:04:47.229> how<00:04:47.469> this

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
go underground you can see how this

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.429 
go underground you can see how this
bridge<00:04:48.069> links<00:04:49.029> up<00:04:49.210> with<00:04:49.240> this<00:04:49.719> island<00:04:50.139> so<00:04:50.409> you

00:04:50.429 --> 00:04:50.439 
bridge links up with this island so you

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:51.899 
bridge links up with this island so you
can<00:04:50.740> integral<00:04:51.039> you're<00:04:51.159> above<00:04:51.370> the<00:04:51.639> ground

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:51.909 
can integral you're above the ground

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:54.719 
can integral you're above the ground
route<00:04:52.150> or<00:04:52.930> you<00:04:53.289> can<00:04:53.499> go<00:04:53.710> the<00:04:54.219> underground

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
route or you can go the underground

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.409 
route or you can go the underground
route<00:04:55.860> in<00:04:56.860> which<00:04:57.069> case<00:04:57.370> you<00:04:57.759> would<00:04:57.969> come<00:04:58.210> out

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
route in which case you would come out

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:14.689 
route in which case you would come out
right<00:04:58.930> next<00:04:59.199> to<00:04:59.469> United<00:04:59.830> Nations<00:05:01.289> right<00:05:02.289> here

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:17.070 

yeah<00:05:15.699> so<00:05:15.879> that<00:05:16.089> if<00:05:16.330> that<00:05:16.539> loaded<00:05:16.839> that<00:05:16.960> would

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
yeah so that if that loaded that would

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.369 
yeah so that if that loaded that would
be<00:05:17.169> the<00:05:17.589> UN<00:05:17.889> building<00:05:18.839> and<00:05:19.839> over<00:05:20.020> here<00:05:20.169> we<00:05:20.289> have

00:05:20.369 --> 00:05:20.379 
be the UN building and over here we have

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:24.029 
be the UN building and over here we have
a<00:05:20.439> little<00:05:20.589> construction<00:05:21.219> site<00:05:21.520> and<00:05:22.919> I<00:05:23.919> don't

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
a little construction site and I don't

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:25.529 
a little construction site and I don't
really<00:05:24.249> know<00:05:24.460> what<00:05:24.699> the<00:05:24.819> purpose<00:05:25.029> of<00:05:25.240> this<00:05:25.360> is

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
really know what the purpose of this is

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:32.550 
really know what the purpose of this is
besides<00:05:26.050> just<00:05:26.229> looking<00:05:26.409> really<00:05:26.800> awesome<00:05:31.560> and

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
besides just looking really awesome and

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:42.260 
besides just looking really awesome and
some<00:05:33.000> fun<00:05:34.000> property

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.010 

so<00:05:43.110> I<00:05:43.139> guess<00:05:43.590> that<00:05:43.979> concludes<00:05:44.280> this<00:05:45.210> video<00:05:45.780> I

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
so I guess that concludes this video I

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.620 
so I guess that concludes this video I
