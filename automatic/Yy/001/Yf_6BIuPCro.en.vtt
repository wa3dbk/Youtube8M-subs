the<00:00:09.630> important<00:00:10.019> thing<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:10.320> that<00:00:10.530> you<00:00:11.190> have<00:00:11.219> a

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
the important thing is that you have a

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.930 
the important thing is that you have a
nice<00:00:11.519> brush<00:00:12.590> preferably<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.920> badger<00:00:14.219> brush<00:00:14.490> but

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
nice brush preferably a badger brush but

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.420 
nice brush preferably a badger brush but
some<00:00:15.179> guys<00:00:15.330> would<00:00:15.480> prefer<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:16.199> boar<00:00:16.920> hair<00:00:17.160> brush

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430

some guys would prefer a boar hair brush
they<00:00:17.670> come<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:18.000> three<00:00:18.210> varieties<00:00:18.859> badger<00:00:19.859> boar

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
they come in three varieties badger boar

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.920 
they come in three varieties badger boar
or<00:00:20.570> synthetic<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:22.039> the<00:00:23.210> badger<00:00:24.210> brushes<00:00:24.630> are

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
or synthetic and the badger brushes are

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.390 
or synthetic and the badger brushes are
generally<00:00:25.619> considered<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.070> little<00:00:26.250> better

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
generally considered a little better

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.730 
generally considered a little better
because<00:00:26.660> they<00:00:27.660> retain<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.170> moisture<00:00:28.320> better

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
because they retain the moisture better

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.460 
because they retain the moisture better
and<00:00:29.010> that's<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.400> key<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:30.179> great<00:00:30.810> lather<00:00:31.140> is

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
and that's the key to a great lather is

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.979 
and that's the key to a great lather is
keeping<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.949> moisture<00:00:32.099> in<00:00:32.399> your<00:00:32.550> brush<00:00:32.989> so

if<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.600> retains<00:01:06.930> heat<00:01:07.290> if<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.979> will<00:01:08.420> get<00:01:09.420> warm

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
if it retains heat if it will get warm

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.090 
if it retains heat if it will get warm
and<00:01:09.900> retain<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.350> heat<00:01:10.500> for<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.770> little<00:01:10.979> while

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
and retain the heat for a little while

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.580 
and retain the heat for a little while
that's<00:01:11.369> even<00:01:11.760> better<00:01:11.939> for<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> key<00:01:13.439> is

I soak my bowl in hot water fill it with
hot<00:01:15.900> water<00:01:15.950> soak<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.100> brush<00:01:17.310> inside<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.210> at

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
hot water soak the brush inside it at

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.450 
hot water soak the brush inside it at
the<00:01:18.450> same<00:01:18.630> time<00:01:18.740> for<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> good<00:01:19.950> two<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.130> three

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
the same time for a good two to three

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.620 
the same time for a good two to three
minutes<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.470> then<00:01:22.470> take<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.830> brush<00:01:23.040> out<00:01:23.630> give

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
minutes and then take the brush out give

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.810 
minutes and then take the brush out give
it<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> couple<00:01:24.960> shapes

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
it a couple shapes

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.819 
it a couple shapes
it'll<00:01:26.820> be<00:01:26.909> drippy<00:01:27.270> like<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.689> but<00:01:27.990> give<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.680> a

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
it'll be drippy like this but give it a

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.200 
it'll be drippy like this but give it a
couple<00:01:29.009> shakes<00:01:29.130> get<00:01:29.579> most<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.060> moisture

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
couple shakes get most of that moisture

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.010 
couple shakes get most of that moisture
out<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.689> it

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
out of it

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.770 
out of it
and<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:31.979> then<00:01:32.390> you<00:01:33.390> don't<00:01:33.540> have<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.900> be<00:01:35.780> limited

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
and so then you don't have to be limited

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.640 
and so then you don't have to be limited
tears<00:01:37.140> choices<00:01:37.860> as<00:01:38.009> far<00:01:38.310> as<00:01:39.170> just<00:01:40.170> using<00:01:40.560> a

down<00:02:44.700> is<00:02:44.880> good<00:02:45.120> because<00:02:45.300> it<00:02:45.600> gets<00:02:45.780> inside<00:02:46.170> the

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
down is good because it gets inside the

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.400 
down is good because it gets inside the
brush<00:02:46.610> and<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:48.270> can<00:02:48.300> put<00:02:48.630> a<00:02:48.660> dab<00:02:48.870> of<00:02:48.900> water<00:02:49.230> in

there<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:51.620> you'll<00:02:52.620> see<00:02:52.830> quickly<00:02:53.130> after<00:02:53.580> just

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
there and you'll see quickly after just

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.540 
there and you'll see quickly after just
a<00:02:54.120> few<00:02:54.150> seconds<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:55.560> starts<00:02:55.950> building<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.370> nice

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
a few seconds it starts building a nice

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.260 
a few seconds it starts building a nice
lather<00:02:57.740> so<00:02:58.740> the<00:02:58.890> key<00:02:59.070> is<00:02:59.190> just<00:02:59.490> back<00:02:59.790> and<00:02:59.970> forth

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270
