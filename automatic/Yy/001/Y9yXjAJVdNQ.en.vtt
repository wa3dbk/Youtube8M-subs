the<00:00:04.620> sony<00:00:04.890> ericsson<00:00:05.370> xperia<00:00:05.490> play<00:00:06.120> and<00:00:06.660> this

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
the sony ericsson xperia play and this

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.020 
the sony ericsson xperia play and this
is<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.049> unlocked<00:00:07.560> european<00:00:08.250> version<00:00:08.460> so<00:00:08.880> it

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
is the unlocked european version so it

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.970 
is the unlocked european version so it
may<00:00:09.269> be<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.510> little<00:00:09.750> bit<00:00:09.900> different<00:00:10.349> when<00:00:10.800> it

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
may be a little bit different when it

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.339 
may be a little bit different when it
comes<00:00:11.010> out<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.610> verizon<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:13.170> other

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
comes out to verizon and to other

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.560 
comes out to verizon and to other
carriers<00:00:13.679> in<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.160> near<00:00:14.340> future<00:00:14.370> so<00:00:15.269> let's<00:00:15.450> get

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
carriers in the near future so let's get

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:24.050 
carriers in the near future so let's get
started<00:00:21.740> so<00:00:22.740> some<00:00:22.980> preliminary<00:00:23.460> specs<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.970> the

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
started so some preliminary specs to the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.670 
started so some preliminary specs to the
xperia<00:00:24.510> play<00:00:24.660> as<00:00:24.779> it's<00:00:25.019> running<00:00:25.170> at<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.410> 1

xperia play as it's running at a 1
gigahertz<00:00:25.980> processing<00:00:26.730> speed<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.180> that's

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
gigahertz processing speed and that's

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.730 
gigahertz processing speed and that's

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.370 
using a qualcomm snapdragon MSM 8255
processor<00:00:32.489> we<00:00:32.640> also<00:00:32.790> have<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> 1<00:00:33.360> gigabyte<00:00:33.809> rom

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
processor we also have a 1 gigabyte rom

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.650 
processor we also have a 1 gigabyte rom
with<00:00:35.130> 400<00:00:35.670> megabytes<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.239> are<00:00:36.360> accessible

with 400 megabytes that are accessible
to<00:00:36.960> onboard<00:00:37.520> memory<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.940> applications<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
to onboard memory and applications the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.380 
to onboard memory and applications the
dimensions<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.010> play<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.460> 62<00:00:41.910> millimeters

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
dimensions of the play is 62 millimeters

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.260 
dimensions of the play is 62 millimeters
across<00:00:42.890> 119<00:00:43.890> millimetres<00:00:44.280> high<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.730> 16

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
across 119 millimetres high and 16

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.029 
across 119 millimetres high and 16
millimeters<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:45.960> depth<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.680> it's<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.890> pretty

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
millimeters in depth so it's a pretty

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.709 
millimeters in depth so it's a pretty
thick<00:00:47.399> device<00:00:47.730> but<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.149> feels<00:00:48.300> pretty<00:00:48.629> good

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
thick device but it feels pretty good

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.290 
thick device but it feels pretty good
while<00:00:48.989> playing<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.559> feels<00:00:50.160> exactly<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.910> same

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
while playing it feels exactly the same

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.350 
while playing it feels exactly the same
thickness<00:00:51.600> as<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.020> PSP<00:00:52.770> go<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.340> we'll<00:00:54.000> compare

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
thickness as the PSP go so we'll compare

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.930 
thickness as the PSP go so we'll compare
that<00:00:54.539> at<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.809> end<00:00:54.960> we<00:00:55.620> also<00:00:55.770> have<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.129> 4<00:00:56.610> inch

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
that at the end we also have a 4 inch

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.380 
that at the end we also have a 4 inch
LCD<00:00:58.280> plastic<00:00:59.280> capacitive<00:01:00.059> multi-touch

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
LCD plastic capacitive multi-touch

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.900 
LCD plastic capacitive multi-touch
screen<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.289> fwvga<00:01:02.190> resolution<00:01:02.789> so

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
screen and this is fwvga resolution so

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.160 
screen and this is fwvga resolution so
that's<00:01:03.090> 480<00:01:03.600> across<00:01:04.019> x<00:01:04.619> 854<00:01:05.339> pixels<00:01:06.150> down<00:01:06.390> so

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
that's 480 across x 854 pixels down so

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.870 
that's 480 across x 854 pixels down so
it<00:01:07.380> seems<00:01:07.590> kind<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.830> odd<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.189> sony<00:01:08.430> ericsson

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
it seems kind of odd that sony ericsson

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.450 
it seems kind of odd that sony ericsson
would<00:01:09.030> choose<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.600> use<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.930> plastic<00:01:10.260> coating<00:01:11.220> on

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
would choose to use a plastic coating on

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.520 
would choose to use a plastic coating on
a<00:01:11.490> high-end<00:01:12.150> android<00:01:12.540> device<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:13.380> is

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
a high-end android device this is

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.320 
a high-end android device this is
running<00:01:13.799> android<00:01:14.100> 2.3<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.970> just<00:01:15.150> seems

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
running android 2.3 and it just seems

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.690 
running android 2.3 and it just seems
weird<00:01:15.600> because<00:01:15.900> most<00:01:16.650> high-end<00:01:16.950> androids<00:01:17.549> are

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
weird because most high-end androids are

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.820 
weird because most high-end androids are
not<00:01:17.820> using<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.240> plastic<00:01:18.540> screen<00:01:19.259> because

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
not using a plastic screen because

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.950 
not using a plastic screen because
plastic<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.369> really<00:01:20.580> prone<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.150> scratches<00:01:21.420> and

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
plastic is really prone to scratches and

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.260 
plastic is really prone to scratches and
it<00:01:22.770> doesn't<00:01:23.040> seem<00:01:23.220> as<00:01:23.400> precise<00:01:23.880> when<00:01:24.150> i've

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
it doesn't seem as precise when i've

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.600 
it doesn't seem as precise when i've
been<00:01:24.450> typing<00:01:24.840> on<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.140> screen<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.369> top

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
been typing on the screen so on the top

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.060 
been typing on the screen so on the top
