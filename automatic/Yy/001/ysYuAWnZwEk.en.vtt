future of surgeries on out of health
I've<00:00:13.660> been<00:00:13.990> a<00:00:14.080> surgeon<00:00:14.349> for<00:00:14.830> almost<00:00:15.249> 25<00:00:15.820> years

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:15.849 
I've been a surgeon for almost 25 years

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.080 
I've been a surgeon for almost 25 years
and<00:00:16.570> I<00:00:16.990> have<00:00:17.140> witnessed<00:00:17.650> through<00:00:18.310> our<00:00:18.490> DC<00:00:18.730> is

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.090 
and I have witnessed through our DC is

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.269 
and I have witnessed through our DC is
tremendous<00:00:19.630> change<00:00:20.050> and<00:00:20.380> almost<00:00:21.099> of

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:21.279 
tremendous change and almost of

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.760 
tremendous change and almost of
evolution<00:00:21.880> in<00:00:22.029> surgical<00:00:22.539> care<00:00:22.810> I've<00:00:23.140> always

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:23.770 
evolution in surgical care I've always

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.380 
evolution in surgical care I've always
makes<00:00:24.310> the<00:00:24.489> points<00:00:24.910> to<00:00:25.000> my<00:00:25.150> younger

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
makes the points to my younger

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.839 
makes the points to my younger
colleagues<00:00:26.079> that<00:00:26.470> much<00:00:26.770> of<00:00:27.009> the<00:00:27.039> surgery<00:00:27.730> that

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:27.849 
colleagues that much of the surgery that

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.639 
colleagues that much of the surgery that
we<00:00:28.180> do<00:00:28.300> these<00:00:28.570> days<00:00:28.810> and<00:00:29.199> much<00:00:29.349> of<00:00:29.379> the

00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:29.649 
we do these days and much of the

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:32.339 
we do these days and much of the
equipment<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.910> we<00:00:31.149> use<00:00:31.180> in<00:00:31.689> the<00:00:31.840> operating

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
equipment that we use in the operating

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.250 
equipment that we use in the operating
room<00:00:32.500> did<00:00:32.829> not<00:00:32.980> exist<00:00:33.489> throughout<00:00:34.030> these<00:00:34.510> 25

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
room did not exist throughout these 25

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.830 
room did not exist throughout these 25
years<00:00:35.649> of<00:00:35.800> my<00:00:35.980> factors<00:00:36.579> I<00:00:36.820> think<00:00:37.329> this<00:00:37.660> is<00:00:37.809> a

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
years of my factors I think this is a

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.750 
years of my factors I think this is a
very<00:00:37.930> special<00:00:38.260> situation<00:00:39.160> that<00:00:39.430> does<00:00:39.610> not

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
very special situation that does not

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.540 
very special situation that does not
exist<00:00:39.940> in<00:00:40.450> any<00:00:40.899> other<00:00:41.200> discipline<00:00:41.890> or<00:00:42.129> in<00:00:42.340> any

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
exist in any other discipline or in any

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.450 
exist in any other discipline or in any
other<00:00:42.670> industry<00:00:43.180> the<00:00:44.079> big<00:00:44.260> story<00:00:44.410> however<00:00:44.890> is

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
other industry the big story however is

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.690 
other industry the big story however is
that<00:00:46.210> we<00:00:47.050> just<00:00:47.290> witnessed<00:00:47.500> the<00:00:47.950> smaller<00:00:48.310> of

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:48.700 
that we just witnessed the smaller of

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.210 
that we just witnessed the smaller of
these<00:00:49.329> revolutions<00:00:50.140> I<00:00:50.290> think<00:00:50.680> we<00:00:50.800> are<00:00:50.950> on<00:00:51.100> the

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
these revolutions I think we are on the

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.520 
these revolutions I think we are on the
threshold<00:00:51.250> of<00:00:51.850> a<00:00:52.180> major<00:00:52.450> revolution<00:00:53.140> in

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
threshold of a major revolution in

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.300 
threshold of a major revolution in
surgical<00:00:54.489> care<00:00:54.810> this<00:00:55.810> revolution<00:00:56.530> is<00:00:56.770> brought

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.310 
surgical care this revolution is brought

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.110 
surgical care this revolution is brought
on<00:00:57.340> by<00:00:58.270> the<00:00:59.140> tremendous<00:00:59.770> advances<00:01:00.700> that<00:01:00.910> we

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
on by the tremendous advances that we

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.590 
on by the tremendous advances that we
have<00:01:01.390> in<00:01:01.660> information<00:01:02.410> technology

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
have in information technology

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.480

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
the Middle East is the tool birthplace

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.719 
the Middle East is the tool birthplace
of<00:01:31.179> modern<00:01:31.450> surgery<00:01:32.259> with<00:01:32.679> many<00:01:32.979> of<00:01:33.279> the

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
of modern surgery with many of the

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.660 
of modern surgery with many of the
principles<00:01:34.149> of<00:01:34.630> surgical<00:01:35.139> care<00:01:35.439> was<00:01:36.429> laid<00:01:36.639> out

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
principles of surgical care was laid out

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.699 
principles of surgical care was laid out
by<00:01:37.119> AB<00:01:37.389> physicians<00:01:38.200> I<00:01:38.499> think<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:40.600> x<00:01:40.810> is<00:01:41.229> a

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:41.709 
by AB physicians I think the x is a

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:44.399 
by AB physicians I think the x is a
special<00:01:42.249> place<00:01:42.579> to<00:01:42.939> celebrate<00:01:43.179> that<00:01:43.899> history

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
special place to celebrate that history

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.569 
special place to celebrate that history
and<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:46.479> understand<00:01:47.049> the<00:01:47.409> changes<00:01:47.950> that<00:01:48.189> we

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
and to understand the changes that we

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.999 
and to understand the changes that we
are<00:01:48.789> going<00:01:49.270> through<00:01:49.569> and<00:01:49.899> to<00:01:50.439> be<00:01:50.590> kin<00:01:50.859> to<00:01:50.889> the
