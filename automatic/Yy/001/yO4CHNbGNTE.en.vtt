00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
doing a leak test I just drilled this

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.860 
doing a leak test I just drilled this
tank<00:00:06.990> and<00:00:08.300> installed<00:00:09.300> this<00:00:09.480> overflow<00:00:09.840> box<00:00:10.260> so

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870

about 12 hours ago it might need a
little<00:00:35.399> bit<00:00:35.489> more<00:00:35.610> time<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.000> cure<00:00:36.300> but<00:00:36.570> we'll

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
little bit more time to cure but we'll

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.470 
little bit more time to cure but we'll

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
I don't see any leaks yet so 65 gallon

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.930 
I don't see any leaks yet so 65 gallon
tank<00:00:57.559> had<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.590> hang<00:00:58.859> on<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.160> back<00:00:59.280> overflow

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
tank had a hang on the back overflow

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.619 
tank had a hang on the back overflow
before<00:01:00.329> but<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:01.370> wanted<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.460> go<00:01:02.609> internal<00:01:03.329> so

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
before but I wanted to go internal so

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.300 
before but I wanted to go internal so
that<00:01:03.809> way<00:01:06.110> if<00:01:07.110> anything<00:01:07.320> ever<00:01:07.590> happened<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.280> a

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
that way if anything ever happened and a

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.780 
that way if anything ever happened and a
loss<00:01:08.490> siphon<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.299> wouldn't<00:01:10.700> well<00:01:11.700> it

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
loss siphon that wouldn't well it

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.340 
loss siphon that wouldn't well it
wouldn't<00:01:12.090> lose<00:01:12.479> siphon<00:01:12.960> because<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.260> just

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
wouldn't lose siphon because it just

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.929 
wouldn't lose siphon because it just
pumped<00:01:13.680> back<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:14.010> here<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.310> overflow<00:01:14.760> back

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
pumped back in here and overflow back

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.070 
pumped back in here and overflow back
over<00:01:16.670> these<00:01:17.670> are<00:01:17.850> schedule<00:01:18.240> 80<00:01:18.450> bulkheads

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
over these are schedule 80 bulkheads

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.200 
over these are schedule 80 bulkheads
they<00:01:19.650> have<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> really<00:01:20.040> thick<00:01:20.400> asking<00:01:20.939> on<00:01:21.060> them

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
they have a really thick asking on them

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.660 
they have a really thick asking on them
I<00:01:21.710> got<00:01:22.710> them<00:01:22.920> instead<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.430> traditional

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
I got them instead of the traditional

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
heard that they leak over time so these

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:36.570 
heard that they leak over time so these
are<00:01:28.890> real<00:01:29.070> strong

everywhere<00:01:51.640> still<00:01:52.640> leak-free<00:01:53.060> when<00:01:53.900> was

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
everywhere still leak-free when was

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.990 
everywhere still leak-free when was
accidentally<00:01:54.710> Oh<00:01:54.740> piece<00:01:55.010> of<00:01:55.040> drop<00:01:55.550> of<00:01:55.700> water<00:01:55.820> I

accidentally Oh piece of drop of water I

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.500 
accidentally Oh piece of drop of water I
dropped<00:01:56.630> in<00:01:56.840> there<00:01:57.700> solely<00:01:58.700> free<00:01:58.970> so<00:01:59.210> far

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
dropped in there solely free so far

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:10.480 
dropped in there solely free so far
though<00:02:08.560> mainly<00:02:09.560> doing<00:02:09.740> this<00:02:09.920> test<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.369> make

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
though mainly doing this test to make

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.470 
though mainly doing this test to make
sure<00:02:10.700> that<00:02:10.910> my<00:02:11.090> drilling<00:02:11.660> doesn't<00:02:13.240> cause<00:02:14.240> the

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
sure that my drilling doesn't cause the

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.890 
sure that my drilling doesn't cause the
tank<00:02:14.750> to<00:02:14.930> crack<00:02:15.260> or<00:02:15.500> anything

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
tank to crack or anything

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.090 
tank to crack or anything
sounds<00:02:17.900> a<00:02:17.930> little<00:02:18.050> paranoid<00:02:18.500> about<00:02:18.800> drilling

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
sounds a little paranoid about drilling

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:45.690 
sounds a little paranoid about drilling
