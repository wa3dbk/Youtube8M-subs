over<00:02:23.630> what<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.810> situation<00:02:24.020> is<00:02:24.349> and<00:02:24.560> isn't<00:02:24.680> I

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
over what the situation is and isn't I

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.610 
over what the situation is and isn't I
don't<00:02:25.160> think<00:02:25.340> that's<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.730> mean<00:02:26.599> I'm<00:02:26.780> just<00:02:26.810> being

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
don't think that's I mean I'm just being

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.590 
don't think that's I mean I'm just being
honest<00:02:27.980> about<00:02:28.069> how<00:02:28.370> women<00:02:28.550> feel<00:02:29.120> because<00:02:29.420> you

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
honest about how women feel because you

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.350 
honest about how women feel because you
know<00:02:29.720> we<00:02:30.080> like<00:02:30.610> control<00:02:31.610> I<00:02:31.730> mean<00:02:31.880> that's<00:02:32.000> you

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
know we like control I mean that's you

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.120 
know we like control I mean that's you
know<00:02:32.480> boy<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:33.050> is<00:02:33.140> but<00:02:33.380> at<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.530> same<00:02:33.650> time<00:02:33.890> I

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
know boy it is but at the same time I

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.380

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
think that you know men title things

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.360 
think that you know men title things
just<00:02:38.569> as<00:02:38.690> much<00:02:38.810> as<00:02:38.959> women<00:02:39.110> do<00:02:39.380> maybe<00:02:40.010> I'm<00:02:40.190> wrong

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
just as much as women do maybe I'm wrong

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.070 
just as much as women do maybe I'm wrong
and<00:02:40.430> if<00:02:40.700> i<00:02:40.819> am<00:02:40.940> wrong<00:02:41.120> please<00:02:41.180> leave<00:02:41.810> a<00:02:41.870> comment

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.690 
and if i am wrong please leave a comment
tell<00:02:42.380> me<00:02:42.470> how<00:02:42.560> wrong<00:02:42.739> I<00:02:42.920> am<00:02:42.950> which<00:02:43.220> I<00:02:43.459> don't

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
tell me how wrong I am which I don't

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.610

think<00:02:43.880> I<00:02:43.940> am<00:02:44.060> but<00:02:44.209> whatever<00:02:44.569> but<00:02:45.260> seriously

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
think I am but whatever but seriously

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.710 
think I am but whatever but seriously
though<00:02:45.769> I<00:02:45.800> think<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.340> reason<00:02:46.489> why<00:02:46.790> women<00:02:47.239> need

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
though I think the reason why women need

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.240 
though I think the reason why women need
titles<00:02:48.200> is<00:02:48.380> because<00:02:49.239> if<00:02:50.239> the<00:02:50.660> you<00:02:51.080> know<00:02:51.250> ish

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
titles is because if the you know ish

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.630 
titles is because if the you know ish
hits<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:52.790> fan<00:02:52.970> then<00:02:53.840> we<00:02:54.049> can<00:02:54.230> say<00:02:54.560> you<00:02:55.489> know

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
hits the fan then we can say you know

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.229 
hits the fan then we can say you know
whether<00:02:56.390> or<00:02:56.510> not<00:02:56.720> we<00:02:56.989> were<00:02:57.110> really<00:02:58.239> invested

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
whether or not we were really invested

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.180 
whether or not we were really invested
all<00:02:59.360> the<00:02:59.510> way<00:02:59.630> anyway<00:02:59.930> see<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.380> okay<00:03:00.890> little

keep going back to that one guy over

keep going back to that one guy over
over

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
over

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.219 
over
basically<00:04:17.620> treats<00:04:17.829> of<00:04:17.979> my<00:04:18.069> crap<00:04:18.400> and<00:04:18.989> I'm<00:04:19.989> not

basically treats of my crap and I'm not
really<00:04:20.379> sure<00:04:20.500> if<00:04:20.680> I<00:04:21.189> answered<00:04:21.609> the<00:04:22.060> question

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:22.569 
really sure if I answered the question

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:23.610 
really sure if I answered the question
because<00:04:22.810> he<00:04:22.930> really<00:04:23.139> want<00:04:23.289> me<00:04:23.379> to<00:04:23.469> make<00:04:23.590> a

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
because he really want me to make a

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.129 
because he really want me to make a
video<00:04:23.830> about<00:04:24.099> it<00:04:24.370> so<00:04:25.120> this<00:04:25.479> is<00:04:25.629> my<00:04:25.750> thing<00:04:25.810> the

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
video about it so this is my thing the

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:27.809 
video about it so this is my thing the
reason<00:04:26.379> why<00:04:26.500> I<00:04:26.530> think<00:04:26.830> some<00:04:27.099> women<00:04:27.219> keep<00:04:27.610> going

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:27.819 
reason why I think some women keep going

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:29.670 
reason why I think some women keep going
back<00:04:27.909> to<00:04:27.969> that<00:04:28.090> one<00:04:28.599> guy<00:04:28.900> over<00:04:29.169> and<00:04:29.409> over<00:04:29.530> again

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
back to that one guy over and over again

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.339 
back to that one guy over and over again
the<00:04:29.889> chasing<00:04:30.250> like<00:04:30.400> crap<00:04:30.879> it<00:04:31.629> is<00:04:31.810> because<00:04:31.960> of<00:04:32.110> a

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:32.349 
the chasing like crap it is because of a

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:33.959 
the chasing like crap it is because of a
few<00:04:32.500> things<00:04:32.560> obviously<00:04:33.069> there<00:04:33.759> are<00:04:33.789> some

00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:33.969 
few things obviously there are some

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:35.490 
few things obviously there are some
self-esteem<00:04:34.270> issues<00:04:34.659> going<00:04:34.840> on<00:04:34.990> so<00:04:35.199> we<00:04:35.289> want

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
self-esteem issues going on so we want

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.589 
self-esteem issues going on so we want
to<00:04:35.530> talk<00:04:35.740> about<00:04:35.800> that<00:04:36.069> but<00:04:36.909> more<00:04:37.180> so<00:04:37.449> I<00:04:37.479> think

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:37.599 
to talk about that but more so I think

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:40.619 
to talk about that but more so I think
it's<00:04:38.050> because<00:04:38.229> of<00:04:38.669> not<00:04:39.669> attachment<00:04:40.509> issues

00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:40.629 
it's because of not attachment issues

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:43.350 
it's because of not attachment issues
but<00:04:41.400> detachment<00:04:42.400> issues<00:04:42.520> you<00:04:42.939> know<00:04:43.060> some

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
but detachment issues you know some

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.179 
but detachment issues you know some
females<00:04:43.719> just<00:04:43.990> can't<00:04:44.289> let<00:04:44.500> go<00:04:44.560> because<00:04:44.949> it

00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:45.189 
females just can't let go because it

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:47.339 
females just can't let go because it
just<00:04:45.280> so<00:04:45.490> afraid<00:04:45.610> of<00:04:45.969> being<00:04:46.569> by<00:04:46.900> themselves

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:47.349 
just so afraid of being by themselves

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:49.320 
just so afraid of being by themselves
and<00:04:47.919> figuring<00:04:48.370> out<00:04:48.370> what<00:04:48.610> they<00:04:48.729> really<00:04:48.759> truly

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
and figuring out what they really truly

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.610 
and figuring out what they really truly
want<00:04:49.659> so<00:04:49.870> they<00:04:49.960> go<00:04:50.110> back<00:04:50.289> to<00:04:50.319> what's

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
want so they go back to what's

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.339 
also an element of control because we
