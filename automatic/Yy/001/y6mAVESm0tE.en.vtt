release<00:02:07.820> off<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.149> glider<00:02:08.390> and<00:02:08.540> can<00:02:08.840> get

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
release off the glider and can get

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.389 
release off the glider and can get
tangled<00:02:09.229> up<00:02:09.470> so<00:02:09.679> you<00:02:09.800> need<00:02:09.920> a<00:02:09.950> little<00:02:10.190> bit<00:02:10.310> of

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
tangled up so you need a little bit of

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.150 
tangled up so you need a little bit of
drag<00:02:10.640> on<00:02:10.820> there<00:02:11.000> and<00:02:11.180> I<00:02:12.050> generally<00:02:12.470> just<00:02:12.500> nose

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
drag on there and I generally just nose

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.390 
drag on there and I generally just nose
it<00:02:13.370> down<00:02:13.550> a<00:02:13.580> bit<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:13.880> then<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:14.720> then<00:02:15.370> pull<00:02:16.370> up

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
it down a bit and then and then pull up

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.910 
it down a bit and then and then pull up
and<00:02:16.850> it<00:02:16.940> releases<00:02:17.630> and<00:02:17.959> gives<00:02:18.170> that<00:02:18.440> extra<00:02:18.590> bit

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
and it releases and gives that extra bit

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.320 
and it releases and gives that extra bit
of<00:02:19.040> speed<00:02:19.400> at<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.730> very<00:02:19.910> top<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.180> little<00:02:20.360> race
