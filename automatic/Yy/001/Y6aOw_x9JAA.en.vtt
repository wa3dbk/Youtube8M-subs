collectors go mine you have to really

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.189 
collectors go mine you have to really

on<00:05:06.810> the<00:05:07.169> goal<00:05:07.349> my<00:05:07.560> elixir<00:05:08.400> collector<00:05:08.699> just

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599 
on the goal my elixir collector just

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:11.990 
on the goal my elixir collector just
take<00:05:09.870> note<00:05:10.380> of<00:05:10.409> that<00:05:10.770> and<00:05:10.979> I'll<00:05:11.580> spread<00:05:11.849> up

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
take note of that and I'll spread up

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.550 
take note of that and I'll spread up
your<00:05:12.270> elixir<00:05:12.510> collector<00:05:12.780> and<00:05:13.199> gold<00:05:13.380> mine

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.860 
your elixir collector and gold mine
right<00:05:14.120> so<00:05:15.120> basically<00:05:15.419> that's<00:05:15.479> it<00:05:15.630> for<00:05:15.780> this

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
right so basically that's it for this
