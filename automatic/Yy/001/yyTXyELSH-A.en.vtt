00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 heike militarists and subscribers 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.130
 youtube shows the king's explanation 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.340
 that humor is called a song already 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.510
 old but pretty, that's what we're going to 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.190
 start quickly when the tutorial 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.680
 well I'm going to play the intro of this 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:22.869
 song and then explain them and they 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.869
 put the stays of our says well 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.180
 well I leave the covers and above the 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.340
 tapas in the name of the chords that we're going 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.040
 to use are rare media but the ones 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.170
 I leave the figures this is like in my case 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.470
 what we are not going to use this finger and 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.270
 nothing is going to touch fifth part that 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:55.410
 remember if you want to make the axis for all 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.030
 the song fifth fifth route and 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.010
 quarter 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.830
 it's in him I passed it to this one as 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.700
 I was being held minor only 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.070
 how simple and with this one of oki the same 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.490
 this fast space had minor with 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.490
 seventh 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.620
 same pressure and we are going to make a short 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.409
 with these two fingers so that they are 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.810
 make it easy to repeat 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.810
 slow to i 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.860
 bow tie 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.920
 we return the same 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:48.380
 my sun 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:53.740
 but now yes 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.740
 and this is from the intro to the verse 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:03.430
 and where they listen to hear the 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.310
 song so they come for not doing it 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.970
 and then we go to a part that is like 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.970
 the pre chorus 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.840
 we do the following bearing more had 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.610
 minor major 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.610
 that everything is fine 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.590
 if it is very simple 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.610
 plus 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.810
 yes 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:51.900
 and we're going to make the choir chords that 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:57.739
 they are very simple maybe they can 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.739
 difficult exist gonzÃ¡lez 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.849
 one 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.849
 is 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.940
 if you are 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.670
 instead of being 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.890
 and here we go 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.709
 Y 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.629
 or it is already and we will fit itself 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.740
 the 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.010
 the 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:17.239
 equipment to have 102 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.800
 the world 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:32.530
 I do not remember 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.530
 fourth need 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.620
 how do you want to praise that if it ends 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:44.759
 yes 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.180
 It can be liter 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.940
 but the whole song they ate is very 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.390
 simple I hope you liked it if you 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.900
