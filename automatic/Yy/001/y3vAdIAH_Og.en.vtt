00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:19.039
 that for me was the week that was 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.600

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:24.940

 subscribers here reach you to see 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.080

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.820
 subscribe I have a dynamic that I have 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.500
 mentioned to the other videos that I'm going to 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.210
 give away a discography and you can 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.410
 choose the artist 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.530
 now the winner is coldplay 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:46.550
 followed by screen ex and a guy who asked 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.710
 give the d amics and good because I liked 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.590
 be was you just have to 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.590
 start it and for example here you can see 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.929
 some words that I have because I have 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.379
 these are these to make you a test 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:04.119
 of everything you can do and good is 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.409
 now it 's free if you want 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.600
 download it here at the bottom 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.250
 are the download links as always 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.490
 and in all the videos I recommend you see 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:16.090
 others and what we stand for 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.800
 It works once you open it and you get out and 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.310
 you can go anywhere 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.220
 and look let's say here we have a word 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:29.900
 in English skinny skin as you know is 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:34.100
 say thin weakling but if we go 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:36.170
 to select and we press copy 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.860
 will give us the translation in the part 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.860
 from up here davis corner and skinny it 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.640
 taught thin, so when you're 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:50.170
 practicing in English or suddenly you're 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.170
 let's give you this practical example 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.549
 these 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.130
 reading the lyrics a song and you understand 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.600
 most of the lyrics but for 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.600
 example let's put 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.830
 that you do not know this word 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.690
 let's say I do not know about this and I'm going to 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.400
 put copy and automatically into the 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.110
 top part will appear to me its 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:21.720
 let's say let's say that this one 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.240
 we are going to give copy and automatically we 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.460
 will appear the translation this in that 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.370
 will help us normally when you're 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.920
 reading a song so it will continue 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.860
 you grab the words the copies the paste 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.900
 and then you lose l you lose the 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.580
 inspiration so you're just going to be 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.150
 reading I do not understand a word 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:46.370
 I have open the application I'm going to 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.370
 select I'm going to press copy 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:55.360
 as you see this serves for everything for everything 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.360
 as long as you can put it 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.880
 the values to translate the memory is 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.860

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.550
