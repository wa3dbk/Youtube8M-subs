is what her hair prep will be under her

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.530 
is what her hair prep will be under her
wig<00:00:07.010> and<00:00:08.010> I<00:00:08.160> do<00:00:08.220> it<00:00:08.429> in<00:00:08.460> a<00:00:08.550> specific<00:00:08.730> way<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.240> lot

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
wig and I do it in a specific way a lot

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.970 
wig and I do it in a specific way a lot
of<00:00:09.630> times<00:00:09.809> depending<00:00:10.170> on<00:00:10.290> what<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.469> period<00:00:10.860> is

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
of times depending on what the period is

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:11.990 
of times depending on what the period is
but<00:00:11.190> this<00:00:11.340> can<00:00:11.490> be<00:00:11.580> evenly<00:00:11.880> distributed

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
but this can be evenly distributed

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.289 
but this can be evenly distributed
pretty<00:00:12.750> much<00:00:12.929> because<00:00:13.820> yeah<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:14.849> guess<00:00:15.120> with

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
pretty much because yeah I guess with

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.400 
pretty much because yeah I guess with
pink<00:00:15.509> rolls<00:00:15.719> -<00:00:15.960> we<00:00:16.080> like<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.320> have<00:00:18.410> everybody

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
pink rolls - we like to have everybody

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.140 
pink rolls - we like to have everybody
do<00:00:19.590> them<00:00:19.770> on<00:00:20.039> their<00:00:20.310> own<00:00:20.340> because<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:20.910> helps

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
do them on their own because it helps

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.730 
do them on their own because it helps
with<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.510> pre-show<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.439> lot<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.369> times<00:00:24.529> it's<00:00:25.529> kind

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
with a pre-show a lot of times it's kind

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.500 
with a pre-show a lot of times it's kind
of<00:00:25.800> its<00:00:26.250> kind<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.460> awkward<00:00:26.640> sometimes<00:00:27.090> but<00:00:27.449> I

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
of its kind of awkward sometimes but I

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.849 
of its kind of awkward sometimes but I
think<00:00:27.539> every<00:00:27.930> performer<00:00:28.410> should<00:00:28.590> be<00:00:28.680> able<00:00:28.769> to

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
think every performer should be able to

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.630 
think every performer should be able to
do<00:00:29.070> their<00:00:29.250> own<00:00:29.279> pin<00:00:29.580> curls<00:00:29.910> it's<00:00:30.060> sort<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.330> my
