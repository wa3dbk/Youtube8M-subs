00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.040
 Good Morning 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.500
 I'll show you today. 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.200
 makeup that I do almost every 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.059
 Days here for my English school and 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.769
 when I got here in Canada and 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.960
 a long time can not script 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.609
 organize my time that I walked 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.430
 she pretended crazy on the street with her hair 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.760
 all up with the face that way alone 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.890
 q worse way and when finally 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.019
 I can make another little face 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.960
 I started smoking more then every day 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.520
 does a basic mega makeup but that 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.070
 It shocked me better and I'm going today. 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.050
 show you how this makeup 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.480
 The first thing I do is use the 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:45.059
 moisturizer and then take care of the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.550
 my side and smoked makeup and I 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.039
 I start my skin like baby with him 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.989
 The cast that I have used is this one here. 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.440
 I was shopping and he 's my friend. 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.219
 favorite is Tite and he speaks with 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.510
 the cni 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.430
 so it helped so much in the oiliness 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.430
 how is control here? 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.960
 usually when this is important 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:18.250
 How light it is but like to spend two 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:20.200
 layers of four thin layers 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.740
 cheesecake on the cheek and now it's okay 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.340
 better but I like to focus more on the 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.340
 cheeks 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.520
 and thus provides a very light coverage as well 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.330
 natural but enough for me on 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.550
 on the day 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.230
 now from the collective I have used two eu 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.960
 I love to define my I think he 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.900
 moisturizes the eyes region well here is a 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.270
 gift to counteract the money is not 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.040
 much lighter 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.250
 I make a triangle here it's head 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.250
 down 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:04.050
 It was beautiful so the image with the brush 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:04.050
 greater than 80's cigna and I'll spread it 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:12.760
 I try and give it a beat and then we 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:17.440
 does not spread so much the effect gets better 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.770
 pretty school that the same school that 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.770
 is better 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:30.470
 on camera I kiss in the mouth but live 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.510
 I do not know if the computer will stay this way. 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.580
 very strange in the chamber, my god, come on 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.800
 a corrective now adopted on my skin 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.020
 August highlights of the glue stick in the 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.460
 true, I like several but this one 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.760
 It's one of the ones I like I've used 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.760
 now 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.820
 Then I use a brush and little bug 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.910
 tapping also spreading the 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.910
 product 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.239
 I'll come with only me then I like this 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.489
 here because it is a fixed stadium and 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.349
 wins a dust-based combat 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:08.099
 so he has more coverage then I 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:11.459
 I come with a brush approaching this is a 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:13.680
 real video is in the morning myself then 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.940
 elaborate bathing people, sorry to 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.829
 water zone brings that's it I come with 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:26.280
 a swab I think this is important 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:28.530
 cute flash box and only I come alone 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.959
 cleaning here some day I filled out 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.319
 eyebrow 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:38.450
 Now people are different 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:41.730
 Let's be honest and there the middle with blush 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:46.040
 Blush mascara is how I'm smart goes 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:50.569
 put two together for me is the most 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:53.190
 beat because it has a year and 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.840
 eight months I have it he's 1 year old and 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.120
 8 months I'm knee 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.340
 a few days of gold eyeliner and some 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.950
 days I wear the mask that the brand ends 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.299
 messing helmes nursery every time i 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.130
 I'd rather make a line with the eyeliner 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.169
 because it 's the mask that you pick up 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.450
 will not go to see who just know I 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:11.609
 I have a problem in my boring environment. 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.200
 eyelid is oily and here Canada does not know 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:17.160
 Why is she so much more hateful then? 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.739
 I have used these two products 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.780
 this here emotion before oiliness in the 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.090
 mary kay's skin that I wear on the eyelid 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.310
 and I have to use the car it's good that 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.510
 Do not come back to the shade. I'm a cousin. 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.910
 bond with the powder 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.720
 so I do jeopardize my voice 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.340
 cold 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:39.449
 and I'll pass on 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.870
 a little craymer come to fix 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:47.280
 Nothing at all because I will not wear shade 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:51.690
 help in eyeliner and helps to reduce 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.940
 does not solve 100% depends on the 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.440
 day also depends on the unit on the outside 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.050
 depends on the heat 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.940
 I think as I walk here I get a 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.410
 shop in the street 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.530
 This ends up influencing my coach. 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.320
 said dawn more than car did not ride in the 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.080
 street then boots 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.900
 which is very valuable I arrive with the 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.360
 pozinho even because I have it from him 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.150
 I use my feeling today I use brown 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.970
 usually brown school pro game 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.640
 I think I feel more comfortable with it. 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.530
 and I spoke only one line even to the 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.390
 eyelashes do not match with a fiat one is 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.740
 how is it going to be today sometimes the end 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.810
 It's not very cute, I was a 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.460
 little kitten we make a kitten 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.110
 traditional but I'll try to do it alone 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.110
 a line even good to see if it rolls 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.900
 I pulled a micrometer kitty here from the side 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.980
 the secret of a good 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.590
 ijf eyeliner 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:52.570
 I always take away the excess of 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.570
 so new paper in towel 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:06:07.940
 I come with my dear corvette and mask 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:11.030
 eyelash volume in the pro- traditional 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:15.290
 only mine is in black brave color that 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:17.570
 It's very dark evil, I love you colossal in the 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.040
 It's over, it's colossal. 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.510
 I can not wear a mask for more than 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.110
 six months because my children start to 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.360
 fall 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.800
 So it's colossal, it's already been six months and then 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.480
 the children begin to fall 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.400
 so I had to buy another mask 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.530
 worldwide volume spoke well of you 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.530
 from here and how was the promotion I ended up 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:35.750
 buying and is still new I think it's the 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:39.830
 third time I'm going to use then today 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:43.210
 the hair I do not have so a super 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:45.740
 Something to say, but I already liked it. 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:48.490
 relationship takes time to get well right 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.490
 Lisbon 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.370
 It's mine but it does not like to put 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.290
 a lot of mask which never comes back much 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.970
 mask and especially in the morning then 

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.900
 does a very basic thing and now 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.790
 to finish 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.280
 I've been wearing this lipstick here, which is the 

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:09.670
 It's a nike car that only kills. 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:14.180
 Look what I do down there. 

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:17.780
 allicin and there how I got it with moisturizer 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:24.620
 lipstick first movie easy to pay I am 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:26.960
 there and ready this makeup stays with 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:29.840
 more natural mouth is our dyad and 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.550
 lasts almost 6 whole and that 's how I 

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.560
 I often go make-up too 

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:36.380
 but that way I already feel very comfortable 

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.900
 I've done this make- up so quick and 

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.640
 It's what could have been a long time ago. 

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.740
