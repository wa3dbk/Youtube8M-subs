I<00:01:48.570> like<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.229> lot<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.500> how<00:01:49.710> H<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.100> has<00:01:50.250> two

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
I like that a lot of how H on has two

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.980 
I like that a lot of how H on has two
different<00:01:50.850> things<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.180> choose<00:01:51.420> from<00:01:51.450> and

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
different things to choose from and

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.510 
different things to choose from and
another<00:01:52.470> thing<00:01:52.770> we<00:01:52.920> can<00:01:53.040> get<00:01:53.250> from<00:01:53.399> this

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
another thing we can get from this

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.609 
another thing we can get from this
episode<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.479> H<00:01:54.689> Shawn<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.229> going<00:01:55.500> to

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
episode is is that H Shawn is going to

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.280 
episode is is that H Shawn is going to
evolve<00:01:55.979> from<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.640> match<00:01:56.939> not<00:01:57.630> just<00:01:57.689> because

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
evolve from this match not just because

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.990 
evolve from this match not just because
of<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.829> know<00:01:58.860> he's<00:01:59.070> fighting<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> tough<00:01:59.640> player

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
of you know he's fighting a tough player

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.389 
of you know he's fighting a tough player
but<00:02:00.570> because<00:02:00.930> his<00:02:01.140> weaknesses<00:02:01.770> are<00:02:02.070> being

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
but because his weaknesses are being

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.910 
but because his weaknesses are being
targeted<00:02:02.729> what<00:02:03.479> happens<00:02:03.990> when<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.380> poke<00:02:04.680> at

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
targeted what happens when you poke at

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.840 
targeted what happens when you poke at
someone's<00:02:05.310> weakness

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
someone's weakness

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.340 
someone's weakness
enough<00:02:06.299> in<00:02:06.570> an<00:02:06.750> anime

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
enough in an anime

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.380 
enough in an anime
or<00:02:07.470> any<00:02:07.920> where<00:02:08.429> well<00:02:08.700> honestly<00:02:08.940> in<00:02:09.060> real<00:02:09.240> life

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
or any where well honestly in real life

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.999 
or any where well honestly in real life
or<00:02:09.569> whatever<00:02:09.840> your<00:02:10.289> weight<00:02:10.440> this<00:02:10.619> will<00:02:10.800> either

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
or whatever your weight this will either

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.160 
or whatever your weight this will either
get<00:02:11.310> bigger<00:02:11.580> or<00:02:12.209> you'll<00:02:12.420> learn<00:02:12.600> to<00:02:12.660> evolve

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
get bigger or you'll learn to evolve

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.570 
get bigger or you'll learn to evolve
from<00:02:13.350> that<00:02:13.440> weakness<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.040> you'll<00:02:14.160> move<00:02:14.280> on

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
from that weakness and you'll move on

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.520 
from that weakness and you'll move on
and<00:02:14.760> get<00:02:14.880> stronger<00:02:15.300> either<00:02:15.720> way<00:02:16.020> that's

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
and get stronger either way that's

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.930 
and get stronger either way that's
usually<00:02:16.980> what<00:02:17.100> happens<00:02:17.130> when<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:17.819> have

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
usually what happens when you have

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.580 
usually what happens when you have
weakness<00:02:18.360> that's<00:02:18.540> being<00:02:18.720> targeted<00:02:19.050> a<00:02:19.350> lot

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
weakness that's being targeted a lot

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.130 
weakness that's being targeted a lot
especially<00:02:19.800> like<00:02:20.310> this<00:02:20.520> episode<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:21.750> HR

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
especially like this episode and so HR

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.840 
especially like this episode and so HR
most<00:02:22.350> likely<00:02:22.680> its<00:02:22.770> gonna<00:02:22.950> realize<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.430> his

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
most likely its gonna realize that his

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.449 
most likely its gonna realize that his
fundamentals<00:02:24.600> have<00:02:24.959> so<00:02:25.290> many<00:02:25.470> holes<00:02:25.800> in<00:02:26.130> it

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
fundamentals have so many holes in it

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.070 
fundamentals have so many holes in it
that<00:02:26.640> he's<00:02:26.940> going<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.209> have<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:27.450> adjust<00:02:27.569> his

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
that he's going to have to adjust his

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.130 
that he's going to have to adjust his
play<00:02:28.350> style<00:02:28.380> so<00:02:29.250> really<00:02:30.090> intriguing<00:02:30.569> that<00:02:30.989> you

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
play style so really intriguing that you

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.570 
play style so really intriguing that you
know<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.260> chance<00:02:31.709> happen<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.069> deal<00:02:32.340> with<00:02:32.489> this

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
know a chance happen to deal with this

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.280 
know a chance happen to deal with this
because<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:32.940> mean<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.150> couple<00:02:33.390> episodes<00:02:33.569> back<00:02:34.080> we

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
because I mean a couple episodes back we

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.800 
because I mean a couple episodes back we
saw<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.560> exact<00:02:34.980> same<00:02:35.190> extent<00:02:35.459> mhm<00:02:35.850> on<00:02:36.120> messing

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
saw the exact same extent mhm on messing

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.900 
saw the exact same extent mhm on messing
with<00:02:36.840> other<00:02:37.110> people's<00:02:37.560> weaknesses<00:02:37.800> so<00:02:38.430> this

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
with other people's weaknesses so this

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.360 
with other people's weaknesses so this
is<00:02:39.090> now<00:02:39.239> happening<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.810> H<00:02:39.959> on<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.410> now<00:02:40.470> H<00:02:40.739> on<00:02:41.100> is

is now happening to H on and now H on is
dealing<00:02:41.730> with<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.150> evolved<00:02:42.510> form<00:02:42.870> pretty

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
dealing with the evolved form pretty

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.830 
dealing with the evolved form pretty
much<00:02:43.739> he's<00:02:43.980> evolving<00:02:44.459> as<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.670> player<00:02:45.060> now<00:02:45.780> the

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
much he's evolving as a player now the

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.650 
much he's evolving as a player now the
overall<00:02:46.459> tension<00:02:47.459> of<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.730> episode<00:02:48.090> was<00:02:48.360> good

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
overall tension of the episode was good

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.840 
overall tension of the episode was good
I<00:02:48.840> love<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.470> slow<00:02:49.709> build<00:02:50.010> up<00:02:50.190> towards<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.640> end

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
I love the slow build up towards the end

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.390 
I love the slow build up towards the end
or<00:02:51.060> H<00:02:51.360> on<00:02:51.630> just<00:02:52.170> turns<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.650> entire<00:02:52.769> game<00:02:53.220> on

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
or H on just turns the entire game on

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.130 
or H on just turns the entire game on
top<00:02:53.610> of<00:02:53.790> its<00:02:53.910> head<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.660> he<00:02:54.780> pretty<00:02:54.989> much

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
top of its head and he pretty much

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.660 
top of its head and he pretty much
starts<00:02:55.410> dominating<00:02:55.590> right<00:02:56.100> towards<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.459> end

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
starts dominating right towards the end

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.850 
starts dominating right towards the end
it<00:02:56.970> was<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.090> really<00:02:57.390> cool<00:02:57.630> twist<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.319> honestly

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
it was a really cool twist and honestly

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.890 
it was a really cool twist and honestly
I<00:02:58.950> kind<00:02:59.310> of<00:02:59.400> expected<00:02:59.910> H<00:03:00.090> on<00:03:00.330> to<00:03:00.420> do<00:03:00.540> that<00:03:00.569> but<00:03:00.870> I

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
I kind of expected H on to do that but I

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.870 
I kind of expected H on to do that but I
did<00:03:01.080> not<00:03:01.170> expect<00:03:01.560> him<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.799> do<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.190> hundred

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
did not expect him to do the hundred

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.120 
did not expect him to do the hundred
square<00:03:03.330> tenants<00:03:03.900> I<00:03:04.019> did<00:03:04.290> not<00:03:04.440> expect<00:03:04.830> that<00:03:04.890> I

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
square tenants I did not expect that I

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.530 
square tenants I did not expect that I
expected<00:03:05.519> him<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:05.670> come<00:03:05.730> back<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.239> change<00:03:06.360> his

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
expected him to come back and change his

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.470 
expected him to come back and change his
play<00:03:06.720> style<00:03:07.019> and<00:03:07.230> some<00:03:07.769> former<00:03:08.400> fashion<00:03:08.640> but

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
play style and some former fashion but

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.030 
play style and some former fashion but
to<00:03:09.630> see<00:03:09.840> something<00:03:10.200> like<00:03:10.230> that<00:03:10.560> that<00:03:10.769> was

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
to see something like that that was

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.069 
to see something like that that was
incredibly<00:03:11.310> shocking<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.239> so<00:03:12.390> I<00:03:12.420> will<00:03:12.840> give

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
incredibly shocking and so I will give

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.449 
incredibly shocking and so I will give
it<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.440> writer<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.890> monk<00:03:14.070> because<00:03:14.370> I
