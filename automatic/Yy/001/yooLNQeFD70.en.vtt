00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
types like that kind of takes

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.130

point of gears of war and like Gears of
War<00:02:06.260> is<00:02:06.470> always<00:02:06.770> a<00:02:06.800> tight<00:02:07.130> pressure<00:02:07.430> game<00:02:07.910> like

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
War is always a tight pressure game like

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.490 
War is always a tight pressure game like
you<00:02:08.330> know<00:02:08.420> coming<00:02:08.720> right<00:02:08.930> down<00:02:08.960> on<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.259> wire

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
you know coming right down on the wire

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.980 
you know coming right down on the wire
and<00:02:09.950> stuff<00:02:10.880> like<00:02:11.060> that<00:02:11.120> just<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.690> way<00:02:11.810> it's

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
and stuff like that just the way it's

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.610 
and stuff like that just the way it's
set<00:02:12.170> up<00:02:12.230> in<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.620> small<00:02:12.830> maps<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:13.610> I<00:02:14.620> don't

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
set up in the small maps and I don't

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.230 
set up in the small maps and I don't
know<00:02:15.710> how<00:02:15.860> it's<00:02:16.040> going<00:02:16.160> to<00:02:16.220> go<00:02:16.280> it's<00:02:16.850> pretty

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
know how it's going to go it's pretty

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.000 
know how it's going to go it's pretty
much<00:02:17.420> like<00:02:17.480> if<00:02:17.840> I<00:02:17.960> went<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.290> did<00:02:18.410> a<00:02:18.440> commentary

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
much like if I went and did a commentary

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.590 
much like if I went and did a commentary
over<00:02:19.130> an<00:02:19.490> ex<00:02:19.730> I'm<00:02:19.970> pretty<00:02:20.180> sure<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:20.480> guys

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
over an ex I'm pretty sure you guys

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.180 
over an ex I'm pretty sure you guys
would<00:02:20.840> think<00:02:21.080> they'd<00:02:21.230> get<00:02:21.380> extremely<00:02:21.770> boring

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
would think they'd get extremely boring

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.460 
would think they'd get extremely boring
because<00:02:22.910> you<00:02:23.150> know<00:02:23.270> people<00:02:23.300> really<00:02:23.660> don't<00:02:24.080> try

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
because you know people really don't try

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.110 
because you know people really don't try
an<00:02:24.530> annex<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:25.250> they<00:02:25.340> just<00:02:25.520> run<00:02:25.610> around<00:02:25.760> and

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
an annex and they just run around and

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.390 
an annex and they just run around and
it's<00:02:26.390> pretty<00:02:26.840> much<00:02:27.080> just<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.500> home<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.920> practice

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
it's pretty much just a home to practice

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.110 
it's pretty much just a home to practice
that<00:02:28.630> so<00:02:29.630> we'll<00:02:30.080> see<00:02:30.320> how<00:02:30.350> that<00:02:30.500> goes<00:02:31.120> I'm

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
that so we'll see how that goes I'm

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.790 
that so we'll see how that goes I'm
really<00:02:32.360> curious<00:02:32.630> to<00:02:32.840> see<00:02:33.170> how<00:02:33.350> they're<00:02:33.620> going

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
really curious to see how they're going

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.000 
really curious to see how they're going
to<00:02:33.920> incorporate<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.940> first<00:02:35.180> person<00:02:36.010> shooter

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
to incorporate the first person shooter

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.860 
to incorporate the first person shooter
with<00:02:37.250> a<00:02:37.280> third-person<00:02:37.790> shooter<00:02:38.330> because<00:02:38.510> most

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
with a third-person shooter because most

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.430 
with a third-person shooter because most
you<00:02:39.190> know<00:02:40.190> that<00:02:40.910> what<00:02:41.090> you<00:02:41.240> zoom<00:02:41.990> in<00:02:42.200> with<00:02:42.290> the

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
you know that what you zoom in with the

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.170 
you know that what you zoom in with the
hammer<00:02:42.470> burst<00:02:43.010> it's<00:02:43.280> actually<00:02:43.640> like<00:02:43.760> an<00:02:43.940> iron

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
hammer burst it's actually like an iron

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.680 
hammer burst it's actually like an iron
sights<00:02:44.540> like<00:02:44.810> a<00:02:45.160> first-person<00:02:46.160> shooter<00:02:46.690> so

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
sights like a first-person shooter so

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.060 
sights like a first-person shooter so
that's<00:02:47.870> going<00:02:47.959> to<00:02:48.020> be<00:02:48.200> interesting<00:02:48.380> I

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
that's going to be interesting I

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.310 
that's going to be interesting I
honestly<00:02:49.580> think<00:02:50.390> it's<00:02:50.600> going<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:50.780> be<00:02:50.959> a<00:02:50.990> great

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
honestly think it's going to be a great

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.460 
honestly think it's going to be a great
game<00:02:51.530> I<00:02:51.830> was<00:02:52.580> raging<00:02:53.420> pretty<00:02:53.690> hard<00:02:53.930> when<00:02:54.140> I<00:02:54.200> saw

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
game I was raging pretty hard when I saw

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.720 
game I was raging pretty hard when I saw
the<00:02:54.530> first<00:02:55.430> gameplay<00:02:55.850> and<00:02:57.520> honestly<00:02:58.520> I've

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
the first gameplay and honestly I've

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.340 
the first gameplay and honestly I've
seen<00:02:58.970> a<00:02:59.000> lot<00:02:59.120> more<00:02:59.480> game<00:02:59.720> plays<00:03:00.020> and<00:03:00.230> I<00:03:00.290> do

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
seen a lot more game plays and I do

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.840 
seen a lot more game plays and I do
think<00:03:00.709> it's<00:03:00.890> going<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.070> be<00:03:01.160> a<00:03:01.250> good<00:03:01.490> game<00:03:01.640> you

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
think it's going to be a good game you

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.670 
think it's going to be a good game you
know<00:03:01.940> I<00:03:01.970> have<00:03:02.150> high<00:03:02.330> expectations<00:03:02.900> and<00:03:03.500> big

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
know I have high expectations and big

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.460 
know I have high expectations and big
hopes<00:03:03.950> for<00:03:04.250> this<00:03:04.400> I<00:03:04.690> told<00:03:05.690> myself<00:03:05.870> I<00:03:06.320> wasn't

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
hopes for this I told myself I wasn't

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.979 
hopes for this I told myself I wasn't
going<00:03:06.680> to<00:03:06.739> hype<00:03:06.950> gears<00:03:07.730> 3<00:03:08.060> up<00:03:08.239> because<00:03:08.570> i<00:03:08.600> hyped

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
going to hype gears 3 up because i hyped

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.600 
going to hype gears 3 up because i hyped
gears<00:03:09.320> two<00:03:09.560> up<00:03:09.769> and<00:03:10.010> I<00:03:10.160> was<00:03:10.340> kind<00:03:10.550> of

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
gears two up and I was kind of

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.970 
gears two up and I was kind of
disappointed<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:11.540> then<00:03:12.200> I<00:03:12.230> thought<00:03:12.320> about<00:03:12.560> it

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
disappointed and then I thought about it

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.949 
disappointed and then I thought about it
and<00:03:13.040> I<00:03:13.100> was<00:03:13.190> like<00:03:13.280> yours<00:03:13.670> too<00:03:13.730> isn't<00:03:14.060> that<00:03:14.690> bad

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
and I was like yours too isn't that bad

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.320 
and I was like yours too isn't that bad
of<00:03:15.140> a<00:03:15.260> game<00:03:15.470> it's<00:03:15.769> just<00:03:16.040> I<00:03:16.580> feel<00:03:17.000> like<00:03:17.060> they

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
of a game it's just I feel like they

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.180 
of a game it's just I feel like they
pulled<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.840> core<00:03:18.080> gameplay<00:03:18.110> away<00:03:18.739> from<00:03:18.950> gears

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
pulled the core gameplay away from gears

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.640 
pulled the core gameplay away from gears
wanted<00:03:19.670> and<00:03:20.090> a<00:03:20.450> lot<00:03:20.630> of<00:03:20.660> people<00:03:21.019> like<00:03:21.290> gears

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
wanted and a lot of people like gears

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.020 
wanted and a lot of people like gears
two<00:03:21.890> better<00:03:22.130> than<00:03:22.340> usually<00:03:22.820> because<00:03:23.000> they

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
two better than usually because they

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.250 
two better than usually because they
started<00:03:23.540> out<00:03:23.660> on<00:03:23.720> it<00:03:24.340> but<00:03:25.340> anyways<00:03:25.910> um<00:03:26.260> besides

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
started out on it but anyways um besides

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.539 
started out on it but anyways um besides
that<00:03:27.830> my<00:03:28.489> new<00:03:28.730> montage<00:03:29.209> just<00:03:29.720> came<00:03:29.989> out<00:03:30.230> I<00:03:30.549> I

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
that my new montage just came out I I

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.330 
that my new montage just came out I I
guess<00:03:32.000> it<00:03:32.150> had<00:03:32.299> some<00:03:32.540> mixed<00:03:32.840> grill<00:03:33.470> on<00:03:33.860> like

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
guess it had some mixed grill on like

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.690 
guess it had some mixed grill on like
some<00:03:34.580> mixed<00:03:34.910> reviews<00:03:35.150> I<00:03:35.950> actually<00:03:36.950> I<00:03:37.580> think

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
some mixed reviews I actually I think

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.760 
some mixed reviews I actually I think
half<00:03:38.330> my<00:03:38.660> montage

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
half my montage

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
know a couple days of the week and I had

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.240 
know a couple days of the week and I had
some<00:03:53.450> decent<00:03:53.600> clips<00:03:54.080> in<00:03:54.260> there<00:03:54.440> you<00:03:54.830> know<00:03:54.860> I

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
some decent clips in there you know I

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.810 
some decent clips in there you know I
got<00:03:55.580> to<00:03:55.640> good<00:03:56.270> feedback<00:03:56.750> so<00:03:57.020> far<00:03:57.050> i'm<00:03:57.500> also

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
got to good feedback so far i'm also

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.930 
got to good feedback so far i'm also
almost<00:03:58.820> about<00:03:59.240> like<00:03:59.450> i'd<00:03:59.690> say<00:03:59.960> 300<00:04:00.680> bikes<00:04:00.940> but

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
almost about like i'd say 300 bikes but

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.080 
almost about like i'd say 300 bikes but
it<00:04:02.090> does<00:04:02.300> have<00:04:02.510> a<00:04:02.540> lot<00:04:02.810> of<00:04:02.840> dislikes<00:04:03.440> and<00:04:04.090> i'm

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
it does have a lot of dislikes and i'm

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.570 
it does have a lot of dislikes and i'm
guessing<00:04:05.450> it's<00:04:06.170> because<00:04:06.350> people<00:04:07.040> are<00:04:07.430> just

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
guessing it's because people are just

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.360 
guessing it's because people are just
fed<00:04:07.790> up<00:04:07.820> with<00:04:08.150> gears<00:04:08.420> one<00:04:08.600> gameplay

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
fed up with gears one gameplay

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.339 
fed up with gears one gameplay
and<00:04:09.879> guys<00:04:10.060> out<00:04:10.299> there<00:04:10.450> I<00:04:10.480> don't<00:04:10.599> blame<00:04:10.959> you<00:04:11.170> but

you<00:04:11.530> do<00:04:11.680> have<00:04:11.860> to<00:04:11.920> realize<00:04:12.489> before<00:04:12.790> you<00:04:13.120> hit<00:04:13.209> a

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
you do have to realize before you hit a

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.600 
you do have to realize before you hit a
dislike<00:04:13.750> button<00:04:13.780> if<00:04:14.409> it's<00:04:15.250> because<00:04:15.370> you

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
the editing was a little too much just

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:49.080 
the editing was a little too much just
try<00:04:47.380> to<00:04:47.440> keep<00:04:47.680> down<00:04:48.130> on<00:04:48.310> the<00:04:48.400> flashes<00:04:48.940> or

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
try to keep down on the flashes or

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.939 
try to keep down on the flashes or
something<00:04:49.419> like<00:04:49.539> that<00:04:49.600> and<00:04:50.050> you<00:04:50.800> know<00:04:50.919> that

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949 
something like that and you know that

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:52.170 
something like that and you know that
makes<00:04:51.280> him<00:04:51.430> feel<00:04:51.610> good<00:04:51.760> because<00:04:51.880> it<00:04:52.030> makes

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
makes him feel good because it makes

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.700 
makes him feel good because it makes
them<00:04:52.360> feel<00:04:52.419> like<00:04:52.780> they<00:04:52.960> didn't<00:04:53.229> completely

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
them feel like they didn't completely

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.850
