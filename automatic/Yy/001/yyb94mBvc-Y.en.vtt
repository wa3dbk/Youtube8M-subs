by using the technology we have today we

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.140 
by using the technology we have today we

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
know how to make vehicles now they get

right now so if it's not an issue of

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.640 
right now so if it's not an issue of
technology<00:02:43.090> then<00:02:43.420> why<00:02:43.810> don't<00:02:43.870> we<00:02:44.110> do<00:02:44.260> it<00:02:44.290> in

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
technology then why don't we do it in

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.250

have<00:03:00.280> been<00:03:00.459> dropped<00:03:01.590> so<00:03:02.590> now<00:03:02.800> the<00:03:02.860> average

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190
