if<00:00:37.680> it's<00:00:37.800> too<00:00:38.010> big<00:00:38.190> we<00:00:38.340> can<00:00:38.520> fix<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.850> later

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
if it's too big we can fix it later

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.569 
if it's too big we can fix it later
and<00:00:41.059> there's<00:00:42.059> your<00:00:42.180> circle<00:00:43.190> so<00:00:44.190> now<00:00:44.399> we're

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
and there's your circle so now we're

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.130 
and there's your circle so now we're
going<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.730> pour<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.149> soil<00:00:45.450> into<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.930> bowl<00:00:46.110> of

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
going to pour the soil into the bowl of

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.000 
going to pour the soil into the bowl of
water<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:47.930> you<00:00:48.930> want<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.200> mix<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.590> up<00:00:49.710> until

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
water and you want to mix it up until

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.330 
water and you want to mix it up until
you<00:00:50.129> get<00:00:50.250> an<00:00:50.340> even<00:00:50.700> wet<00:00:50.910> consistency<00:00:52.219> that<00:00:53.219> you

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
you get an even wet consistency that you

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.810 
you get an even wet consistency that you
can<00:00:53.520> then<00:00:53.670> shape<00:00:54.030> into<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.360> ball<00:00:55.699> you're<00:00:56.699> going

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
can then shape into a ball you're going

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.569 
can then shape into a ball you're going
to<00:00:56.879> squeeze<00:00:57.180> out<00:00:57.329> all<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.570> excess<00:00:58.260> water<00:00:58.579> so

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
to squeeze out all the excess water so

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.810 
to squeeze out all the excess water so
it's<00:00:59.699> nice<00:00:59.879> and<00:00:59.910> tight<00:01:00.120> like<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:01.340> and<00:01:02.340> next

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
it's nice and tight like that and next

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.030 
it's nice and tight like that and next
we're<00:01:03.000> going<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.149> plant<00:01:03.570> our<00:01:03.899> plant<00:01:04.739> into<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
we're going to plant our plant into the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.730 
we're going to plant our plant into the
soil<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.299> want<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.689> compress<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.320> ball<00:01:07.470> so

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
soil so you want to compress the ball so

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.590 
soil so you want to compress the ball so
it<00:01:07.860> stays<00:01:08.070> together<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.729> stick<00:01:09.090> your<00:01:09.210> finger

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
it stays together and stick your finger

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.810 
it stays together and stick your finger
in<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.810> couple<00:01:10.110> inches<00:01:10.250> to<00:01:11.250> make<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.430> hole<00:01:11.670> that

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
in a couple inches to make a hole that

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.700 
in a couple inches to make a hole that
you<00:01:11.939> can<00:01:12.060> then<00:01:12.210> plant<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.990> then

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
you can then plant it in and then

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.740 
you can then plant it in and then
compress<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.310> really<00:01:14.640> tightly<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.540> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
compress it really tightly so that the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.600 
compress it really tightly so that the
plant<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.110> secure<00:01:19.009> now<00:01:20.009> before<00:01:20.400> we<00:01:20.549> start

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
plant is secure now before we start

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.570 
plant is secure now before we start
tying<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.420> want<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.689> make<00:01:21.810> sure<00:01:22.100> that<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
tying you want to make sure that the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.510 
tying you want to make sure that the
sheet<00:01:23.820> Moss<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.299> not<00:01:24.689> too<00:01:24.900> big<00:01:25.250> see<00:01:26.250> if<00:01:26.369> your

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
sheet Moss is not too big see if your

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.130 
sheet Moss is not too big see if your
mind<00:01:26.729> it's<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.000> little<00:01:27.240> bit<00:01:27.390> big<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:27.869> I'm<00:01:27.960> just

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
mind it's a little bit big so I'm just

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.590 
mind it's a little bit big so I'm just
going<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.350> trim<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.650> down<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.950> couple<00:01:29.280> inches

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
going to trim it down a couple inches

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.330 
going to trim it down a couple inches
and<00:01:31.340> then<00:01:32.340> after<00:01:33.119> trimming<00:01:34.009> you're<00:01:35.009> going<00:01:35.220> to

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
and then after trimming you're going to

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.719 
and then after trimming you're going to
cut<00:01:35.610> make<00:01:36.600> four<00:01:36.869> slices<00:01:37.490> equidistant<00:01:38.490> around

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
cut make four slices equidistant around

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.480 
cut make four slices equidistant around
the<00:01:38.850> circle<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.390> couple<00:01:39.570> inches<00:01:39.900> in<00:01:40.340> that<00:01:41.340> way

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
the circle a couple inches in that way

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.370 
the circle a couple inches in that way
we<00:01:41.640> can<00:01:41.820> fold<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.210> sheet<00:01:42.479> moss<00:01:42.659> around<00:01:42.990> the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
we can fold the sheet moss around the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.910 
we can fold the sheet moss around the
ball<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:45.380> so<00:01:46.380> now<00:01:46.560> you're<00:01:46.740> going<00:01:46.829> to

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
ball like that so now you're going to

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.710 
ball like that so now you're going to
wrap<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.369> folds<00:01:47.790> around<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.210> ball<00:01:48.390> really

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
wrap the folds around the ball really

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.319 
wrap the folds around the ball really
tightly<00:01:49.520> make<00:01:50.520> sure<00:01:50.729> they're<00:01:50.909> overlapping

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
tightly make sure they're overlapping

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.560 
tightly make sure they're overlapping
each<00:01:51.630> other<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.200> no<00:01:52.380> soil<00:01:52.680> can<00:01:52.950> fall<00:01:53.159> out

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.389 

just<00:01:56.570> like<00:01:56.780> that<00:01:58.630> all<00:01:59.630> right<00:01:59.930> so<00:02:00.619> before<00:02:01.250> you

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
just like that all right so before you

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.069 
just like that all right so before you
start<00:02:01.460> wrapping<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.149> twine<00:02:02.420> around<00:02:02.570> you<00:02:02.930> want

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
start wrapping the twine around you want

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.050 
start wrapping the twine around you want
to<00:02:03.170> make<00:02:03.320> sure<00:02:03.530> you<00:02:03.710> have<00:02:03.920> about<00:02:04.159> 20<00:02:04.579> inches<00:02:04.610> of

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
to make sure you have about 20 inches of

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.359 
to make sure you have about 20 inches of
extra<00:02:05.479> slack<00:02:05.630> that<00:02:06.590> way<00:02:06.710> we<00:02:06.829> can<00:02:07.009> tie<00:02:07.220> it<00:02:07.280> at

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
extra slack that way we can tie it at

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.449 
extra slack that way we can tie it at
the<00:02:07.430> end<00:02:07.670> and<00:02:08.560> then<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:09.770> can<00:02:09.920> go<00:02:10.069> ahead<00:02:10.190> and

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
the end and then you can go ahead and

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.600 
the end and then you can go ahead and
wrap<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.849> twine<00:02:11.090> around<00:02:11.510> it<00:02:11.690> around<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:12.080> ball

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
wrap the twine around it around the ball

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.580 
wrap the twine around it around the ball
covering<00:02:13.610> all<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:14.450> folds<00:02:15.019> and<00:02:15.140> making<00:02:15.470> it
