00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.950
 that daniel valleys to explain what 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.840
 which it is the black market because I'm look 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.990
 originally from low california cove and 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.240
 We wanted to bring us a space that 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:47.480
 will represent the low gastronomy 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.640
 california was a project thought in 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.800
 family at the beginning my brother 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.960
 industrial designer and he was the one 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.629
 created the space the menu is thought 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.129
 to represent the whole of the 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.950
 california baja gastronomy we wanted 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.480
 include in the urban part of the kitchen 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.430
 which is something super important and low 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.890
 california is a place that has 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.500
 basically everything on the one hand you have the 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.940
 peaceful on the other the sea of ​​cortez crosses 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.280
 a saw then has all the 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.240
 elements then we practically bring 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.240
 the state 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.560
 so it's a place that we like 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.990
 enough was already committed as that in a 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.880
 super recommended favorite for these 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.790
 hot nights good food or in 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.290
 excellent environment today how much time 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.970
 they have living here since there are their 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.040
 frequent clients and over the years of 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.649
 what is it that they asked for the day 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.870
 today this question made it is very 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.090
 good the corruptor 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.560
 this this attacked then then now 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.970
 let's talk about tacos truth that you 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.740
 you are going to prepare so look 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.780
 talking about our roots and low 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.550
 california and everything because he had to say a 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.990
 taco that would educate with seafood 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.480
 no but right now we have the whole subject of 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.910
 that we are in Monterrey and we are 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.570
 trying to act with a little more 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.600
 with the local 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.740
 then this taco is a taco de discada 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.450
 and we called it seafood and we put the 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.310
 name of the pattern 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.450
 with a friend who was the first one 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.080
 taught to do the dial in where 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.960
 made a dish as is traditional 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.000
 norestense 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.280
 simple in the end as 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.560
 the preparation of the stubborn shameless very 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.840
 Well look at this traditionally here 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.090
 in Monterrey is done with pork nets and 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.120
 some sausage and we substitute 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.950
 this for octopus shrimp and fish this 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.470
 keep bringing bacon and chorizo 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.420
 what I will be is what most ssa has 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.430
 then it is what will predominate that 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.260
 flavor and therefore the textures that the 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.840
 octopus for example fish is 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.410
 totally different what he mentions that 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.120
 they used a secret recipe that therefore more 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.430
 what secret recipes to follow as a 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.500
 very very firm seasoning of the house and 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.990
 something very low california inlet that 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.110
 is the land of chilies is basically the 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.540
 base of the mole but they are chiles 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.600
 dried baked and made in powder or in 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.360
 the luxury this true for the taste 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.280
 but special to what is the scale 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.970
 truth more something indifferent and well 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.160
 original 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.040
 now he's going to prepare the taco truth 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:26.800
 Let's give this we will give will 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.800
 start with the chorizo ​​and with the bacon 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.860
 let's have a little onion 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.860
 dwelling 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.690
 some soccer whistle and fish this 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:45.250
 fish is a fish as a low 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.250
 california white fish 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.650
 and then we're going to put the one 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.459
 little bit 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.459
 at least 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.470
 for a little salt 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.470
 a little pepper 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.470
 and already so that it takes hold everything much flavor 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.600
 let's use a little bit of beer 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.810
 dark preference and there is no work for 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:18.620
 the chef here here we already gave us the 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:18.620
 touched then after 

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:30.300
 now we're going to have to do some 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.300
 simple quesadillas 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:39.070
