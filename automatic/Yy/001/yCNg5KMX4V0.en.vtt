00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:07.350
 hello for a new radio video 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.480
 Bernie 2 so these presentations the 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.389
 studio 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.570
 so I was already doing all without 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:20.640
 even be careful 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:22.350
 no, so we'll start here 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.820
 it's a bit of a mess so all that 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:30.750
 it's not worth having a microphone 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:33.450
 so this behringer a socket for sylvia 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.820
 with a computer here it takes one case 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.129
 take live on the table he goes 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.020
 to fit in here finally there is nobody who 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.550
 comes again this is for both 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.539
 shares that are there to settle 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:52.079
 they're not going to have that rules 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:54.570
 so that's really the brothel it's 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:59.129
 not the brothel in quarters nor anything that's the 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.890
 brothel to understand so this is the 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.550
 standard skype it's not a standard 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.229
 telephone 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:11.070
 it's a skype standard so that's it 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.960
 who goes to the mixer and for 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.290
 that the guy who qualifies for the agreement 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.720
 still good what we have return he 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.189
 not hear consistent because so 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.689
 skype back to connect to this skype 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.119
 without echoes why I scored without 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:33.540
 echo simply because on this 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:36.509
 way if we skype etc if you look 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.950
 well so he is not careful button 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.869
 green are more trendy now and in 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.600
 done they are grabbing the deal all 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.600
 except yes I will ride his mother 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:02:00.040
 so then on this path there is my 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:03.610
 micro who's there so with the stand that 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:08.550
 like that where is so what you 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:11.800
 hear it's the radio the moment so 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:18.280
 that's what you mean it's the 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:20.019
 radio so I can look at it on the page 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.090
 facebook of the show end of the show 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.260
 of the radio 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.799
 so we can see that there is a person 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.420
 who's listening is not a lot but it's 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.100
 already that 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.569
 so for me as I have a young 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:40.230
 heather hach ​​of 201 so very very good 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:42.730
 breaks the c1 jbe 6 thp 2000 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.060
 so here it is a table and michel 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.440
 greenhouses 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.840
 I did not say it is useless 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.390
 because it serves but you see I 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.780
 am I turn with the software my radio 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.000
 mathis mme my radio maths mme and he 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.299
 only accept the microphone inputs I 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:04.450
 download com software jossic 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:06.470
 download it is where the oyes it takes 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.690
 that I find 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.370
 yes no but I can not do it 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.870
 function so and of me if you 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:20.840
 please do not cost and the volume under the 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:23.000
 table there is 2 and on this one the 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.500
 one and a half that's why really 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.870
 fell as much as possible the volumes 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.790
 entrance and if I put it stronger than that 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.020
 it actually kills me if I put it harder 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.870
 that settings like that that's it 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.880
 hard banks so that's to put 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.140
 the headphones must I buy an amp that 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.700
 do not be afraid it will not stay like 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.940
 that for the all or nothing quality 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.230
 I have two cables that cost the skin of 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.760
 1 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.190
 I will not say the word but hey you 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.230
 have understood I'm kidding it does not cost 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:56.480
 dear at all but still it's 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:59.360
 quality so I can plug in my 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.800
 laptop here I will not plug him in 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.200
 because that's what I'm filming 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:07.130
 I had the receiver hf for the microphone 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.820
 that he has like that in addition what in 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.500
 what the bank 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.180
 when you listen to the show the music 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.310
 that you top that you hear depressed 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.700
 music is endurable end of the 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.920
 music 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.709
 mx who are mistaking person so this 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:22.790
 crisis there is to go to the small park 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:24.919
 is there to illuminate a little for 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.350
 get a little bit of everything here what 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.390
 when landat double cd player a table 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.090
 mixers who do not know but they are 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:35.300
 not even read but then it takes 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.810
 to go to laye is very very 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.810
 simple 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:48.110
 good there the music you hear alone 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:50.290
 director sees there again we can do 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.290
 launch the broadcast but I'm going first 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.290
 so 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.770
 these dumps it's just this short 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.280
 in fact in the future will be there maybe 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.250
 other 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:15.230
 there will surely even other pc so 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:19.820
 there we can see the music so it is 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:27.430
 there the volume is normal then we have it 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:27.430
 given to the not must not put it to the bottom 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:40.580
 so here we can hear in the 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:46.400
 headphones in performance so the headset he 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:49.550
 is there beyond we have the 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:52.070
 broadcast so in my memories there are 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:55.600
 ten 10 12 seconds off 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.600
 so we will hear it in the old 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:12.170
 so that's the importance that his direct 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:22.940
 and if I want to stop broadcasting a 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:25.960
 fighter of 3 4 6 7 yes 9 10 11 12 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.960
 There you go 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:32.430
 so the image you see there I 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:36.330
 thanks really does the design that is 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:42.750
 the second animator I will not you 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:44.730
 give it brian so that made me 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:48.720
 this picture if I thank him 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:50.360
 frankly next video this will be 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.870

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:59.180

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:59.180
