according to them not them i don't know

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.440 
according to them not them i don't know

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
lot of the US presidents are were also

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.960 
lot of the US presidents are were also
these<00:02:55.580> seven<00:02:56.580> foot<00:02:57.860> blood-drinking<00:02:58.860> lizards

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
these seven foot blood-drinking lizards

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.630 
these seven foot blood-drinking lizards
from<00:02:59.970> this<00:03:00.209> other<00:03:00.540> planet<00:03:01.310> um<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:04.489> while<00:03:05.489> this

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
from this other planet um and while this

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.160 
from this other planet um and while this
other<00:03:05.850> galaxies<00:03:06.570> rather<00:03:06.890> and

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.729 

the<00:03:12.370> insane<00:03:13.370> thing<00:03:13.730> is<00:03:14.170> it<00:03:15.170> sounds<00:03:15.530> like<00:03:15.590> a

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
the insane thing is it sounds like a

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.059 
the insane thing is it sounds like a
really<00:03:15.980> poorly<00:03:16.760> made<00:03:17.150> excuse<00:03:17.780> is<00:03:18.139> that<00:03:18.709> the

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
really poorly made excuse is that the

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.300 
really poorly made excuse is that the
reason<00:03:19.310> why<00:03:19.760> we<00:03:20.030> find<00:03:20.450> this<00:03:20.840> very<00:03:21.310> skeptical

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
reason why we find this very skeptical

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.330 
reason why we find this very skeptical
is<00:03:22.549> because<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.810> Wizards<00:03:24.230> have<00:03:24.799> brainwashed

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
is because the Wizards have brainwashed

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.440 
is because the Wizards have brainwashed
us<00:03:25.999> and<00:03:26.859> that's<00:03:27.859> why<00:03:28.250> we<00:03:28.519> are<00:03:28.670> not<00:03:28.700> quick<00:03:29.420> to

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
us and that's why we are not quick to

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.229 
us and that's why we are not quick to
believe<00:03:29.870> this<00:03:30.409> theory<00:03:32.319> well<00:03:33.319> I<00:03:33.680> don't<00:03:34.459> see

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
believe this theory well I don't see

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.530 
believe this theory well I don't see
myself<00:03:35.420> leaving<00:03:35.959> it<00:03:36.349> and<00:03:37.120> that's<00:03:38.120> probably

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
myself leaving it and that's probably

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:47.970 
myself leaving it and that's probably
low<00:03:39.200> fire<00:03:39.980> um<00:03:40.810> that's<00:03:41.810> probably<00:03:42.169> because<00:03:43.389> um

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.879 

the<00:03:48.980> theory<00:03:49.400> that<00:03:49.930> aliens<00:03:50.930> will<00:03:51.409> randomly

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:51.889 
the theory that aliens will randomly

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:54.959 
the theory that aliens will randomly
come<00:03:52.189> and<00:03:52.519> try<00:03:52.790> to<00:03:52.849> take<00:03:53.120> over<00:03:53.269> the<00:03:53.449> earth<00:03:53.840> and

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:54.969 
come and try to take over the earth and

maybe<00:04:05.629> I'm<00:04:05.870> just<00:04:05.989> brainwashed<00:04:07.299> we<00:04:08.299> okay<00:04:08.930> I'm

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
maybe I'm just brainwashed we okay I'm
