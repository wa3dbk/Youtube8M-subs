00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello youtube I hope you are very 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.020
 well in this video I will show you some 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.890
 tricks and tips to improve time 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.050
 of life on your iphone's battery 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.390
 before starting I want to mention them 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.610
 that all the advice that I will give in this 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.580
 video are aimed at users who already 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:23.700
 have updated to 7 or a version 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.619
 posterior of ios and also worth noting 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.960
 that all the advice that I will mention 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.650
 they will be extremely simple to execute 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.690
 so let's start the first advice that 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.270
 I will mention them is to turn off the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.280
 movement of the interface for this 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.560
 they should only enter settings 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.300
 then in general afterwards in 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.710
 accessibility and will be here where 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.289
 find the option to reduce 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.140
 movement and all they have to do is 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.329
 activate it basically everything this 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.460
 will do is stop the visual effect that 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.230
 they have the icons when we are in the 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.600
 Different screens of our iphone 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.120
 Well, this is a visual effect that 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.179
 quickly consumes the battery and that in 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.430
 reality is not necessary the second 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:07.320
 advice that I will mention is a very 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.230
 simple and obvious but that many 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.360
 users forget to apply them all 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.430
 what they should do is open the center 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.170
 control and make sure that the connections 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.260
 they are not using they are 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.520
 off 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.530
 mainly check the wifi and 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.750
 bluetooth because if these two networks are 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.700
 constantly find their 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.630
 battery can be reduced even in a 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.240
 20% the third advice is to turn off 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.670
 location services for this 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.190
 they should only enter settings 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.860
 then in privacy and finally the 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.720
 location here you will find all the 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.180
 applications that may be using 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.830
 this function and to turn it off simply 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.470
 they must move the small switch of the 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.390
 top and in case you wish 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.970
 manage this application function by 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.800
 application just go down a bit and 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.360
 select the applications that 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.909
 I would like them to have access to their 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.950
 location just keep in mind that between 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.880
 more applications have access to this 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.560
 function plus battery will consume the same 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.420
 the fourth council that I will mention 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.550
 is to turn off updates 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.709
 automatic then at the end of the day 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.900
 it will always be more important to have 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.510
 battery in the phone instead of the 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.430
 recent update of a game for 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.220
 this should only enter settings 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.050
 then in itunes store and appstore and in 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.600
 this section just turn off 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.430
 switch that says updates and a 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.100
 once they have done this simply 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.000
 remember to visit the app store 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.210
 eventually to update their 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.180
 applications the fifth council consists 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.520
 in turn off the constant updates 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.440
 within the same applications and in 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.480
 if this confuses them a bit 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.670
 I just mean that we're going to 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.950
 make our applications are not 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.840
 all the time looking to update and 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.000
 this applies mainly with 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.310
 news or weather applications 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.740
 to do this we simply must 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.080
 enter into adjustments then we enter in 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.910
 general and in this part we look for the 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.370
 section called updates in 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.310
 second plane once inside it 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.320
 we can completely turn off the function or 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.630
 simply select manually 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.660
 which applications can access 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.910
 this function the sixth council that 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.790
 I will mention is to turn off the brightness 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.590
 of automatic screen and for this alone 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.050
 it is necessary that they enter into adjustments and 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.820
 then on wallpaper and brightness 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.950
 I recommend you leave it in a 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.780
 very low intensity and when really 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.000
 need to see a little more brightness in 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.370
 your screen simply slide the 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.580
 control center and you can adjust it from 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.100
 Very simple and fast way 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.380
 the seventh advice that I will mention is 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.030
 very important and it consists of deactivating 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.340
 the notifications of some 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.250
 applications that really are nothing 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.260
 important for this only enters 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.570
 in settings later in center 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.910
 notifications and now go down to the 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.070
 part that says include and analyze the 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.370
 applications of which they do not have 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.100
 no sense received notifications 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.960
 once they have selected them 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.210
 just enter each one of them and 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.090
 disable the option called to see in 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.580
 blocked screen these were some 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.590
 of the most important tips that 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.690
 sure they will help you save battery in 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.420
 your iphone and as I mentioned at the beginning 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.609
 of the video taking advantage of all 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.610
 they are very simple and fast so 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.590
 take full advantage of them let me know 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.520
 in the comments that you think of these 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.560
 advice and if you plan to use some if you 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.780
