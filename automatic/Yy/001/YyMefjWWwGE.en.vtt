actually ran the walmart and back which
is<00:00:47.760> about<00:00:47.940> 10<00:00:48.210> mile<00:00:48.420> round<00:00:48.750> trip<00:00:48.809> from<00:00:49.289> where<00:00:49.500> i

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
is about 10 mile round trip from where i

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.330 
is about 10 mile round trip from where i
live<00:00:49.800> at<00:00:49.859> and<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:51.530> no<00:00:52.530> it's<00:00:52.710> quite<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.010> bit<00:00:53.219> of

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
live at and and no it's quite a bit of

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.180 
live at and and no it's quite a bit of
improvement<00:00:53.460> on<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.260> power<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.679> vehicle

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
improvement on the power of the vehicle

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.529 
improvement on the power of the vehicle
which<00:00:56.850> really<00:00:57.089> surprised<00:00:57.719> me<00:00:58.309> i<00:00:59.539> didn't

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
which really surprised me i didn't

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.779 
which really surprised me i didn't
expect<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.440> much<00:01:01.710> difference<00:01:02.309> in<00:01:02.429> the<00:01:02.550> power

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
expect that much difference in the power

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.600 
expect that much difference in the power
right<00:01:03.089> away<00:01:03.329> because<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.559> computer<00:01:05.250> had<00:01:05.580> a

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
right away because the computer had a

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.920 
right away because the computer had a
time<00:01:05.910> to<00:01:06.500> recalibrate<00:01:08.570> over<00:01:09.570> here<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:09.780> our

good shot of that right there now the

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.110 
good shot of that right there now the
way<00:04:12.570> this<00:04:12.830> these<00:04:13.830> oxygen<00:04:14.310> sensor<00:04:14.670> extenders

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
way this these oxygen sensor extenders

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.970 
way this these oxygen sensor extenders
work<00:04:15.330> they<00:04:15.600> pull<00:04:15.990> the<00:04:16.170> oxygen<00:04:16.590> sensors

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
work they pull the oxygen sensors

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.229 
work they pull the oxygen sensors
further<00:04:17.250> away<00:04:17.460> from<00:04:17.669> the<00:04:18.060> exhaust<00:04:18.450> to<00:04:20.210> how<00:04:21.210> I

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
further away from the exhaust to how I

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.220 
further away from the exhaust to how I
would<00:04:21.510> say<00:04:21.660> this

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
would say this

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.580 
would say this
read<00:04:23.040> less<00:04:23.340> oxygen<00:04:23.930> and<00:04:24.930> when<00:04:25.110> it<00:04:25.200> reads<00:04:25.350> less

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
read less oxygen and when it reads less
