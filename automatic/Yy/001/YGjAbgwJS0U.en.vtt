00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 you will know how to be at the 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.940
 current team pocket edition 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.470
 can then build a cnc cannon version 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.470
 are you in this video just right 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.650
 so in this sense, I am now synonymous 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.689
 Welcome to a 92 on 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.340
 my channel and that should go 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.820
 a small cnt cannon 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.470
 because actually there is already a lot 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.170
 many videos on youtube where shown 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.089
 how to build such a teapot or 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.530
 I want something like that today 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:42.150
 that will be like the action version 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.980
 it works is actually relative 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.769
 but I hope that all 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.040
 is explained quite well and yes I would like 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.269
 I also today no big tmc came without 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.369
 show but only one actually 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:57.449
 small because I think you are creative 

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:58.140
 enough a bigger or a mightier one 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.210
 to build 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.790
 because that's just such a small one 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.070
 fundamentally, depending on what I mean 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.750
 I like it and I'll start it right away 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.920
 I have killed all the things now 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.860
 when he just is not what you want 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.070
 Everything you need is obsidian with it 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.960
 she can not break anymore 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.270
 if she had then I get with you if 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.680
 They only really through lava and 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.540
 by looking at mÃ¼ller like that 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.090
 Works she definitely needs 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.280
 but a world is there you have to go 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.200
 in youtube simply a community 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.500
 pocket edition i do not know lava looks 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.450
 or so then there is definitely something to us 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.970
 I'll start that for the first time 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.880
 It should be three blocks 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.590
 be broad and be happy three 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.150
 that is what we should look like 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.620
 So that's just here now 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.260
 Do a little without me like I did before 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.030
 have said then the ground 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.940
 Let's have a look at it, too 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.860
 do not break and come up front 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.150
 then you can do a headstand step indoor 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.970
 also do whatever you want there 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.670
 also around briggs labs or even and 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.560
 Slips or there is just everything must 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.090
 just try it yourself then needs 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.830
 you have a water bucket I have already 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.159
 conjured up a small infinite source 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.569
 I have not said that before 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:11.760
 What you need everything you need 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.640
 of course, two more pieces or ever 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.890
 on the size of the resist the cannon 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.689
 should and, of course , a 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.220
 vehicle and yes you pick ax 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:22.319
 members also break down the obsidian 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.659
 prince choice if you can do it all 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.120
 do not break down so then this set on 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:28.230
 seen the end of the block and then flows 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.640
 that a bit forward 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.720
 if you move in here now you can 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.800
 tell that you ever forward 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.320
 is driven 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.930
 After that you have to block a team 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.550
 now and 1 year on it and then 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.570
 it's such a small construction are 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.150
 maybe a little strange now 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.030
 but as you said, if you bigger 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.190
 wanted to build with glass dome or with what 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.290
 I'll see it all over 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.540
 some majestic out and I believe 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.130
 I'm sure you have some good ideas 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.230
 and then let's say we start 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.520
 all part time works 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.750
 namely, if you like me 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.600
 now with the vehicle on the 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.000
 then teach on the top then 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.400
 the lower one is blown up and the second one 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.580
 then explodes you can see 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.890
 the block blew something away so 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.090
 the cannon works according to me 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.020
 show that now again depending 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.760
 nobody because you fired the upper one then 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.230
 now also blown up because 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.420
 if I fire right now 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:26.430
 but not then it would be in the air 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.810
 shredded and it explodes somehow 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.980
 nothing is wanting with certain now 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.020
 it's just a bit funny 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.030
 Bit packed but it would be now 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:37.140
 in principle, I already work like that 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.120
 that again and now I want it 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.380
 right at the zither times that's it 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.720
 she will soon explode in the air 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.320
 So it seems to you you have the whole 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.090
 night can be created without then where 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.300
 the water in this small country 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.890
 tutorial about constructive criticism 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.420
 me of course and if you 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.430
 liked this video or knows 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.590
 then I would be happy to help 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.790
 if yes click on the positive then 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.920
 on the thumbs up 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.610
 as I said if you do not like 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.700
 I'm happy about that 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.930
 constructive criticism and then I would 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.030
 tell me is actually again 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.030
 at the network until then your people
