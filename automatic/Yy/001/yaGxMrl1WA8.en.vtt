it<00:03:30.650> out<00:03:30.799> that<00:03:31.459> way<00:03:31.629> and<00:03:32.629> doing<00:03:33.409> it<00:03:33.500> like<00:03:33.620> that

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
it out that way and doing it like that

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.439 
it out that way and doing it like that
makes<00:03:34.099> it<00:03:34.220> seem<00:03:34.430> really<00:03:34.760> easy<00:03:34.790> but<00:03:35.239> if<00:03:35.359> you

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:35.449 
makes it seem really easy but if you

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:37.300 
makes it seem really easy but if you
don't<00:03:35.659> do<00:03:35.840> it<00:03:35.930> in<00:03:36.019> that<00:03:36.169> specific<00:03:36.409> order<00:03:37.010> then

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
don't do it in that specific order then

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.339 
don't do it in that specific order then
good<00:03:37.699> luck<00:03:37.879> it's<00:03:38.689> going<00:03:38.840> to<00:03:38.900> take<00:03:39.079> you<00:03:39.229> awhile

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
good luck it's going to take you awhile

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:41.409
