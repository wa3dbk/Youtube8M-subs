what's<00:00:43.969> a<00:00:44.059> little<00:00:44.210> bit<00:00:44.329> different<00:00:44.750> about<00:00:44.809> this

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
what's a little bit different about this

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.520 
what's a little bit different about this
than<00:00:45.230> the<00:00:45.620> H<00:00:46.070> 100<00:00:46.579> i<00:00:46.640> right<00:00:46.910> off<00:00:47.059> the<00:00:47.269> bat<00:00:47.530> you

than the H 100 i right off the bat you

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.319 
than the H 100 i right off the bat you
can<00:00:48.679> see<00:00:48.949> that<00:00:49.309> it<00:00:49.519> has<00:00:49.550> this<00:00:49.910> different<00:00:50.300> look

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329

on<00:00:50.660> the<00:00:51.050> actual<00:00:51.350> amount<00:00:51.710> that<00:00:51.829> goes<00:00:52.039> on<00:00:52.370> the

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:52.609 
on the actual amount that goes on the

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:54.669 
on the actual amount that goes on the
CPU<00:00:53.030> which<00:00:53.179> is<00:00:53.300> very<00:00:53.510> very<00:00:54.050> nice<00:00:54.199> actually

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:54.679 
CPU which is very very nice actually

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:57.220 
CPU which is very very nice actually
it's<00:00:54.829> now<00:00:54.949> round<00:00:55.309> so<00:00:55.609> to<00:00:55.670> square<00:00:56.030> it<00:00:56.839> has<00:00:56.870> this

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
it's now round so to square it has this

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.560 
it's now round so to square it has this
ring<00:00:57.710> that's<00:00:57.949> interchangeable<00:00:58.699> and<00:00:58.909> it<00:00:59.329> does

you<00:02:09.470> have<00:02:09.530> it<00:02:09.729> what's<00:02:10.729> important<00:02:11.300> here<00:02:11.720> and

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
you have it what's important here and

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.800 
you have it what's important here and
see<00:02:12.170> if<00:02:12.260> I<00:02:12.320> can<00:02:12.470> find<00:02:12.590> it<00:02:12.830> ah<00:02:12.920> yes<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.400> domen

see if I can find it ah yes the domen

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.750 
see if I can find it ah yes the domen
and<00:02:14.260> they're<00:02:14.440> not<00:02:14.560> shy<00:02:14.860> about<00:02:15.250> putting<00:02:15.580> these

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
and they're not shy about putting these

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.000 
and they're not shy about putting these
on<00:02:15.819> they're<00:02:16.150> very<00:02:16.360> important<00:02:16.870> this<00:02:17.380> is<00:02:17.590> a<00:02:17.620> big

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
on they're very important this is a big

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.580 
on they're very important this is a big
radiator<00:02:18.430> this<00:02:18.850> is<00:02:19.000> actually<00:02:19.420> 38<00:02:19.900> millimeters

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
radiator this is actually 38 millimeters

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.309 
radiator this is actually 38 millimeters
for<00:02:20.980> just<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.340> red<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:21.790> then<00:02:22.330> when<00:02:23.020> you<00:02:23.140> add

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
for just the red and then when you add

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.320 
for just the red and then when you add
in<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.590> fan<00:02:24.010> you're<00:02:24.370> at<00:02:24.459> about<00:02:24.640> 63

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
in the fan you're at about 63

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.820 
in the fan you're at about 63
millimeters<00:02:25.600> so<00:02:26.110> pretty<00:02:26.350> thick<00:02:26.560> we'll<00:02:26.709> see

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
millimeters so pretty thick we'll see

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.050 
millimeters so pretty thick we'll see
that<00:02:26.980> in<00:02:27.069> a<00:02:27.130> minute<00:02:27.190> here<00:02:27.340> we<00:02:27.550> get<00:02:27.640> an<00:02:27.760> open

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
that in a minute here we get an open

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.059 
that in a minute here we get an open
that's<00:02:28.569> important<00:02:28.990> to<00:02:29.080> keep<00:02:29.200> in<00:02:29.350> mind<00:02:29.410> because

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
that's important to keep in mind because

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.040 
that's important to keep in mind because
if<00:02:30.790> you're<00:02:30.910> like<00:02:31.000> me<00:02:31.239> and<00:02:31.450> you<00:02:31.569> like<00:02:31.660> mounting

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
if you're like me and you like mounting

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.050 
if you're like me and you like mounting
these<00:02:32.140> at<00:02:32.319> the<00:02:32.410> top<00:02:32.440> of<00:02:32.770> your<00:02:32.890> case<00:02:33.160> to<00:02:33.819> try<00:02:34.000> to

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
these at the top of your case to try to

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.229 
these at the top of your case to try to
suck<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.480> air<00:02:34.600> out<00:02:34.630> of<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.930> case<00:02:36.060> it's<00:02:37.060> not

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
suck the air out of the case it's not

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.720 
suck the air out of the case it's not
the<00:02:37.480> best<00:02:38.319> thing<00:02:38.530> in<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.800> world<00:02:39.069> it's<00:02:39.400> super

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
the best thing in the world it's super

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.460 
the best thing in the world it's super
thick<00:02:39.970> but<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.600> thickness<00:02:40.959> of<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.170> radiator

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
thick but the thickness of the radiator

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.900 
thick but the thickness of the radiator
is<00:02:41.650> great<00:02:41.860> for<00:02:42.130> being<00:02:42.310> able<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.489> dissipate

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
is great for being able to dissipate

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.270 
is great for being able to dissipate
heat<00:02:43.180> so<00:02:43.510> make<00:02:44.140> sure<00:02:44.170> you<00:02:44.410> got<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.620> room<00:02:44.980> and

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
heat so make sure you got the room and

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.040 
heat so make sure you got the room and
if<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.520> don't<00:02:45.820> have<00:02:46.030> room<00:02:46.269> at<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.510> top<00:02:46.750> put<00:02:47.019> it

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
if you don't have room at the top put it

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.870 
if you don't have room at the top put it
in<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.290> front<00:02:47.560> or<00:02:47.709> make<00:02:48.160> sure<00:02:48.310> your<00:02:48.489> case<00:02:48.670> can

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
in the front or make sure your case can

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.920 
in the front or make sure your case can
support<00:02:49.150> it<00:02:49.300> somewhere<00:02:49.600> else

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
support it somewhere else

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.050 
support it somewhere else
all<00:02:50.380> right<00:02:50.530> time<00:02:50.680> to<00:02:50.800> cut<00:02:50.980> open<00:02:51.130> here<00:02:54.060> all

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
all right time to cut open here all

all right time to cut open here all
right<00:02:56.310> pull<00:02:57.310> that<00:02:57.459> up<00:02:57.959> just<00:02:58.959> like<00:02:59.170> before<00:03:00.360> got

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
right pull that up just like before got

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.449 
right pull that up just like before got
the<00:03:01.480> nice<00:03:01.630> padding<00:03:02.110> on<00:03:02.230> top<00:03:02.290> so<00:03:03.250> we'll<00:03:03.370> go

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
the nice padding on top so we'll go

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.759 
the nice padding on top so we'll go
ahead<00:03:03.489> and<00:03:03.730> set<00:03:04.600> that<00:03:04.630> off<00:03:04.810> to<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:05.200> side

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
to install it not brain surgery these

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.580 
to install it not brain surgery these
are<00:03:32.950> actually<00:03:33.220> fairly<00:03:33.400> easy<00:03:33.549> to<00:03:33.790> install<00:03:34.590> all

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
are actually fairly easy to install all

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.640 
are actually fairly easy to install all
right<00:03:35.769> let's<00:03:36.040> pull<00:03:36.280> out<00:03:36.400> the<00:03:36.430> goodies<00:03:37.500> you<00:03:38.500> get

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
right let's pull out the goodies you get

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.940 
right let's pull out the goodies you get
a<00:03:38.680> bag<00:03:38.920> this<00:03:39.910> has<00:03:40.180> your<00:03:40.720> splitter<00:03:41.530> it's<00:03:41.739> a<00:03:41.799> Y

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
a bag this has your splitter it's a Y

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.160 
a bag this has your splitter it's a Y
cable<00:03:42.340> for<00:03:42.519> the<00:03:42.579> fan<00:03:42.760> the<00:03:43.030> PWM<00:03:43.600> fan<00:03:43.810> they<00:03:44.019> are

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
cable for the fan the PWM fan they are

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.699 
cable for the fan the PWM fan they are
for<00:03:44.530> pin<00:03:44.859> it<00:03:45.100> looks<00:03:45.280> like<00:03:45.489> yep<00:03:46.030> and<00:03:46.390> then<00:03:47.260> all

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
for pin it looks like yep and then all

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.860 
for pin it looks like yep and then all
of<00:03:47.739> your<00:03:47.950> mounting<00:03:48.280> hardware<00:03:48.310> as<00:03:49.000> well<00:03:49.030> as<00:03:49.359> the

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
of your mounting hardware as well as the

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.479 
of your mounting hardware as well as the
mounting<00:03:50.200> brackets<00:03:50.680> apparently<00:03:51.100> this<00:03:51.220> is<00:03:51.400> an

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
mounting brackets apparently this is an

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.520 
mounting brackets apparently this is an
updated<00:03:51.880> bracket<00:03:52.420> from<00:03:53.230> what<00:03:53.350> they<00:03:53.440> were

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
updated bracket from what they were

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.770 
updated bracket from what they were
using<00:03:53.829> before<00:03:53.950> so<00:03:54.940> that's<00:03:55.120> good<00:03:55.329> because<00:03:55.510> it

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
using before so that's good because it

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.860 
using before so that's good because it
was<00:03:55.870> it<00:03:56.739> wasn't<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.180> most<00:03:58.180> solid<00:03:58.660> feeling

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
was it wasn't the most solid feeling

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.960 
was it wasn't the most solid feeling
mount<00:03:59.170> and<00:03:59.530> actually<00:03:59.980> I<00:04:00.040> had<00:04:00.220> an<00:04:00.310> H<00:04:00.430> 100<00:04:00.850> I<00:04:00.940> I

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
mount and actually I had an H 100 I I

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.030 
mount and actually I had an H 100 I I
had<00:04:01.390> two<00:04:01.600> of<00:04:01.750> them<00:04:01.930> and<00:04:01.959> both<00:04:02.709> of<00:04:02.739> them

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
had two of them and both of them

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.370 
had two of them and both of them
mounting<00:04:03.430> hardware<00:04:03.579> failed<00:04:04.060> the<00:04:04.900> first<00:04:05.079> one

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
mounting hardware failed the first one

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.650 
mounting hardware failed the first one
the<00:04:05.680> screw<00:04:05.980> that<00:04:06.130> came<00:04:06.310> with<00:04:06.459> it<00:04:06.609> was<00:04:06.700> bent<00:04:07.090> for

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
the screw that came with it was bent for

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.300 
the screw that came with it was bent for
the<00:04:07.810> LGA<00:04:08.670> 1150<00:04:09.720> it<00:04:10.720> was<00:04:10.870> 1155<00:04:11.769> or<00:04:12.070> something<00:04:12.280> I

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
the LGA 1150 it was 1155 or something I

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.759 
the LGA 1150 it was 1155 or something I
was<00:04:12.430> using<00:04:12.549> on<00:04:12.700> that<00:04:12.820> one<00:04:13.000> it<00:04:13.090> was<00:04:13.180> an<00:04:13.239> older

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
was using on that one it was an older

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.500 
was using on that one it was an older
Intel<00:04:14.769> and<00:04:15.070> then<00:04:15.579> I<00:04:15.640> had<00:04:15.790> one<00:04:15.820> hooked<00:04:16.150> up<00:04:16.269> to

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
Intel and then I had one hooked up to

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.870 
Intel and then I had one hooked up to
the<00:04:16.810> 8350<00:04:17.590> which<00:04:18.130> is<00:04:18.220> the<00:04:18.310> computer<00:04:18.609> running

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
the 8350 which is the computer running

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.120 
the 8350 which is the computer running
next<00:04:19.060> to<00:04:19.150> me<00:04:19.269> now<00:04:19.450> and<00:04:19.750> actually<00:04:20.590> the<00:04:20.769> the

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
next to me now and actually the the

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.040 
next to me now and actually the the
little<00:04:21.340> hook<00:04:21.640> that<00:04:22.090> would<00:04:22.240> hang<00:04:22.419> down<00:04:22.630> to<00:04:22.840> hold

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
little hook that would hang down to hold

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.300 
little hook that would hang down to hold
it<00:04:23.140> on<00:04:23.229> to<00:04:23.409> the<00:04:23.620> am3+<00:04:24.610> bro

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
it on to the am3+ bro

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.440 
it on to the am3+ bro
so<00:04:26.370> it's<00:04:26.520> good<00:04:26.669> to<00:04:26.700> see<00:04:26.940> that<00:04:26.970> they<00:04:27.210> switch

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
so it's good to see that they switch

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.260 
so it's good to see that they switch
that<00:04:27.660> up<00:04:28.610> and<00:04:29.610> what<00:04:30.270> else<00:04:30.450> we<00:04:30.540> got<00:04:30.660> here<00:04:30.960> see

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
that up and what else we got here see

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:38.570 
that up and what else we got here see
we've<00:04:33.270> got<00:04:33.570> a<00:04:34.520> empty<00:04:35.540> case<00:04:36.650> box<00:04:37.650> thing<00:04:38.010> spacer

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
we've got a empty case box thing spacer

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.930 
we've got a empty case box thing spacer
for<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:39.419> fans<00:04:39.630> kept<00:04:40.500> these<00:04:40.680> from<00:04:40.940> bumping

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
for the fans kept these from bumping

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.970 
for the fans kept these from bumping
together<00:04:42.210> on<00:04:42.450> the<00:04:42.540> ride<00:04:42.720> alright<00:04:43.590> so<00:04:43.770> like<00:04:43.860> I

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
together on the ride alright so like I

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.629 
together on the ride alright so like I
said<00:04:44.040> these<00:04:44.280> are<00:04:44.340> the<00:04:45.260> ESPYs<00:04:46.260> but<00:04:47.250> they're<00:04:47.460> the

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
said these are the ESPYs but they're the

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.520 
said these are the ESPYs but they're the
the<00:04:48.150> tame<00:04:48.389> down<00:04:48.600> version<00:04:49.020> of<00:04:49.110> them<00:04:49.230> so<00:04:49.380> what

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
the tame down version of them so what

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.690 
the tame down version of them so what
you're<00:04:49.650> not<00:04:49.680> getting<00:04:50.070> on<00:04:50.190> these<00:04:50.280> are<00:04:50.550> not

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
you're not getting on these are not

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.570 
you're not getting on these are not
getting<00:04:51.060> the<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:52.139> rubber<00:04:52.380> for<00:04:53.100> the<00:04:53.220> mounting

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
getting the the rubber for the mounting

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.100 
getting the the rubber for the mounting
for<00:04:53.790> the<00:04:53.880> vibration<00:04:54.360> resistance<00:04:54.870> that<00:04:55.020> you

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
for the vibration resistance that you

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.260 
for the vibration resistance that you
get<00:04:55.260> on<00:04:55.380> the<00:04:55.560> on<00:04:55.800> the<00:04:55.889> full<00:04:56.100> ESPYs<00:04:56.520> you're<00:04:57.150> not

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
get on the on the full ESPYs you're not

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.800 
get on the on the full ESPYs you're not
getting<00:04:57.510> that<00:04:57.630> ring<00:04:58.130> but<00:04:59.130> they<00:04:59.310> are<00:04:59.460> 4<00:04:59.790> pin<00:05:00.030> pwm

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
getting that ring but they are 4 pin pwm

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.890 
getting that ring but they are 4 pin pwm
which<00:05:00.960> is<00:05:01.110> nice<00:05:01.910> set<00:05:02.910> those<00:05:03.120> off<00:05:03.150> to<00:05:03.750> the<00:05:03.780> side

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
which is nice set those off to the side

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:11.110 
which is nice set those off to the side
and<00:05:04.910> let's<00:05:05.910> pull<00:05:06.180> this<00:05:06.360> out<00:05:07.250> all<00:05:08.250> right<00:05:08.370> so<00:05:08.669> all

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.740 

right<00:05:12.120> star<00:05:12.450> of<00:05:12.570> the<00:05:12.630> show<00:05:13.070> right<00:05:14.070> here

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
right star of the show right here

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.570 
right star of the show right here
immediately<00:05:15.750> you<00:05:15.870> can<00:05:16.080> see<00:05:16.190> that<00:05:17.190> this

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
immediately you can see that this

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.469 
immediately you can see that this
radiator<00:05:18.150> is<00:05:18.570> fairly<00:05:19.530> thick<00:05:20.240> you<00:05:21.240> know<00:05:21.360> if

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
radiator is fairly thick you know if

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.550 
radiator is fairly thick you know if
you've<00:05:21.630> used<00:05:21.690> a<00:05:22.110> 100<00:05:22.950> before<00:05:23.760> or<00:05:24.240> even<00:05:24.300> the<00:05:25.080> 110

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
you've used a 100 before or even the 110

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.440 
you've used a 100 before or even the 110
which<00:05:25.950> is<00:05:26.070> 140<00:05:26.669> millimeter<00:05:27.030> version<00:05:27.120> of<00:05:27.330> it

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
which is 140 millimeter version of it

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.270 
which is 140 millimeter version of it
you<00:05:28.080> know<00:05:28.169> it<00:05:28.320> comes<00:05:28.500> down<00:05:28.680> to<00:05:28.740> about<00:05:28.919> there

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
you know it comes down to about there

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.159 
you know it comes down to about there
it's<00:05:29.400> not<00:05:29.490> quite<00:05:29.820> as<00:05:29.970> thick<00:05:30.150> as<00:05:30.270> this<00:05:30.419> one<00:05:30.630> but

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
it's not quite as thick as this one but

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.350 
it's not quite as thick as this one but
this<00:05:31.289> extra<00:05:31.590> thickness<00:05:31.830> allows<00:05:32.430> for<00:05:33.120> these

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
this extra thickness allows for these

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.150 
this extra thickness allows for these
fins<00:05:33.750> to<00:05:34.560> have<00:05:35.010> more<00:05:35.400> airtime<00:05:36.150> so<00:05:36.539> more<00:05:37.200> air<00:05:37.860> is

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
fins to have more airtime so more air is

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.950 
fins to have more airtime so more air is
passing<00:05:38.430> over<00:05:38.910> each<00:05:39.150> one<00:05:39.180> of<00:05:39.570> these<00:05:39.690> little

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
passing over each one of these little

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.810 
passing over each one of these little
fins<00:05:40.260> so<00:05:40.979> even<00:05:41.190> though<00:05:41.250> they're<00:05:41.430> not<00:05:41.520> the<00:05:41.669> most

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
fins so even though they're not the most

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.760 
fins so even though they're not the most
dense<00:05:42.210> fins<00:05:42.570> in<00:05:42.780> the<00:05:42.870> world<00:05:43.050> as<00:05:43.350> far<00:05:43.410> as<00:05:43.590> the

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
dense fins in the world as far as the

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.890 
dense fins in the world as far as the
layout<00:05:43.919> goes<00:05:44.280> a<00:05:44.610> lot<00:05:45.120> of<00:05:45.270> air<00:05:45.390> is<00:05:45.510> gonna<00:05:45.660> pass

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
layout goes a lot of air is gonna pass

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.350 
layout goes a lot of air is gonna pass
through<00:05:46.229> I<00:05:46.500> mean<00:05:47.430> I<00:05:47.550> can<00:05:47.700> feel<00:05:47.910> when<00:05:48.090> I<00:05:48.150> blow

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
through I mean I can feel when I blow

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.450 
through I mean I can feel when I blow
through<00:05:48.630> it<00:05:48.680> so<00:05:49.680> that's<00:05:49.860> good<00:05:50.070> that'll<00:05:50.280> keep

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
through it so that's good that'll keep

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.060 
through it so that's good that'll keep
the<00:05:50.610> airflow<00:05:50.729> moving<00:05:51.470> and<00:05:52.470> then<00:05:52.919> of<00:05:53.039> course

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
the airflow moving and then of course

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.120 
the airflow moving and then of course
the<00:05:54.000> star<00:05:54.210> of<00:05:54.990> the<00:05:55.229> show<00:05:55.260> the<00:05:55.830> thing<00:05:55.950> you're

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
the star of the show the thing you're

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.270 
the star of the show the thing you're
gonna<00:05:56.220> see<00:05:56.430> the<00:05:56.550> most<00:05:56.810> the<00:05:57.810> actual<00:05:58.280> corsair

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
gonna see the most the actual corsair

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.719 
gonna see the most the actual corsair
stuff<00:06:00.000> is<00:06:00.150> here<00:06:00.389> grab<00:06:00.840> it<00:06:00.930> with<00:06:01.020> my<00:06:01.080> legs<00:06:01.729> the

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:02.729 
stuff is here grab it with my legs the

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:05.480 
stuff is here grab it with my legs the
corsair<00:06:03.210> mouch<00:06:03.720> so<00:06:04.200> that's<00:06:04.560> a<00:06:04.770> pretty

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
corsair mouch so that's a pretty

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.070 
corsair mouch so that's a pretty
good-looking<00:06:05.669> like<00:06:06.630> I<00:06:06.720> said<00:06:06.870> I<00:06:06.900> like<00:06:07.020> that

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
good-looking like I said I like that

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.719 
good-looking like I said I like that
it's<00:06:07.320> round<00:06:07.500> and<00:06:08.039> I<00:06:08.250> like<00:06:08.400> that<00:06:08.490> you<00:06:08.610> can

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:08.729 
it's round and I like that you can

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:10.430 
it's round and I like that you can
change<00:06:08.910> this<00:06:09.120> out<00:06:09.330> because<00:06:09.479> this<00:06:10.020> is<00:06:10.169> gonna<00:06:10.289> be

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
change this out because this is gonna be

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.260 
change this out because this is gonna be
going<00:06:10.620> in<00:06:10.710> a<00:06:10.770> system<00:06:11.100> that<00:06:11.130> has<00:06:11.250> a<00:06:11.400> Maximus<00:06:12.030> 6

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
going in a system that has a Maximus 6

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.270

off because you've got your thermal

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.890 
off because you've got your thermal
paste<00:06:25.830> on<00:06:26.039> here<00:06:26.340> and<00:06:26.550> this<00:06:26.820> little<00:06:27.330> cover<00:06:27.600> is

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.060 
there right so yeah you can see you've
got<00:06:34.680> your<00:06:34.919> thermal<00:06:35.490> paste<00:06:35.789> pre-applied<00:06:36.479> and<00:06:37.070> I

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.070 
got your thermal paste pre-applied and I

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.469 
got your thermal paste pre-applied and I
don't<00:06:38.310> want<00:06:38.520> to<00:06:38.580> handle<00:06:38.849> this<00:06:39.000> -<00:06:39.210> how<00:06:39.330> much

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 
don't want to handle this - how much

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:40.129 
don't want to handle this - how much
because<00:06:39.750> I<00:06:39.840> don't

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:40.139 
because I don't

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:43.339 
because I don't
cause<00:06:40.349> any<00:06:40.650> of<00:06:40.830> these<00:06:40.949> little<00:06:42.110> tubes<00:06:43.110> just

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:43.349 
cause any of these little tubes just

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:44.749 
cause any of these little tubes just
spring<00:06:43.680> a<00:06:43.740> leak<00:06:43.889> so<00:06:44.159> I'm<00:06:44.310> actually<00:06:44.400> gonna<00:06:44.639> put

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:44.759 
spring a leak so I'm actually gonna put

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:47.899 
spring a leak so I'm actually gonna put
it<00:06:44.969> back<00:06:45.150> in<00:06:46.110> the<00:06:46.319> box<00:06:46.680> if<00:06:47.159> I<00:06:47.340> can<00:06:47.490> remember<00:06:47.759> how

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:47.909 
it back in the box if I can remember how

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:50.689 
it back in the box if I can remember how
to<00:06:48.060> do<00:06:48.270> that<00:06:48.479> how<00:06:49.379> do<00:06:49.469> I<00:06:49.560> get<00:06:49.620> this<00:06:49.800> out<00:06:49.979> all

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:50.699 
to do that how do I get this out all

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:51.980 
to do that how do I get this out all
right<00:06:50.819> let's<00:06:50.999> take<00:06:51.150> a<00:06:51.210> look<00:06:51.330> at<00:06:51.569> the<00:06:51.719> rings

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:51.990 
right let's take a look at the rings

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.700 
right let's take a look at the rings
that<00:06:52.650> was<00:06:52.710> mentioning<00:06:53.159> here<00:06:54.439> make<00:06:55.439> it<00:06:55.560> about

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:55.710 
that was mentioning here make it about

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.679 
that was mentioning here make it about
yeah<00:06:56.370> there<00:06:56.550> they<00:06:56.669> are<00:06:56.789> so<00:06:56.969> you<00:06:57.060> got<00:06:57.180> red<00:06:57.479> and

00:06:57.679 --> 00:06:57.689 
yeah there they are so you got red and

00:06:57.689 --> 00:06:59.600 
yeah there they are so you got red and
blue<00:06:57.930> that<00:06:58.529> you<00:06:58.560> can<00:06:58.770> switch<00:06:58.949> on<00:06:59.159> there<00:06:59.400> but

00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.610 
blue that you can switch on there but

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:00.769 
blue that you can switch on there but
nice<00:06:59.789> if<00:06:59.969> they<00:07:00.060> would<00:07:00.150> included<00:07:00.599> white

00:07:00.769 --> 00:07:00.779 
nice if they would included white

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:02.989 
nice if they would included white
especially<00:07:01.259> since<00:07:01.439> the<00:07:01.680> LED<00:07:02.279> that<00:07:02.669> actually

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:02.999 
especially since the LED that actually

00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:05.360 
especially since the LED that actually
lights<00:07:03.180> up<00:07:03.330> that<00:07:03.389> says<00:07:03.659> Corsair<00:07:04.139> is<00:07:04.169> white<00:07:04.499> but

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.370 
lights up that says Corsair is white but

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.790 
lights up that says Corsair is white but
I<00:07:05.610> guess<00:07:05.969> she<00:07:06.120> can't<00:07:06.360> have<00:07:06.569> everything<00:07:06.960> that's

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 
I guess she can't have everything that's

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.659 
I guess she can't have everything that's
just<00:07:07.919> being<00:07:08.159> bossy<00:07:08.840> so<00:07:10.370> that<00:07:11.370> being<00:07:11.580> said

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:11.669 
just being bossy so that being said

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:15.140 
just being bossy so that being said
that's<00:07:12.240> gonna<00:07:12.479> go<00:07:12.689> in<00:07:12.900> my<00:07:12.930> build<00:07:13.259> and<00:07:14.150> I'm

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:15.150 
that's gonna go in my build and I'm

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.999 
that's gonna go in my build and I'm
excited<00:07:15.449> to<00:07:15.629> see<00:07:15.810> how<00:07:15.960> it<00:07:16.110> performs<00:07:16.469> actually
