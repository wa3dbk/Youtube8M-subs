that one that one kicks to the red stone
it's<00:02:26.200> really<00:02:26.560> easy<00:02:26.710> red<00:02:26.980> stones<00:02:27.690> I'm<00:02:28.690> not<00:02:29.200> the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
it's really easy red stones I'm not the

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.440 
it's really easy red stones I'm not the
greatest<00:02:29.500> redstone<00:02:30.280> guy<00:02:30.490> and<00:02:30.880> I<00:02:30.940> figure<00:02:31.270> this

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
greatest redstone guy and I figure this

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.230 
greatest redstone guy and I figure this
one<00:02:31.690> out<00:02:34.350> place<00:02:35.350> redstone<00:02:35.950> repeater<00:02:36.520> the

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
one out place redstone repeater the

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.060 
one out place redstone repeater the
reason<00:02:37.540> I'm<00:02:37.660> putting<00:02:37.690> a<00:02:38.110> little<00:02:38.290> block<00:02:38.560> I<00:02:38.770> put

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
reason I'm putting a little block I put

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.970 
reason I'm putting a little block I put
a<00:02:39.100> block<00:02:39.340> there<00:02:39.580> is<00:02:39.820> so<00:02:40.600> that<00:02:40.810> this<00:02:41.080> this<00:02:41.740> way<00:02:41.950> i

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
a block there is so that this this way i

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.330 
a block there is so that this this way i
can<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.580> power<00:02:43.510> this<00:02:44.080> block<00:02:44.350> right<00:02:44.380> here<00:02:44.590> which

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
can a power this block right here which

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.880 
can a power this block right here which
will<00:02:45.490> cause<00:02:45.730> this<00:02:46.540> trapdoor<00:02:47.110> in<00:02:47.380> placing

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
will cause this trapdoor in placing

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.650 
will cause this trapdoor in placing
right<00:02:48.070> here<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:50.380> flip<00:02:50.880> back<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:51.940> forth<00:02:52.150> so
