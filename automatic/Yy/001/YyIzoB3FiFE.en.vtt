Microsoft that's going to attempt to

worlds<00:00:18.150> into<00:00:18.420> 10<00:00:18.690> s<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.260> it's<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.500> really

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
worlds into 10 s so it's a really

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.740 
worlds into 10 s so it's a really
completely<00:00:20.250> different<00:00:20.670> strategy<00:00:21.420> than<00:00:21.449> when

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
completely different strategy than when

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.269 
completely different strategy than when
Apple<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.140> doing<00:00:22.410> with<00:00:22.560> mountain<00:00:22.920> lion<00:00:23.100> and

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
Apple is doing with mountain lion and

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.240 
Apple is doing with mountain lion and
iOS<00:00:23.609> everything<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.300> in<00:00:24.750> one<00:00:25.019> device<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.769> the

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
iOS everything is in one device and the

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.200 
iOS everything is in one device and the
idea<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:26.730> you're<00:00:26.880> going<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.060> have<00:00:27.180> a

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
idea is that you're going to have a

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.670 
idea is that you're going to have a
completely<00:00:27.750> different<00:00:28.050> type<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.230> interface

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
completely different type of interface

completely different type of interface
than<00:00:28.920> you're<00:00:29.039> used<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.340> on<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.580> regular<00:00:29.640> windows

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
than you're used to on a regular windows

and regular windows is obviously the

options and what you have the idea of
here<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.170> being<00:01:28.380> able<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.740> personalize<00:01:29.340> the

here of being able to personalize the
interface<00:01:29.909> as<00:01:30.150> well<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.810> can<00:01:30.990> move<00:01:31.140> any<00:01:31.409> of

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
interface as well so you can move any of

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.760 
interface as well so you can move any of
these<00:01:31.650> tiles<00:01:31.979> around<00:01:32.990> just<00:01:33.990> like<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.320> you

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
these tiles around just like that you

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.590 
these tiles around just like that you
can<00:01:34.860> also<00:01:34.979> group<00:01:35.460> tiles<00:01:35.790> together<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.509> can

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
can also group tiles together so you can

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.940 
can also group tiles together so you can
see<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.020> we<00:01:37.110> just<00:01:37.259> did<00:01:37.470> what's<00:01:37.619> called<00:01:37.710> a

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
see that we just did what's called a

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.560 
see that we just did what's called a
semantic<00:01:38.460> zoom<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.939> what<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.180> means<00:01:39.390> is

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
semantic zoom and what that means is

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.969 
semantic zoom and what that means is
that<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.810> can<00:01:39.960> see<00:01:40.110> all<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.320> your<00:01:40.530> groups<00:01:40.770> of

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
that you can see all of your groups of

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.370 
that you can see all of your groups of
apps<00:01:41.460> together<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.150> could<00:01:42.299> move<00:01:42.509> one

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
apps together and you could move one

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.920 
apps together and you could move one
around<00:01:43.619> if<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.920> want<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.450> can<00:01:45.450> also<00:01:45.600> name

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
around if you want and you can also name

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.569 
around if you want and you can also name
them<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.350> for<00:01:46.560> example<00:01:46.649> what<00:01:47.040> we<00:01:47.070> did<00:01:47.280> there

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
them so for example what we did there

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.210 
them so for example what we did there
was<00:01:48.299> entertainment<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.649> if<00:01:49.740> we<00:01:49.829> wanted<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.100> we

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
was entertainment so if we wanted to we

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.069 
was entertainment so if we wanted to we
could<00:01:50.369> move<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:51.810> music<00:01:52.229> on<00:01:52.409> over<00:01:53.310> here<00:01:53.930> so<00:01:54.930> the

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
could move the music on over here so the

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.690 
could move the music on over here so the
interface<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.409> completely<00:01:56.040> your<00:01:56.159> own<00:01:56.219> and

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
interface is completely your own and

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.940 
interface is completely your own and
completely<00:01:57.149> customizable<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.740> know<00:01:58.829> we

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
completely customizable and you know we

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.319 
completely customizable and you know we
really<00:01:59.070> like<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.490> personalization<00:02:00.000> options

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
really like the personalization options

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.850 
really like the personalization options
that<00:02:00.659> are<00:02:00.780> here<00:02:00.930> but<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.170> also<00:02:01.290> involves<00:02:01.680> a

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
that are here but it also involves a

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.050 
that are here but it also involves a
little<00:02:01.979> bit<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.280> work<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:02.640> if<00:02:02.729> you're<00:02:02.850> willing

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
to put in just a little bit of time

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.560 
to put in just a little bit of time
you're<00:02:04.619> going<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.829> get<00:02:04.950> rewarded<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:06.119> there

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
here that are sort of consistent

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.290 
here that are sort of consistent
throughout<00:02:11.220> windows<00:02:11.640> 8<00:02:11.819> we're<00:02:11.970> going<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.180> walk

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
throughout windows 8 we're going to walk

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.350 
throughout windows 8 we're going to walk
you<00:02:12.450> through<00:02:12.480> that

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
you through that

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.850

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
multitasking so if you have a bunch of

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.470 
multitasking so if you have a bunch of
applications<00:02:17.890> open<00:02:18.070> you<00:02:18.970> can<00:02:19.120> just<00:02:19.270> start

applications open you can just start

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.180 
applications open you can just start
pulling<00:02:19.720> them<00:02:19.930> in<00:02:20.020> from<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.380> left<00:02:20.590> this<00:02:21.010> is

as microsoft works with developers we're

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.770 
as microsoft works with developers we're
hoping<00:04:45.370> to<00:04:45.490> see<00:04:45.670> Twitter<00:04:45.970> and<00:04:46.210> Facebook<00:04:46.360> and

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
hoping to see Twitter and Facebook and

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.660 
hoping to see Twitter and Facebook and
all<00:04:47.290> sorts<00:04:47.560> of<00:04:47.650> third-party<00:04:48.190> apps<00:04:48.340> I<00:04:48.550> mean

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
all sorts of third-party apps I mean

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:49.980 
all sorts of third-party apps I mean
hopefully<00:04:48.820> two<00:04:49.150> e-tech<00:04:49.390> that<00:04:49.630> would<00:04:49.750> be<00:04:49.840> nice

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
hopefully two e-tech that would be nice

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.830 
hopefully two e-tech that would be nice
so<00:04:50.860> if<00:04:50.980> you<00:04:51.100> click<00:04:51.220> on<00:04:51.400> mail<00:04:51.670> you'll<00:04:52.480> see<00:04:52.690> that

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
so if you click on mail you'll see that

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.680 
so if you click on mail you'll see that
a<00:04:52.900> message<00:04:53.140> automatically<00:04:54.210> launches<00:04:55.210> and

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
a message automatically launches and

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.060 
a message automatically launches and
Windows<00:04:58.690> 8<00:04:58.780> is<00:04:58.810> supposed<00:04:59.260> to<00:04:59.410> populate<00:04:59.830> this

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
Windows 8 is supposed to populate this

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.600 
Windows 8 is supposed to populate this
with<00:05:00.370> with<00:05:00.640> an<00:05:00.760> image<00:05:01.050> there<00:05:02.050> we<00:05:02.140> go<00:05:02.520> so<00:05:03.520> you

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
with with an image there we go so you

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.250 
with with an image there we go so you
can<00:05:03.640> choose<00:05:03.970> your<00:05:04.090> image<00:05:04.360> and<00:05:04.570> then<00:05:04.900> send<00:05:05.200> it

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
can choose your image and then send it

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.230

off<00:05:05.380> as<00:05:05.650> an<00:05:05.770> email<00:05:06.070> and<00:05:06.280> while<00:05:06.820> we're<00:05:06.940> here<00:05:07.060> we

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
off as an email and while we're here we

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.370 
off as an email and while we're here we
can<00:05:07.270> take<00:05:07.510> a<00:05:07.540> look<00:05:07.720> at<00:05:07.810> the<00:05:07.930> split<00:05:08.170> keyboard

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
can take a look at the split keyboard

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.080 
can take a look at the split keyboard
which<00:05:08.860> is<00:05:09.010> one<00:05:09.160> of<00:05:09.220> the<00:05:09.310> options<00:05:09.340> available<00:05:09.730> in

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
which is one of the options available in

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.660 
which is one of the options available in
the<00:05:10.210> windows<00:05:10.480> 8<00:05:10.660> consumer<00:05:10.690> preview<00:05:11.340> so<00:05:12.340> the

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 
the windows 8 consumer preview so the

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.640 
the windows 8 consumer preview so the
touch<00:05:13.000> sensitivity<00:05:13.720> and<00:05:14.170> the<00:05:14.200> accuracy<00:05:14.620> is

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
touch sensitivity and the accuracy is

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.620 
touch sensitivity and the accuracy is
really<00:05:15.040> good<00:05:15.190> so<00:05:15.940> let's<00:05:16.120> say<00:05:16.240> we<00:05:16.270> wanted<00:05:16.510> to

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
really good so let's say we wanted to

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.880 
really good so let's say we wanted to
send<00:05:16.810> it<00:05:16.960> to<00:05:17.160> my<00:05:18.160> friend<00:05:18.490> even<00:05:19.560> just<00:05:20.560> type<00:05:20.770> a

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
send it to my friend even just type a

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.530 
send it to my friend even just type a
couple<00:05:21.160> letters<00:05:21.340> you'll<00:05:22.150> see<00:05:22.300> that<00:05:22.420> the

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 
couple letters you'll see that the

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.000 
couple letters you'll see that the
contact<00:05:22.960> show<00:05:23.110> up<00:05:23.200> there<00:05:23.380> you<00:05:23.590> select<00:05:23.920> that

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
contact show up there you select that

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.100 
contact show up there you select that
then<00:05:24.790> you<00:05:24.910> can<00:05:24.940> send<00:05:25.240> it<00:05:25.360> off<00:05:25.480> the<00:05:25.840> other<00:05:25.960> thing

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
then you can send it off the other thing

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.540 
then you can send it off the other thing
that<00:05:26.140> we<00:05:26.290> like<00:05:26.440> about<00:05:26.560> the<00:05:26.770> split<00:05:27.010> keyboard<00:05:27.160> is

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
that we like about the split keyboard is

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.800 
that we like about the split keyboard is
that<00:05:27.700> you<00:05:27.820> can<00:05:27.970> use<00:05:28.120> it<00:05:28.150> with<00:05:28.390> your<00:05:28.540> thumbs

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
that you can use it with your thumbs

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.540 
that you can use it with your thumbs
which<00:05:29.050> is<00:05:29.170> better<00:05:29.320> for<00:05:29.440> wider<00:05:29.890> tablets<00:05:30.400> like

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
which is better for wider tablets like

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.780 
which is better for wider tablets like
this<00:05:30.790> and<00:05:31.000> you<00:05:31.720> have<00:05:31.900> the<00:05:32.340> numeric<00:05:33.340> keypad

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
this and you have the numeric keypad

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.760 
this and you have the numeric keypad
right<00:05:34.090> in<00:05:34.180> the<00:05:34.270> middle<00:05:34.450> but<00:05:35.050> you<00:05:35.140> can<00:05:35.260> also<00:05:35.410> go

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
right in the middle but you can also go

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.180 
right in the middle but you can also go
to<00:05:35.830> a<00:05:36.010> full<00:05:36.340> size<00:05:36.550> if<00:05:36.940> you<00:05:37.600> want<00:05:37.810> and<00:05:38.050> if<00:05:38.950> you<00:05:39.040> go

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
to a full size if you want and if you go

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.130 
to a full size if you want and if you go
back<00:05:39.400> to<00:05:39.700> the<00:05:39.820> thumb<00:05:40.120> keyboard<00:05:40.330> you<00:05:41.110> can

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:41.140 
back to the thumb keyboard you can

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.250 
back to the thumb keyboard you can
resize<00:05:41.680> it<00:05:42.000> just<00:05:43.000> by<00:05:43.150> going<00:05:43.300> from<00:05:43.630> small<00:05:44.050> to

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
resize it just by going from small to

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.350 
resize it just by going from small to
medium<00:05:44.560> to<00:05:44.740> large<00:05:44.980> so<00:05:45.550> Microsoft<00:05:46.030> is<00:05:46.150> really

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
medium to large so Microsoft is really

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.450 
medium to large so Microsoft is really
thought<00:05:46.660> through<00:05:46.900> the<00:05:47.440> the<00:05:47.830> text<00:05:48.100> input

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
thought through the the text input

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.030 
thought through the the text input
process<00:05:48.940> okay<00:05:49.900> so<00:05:49.960> overall<00:05:50.440> with<00:05:50.560> Windows<00:05:50.890> 8

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.040 
process okay so overall with Windows 8

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.080 
process okay so overall with Windows 8
we're<00:05:51.310> impressed<00:05:51.520> with<00:05:51.700> the<00:05:51.760> progress<00:05:51.910> that

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
we're impressed with the progress that

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.690 
we're impressed with the progress that
Microsoft<00:05:52.630> is<00:05:52.780> made<00:05:52.990> so<00:05:53.200> far<00:05:53.440> and<00:05:53.770> you<00:05:54.460> know<00:05:54.550> it

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
Microsoft is made so far and you know it

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.340 
Microsoft is made so far and you know it
definitely<00:05:55.000> requires<00:05:55.360> a<00:05:55.630> learning<00:05:55.990> curve<00:05:56.140> in

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
definitely requires a learning curve in

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:57.720 
definitely requires a learning curve in
terms<00:05:56.380> of<00:05:56.680> you<00:05:56.890> know<00:05:56.950> learning<00:05:57.250> this<00:05:57.490> new

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
terms of you know learning this new

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.760 
terms of you know learning this new
interface<00:05:58.150> but<00:05:58.870> we<00:05:58.960> think<00:05:59.169> it's<00:05:59.380> worth<00:05:59.560> the

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
interface but we think it's worth the

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.070 
interface but we think it's worth the
trade-off<00:06:00.040> in<00:06:00.790> terms<00:06:01.000> of<00:06:01.150> just<00:06:01.270> having<00:06:01.570> a<00:06:01.870> UI

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
trade-off in terms of just having a UI

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.070 
trade-off in terms of just having a UI
that's<00:06:02.590> more<00:06:03.070> dynamic<00:06:03.580> and<00:06:04.419> interesting<00:06:04.690> and

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
that's more dynamic and interesting and

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.690 
that's more dynamic and interesting and
personalized<00:06:05.680> you<00:06:05.980> know<00:06:06.070> versus<00:06:06.400> you<00:06:06.610> know

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:06.700 
personalized you know versus you know

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.790 
personalized you know versus you know
the<00:06:06.790> competition<00:06:07.419> but<00:06:08.260> it's<00:06:08.560> definitely

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
the competition but it's definitely

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.470 
the competition but it's definitely
going<00:06:09.040> to<00:06:09.100> be<00:06:09.250> a<00:06:09.280> hump<00:06:09.640> for<00:06:09.790> users<00:06:10.060> to<00:06:10.090> get<00:06:10.270> over

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:10.480 
going to be a hump for users to get over

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.550 
going to be a hump for users to get over
because<00:06:10.660> there's<00:06:10.810> a<00:06:10.870> lot<00:06:10.990> of<00:06:11.020> swiping<00:06:11.500> from

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
because there's a lot of swiping from

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.950 
because there's a lot of swiping from
the<00:06:11.830> left<00:06:12.010> side<00:06:12.190> from<00:06:12.490> the<00:06:12.580> right<00:06:12.730> side<00:06:12.960> from

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
the left side from the right side from

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.480 
the left side from the right side from
this<00:06:14.140> side<00:06:14.320> to<00:06:14.500> you<00:06:14.590> know<00:06:14.710> to<00:06:14.830> get<00:06:14.950> two<00:06:15.040> options

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
this side to you know to get two options

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:16.890 
this side to you know to get two options
so<00:06:16.000> you<00:06:16.060> know<00:06:16.300> it's<00:06:16.480> going<00:06:16.600> to<00:06:16.660> take<00:06:16.870> some

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
so you know it's going to take some

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.480 
so you know it's going to take some
getting<00:06:17.440> used<00:06:17.470> to<00:06:17.740> especially<00:06:17.860> for<00:06:18.400> people

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
getting used to especially for people
