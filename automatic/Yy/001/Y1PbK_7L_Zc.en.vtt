00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.530
 hello everyone again vadim pioneers 

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:07.480
 and today I am ready to talk to you about 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.910
 making special malts 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.059
 in particular, today I would like to smoke 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:16.420
 the malt thing is that wolves buy 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:20.800
 bags so much more profitable not only 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:26.770
 price per kilo but including shipping so 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:30.070
 like for the gold bags and drive myself here 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:33.070
 smoke we will be so homely 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:38.050
 smokehouse and how exactly how strong she is 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:41.649
 we didn’t like me very much 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:47.739
 did not use but smoke me malt 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:59.230
 the thing inside is very similar to the usual 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:01:02.320
 a rice cooker is inserted into it such a bunker 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:05.770
 inside we have a heating element 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:09.009
 which goes through such a bowl 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:14.700
 the lid is well lost therefore 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:17.700
 close and I will foil shavings and she 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.170
 vomited with such a plank this is hikari and 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.079
 in my opinion in Russian, I transported it 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.599
 hickory never heard russia this 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:30.039
 tree 

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:37.659
 what did he look like he close first 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:42.279
 chunky behavior so our 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:49.599
 sawdust further inside is inserted here 

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:52.060
 such is the design for fish meat 

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:56.649
 inside there is such a grid 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:02:00.909
 I made from the usual grid for the pan 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:02.919
 grease trap here it costs a dollar 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:09.129
 ie fifty Russian rubles you 

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:12.280
 50 bent the edges in a circle last time 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:13.900
 when i did i just cut it out 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.400
 it was very inconvenient since malt 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:23.170
 dumped and will load in one time i could 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:33.219
 no more than 250 grams now I checked and 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:39.790
 I have 700 grams of malt that almost 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:46.260
 3 times more so well Well here 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:49.260
 I am 700 grams malt file I fall asleep 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
 captain 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:16.100
 and close it all the lid 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.780
 you can smoke in principle and at home if 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:23.239
 deeds once and if you do several 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:27.010
 messages in a row it is better to take to the streets 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:31.670
 because the smell of smoke at home will still 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:34.070
 so we will need cold only 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.900
 smoking cold is when only smoke 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:45.610
 goes about the bottom danny is heated and 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:50.620
 we expose the whole thing for 20 minutes 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:53.380
 my process started 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.560
 So what is left 1 minute before the end of 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.580
 smoking 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.780
 give you talk about the tree 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.910
 smoking what smokehouse can 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.590
 you can use smokehouse 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.650
 use absolutely any 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.890
 the only difference is that i am still up 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:12.590
 smoke in a smokehouse made from old 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.170
 Refrigerator volume inside large 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.200
 thrown kind can 4 kilograms of malt 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.780
 so instead of 20 minutes I smoked 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.530
 40 minutes, that is, twice I fell asleep chips 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:27.470
 this can be determined by the smell is ready 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.070
 your gold lines are ready even if you 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.330
 I never had smoked malt in my hands 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.539
 I do some other meats you 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:38.419
 understand the tree again too can 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:41.650
 be used absolutely any to such 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:45.090
 do you use when smoking food 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.699
 some malt and sell malt 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.150
 he is ready we are selling smoked salad 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:50.150
 on peat 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:05:01.220
 but for some reason it seems to me that such a salad 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:04.220
 will be more for viskarya 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:09.350
 than for beer 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:13.680
 since the food I would not have risked smokes on 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:16.260
 peat of smell by good then and malt i 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:20.010
 I will not smoke because of the malt we 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:25.650
 we will make a drink that is smoke from top 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:31.680
 will get us a drink worth this thing 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:36.419
 what if it's ok for you 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:39.060
 take solkokokon peat that is, this is your 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.850
 comfort zone then why not done 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:44.699
 personal matter 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:47.160
 Well, here's the principle of malt and ready left 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:50.370
 just throw it in the package to fall asleep 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.530
 the next batch and all 100 did not soak 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.560
