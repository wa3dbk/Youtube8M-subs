00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:08.210
 movie theme 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:13.190
 bird feeders we all know that birds 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:18.410
 in the garden it is a very useful living creature so 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:21.079
 say and to attract her for 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:26.679
 picking up all kinds of beetle grubs 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:31.640
 need to here trough but trough there is 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:33.440
 such as artistic and there are 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.690
 simple here I want you 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.649
 to demonstrate 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:44.300
 simple trough of waste like this 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:45.980
 you can do this feeder that's me 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.579
 when you just made cells for 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.370
 parrots and now there are these blanks 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:57.429
 there you see even here there are holes 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:04.220
 for wire and here I am with these blanks 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:07.000
 it's 10 by 10 cubes, and here they are 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:13.570
 so you can do 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:19.399
 simple but practical trough means 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:21.799
 it consists of oak sticks and dvp dvp 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:26.240
 strait lina can be painted 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:31.130
 here is such a special assessment 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:34.430
 points so as not to numb and small sides 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:38.750
 such are the grain and then 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:43.610
 such a thing where to hang it but it 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:47.360
 I had blanks and I used them 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.969
 to make you or who will want 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.280
 That's the kind of thing you can take 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:56.600
 for example, oak 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.180
 waste bars and more and less what 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:05.450
 as if not liquid and nowhere is it not 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:06.200
 goes and on planer planer 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.870
 machine tool 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.020
 cut blanks here I now put 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:16.840
 with 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.860
 diameter between saw and stop and just 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.000
 I'll cut the workpiece 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.510
 sort of for so dad manuals so you 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.510
 have seen 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:03.690
 Here are such smooth billets 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:09.180
 it turns out that you can lower it 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:11.960
 and here and if now do here again 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.960
 such a move 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.040
 but 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:46.920
 Here we get a centimeter per centimeter 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:49.870
 that is, that's it and this is possible here 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.680
 this is how you will be on blanks 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:04:00.270
 and here again show you how it is done 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:03.510
 inside this house 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:07.120
 all on self-tapping screws 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.940
 first you need to drill a tree 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:15.340
 holes then self-tapping screw and 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:20.950
 here but also screws screws are not 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:24.790
 problem now so what can their 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:28.540
 use no near screws and here 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:34.180
 It turns out I repeat this is so cool 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:35.890
 bird feeder well here on it and everything with 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.820
 you had a channel helpful tips 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:42.390
 devices for cottages and houses 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.830
