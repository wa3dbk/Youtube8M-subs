 all the guys and lesou made tim thank you 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.160
 You and all your team, this one. 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.910
 Introduction I think I'll have to 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.090
 family people 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.420
 My heart is in need of you together. 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:05.190
 today I will speak a very fast and 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.950
 basic of the control and 4 pk firmness 4 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.680
 become super adopted by most of 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.649
 Okay, people, I'll talk a little bit later. 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.960
 of her solutions you have an idea 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:18.390
 functions in one of the two functions here 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.649
 What I use for me is very shy. 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.240
 Look at the farm. 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:28.890
 Let's see now it is based so today I 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:32.400
 talk about the function of the frame pk the neutral 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:36.229
 becki newton is neutral bric I use and 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:40.049
 It's very useful to me as I would 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:42.450
 you use the function of the esc nÃ© function 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.189
 s that in that case you will leave the 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.060
 car a little bit tied up a bit 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.979
 more stuck to the ground then I go 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.950
 show you how I use it 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.960
 this function does not go here in the function 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:01.530
 he already has it already knows how 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:06.299
 It works and I come here this option O sw 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:10.970
 tsh right because I'm going to let me gal 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.970
 the neutral black you can see that the ps3 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.370
 Catch that's his job, I'll call him. 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.160
 this button that ps3 button right here 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.700
 So what do I do when I'm walking and 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.260
 I want to start the neutral neutral 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.940
 to that tied that one 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.549
 stuck to the floor of the car 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.040
 Let's carry as much and I am. 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.090
 terrible turn on and off here it 's like 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.250
 were 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.629
 function in the northwest that also does not help 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.580
 much from here 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:42.750
 So what I do here has several 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:45.420
 ps3 commercial stuff has several here right? 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.970
 ps3 is has several functions for you 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.650
 put here only portal more or less 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.370
 Are you going to change? 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:57.390
 Then there are several things that are in it. 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:01.580
 and it's an example sometimes the guy who is 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:04.920
 to program the flip of the 180 year old lighthouse 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.950
 zdc fights if you understand 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.739
 So when do you call and here? 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.829
 I'll get out of here automatically. 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.440
 function is already here, I'll call him 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:20.010
 here you are and here as normal 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.340
 turns on and flashes from the 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.040
 assume here's already known that moved to 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:32.370
 my leaving stronger or weaker I 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:34.290
 use those here DDT point two then 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.109
 automatically the time that I got here 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.609
 He's coming here to raise you or 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:41.459
 diminish understood 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:45.900
 here ov 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:50.280
 I'm going to increase or decrease the force 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:52.079
 black neutral here firmness 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.040
 then the very simple thing so much more than 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:04:02.639
 very useful for anyone who wants there is in 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:04.380
 Another thing that everybody already knows, right? 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:06.569
 I use a lot and you can see that that 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.959
 Proof will come from one side to the other 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:13.440
 The guys know mine is different because 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:15.450
 I've been beating a lot that day and it's over 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.340
 who then bent the soy to turn to 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.820
 the two equal sides have to be this way 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.340
 huh 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.590
 in case it's different here after I 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.260
 I give a regularity in the exchange rate 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.770
 in which they exercise that left two equal 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:31.410
 here the throttle force for you does not 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.870
 getting yourself killed the stage did decrease or 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.740
 increase the throttle force here and it is 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.270
 the breach 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.570
 so if these functions I use 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.530
 throttle control black UNWTO owner 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.919
 right here 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.930
 It's what I use the most then if you want 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:49.380
 take the test there 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:52.440
 it is easy to have no secret the beauty 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.530
 Pretty simple video there and I did it too. 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.560
 this model that is soccer 4 to sin but 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.580
 There are a lot of guys that have m12m control . 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.190
 11 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.160
 yesterday other controls with sure 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.289
 the newest controls have this function 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.750
 is to give a test and who has 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:12.210
 Hand make a video to teach the guys. 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.759
 control other brand the right models 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.889
 even in brazil it must have a lot of mark 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:20.490
 different to see if you have this function some 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:23.240
 thing but you do firming test 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:28.259
 so this is it guys, this is a simple thing 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:31.110
 beauty for anyone who wants to do something 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:33.630
 Fast yuba one beque elsewhere to 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.419
 me what I use most in control 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:39.060
 Actually, what I use is this and the rest. 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:41.520
 in other functions on so but the cable 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.680
 I do not change much how much it is 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.860
 I do not know how to say the right thing to you. 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:50.400
 How it works so I was forgetting 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:53.010
 There is another fall here. 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.849
 if here also post here also a use 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:06:04.080
 a lot is the function is this from here on 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:07.560
 option function that until h 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:13.020
 the espn that even in the speed that here has 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:16.110
 three modes at this right total acceleration 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:18.630
 who touched a finger on the trigger he liked 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:21.780
 of it in the trigger that already accelerates 100% everything 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:25.169
 has option 2 that goes more gradual 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:28.259
 nettheim lowe ray then there is no way 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:33.120
 term also goes from the beginning already goes to 

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:35.669
 end of the third and the beginning of the end and 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.070
 this 3 option that uses rolled mid and 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:41.130
 high so type is quite gradual that 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:43.440
 Why are the ones I can get? 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:47.610
 Can you see how I'm accelerating here? 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:50.430
 I can make my car give more 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:52.440
 grip when they access faster with this 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:55.139
 option here because when you touch your finger 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:57.960
 on the throttle here if I leave a 100% 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:59.790
 and it works all that goes there goes 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.640
 giving the grip on the speed 

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:04.980
 slowly in the car so I use a lot 

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:07.950
 from always on in that third 

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:10.110
 so here it goes gradually and right here 

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:13.140
 for you also changing his option not 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:15.330
 if it goes down and if it wants in the beginning 

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.830
 it accelerate more or less here gives to 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.770
 keep changing, too 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:22.440
 several options so this is a lot 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:28.020
 important also one for me then 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:29.790
 You have one that is 100% all o2 and the 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:32.130
 Third, I always gave the third 

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:34.470
 module that is coming gradually if I 

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.800
 I can pick up a faster speed 

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.080
 huh 

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:41.240
 out with my car with that too 

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.240
 Firmness then this is it guys 

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.460
 I hope you liked the video there. 

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.460
 together
