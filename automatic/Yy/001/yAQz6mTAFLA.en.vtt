final special thing about the AR m is
kind<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.600> weird<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.590> exactly<00:01:37.799> the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
kind of weird and this is exactly the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.789 
kind of weird and this is exactly the
stats<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.150> possesses<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:40.409> if<00:01:40.500> we<00:01:40.619> go<00:01:40.770> on

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
stats that it possesses so if we go on

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.100

m416 assault rifle but what's very

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.690 
m416 assault rifle but what's very
strange<00:02:04.110> about<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.500> gun<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.280> also

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
strange about this gun is that it also

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.240 
strange about this gun is that it also
possesses<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:06.329> low<00:02:06.540> fire<00:02:06.869> rate<00:02:06.899> as<00:02:07.500> well<00:02:07.829> so<00:02:08.129> it

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
possesses a low fire rate as well so it

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.110 
possesses a low fire rate as well so it
sits<00:02:08.459> in<00:02:08.640> about<00:02:09.000> 600<00:02:09.590> rpm<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.340> have<00:02:11.580> 2<00:02:11.730> 1

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
sits in about 600 rpm so you have 2 1

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.149 
sits in about 600 rpm so you have 2 1

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
so this supposedly special syndicate

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.280 
so this supposedly special syndicate
weapon<00:03:53.669> is<00:03:53.879> actually<00:03:54.359> the<00:03:54.480> kind<00:03:54.720> of<00:03:54.840> gun<00:03:55.049> that

you think about logically because you're

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.670

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
and more precise in turn you're going to

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.129 
and more precise in turn you're going to
get<00:04:37.699> more<00:04:37.850> head<00:04:38.060> shots<00:04:38.360> which<00:04:38.509> means<00:04:38.900> that

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
get more head shots which means that

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:40.960 
get more head shots which means that
you're<00:04:39.259> going<00:04:39.380> to<00:04:39.440> drop<00:04:39.650> players<00:04:39.979> a<00:04:40.190> much

magazine<00:05:30.289> because<00:05:30.770> of<00:05:30.889> course<00:05:31.039> that<00:05:31.340> means

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
magazine because of course that means

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.790 
magazine because of course that means
more<00:05:31.880> efficiency<00:05:32.510> and<00:05:32.690> I<00:05:33.050> have<00:05:33.260> to<00:05:33.440> reload

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
more efficiency and I have to reload

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.890 
more efficiency and I have to reload
less<00:05:34.099> but<00:05:34.669> on<00:05:34.789> the<00:05:34.880> flip<00:05:35.090> side<00:05:35.120> of<00:05:35.330> that<00:05:35.479> the

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
less but on the flip side of that the

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.110 
less but on the flip side of that the
reloading<00:05:36.590> as<00:05:36.800> well<00:05:37.099> now<00:05:37.729> surprisingly

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
reloading as well now surprisingly

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.960

enough<00:05:38.630> the<00:05:39.050> reload<00:05:39.380> time<00:05:39.530> on<00:05:40.010> the<00:05:40.250> AR<00:05:40.520> m<00:05:40.729> is

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
enough the reload time on the AR m is

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.659 
enough the reload time on the AR m is
relatively<00:05:41.630> quick<00:05:42.199> so<00:05:42.740> when<00:05:42.830> you<00:05:42.919> have<00:05:43.070> a<00:05:43.099> 51

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
relatively quick so when you have a 51

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:45.100 
relatively quick so when you have a 51
bullet<00:05:44.000> count<00:05:44.240> and<00:05:44.419> then<00:05:44.630> you<00:05:44.750> have<00:05:44.930> the

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
bullet count and then you have the

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.379 
bullet count and then you have the
opportunity<00:05:45.289> to<00:05:45.949> reload<00:05:46.760> I<00:05:47.000> fairly

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
opportunity to reload I fairly

opportunity to reload I fairly
successive<00:05:48.050> rate<00:05:48.320> you<00:05:48.889> become<00:05:49.220> some<00:05:49.550> kind<00:05:49.580> of

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
successive rate you become some kind of

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.330 
successive rate you become some kind of
machine<00:05:50.389> players<00:05:51.199> can't<00:05:51.530> stop<00:05:51.860> you<00:05:52.159> and

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
machine players can't stop you and

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.700 
machine players can't stop you and
because<00:05:52.970> they<00:05:53.120> most<00:05:53.570> likely<00:05:53.690> have<00:05:54.409> smaller

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
because they most likely have smaller

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.830 
because they most likely have smaller
magazines<00:05:55.280> than<00:05:55.490> you<00:05:55.699> do<00:05:55.909> they're<00:05:56.479> gonna<00:05:56.659> have

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
magazines than you do they're gonna have

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.080 
magazines than you do they're gonna have
to<00:05:56.960> keep<00:05:57.110> reloading<00:05:57.530> ducking<00:05:58.310> into<00:05:58.430> cover<00:05:58.729> and

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
to keep reloading ducking into cover and

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.760 
to keep reloading ducking into cover and
ultimately<00:05:59.810> because<00:06:00.259> you<00:06:00.409> possess<00:06:00.560> that

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
ultimately because you possess that

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.159 
ultimately because you possess that
longer<00:06:01.220> time<00:06:01.490> frame<00:06:01.820> of<00:06:02.090> fire<00:06:02.419> you<00:06:02.990> will

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169 
longer time frame of fire you will

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:05.050 
longer time frame of fire you will
statistically<00:06:03.380> be<00:06:04.099> more<00:06:04.310> likely<00:06:04.520> to<00:06:04.699> have<00:06:04.880> the

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
statistically be more likely to have the

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.180 
statistically be more likely to have the
drop<00:06:05.270> on<00:06:05.449> them<00:06:05.599> a<00:06:05.780> good<00:06:06.259> example<00:06:06.349> I<00:06:06.740> found<00:06:07.009> was

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
drop on them a good example I found was

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.980 
drop on them a good example I found was
when<00:06:07.280> i<00:06:07.340> was<00:06:07.460> playing<00:06:07.610> in<00:06:07.789> everglades<00:06:08.360> and<00:06:08.630> i

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
when i was playing in everglades and i

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.870 
when i was playing in everglades and i
had<00:06:09.169> players<00:06:09.500> running<00:06:09.860> at<00:06:10.039> me<00:06:10.220> from<00:06:10.460> long

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
had players running at me from long

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.170 
had players running at me from long
distances<00:06:11.599> of<00:06:11.960> very<00:06:12.620> open<00:06:13.070> space<00:06:13.490> now<00:06:14.060> they

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
distances of very open space now they

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.120 
distances of very open space now they
were<00:06:14.240> firing<00:06:14.630> at<00:06:14.930> me<00:06:14.990> but<00:06:15.320> it<00:06:15.409> eventually<00:06:15.560> had

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130 
were firing at me but it eventually had

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.610 
were firing at me but it eventually had
to<00:06:16.159> reload<00:06:16.729> and<00:06:16.970> stop<00:06:17.389> shooting<00:06:17.840> at<00:06:17.990> me<00:06:18.110> due<00:06:18.500> to

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620 
to reload and stop shooting at me due to

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.990 
to reload and stop shooting at me due to
the<00:06:18.710> lack<00:06:18.830> of<00:06:18.889> cover<00:06:19.250> and<00:06:19.370> due<00:06:19.610> to<00:06:19.639> the<00:06:19.849> fact

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 
the lack of cover and due to the fact

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.570 
the lack of cover and due to the fact
that<00:06:20.270> we<00:06:20.570> were<00:06:20.750> in<00:06:20.930> an<00:06:21.020> open<00:06:21.349> field<00:06:21.380> I<00:06:21.949> didn't

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580 
that we were in an open field I didn't

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.999 
that we were in an open field I didn't
have<00:06:22.820> to<00:06:23.030> stop<00:06:23.240> reloading<00:06:23.810> so<00:06:24.229> I<00:06:24.500> could<00:06:24.860> keep

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:25.009 
have to stop reloading so I could keep

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:27.010 
have to stop reloading so I could keep
shooting<00:06:25.460> at<00:06:25.610> them<00:06:25.789> and<00:06:26.030> take<00:06:26.509> down<00:06:26.659> a<00:06:26.720> couple

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
shooting at them and take down a couple

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.570 
shooting at them and take down a couple
of<00:06:27.169> players<00:06:27.320> and<00:06:27.440> by<00:06:27.680> the<00:06:27.740> time<00:06:27.800> I<00:06:28.009> did<00:06:28.370> have<00:06:28.550> to

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:28.580 
of players and by the time I did have to

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.180 
of players and by the time I did have to
reload<00:06:29.090> most<00:06:29.840> of<00:06:30.080> the<00:06:30.199> threat<00:06:30.500> was<00:06:30.680> cleared

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.190 
reload most of the threat was cleared

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.740 
reload most of the threat was cleared
and<00:06:31.400> that's<00:06:31.789> what<00:06:31.970> this<00:06:32.060> assault<00:06:32.389> rifle

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:32.750 
and that's what this assault rifle

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.560 
and that's what this assault rifle
possesses<00:06:33.320> it's<00:06:33.590> a<00:06:33.919> new<00:06:34.099> style<00:06:34.520> of<00:06:34.669> play<00:06:34.969> for

possesses it's a new style of play for

any kind of operator it's a no longer a

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.800 
any kind of operator it's a no longer a

case of smash and grab

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.600 
case of smash and grab
it's<00:06:39.110> a<00:06:39.200> case<00:06:39.380> of<00:06:39.410> being<00:06:39.740> more<00:06:39.980> strategical

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610 
it's a case of being more strategical

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.300 
it's a case of being more strategical
taking<00:06:41.330> more<00:06:41.510> time<00:06:41.540> and<00:06:42.110> more<00:06:42.770> specifically

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830 
being a long ranged player the last

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.770 
being a long ranged player the last
noticeable<00:06:46.460> thing<00:06:46.669> for<00:06:46.970> me<00:06:47.150> was<00:06:47.480> how<00:06:47.720> the

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:47.780 
noticeable thing for me was how the

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.350 
noticeable thing for me was how the
weapon<00:06:48.200> actually<00:06:48.680> finds<00:06:48.950> itself<00:06:49.490> nervously

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 
weapon actually finds itself nervously

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.060 
weapon actually finds itself nervously
I've<00:06:50.570> already<00:06:50.720> discussed<00:06:51.169> we<00:06:51.440> have<00:06:51.680> that<00:06:51.889> low

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:52.070 
I've already discussed we have that low

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.129 
I've already discussed we have that low
rate<00:06:52.310> of<00:06:52.430> fire<00:06:52.610> we<00:06:52.850> have<00:06:53.030> that<00:06:53.240> low<00:06:53.389> recoil<00:06:53.660> and

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:54.139 
rate of fire we have that low recoil and

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:56.530 
rate of fire we have that low recoil and
we<00:06:54.800> have<00:06:55.010> that<00:06:55.190> huge<00:06:55.490> magazine<00:06:56.090> cam<00:06:56.360> which

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:56.540 
we have that huge magazine cam which

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.030 
we have that huge magazine cam which
means<00:06:56.750> we<00:06:56.900> could<00:06:57.020> do<00:06:57.110> some<00:06:57.290> pretty<00:06:57.470> effective

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:58.040 
means we could do some pretty effective

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.310 
means we could do some pretty effective
firing<00:06:58.310> but<00:06:59.210> what<00:06:59.480> I<00:06:59.510> normally<00:06:59.660> find<00:07:00.200> with

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:00.320 
firing but what I normally find with

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.409 
firing but what I normally find with
these<00:07:00.560> kind<00:07:00.830> of<00:07:00.889> weapons<00:07:00.950> for<00:07:01.580> example<00:07:02.090> your

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:02.419 
these kind of weapons for example your

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:04.330 
these kind of weapons for example your
battle<00:07:02.750> rifles<00:07:03.139> which<00:07:03.320> have<00:07:03.500> large<00:07:03.770> magazines

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:04.340 
battle rifles which have large magazines

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.580 
battle rifles which have large magazines
is<00:07:04.580> that<00:07:05.060> they<00:07:05.150> tend<00:07:05.330> to<00:07:05.450> possess<00:07:05.780> a<00:07:05.930> very<00:07:06.260> wide

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:06.590 
is that they tend to possess a very wide

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.010 
is that they tend to possess a very wide
bullet<00:07:07.010> spread<00:07:07.220> in<00:07:07.610> fact<00:07:07.880> any<00:07:08.120> gun<00:07:08.510> which<00:07:08.810> has

a large magazine and low recoil tends to

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.450 
a large magazine and low recoil tends to

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:13.460 
have that kind of accountability in

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.620 
have that kind of accountability in
order<00:07:14.000> to<00:07:14.090> make<00:07:14.210> it<00:07:14.240> a<00:07:14.419> bit<00:07:14.600> more

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:14.630 
order to make it a bit more

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.080 
order to make it a bit more
unpredictable<00:07:15.169> and<00:07:15.710> less<00:07:16.250> of<00:07:16.490> a<00:07:16.580> laser<00:07:16.790> cannon

unpredictable and less of a laser cannon
now<00:07:17.870> the<00:07:18.200> comparator<00:07:18.680> i<00:07:18.710> like<00:07:18.950> to<00:07:19.100> make

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:19.220 
now the comparator i like to make

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.480 
now the comparator i like to make
between<00:07:19.550> the<00:07:19.639> AR<00:07:20.000> m<00:07:20.180> here<00:07:20.510> is<00:07:20.690> the<00:07:21.139> car<00:07:21.410> 556<00:07:22.310> if

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:22.490 
between the AR m here is the car 556 if

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.400 
between the AR m here is the car 556 if
you've<00:07:22.669> used<00:07:22.850> this<00:07:23.060> weapon<00:07:23.270> you<00:07:24.050> will<00:07:24.169> know

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:24.410 
you've used this weapon you will know

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.680 
you've used this weapon you will know
that<00:07:24.710> a<00:07:24.740> medium<00:07:25.280> to<00:07:25.430> long<00:07:25.610> ranges<00:07:26.090> you<00:07:26.510> can

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:26.690 
that a medium to long ranges you can

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.050 
that a medium to long ranges you can
still<00:07:26.930> fire<00:07:27.290> this<00:07:27.500> gun<00:07:27.710> a<00:07:27.979> fully<00:07:28.400> automatic

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:29.060 
still fire this gun a fully automatic

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.750 
still fire this gun a fully automatic
ray<00:07:29.510> with<00:07:30.020> no<00:07:30.229> tab<00:07:30.560> fire<00:07:30.860> and<00:07:31.160> be<00:07:31.280> deadly

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:31.760 
ray with no tab fire and be deadly

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.790 
ray with no tab fire and be deadly
efficient<00:07:32.270> and<00:07:32.450> have<00:07:32.630> very<00:07:32.990> good<00:07:33.229> accuracy

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:33.800 
efficient and have very good accuracy

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.100 
efficient and have very good accuracy
now<00:07:34.430> the<00:07:34.490> AR<00:07:34.790> m<00:07:34.970> is<00:07:35.180> the<00:07:35.330> same<00:07:35.510> principle<00:07:35.960> you

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.110 
now the AR m is the same principle you

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.030 
now the AR m is the same principle you
can<00:07:36.229> fire<00:07:36.470> this<00:07:36.650> kind<00:07:36.860> I'd<00:07:36.979> say<00:07:37.190> up<00:07:37.639> to<00:07:38.000> 300<00:07:38.479> to

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:39.040 
can fire this kind I'd say up to 300 to

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.430 
can fire this kind I'd say up to 300 to
350<00:07:40.040> meters<00:07:40.580> away<00:07:40.700> at<00:07:41.000> fully<00:07:41.600> auto<00:07:41.870> and<00:07:42.290> you'll

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:42.440 
350 meters away at fully auto and you'll

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.290 
350 meters away at fully auto and you'll
be<00:07:42.560> incredibly<00:07:43.310> efficient<00:07:43.789> and<00:07:43.940> you'll

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:44.300 
be incredibly efficient and you'll

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.480 
be incredibly efficient and you'll
probably<00:07:44.510> never<00:07:44.870> miss<00:07:45.260> so<00:07:46.039> that's<00:07:46.250> something

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:46.490 
probably never miss so that's something

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:47.890 
probably never miss so that's something
that's<00:07:46.700> very<00:07:46.820> beneficial<00:07:47.150> of<00:07:47.539> this<00:07:47.690> weapon

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:47.900 
that's very beneficial of this weapon

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.290 
that's very beneficial of this weapon
and<00:07:48.229> in<00:07:48.530> my<00:07:48.680> opinion<00:07:48.800> ultimately<00:07:49.760> makes<00:07:50.120> it

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:50.300 
and in my opinion ultimately makes it

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.029 
and in my opinion ultimately makes it
the<00:07:50.450> strongest<00:07:50.900> assault<00:07:51.289> rifle<00:07:51.650> in<00:07:51.740> the<00:07:51.830> game

00:07:52.029 --> 00:07:52.039 
the strongest assault rifle in the game

00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:53.440 
the strongest assault rifle in the game
although<00:07:52.550> these<00:07:52.700> other<00:07:52.970> ones<00:07:53.180> are<00:07:53.300> more

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:53.450 
although these other ones are more

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:55.690 
although these other ones are more
smash-and-grab<00:07:54.169> and<00:07:54.380> close<00:07:54.590> cause<00:07:54.890> I<00:07:55.160> feel<00:07:55.580> as

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:55.700 
smash-and-grab and close cause I feel as

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.880 
smash-and-grab and close cause I feel as
though<00:07:55.729> the<00:07:55.970> AR<00:07:56.300> m<00:07:56.510> has<00:07:56.780> the<00:07:56.990> tactical<00:07:57.620> prowess

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:57.890 
though the AR m has the tactical prowess

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.250 
though the AR m has the tactical prowess
that<00:07:58.340> most<00:07:58.910> of<00:07:59.090> our<00:07:59.240> assault<00:07:59.479> rifles<00:07:59.900> don't

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:00.260 
that most of our assault rifles don't

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.890 
that most of our assault rifles don't
have<00:08:00.530> and<00:08:00.890> probably<00:08:01.190> won't<00:08:01.520> ever<00:08:01.700> have<00:08:02.030> so

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:02.900
