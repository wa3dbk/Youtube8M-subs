ultimate team in a pretty much good way

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.580 
ultimate team in a pretty much good way
because<00:03:22.850> we<00:03:23.180> can<00:03:23.330> take<00:03:23.510> advantage<00:03:23.690> of<00:03:24.200> it<00:03:24.350> now

because we can take advantage of it now
there's<00:03:25.160> another<00:03:25.340> thing<00:03:25.940> we<00:03:26.090> also<00:03:26.239> have<00:03:26.510> to

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
there's another thing we also have to

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.350 
there's another thing we also have to
talk<00:03:26.810> about<00:03:26.840> and<00:03:27.230> that's<00:03:27.320> predicting<00:03:28.130> if<00:03:29.120> a

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
talk about and that's predicting if a

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.580 
talk about and that's predicting if a
player<00:03:29.600> is<00:03:29.630> going<00:03:29.840> to<00:03:29.930> be<00:03:30.050> in<00:03:30.140> the<00:03:30.230> team<00:03:30.410> of<00:03:30.530> the

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
player is going to be in the team of the

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.930 
player is going to be in the team of the
season<00:03:30.830> or<00:03:30.920> team<00:03:31.070> of<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.190> year<00:03:31.220> obviously<00:03:31.910> I

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
season or team of the year obviously I

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.000 
season or team of the year obviously I
predicted<00:03:32.510> that<00:03:32.660> Chiellini<00:03:33.110> was<00:03:33.350> not<00:03:33.650> going

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
predicted that Chiellini was not going

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.040 
predicted that Chiellini was not going
to<00:03:34.160> be<00:03:34.280> in<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.520> team<00:03:34.700> of<00:03:34.850> the<00:03:34.940> season<00:03:35.720> City<00:03:35.930> out

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
to be in the team of the season City out

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.490 
to be in the team of the season City out
team<00:03:36.230> of<00:03:36.320> the<00:03:36.380> season<00:03:36.709> and<00:03:36.910> indeed<00:03:37.910> he<00:03:38.090> was<00:03:38.120> not

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
team of the season and indeed he was not

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.440 
team of the season and indeed he was not
so<00:03:39.500> his<00:03:39.650> price<00:03:39.980> went<00:03:40.310> up<00:03:40.370> only<00:03:40.820> about<00:03:41.030> thirty

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
so his price went up only about thirty

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.440 
so his price went up only about thirty
thousand<00:03:42.020> coins<00:03:42.170> guys<00:03:42.470> not<00:03:42.980> too<00:03:43.430> much<00:03:43.820> maybe<00:03:44.360> a

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
thousand coins guys not too much maybe a

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.570 
thousand coins guys not too much maybe a
little<00:03:44.750> bit<00:03:44.959> more<00:03:45.170> I<00:03:45.380> thought<00:03:45.920> he<00:03:46.040> would<00:03:46.190> go<00:03:46.430> up

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580

little bit more I thought he would go up
a<00:03:46.730> little<00:03:46.910> bit<00:03:47.120> more<00:03:47.270> than<00:03:47.480> that<00:03:47.630> but<00:03:47.989> I<00:03:48.230> know<00:03:48.650> a

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
a little bit more than that but I know a

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.350 
a little bit more than that but I know a
