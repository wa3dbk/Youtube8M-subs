00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
made up of natural enzymes that simply

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.439 
made up of natural enzymes that simply
kill<00:03:02.219> the<00:03:02.340> yeast<00:03:02.519> and<00:03:02.819> it<00:03:02.849> works<00:03:03.060> really

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:03.449 
kill the yeast and it works really

really<00:03:03.689> well<00:03:04.169> from<00:03:04.530> al-azizia<00:03:05.040> these<00:03:05.939> natural

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
really well from al-azizia these natural

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.390 
really well from al-azizia these natural
enzymes<00:03:06.719> like<00:03:06.840> I<00:03:07.079> said<00:03:07.319> kill<00:03:07.590> both<00:03:07.799> yeast<00:03:08.129> and

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
enzymes like I said kill both yeast and

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.459 
enzymes like I said kill both yeast and
bacteria<00:03:08.909> so<00:03:09.569> what<00:03:09.719> you<00:03:09.840> do<00:03:09.959> is<00:03:10.079> you<00:03:10.169> take<00:03:10.290> your

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:10.469 
bacteria so what you do is you take your

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:12.619 
bacteria so what you do is you take your
dog<00:03:10.680> and<00:03:10.889> use<00:03:11.099> them<00:03:11.280> these<00:03:11.639> I<00:03:11.849> mock<00:03:12.120> shampoo

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.740 
dog and use them these I mock shampoo
and<00:03:12.810> wash<00:03:13.019> them<00:03:13.259> and<00:03:13.290> put<00:03:14.060> stem<00:03:15.060> particular<00:03:15.389> to

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
and wash them and put stem particular to

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.059 
and wash them and put stem particular to
put<00:03:15.959> put<00:03:16.169> excuse<00:03:16.650> me<00:03:16.769> put<00:03:16.949> particular

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
put put excuse me put particular

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.039 
put put excuse me put particular
attention<00:03:17.909> on<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.389> areas<00:03:18.750> that<00:03:18.840> have<00:03:19.019> the

malassezia rinse them and then there's a

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.960 
malassezia rinse them and then there's a
trick<00:03:22.229> with<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.650> cream<00:03:22.859> once<00:03:23.069> you<00:03:23.639> put<00:03:23.849> the
