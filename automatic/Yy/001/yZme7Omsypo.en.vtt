to the light up and down the street so

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.670 
to the light up and down the street so
there<00:01:30.329> aren't<00:01:30.509> dark<00:01:30.810> places<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.500> light

places<00:01:32.159> along<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.490> street<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.090> think<00:01:33.600> that

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
places along the street I think that

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.780 
places along the street I think that
contributes<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.619> sense<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.100> safety<00:01:35.369> in

contributes to the sense of safety in

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.380 
contributes to the sense of safety in
the<00:01:36.060> area<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.509> that's<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:37.189> very<00:01:38.189> particular

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
the area and that's a very particular

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.550 
the area and that's a very particular
characteristic<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.659> LED<00:01:39.990> lights<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.470> we

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
characteristic of the LED lights that we

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.740 
characteristic of the LED lights that we
use<00:01:40.770> we're<00:01:41.310> also<00:01:41.490> saving<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.150> fair<00:01:42.450> amount<00:01:42.540> of

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
use we're also saving a fair amount of

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.350 
use we're also saving a fair amount of
money<00:01:42.990> in<00:01:43.340> energy<00:01:44.340> doing<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.119> was<00:01:45.329> a

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
money in energy doing this this was a

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.179 
money in energy doing this this was a
demonstration<00:01:45.750> project<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:46.799> it's<00:01:46.950> being

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
demonstration project so it's being

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.980 
demonstration project so it's being
metered<00:01:47.579> separately<00:01:48.210> from<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.479> rest<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.869> the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
city street light program and so we're

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.139 
city street light program and so we're
able<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.899> monitor<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.040> energy<00:01:53.430> uses<00:01:53.850> on<00:01:54.030> the

but<00:02:02.280> we're<00:02:03.149> estimating<00:02:03.540> probably<00:02:04.320> forty<00:02:04.590> or

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
but we're estimating probably forty or

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.350 
but we're estimating probably forty or
fifty<00:02:04.860> percent<00:02:05.340> at<00:02:05.520> least<00:02:05.790> savings<00:02:06.570> in<00:02:06.869> energy

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
fifty percent at least savings in energy

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.650 
fifty percent at least savings in energy

over our traditional street light
pattern<00:02:10.660> and<00:02:10.840> also<00:02:11.200> there's<00:02:11.410> a<00:02:11.470> we<00:02:12.340> are

pattern and also there's a we are

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.760 
pattern and also there's a we are
anticipating<00:02:12.850> a<00:02:13.390> fairly<00:02:13.750> large<00:02:13.960> savings<00:02:14.380> and

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
anticipating a fairly large savings and

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.830 
anticipating a fairly large savings and
maintenance<00:02:15.160> as<00:02:15.340> well<00:02:15.580> as<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:16.330> lifetime<00:02:16.810> of

these fixtures maybe 12 15 20 years with
very<00:02:20.590> little<00:02:20.830> maintenance<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:21.580> very<00:02:21.760> little

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
very little maintenance and very little

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.760 
very little maintenance and very little

into<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.100> poles<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:25.030> new<00:02:25.210> LED<00:02:25.660> lights<00:02:25.870> also

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
into the poles the new LED lights also

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.050 
into the poles the new LED lights also
make<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:26.650> easier<00:02:27.010> for<00:02:27.250> students<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:27.880> other

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
make it easier for students and other

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.110 
make it easier for students and other
pedestrians<00:02:28.270> to<00:02:28.810> see<00:02:29.110> each<00:02:29.260> other<00:02:30.000> what<00:02:31.000> I'm

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
pedestrians to see each other what I'm

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.270 
pedestrians to see each other what I'm
seeing<00:02:31.660> here<00:02:31.690> is<00:02:32.020> that<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.620> streets<00:02:32.980> are

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
seeing here is that the streets are

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.480 
seeing here is that the streets are
lighted<00:02:34.209> well<00:02:34.420> as<00:02:35.170> well<00:02:35.560> as<00:02:35.740> the<00:02:35.920> pedestrian

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
lighted well as well as the pedestrian

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.220 
lighted well as well as the pedestrian
areas<00:02:36.850> you<00:02:37.690> get<00:02:37.870> very<00:02:38.170> good<00:02:38.380> verticals<00:02:38.890> on<00:02:39.130> the

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
areas you get very good verticals on the

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.420 
areas you get very good verticals on the
folks<00:02:41.230> as<00:02:41.440> they<00:02:41.470> walk<00:02:41.830> up<00:02:42.040> and<00:02:42.160> down<00:02:42.220> the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
folks as they walk up and down the

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.120 
folks as they walk up and down the
sidewalk<00:02:42.750> that's<00:02:43.750> good<00:02:43.990> for<00:02:44.130> facial

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
sidewalk that's good for facial

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.690 
sidewalk that's good for facial
recognition<00:02:45.280> good<00:02:46.239> for<00:02:46.480> safety<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.020> security

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
recognition good for safety and security

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.050 
recognition good for safety and security
makes<00:02:48.700> for<00:02:48.910> a<00:02:48.940> nice<00:02:49.120> environment<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:51.760> as<00:02:51.910> I

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
makes for a nice environment so as I

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.540 
makes for a nice environment so as I
walk<00:02:52.270> up<00:02:52.300> the<00:02:52.600> sidewalk<00:02:53.110> you<00:02:53.380> see<00:02:53.650> that<00:02:53.950> my

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
walk up the sidewalk you see that my

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.710 
walk up the sidewalk you see that my
entire<00:02:54.910> vertical<00:02:55.420> surface<00:02:56.380> here<00:02:57.000> from<00:02:58.000> my

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
entire vertical surface here from my

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.229 
entire vertical surface here from my
head<00:02:58.959> to<00:02:58.989> my<00:02:59.200> toe<00:02:59.380> is<00:02:59.800> illuminated<00:03:00.430> and<00:03:00.580> you

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
head to my toe is illuminated and you

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.810 
head to my toe is illuminated and you
can<00:03:01.420> see<00:03:01.660> and<00:03:01.870> recognize<00:03:02.050> me<00:03:02.709> from<00:03:02.890> a<00:03:03.400> distance

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
can see and recognize me from a distance

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.540 
can see and recognize me from a distance
so<00:03:04.540> that's<00:03:05.230> what<00:03:05.530> I<00:03:05.560> mean<00:03:05.830> when<00:03:06.010> I<00:03:06.040> say<00:03:06.310> good

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
so that's what I mean when I say good

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.479 
so that's what I mean when I say good
verticals<00:03:07.080> well<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.290> safety<00:03:09.160> and<00:03:09.250> security

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
verticals well the safety and security

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.640 
verticals well the safety and security
aspect<00:03:10.120> of<00:03:10.270> that<00:03:10.390> is<00:03:10.570> very<00:03:10.840> important<00:03:11.410> in<00:03:11.530> our

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
aspect of that is very important in our

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.910 
aspect of that is very important in our
industry<00:03:12.070> standards<00:03:12.760> from<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.390> IES<00:03:13.840> we<00:03:14.739> know

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
industry standards from the IES we know

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.070 
industry standards from the IES we know
that<00:03:15.160> for<00:03:15.370> good<00:03:15.549> safety<00:03:16.090> facial<00:03:16.870> recognition

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
that for good safety facial recognition

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.759 
that for good safety facial recognition
at<00:03:17.680> about<00:03:17.920> 30<00:03:18.250> feet<00:03:18.489> is<00:03:18.700> very<00:03:19.000> important<00:03:19.570> so<00:03:20.290> if

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
at about 30 feet is very important so if

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.009 
at about 30 feet is very important so if
we<00:03:21.100> have<00:03:21.400> good<00:03:21.790> vertical<00:03:22.030> foot<00:03:22.450> candles<00:03:22.900> that

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
we have good vertical foot candles that

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.130 
we have good vertical foot candles that
means<00:03:23.440> that<00:03:24.130> facial<00:03:24.700> recognition<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:25.690> the

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
means that facial recognition and the

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.199 
means that facial recognition and the
ability<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:26.769> identify<00:03:26.980> a<00:03:27.310> person<00:03:27.700> and<00:03:28.030> so

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
ability to identify a person and so

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.770 
ability to identify a person and so
forth<00:03:28.510> at<00:03:29.380> a<00:03:29.860> certain<00:03:30.340> distance<00:03:30.780> that

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
forth at a certain distance that

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.729 
forth at a certain distance that
actually<00:03:32.590> reduces<00:03:33.370> crime<00:03:34.180> it<00:03:35.170> reduces

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
actually reduces crime it reduces

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.000 
actually reduces crime it reduces
vandalism<00:03:36.549> it<00:03:36.760> reduces<00:03:37.299> a<00:03:37.360> tax<00:03:37.720> and<00:03:38.049> so<00:03:38.709> forth

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
vandalism it reduces a tax and so forth

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.780 
vandalism it reduces a tax and so forth
so<00:03:39.280> that's<00:03:39.970> why<00:03:40.180> it's<00:03:40.360> important
