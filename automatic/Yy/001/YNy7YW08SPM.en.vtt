00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:55.229 
first first two rounds but pretty much

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:57.140 
first first two rounds but pretty much
after<00:00:55.589> that<00:00:55.619> it<00:00:55.860> was<00:00:55.920> all<00:00:56.129> lomachenko<00:00:56.580> he<00:00:57.030> was

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
after that it was all lomachenko he was

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.729 
after that it was all lomachenko he was
active<00:00:57.659> was<00:00:57.869> landing<00:00:58.170> some<00:00:58.290> punches<00:00:58.589> to<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
active was landing some punches to the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.920 
active was landing some punches to the
body<00:00:58.830> he<00:00:59.729> was<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.909> landing<00:01:00.420> some<00:01:00.570> punches<00:01:00.839> to

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
body he was a landing some punches to

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.990 
body he was a landing some punches to
the<00:01:00.960> face<00:01:01.049> of<00:01:01.400> Rodriguez<00:01:02.400> three<00:01:02.580> times<00:01:02.820> where

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
the face of Rodriguez three times where

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.870 
the face of Rodriguez three times where
he<00:01:03.089> had<00:01:03.180> some<00:01:03.470> padding<00:01:04.470> like<00:01:04.920> padding<00:01:05.400> punches

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
he had some padding like padding punches

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.280 
he had some padding like padding punches
like<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.180> wasn't<00:01:06.450> really<00:01:06.570> throwing<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.170> much

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
like it wasn't really throwing that much

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.350 
like it wasn't really throwing that much
power<00:01:07.530> into<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.189> think<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.030> still<00:01:09.240> that

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
power into it I think it is still that

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.550 
power into it I think it is still that
go<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.810> little<00:01:10.020> bit<00:01:10.080> more<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.290> think<00:01:10.500> he

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
go of that a little bit more I think he

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.310 
go of that a little bit more I think he
needs<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.799> really<00:01:11.270> talk<00:01:12.270> more<00:01:12.630> power<00:01:12.900> punches

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
needs to really talk more power punches

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.410 
needs to really talk more power punches
instead<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.710> those<00:01:13.890> weak<00:01:14.370> punches<00:01:14.790> just<00:01:15.270> to

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
instead of those weak punches just to

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.090 
instead of those weak punches just to
like<00:01:15.870> land<00:01:16.170> something<00:01:16.440> or<00:01:16.710> something<00:01:16.950> like

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
like land something or something like

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.710 
like land something or something like
that<00:01:17.160> or<00:01:17.280> just<00:01:17.370> to<00:01:17.640> look<00:01:17.910> like<00:01:18.120> he's<00:01:18.270> bc

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
that or just to look like he's bc

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.010 
that or just to look like he's bc
because<00:01:19.410> I<00:01:19.850> like<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.300> that's<00:01:21.600> something<00:01:21.810> you

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
because I like that that's something you

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.540 
because I like that that's something you
can<00:01:22.170> do<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.410> the<00:01:22.500> amateurs<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.190> the<00:01:23.250> pros

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
can do in the amateurs but in the pros

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.480 
can do in the amateurs but in the pros
it's<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.390> little<00:01:24.510> risky<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:25.020> do<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:26.100> it

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
it's a little risky to do that and it

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.010 
it's a little risky to do that and it
kind<00:01:26.730> of<00:01:26.790> opens<00:01:27.030> yourself<00:01:27.360> up<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:27.900> if

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
kind of opens yourself up and then if

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.690 
kind of opens yourself up and then if
you<00:01:28.110> fight<00:01:28.290> someone<00:01:28.650> more<00:01:28.950> experienced<00:01:29.490> down

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
you fight someone more experienced down

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.520 
you fight someone more experienced down
the<00:01:29.760> line<00:01:30.060> or<00:01:30.510> someone<00:01:30.900> only<00:01:31.110> on<00:01:31.230> one<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.470> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the line or someone only on one of the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.690 
the line or someone only on one of the
top<00:01:31.620> fighters<00:01:31.950> out<00:01:32.070> there<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.310> think<00:01:32.550> that

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
top fighters out there I think that

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.030 
top fighters out there I think that
would<00:01:32.940> be<00:01:33.120> a<00:01:33.330> wrong<00:01:34.140> thing<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.440> do<00:01:34.680> against

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
would be a wrong thing to do against

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.470 
would be a wrong thing to do against
maybe<00:01:35.190> like<00:01:35.400> someone<00:01:35.700> i<00:01:35.730> guess<00:01:35.880> like<00:01:35.909> Nicholas

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.480 
maybe like someone i guess like Nicholas

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.230 
maybe like someone i guess like Nicholas
Walters<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:36.960> something<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.700> but<00:01:38.700> overall<00:01:39.000> it

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
Walters is something that but overall it

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.460 
Walters is something that but overall it
was<00:01:39.330> still<00:01:39.540> very<00:01:39.570> good<00:01:39.900> performance<00:01:40.080> but

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
was still very good performance but

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.430 
was still very good performance but

and<00:03:07.440> I<00:03:07.530> don't<00:03:07.769> know<00:03:07.829> if<00:03:07.980> he<00:03:08.069> was<00:03:08.190> playing

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
and I don't know if he was playing

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.309 
and I don't know if he was playing
around<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:09.120> know<00:03:09.209> this<00:03:09.390> pretending<00:03:09.989> that<00:03:10.170> he

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
around you know this pretending that he

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.619 
around you know this pretending that he
didn't<00:03:10.560> know<00:03:10.950> that<00:03:11.190> was<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:11.370> tent<00:03:11.640> count<00:03:11.879> but<00:03:12.150> he

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
didn't know that was a tent count but he

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:13.759 
didn't know that was a tent count but he
was<00:03:12.750> really<00:03:12.959> hurt<00:03:13.200> and<00:03:13.410> he<00:03:13.500> was<00:03:13.620> really

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
was really hurt and he was really

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.819 
was really hurt and he was really
getting<00:03:14.069> beaten<00:03:14.370> up<00:03:14.610> so<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:15.290> think<00:03:16.290> he<00:03:16.410> knew

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
getting beaten up so I think he knew

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:17.960 
getting beaten up so I think he knew
that<00:03:17.010> he<00:03:17.069> was<00:03:17.160> going<00:03:17.280> to<00:03:17.340> lose<00:03:17.519> this<00:03:17.670> fight<00:03:17.910> I

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
that he was going to lose this fight I

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.699 
that he was going to lose this fight I
mean<00:03:18.269> I<00:03:18.360> expected<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:18.930> little<00:03:19.170> bit<00:03:19.260> more<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.500> be

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
mean I expected a little bit more to be

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.009
