zomboid<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.549> remember<00:01:53.850> these<00:01:53.939> two<00:01:54.119> are<00:01:54.210> going

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
zomboid so remember these two are going

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.910 
zomboid so remember these two are going
head-to-head<00:01:54.600> in<00:01:54.840> whichever<00:01:55.140> wins<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.710> going

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
to continue project zomboid was 1739 so

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.749 
to continue project zomboid was 1739 so
you<00:02:03.990> would<00:02:04.200> think<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.590> crowns<00:02:05.040> project

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
you would think that crowns project

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.389 
you would think that crowns project
zomboid<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.540> winner<00:02:06.780> however<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:08.129> know

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
zomboid the winner however I you know

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.460 
zomboid the winner however I you know
personally<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.119> expected<00:02:09.720> there<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.869> be<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.050> huge

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
personally I expected there to be a huge

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.680 
personally I expected there to be a huge
discrepancy<00:02:11.310> like<00:02:11.670> they're<00:02:12.120> being<00:02:12.300> like<00:02:12.450> okay

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690

you<00:02:12.750> guys<00:02:12.989> just

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
you guys just

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.130 
you guys just
loved<00:02:14.040> one<00:02:14.720> series<00:02:15.720> versus<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.020> other

loved one series versus the other

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.800 
loved one series versus the other
because<00:02:16.470> it's<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:16.980> close<00:02:17.250> it's<00:02:17.820> I<00:02:18.510> mean<00:02:18.780> it's

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
because it's so close it's I mean it's

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.610 
because it's so close it's I mean it's
less<00:02:19.200> than<00:02:19.470> 200<00:02:20.400> points<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.200> add<00:02:22.200> this

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
less than 200 points and add this

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.930 
less than 200 points and add this
