 hello waiters and girls in the second video 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.660
 of cuts we are going to show you the cut in 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:14.480
 juliana we will do it with an onion 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.520
 carrot and a dog for you to compare 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.869
 with those of the previous video and also 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.730
 because it is what we had at the level of 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.680
 gas 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:25.740
 let's start with the onion 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.710
 we cut from the root to the tip 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.349
 as always we look at where it is 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.619
 the knot to start cutting from the 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.619
 other side 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:42.250
 the objective in this case that is 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.250
 get some small strips 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.550
 Y 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.440
 now with the carrot we start 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.420
 making a base or fitting the one that 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.380
 call to stay firm in the 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.430
 table 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:04.080
 we cut it in half more or less 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.080
 and we started looking at her 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:13.520
 at this point it is better to knock down the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.520
 make it easier to avoid short cuts 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.780
 once we have the plates 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.780
 we started making the strips 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:35.620
 finally we take the rope white 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.620
 we split several pieces 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.120
 we cut in half 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.880
 and now we start making the strips 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.100
 this easier than the carrot 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.229
 the julienne cut is used mainly 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:11.480
 for salads sauteed trimmings and 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.849
 for the well-known Julienne soup also 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.370
 can use in sauces and nothing until 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.989
 here our second video cuts 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.830
 We hope you find it useful and even 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.830
 our next video
