00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.420 
like I was faster than him but uh you
know<00:02:44.230> there<00:02:44.500> was<00:02:44.620> it<00:02:44.890> was<00:02:44.980> hard<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.220> make<00:02:45.400> a

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
know there was it was hard to make a

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.890 
know there was it was hard to make a
pass<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.879> tracks<00:02:46.120> really<00:02:46.390> high<00:02:46.510> speed<00:02:46.870> a

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
pass the tracks really high speed a

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.849 
pass the tracks really high speed a
little<00:02:47.230> bit<00:02:47.349> one<00:02:47.620> line<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:48.159> slippery<00:02:48.549> so<00:02:49.859> you

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859 
little bit one line and slippery so you

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.130 
little bit one line and slippery so you
know<00:02:50.950> I<00:02:50.980> made<00:02:51.250> a<00:02:51.280> couple<00:02:51.459> attempts<00:02:52.060> he<00:02:52.840> chopped

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
know I made a couple attempts he chopped

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.539 
know I made a couple attempts he chopped
me<00:02:53.319> off<00:02:53.470> a<00:02:53.500> couple<00:02:53.709> bad<00:02:54.010> a<00:02:54.040> couple<00:02:54.459> times

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
me off a couple bad a couple times

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.670 
me off a couple bad a couple times
pretty<00:02:54.879> bad<00:02:55.060> so<00:02:55.450> I<00:02:55.480> lost<00:02:55.840> ground<00:02:56.109> I'd<00:02:56.470> have<00:02:56.590> to

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
pretty bad so I lost ground I'd have to

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:09.860 
pretty bad so I lost ground I'd have to
make<00:02:56.739> it<00:02:56.980> back<00:02:57.129> up

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.860 

and<00:03:10.230> then<00:03:11.099> finally<00:03:11.400> you<00:03:11.849> know<00:03:12.209> probably

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
and then finally you know probably

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.479 
and then finally you know probably
halfway<00:03:13.230> just<00:03:13.470> past<00:03:13.830> halfway<00:03:14.069> through<00:03:14.400> the

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
halfway just past halfway through the

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.820 
halfway just past halfway through the
race<00:03:14.640> I<00:03:14.970> got<00:03:15.569> up<00:03:15.659> to<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.870> inside<00:03:16.200> of<00:03:16.230> them<00:03:16.500> you

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
race I got up to the inside of them you

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.199 
race I got up to the inside of them you
know<00:03:16.920> did<00:03:17.159> a<00:03:17.190> block<00:03:17.400> cast<00:03:17.640> we<00:03:17.819> kind<00:03:18.030> of<00:03:18.090> made

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
know did a block cast we kind of made

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.600 
know did a block cast we kind of made
some<00:03:18.360> contact<00:03:18.900> but<00:03:19.200> yeah<00:03:19.980> I<00:03:20.010> got<00:03:20.250> away<00:03:20.340> clean

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
some contact but yeah I got away clean

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.520 
some contact but yeah I got away clean
and<00:03:21.000> was<00:03:21.540> able<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:21.840> kind<00:03:22.080> of<00:03:22.200> pull<00:03:22.379> out<00:03:22.500> a

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
and was able to kind of pull out a

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.470 
and was able to kind of pull out a
little<00:03:22.799> gap<00:03:22.980> and<00:03:23.819> then<00:03:23.909> I<00:03:24.030> just<00:03:24.239> kind<00:03:24.390> of

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
little gap and then I just kind of

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.660 
little gap and then I just kind of
carried<00:03:24.780> that<00:03:24.870> momentum<00:03:25.019> and<00:03:25.500> got<00:03:26.400> up<00:03:26.519> on<00:03:26.640> the

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
carried that momentum and got up on the

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.039 
carried that momentum and got up on the
inside<00:03:27.060> of<00:03:27.090> them<00:03:27.269> and<00:03:27.299> put<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.599> pass<00:03:27.750> on<00:03:27.959> him

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
inside of them and put the pass on him

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.869 
inside of them and put the pass on him
too<00:03:28.230> so<00:03:28.470> we<00:03:28.680> were<00:03:28.799> running<00:03:28.950> 1<00:03:29.190> &amp;<00:03:29.340> 2<00:03:29.370> again<00:03:29.670> and
