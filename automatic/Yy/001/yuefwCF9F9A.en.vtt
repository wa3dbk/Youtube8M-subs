00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.519
 friends that you travel to and want 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.929
 show you something really curious 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.260
 that from next week will be in 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.960
 3 store sales will be available 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.960
 in the shops of the three then the formulas with 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.920
 which will be proposed are still from 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.289
 to discover 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.380
 I tell you about an object that bears the name 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:32.550
 of pocket cube and what it is is in practice 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.960
 a cross between the cube of three and one 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.690
 but the files a very comfortable situation to 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.440
 use thinking that this object 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.140
 in practice it connects to the network 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:49.500
 electric and therefore this base that you 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.250
 see is in practice what constitutes 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.190
 let's say the charging base and more 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.010
 also the amplification of the wifi signal 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.390
 for this instead that it is a true e 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.470
 just pocket wifi shows up quickly 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.280
 also some of the features 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.540
 this is an object that huawei has 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.490
 made just on expressive 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.909
 request for 3 see there is a microsim 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.970
 inside a 1000 500 battery 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:24.450
 milliampere this is the classic aspect 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:28.290
 of wifi and the important thing is that a 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.110
 product 4g then lt and then gives you the 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.470
 possibility to exploit the band more 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.630
 fast which is 3 proposes in many cities 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.430
 d'italia is an operator lock object 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.250
 so you can use it only and 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.250
 exclusively with sims of three 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.920
 when you are outside you can bring 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.899
 around your router and have up to 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.390
 four hours of continuous navigation 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.460
 and thanks to the battery we said of 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.810
 1,500 milian for and when you are 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.070
 Inside the house 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.990
 support the pocket wifi simply 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.060
 on its base and at that point not only 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.399
 it will recharge but the wifi signal will have 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.179
 also an amplification thanks to 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.539
 base that there is a product behind 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.099
 I think a lot 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.340
 interesting especially now that the 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:17.500
 4g network develops quickly from the 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.489
 next week will be available in 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.489
 3 stores
