was<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.960> be<00:00:40.079> done<00:00:40.410> because<00:00:40.590> it's<00:00:40.829> obviously

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
was to be done because it's obviously

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.180

the<00:00:41.340> most<00:00:41.550> deck<00:00:42.090> plane<00:00:42.300> in<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.540> format<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.530> if

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
the most deck plane in the format so if

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.950 
the most deck plane in the format so if
you<00:00:44.370> play<00:00:44.610> first<00:00:44.850> like<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.600> mana

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
acceleration so you have arbor elf and

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.840 
acceleration so you have arbor elf and
lanois<00:00:49.050> rail<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.649> nice<00:00:49.890> one<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.460> you're

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
central groves so you can just fetch

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.270 
central groves so you can just fetch
some<00:03:40.970> I<00:03:41.210> think<00:03:41.690> like<00:03:42.230> one<00:03:42.500> more<00:03:42.650> illness<00:03:43.070> and

some I think like one more illness and

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.330 
some I think like one more illness and
maybe<00:03:43.400> one<00:03:43.670> end<00:03:43.850> one<00:03:44.030> would<00:03:44.210> be<00:03:44.330> nice
