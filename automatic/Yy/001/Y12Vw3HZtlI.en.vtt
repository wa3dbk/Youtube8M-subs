00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:23.560
 south to the crysis 3 eroticism as 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.360
 his name indicated enough enough following 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.619
 crysis 2 which itself was the result of 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.710
 crysis then we obviously find 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.210
 the universe of the fps crytek ie 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.340
 we always control a super soldier 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.210
 in a super magical armor that gives 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.390
 super powers 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.739
 there they have a little wanted to mix 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.510
 the atmosphere of 1 and 2 you get 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.790
 found in new york but new york invaded 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.579
 by the forest so it's not necessarily 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.850
 super successful we will talk about it later 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.230
 so that's classic fps 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:55.839
 modern big show 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:57.760
 all we like at 10.3 is a small 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:58.899
 little the end of a trilogy even if we 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.539
 imagine they're going to lay a 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:04.030
 crisis 4 and 5 and 6 and 7 may point of view 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:06.010
 story we're really an end point 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.900
 what we started in 2007 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.090
 so that allows us to discover a 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.640
 little bit the consequences the aftermath of 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.229
 everything that has happened since then and 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.780
 it must be said that it is not very 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.750
 interesting then it's a problem that 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.950
 double-sided already because x true that 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.510
 the story is still pretty bad 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:28.570
 it's messy without really being 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:30.460
 interesting it's unnecessarily complex 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.290
 Anyway, it's really not a 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.720
 scenario that you this coach is waiting for seats 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.940
 the characters are not at all 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.040
 nice but we do not care a little 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.570
 little of what happens to them and we do not care 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.920
 a little bit of their moods and 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.010
 especially the narration is really 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.730
 really naze it's distributed anywhere 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.960
 how 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:51.190
 the ridiculous tirades of the soldier the type 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.290
 who tells us ah I will kill the 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.340
 bad guys but we just killed 250 of them 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.530
 see what difference it makes 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.360
 Anyway, it's really at the point of 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.320
 narrative scenario view so I know that 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.960
 it's not necessarily what we're looking for 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.180
 first of all in a fps but when or 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.400
 age is so much to the face even though he 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.360
 is possible to appetite but I advise 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.880
 to everyone to do it so much to 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.100
 at ease but when we are thrown 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.660
 narration so much to the face that we 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.480
 is constantly taking it down when 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.130
 even sad to have a script and a 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.130
 distribution of the scenario as bad 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.390
 like crysis 3 is an fps we have 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.920
 obviously spend our time at 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.440
 strafe a whole lot of guys that we 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.140
 have done nothing in the absolute then point 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.739
 mechanical view we really find there 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.709
 down the dough 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.569
 crysis 1 the weapons are very fun to 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.610
 use then we still regret that 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.080
 as usual in betray them he 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.280
 need a little bit of bastos for 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.540
 knock down the enemies that does not want 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.760
 to say that they are too hard it's just 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.930
 that sometimes we stick three discharges of 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.030
 shotgun in a guy and he gets up 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.950
 again and it's a little bit stupid on 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.080
 obviously also finds everything 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.900
 super combination packaging around the 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.910
 fps gameplay so we can be invisible 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.530
 we can become more solid we can 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.880
 jump super heroes on to the super strong 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.930
 all this and it's a little bit a 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.120
 problem because the enemies are 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.380
 so stupid that if we were just 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.110
 basic soldier already he would have trouble 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.489
 but there since we are in addition a soldier 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.440
 so the invisible ones and well we can say 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.989
 that they galera serious it arrange super 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.519
 easy and as situations are not 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.890
 varied at all that's really a 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.660
 health walk on Toulon 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.890
 to say we come we are invisible we stumble 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.959
 everyone with the bow that is very 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.459
 funny in itself but hey it's still 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.530
 a bit boring by being superman 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.230
 so here is a gameplay that is 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.690
 solid but poorly exploited because not 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.859
 enough variety not enough of 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.620
 renewal but at the same time 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:39.420
 it was not easy to renew oneself on 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:42.120
 a game that lasts four hours reputation 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.160
 of the crysis series obviously before 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.230
 everything and maybe even wrong of his 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.170
 graphical part that it came out in 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.310
 2007 on pc that it had exploded 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.410
 all the chipset of the world 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.319
 so obviously crysis 3 had to 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.579
 to be supra handsome also on pc is 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.500
 undeniably the cun the game is 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:01.120
 really super beautiful 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.000
 technologically there are still some stuff 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.680
 who chafouines us ie he is 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.940
 less interactive with its decorations than 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.680
 could be the first crysis 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.720
 there is a little less destroy things 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.940
 move and stuff etc 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.500
 but overall it's still great 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.239
 super nice on the other hand it's really 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.549
 very very greedy on pc info really 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.010
 a very big machine enjoy it in 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.600
 mega ultra hand on console that 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.000
 remains a game that is beautiful obviously good 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.770
 it's very far from the pc it's still a game 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.410
 which is beautiful by cons there is still 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.600
 small worries worries textures 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.610
 on xbox before and pixelated on 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.169
 playstation have been super blurred we have 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.389
 big problems with aliasing is 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.130
 really ubiquitous to a point that 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.800
 almost believes a camouflage for 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.500
 enemies from time to time we also 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.270
 a framerate one who sometimes suffer 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.250
 good is still very rank 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.130
 casual is not a problem 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.500
 finally sometimes small mini freeze on 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.389
 see there technically it's not 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.699
 irreproachable but it remains a game that 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:59.260
 does its job at this level which 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.720
 is a fight you had to do well 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:05.010
 work and law 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.010
 meiway is beauty that's not everything 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.850
 very very beautiful especially on pc crysis 3 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.370
 dogs tradition is very short this is 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.450
 probably the most common fps that I 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.700
 make of my life ie 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:21.440
 3h50 on consoles round up to 4h 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.730
 since that is feeling generous 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.670
 three hours on pc it's still 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:27.250
 of trouble so here it is a fps 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:29.930
 aperitif that I would advise against 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.850
 frankly I do not want them to be 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.440
 unpleasant to play the impressions 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.820
 third are good we have weapons 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.710
 funny the super combination is 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.630
 still so funny but the 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.450
 game situations are already seen 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.460
 repetitive no inventiveness to any 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.600
 place it's super easy because the 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.580
 main character is way too much 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.850
 powerful proulx and the enemies a lot 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.650
 too silly and overall low I see 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.780
 really not why we will invest our 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.160
 money in there as good fps 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.150
 Modern who take after but 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.780
 that it arises in all directions 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.340
 not missing 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.110
 and even to call of duty lasts longer 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.860
 a long time so we sometimes fail to 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.860
 its sites the jaws of the world
