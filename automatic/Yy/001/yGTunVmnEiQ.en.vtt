here<00:00:08.850> I've<00:00:09.120> got<00:00:09.389> jet<00:00:10.020> beams<00:00:10.700> DD<00:00:11.750> c20<00:00:12.750> prototype

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
here I've got jet beams DD c20 prototype

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.570 
here I've got jet beams DD c20 prototype
this<00:00:14.250> is<00:00:14.430> one<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.610> five<00:00:14.849> models<00:00:15.210> coming<00:00:15.540> out

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
this is one of five models coming out

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.269 
this is one of five models coming out
with<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.700> digital<00:00:18.119> display<00:00:18.950> there<00:00:19.950> you<00:00:20.099> go

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
with the digital display there you go

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.310 
with the digital display there you go
right<00:00:20.759> now<00:00:20.880> it's<00:00:21.060> showing<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.570> number<00:00:21.930> nine

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
right now it's showing a number nine

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.290 
right now it's showing a number nine
which<00:00:22.560> indicates<00:00:23.220> about<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.430> 90%<00:00:23.730> battery

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
which indicates about a 90% battery

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.540 
which indicates about a 90% battery
level<00:00:25.759> that's<00:00:26.759> medium<00:00:27.360> mode<00:00:28.070> it<00:00:29.070> will<00:00:29.189> flip

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
level that's medium mode it will flip

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.999 
level that's medium mode it will flip
over<00:00:29.669> to<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.029> battery<00:00:30.960> indicator<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.770> sec

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
over to the battery indicator in a sec

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.950 
over to the battery indicator in a sec
low<00:00:32.759> mode<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.210> then<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.329> double-click<00:00:33.780> gives

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
low mode and then I double-click gives

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.030 
low mode and then I double-click gives
you<00:00:34.079> strobe<00:00:35.329> start<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.390> off<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.809> see<00:00:37.739> if<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:37.890> can

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
you strobe start it off and see if I can

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:48.700 
you strobe start it off and see if I can
give<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.250> some<00:00:38.430> shots<00:00:38.790> here

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.190 

those<00:00:49.280> ones<00:00:49.490> got<00:00:49.640> an<00:00:49.730> orange<00:00:50.150> peel<00:00:52.060> reflector

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
those ones got an orange peel reflector

00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:18.069 
those ones got an orange peel reflector
it<00:00:54.200> does<00:00:54.410> use<00:00:54.590> utilize<00:00:55.280> the<00:00:55.580> XML<00:00:56.210> you<00:00:56.390> to<00:00:56.660> led

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:18.079 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:21.160 

the<00:01:18.560> clip<00:01:18.859> is<00:01:19.240> mounted<00:01:20.240> on<00:01:20.329> really<00:01:20.600> nice<00:01:20.960> and

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
the clip is mounted on really nice and

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.810 
the clip is mounted on really nice and
solid<00:01:21.289> I<00:01:21.469> believe<00:01:21.710> it's<00:01:21.859> titanium<00:01:22.189> I'm<00:01:22.579> not

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
solid I believe it's titanium I'm not

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.459 
solid I believe it's titanium I'm not
positive<00:01:23.060> or<00:01:23.359> at<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.570> moment<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.990> prototype

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:27.469 
positive or at the moment the prototype

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:28.749 
positive or at the moment the prototype
didn't<00:01:27.710> actually<00:01:27.799> come<00:01:28.100> with<00:01:28.130> a<00:01:28.280> lanyard

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
didn't actually come with a lanyard

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.260 
didn't actually come with a lanyard
but<00:01:28.939> there's<00:01:30.280> TL<00:01:31.280> cap<00:01:31.490> has<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:31.909> screw<00:01:32.149> in

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
but there's TL cap has the screw in

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.450 
but there's TL cap has the screw in
which<00:01:32.390> I<00:01:32.509> would<00:01:32.920> think<00:01:33.920> that<00:01:34.039> it's<00:01:34.280> for<00:01:34.429> a

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
which I would think that it's for a

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:42.010 
which I would think that it's for a
lanyard<00:01:34.819> or<00:01:34.939> a<00:01:35.360> clip<00:01:36.640> hold<00:01:37.640> right<00:01:37.789> here<00:01:41.020> just

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
lanyard or a clip hold right here just

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.240 
lanyard or a clip hold right here just
to<00:01:42.140> go<00:01:42.229> over<00:01:42.259> some<00:01:42.530> of<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.679> features<00:01:42.829> I<00:01:43.100> laid

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
to go over some of the features I laid

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.770 
to go over some of the features I laid
it<00:01:43.399> down<00:01:43.429> there<00:01:43.880> so<00:01:44.209> that<00:01:44.329> you<00:01:44.390> can<00:01:44.539> see<00:01:44.659> the

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
it down there so that you can see the

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.609 
it down there so that you can see the
measurement<00:01:45.140> it<00:01:45.259> does<00:01:45.380> measure<00:01:46.310> five<00:01:46.850> inches

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
measurement it does measure five inches

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.520 
measurement it does measure five inches
it<00:01:48.619> has<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:48.920> side<00:01:49.130> switch<00:01:49.340> as<00:01:49.670> you<00:01:49.700> well<00:01:50.149> saw

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
it has the side switch as you well saw

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.990 
it has the side switch as you well saw
it<00:01:51.530> does<00:01:51.739> automatically<00:01:52.220> memorize<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:52.789> last

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
it does automatically memorize the last

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.620 
it does automatically memorize the last
output<00:01:53.569> so<00:01:53.989> that's<00:01:54.170> kind<00:01:54.349> of<00:01:54.409> cool

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
output so that's kind of cool

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.289 
output so that's kind of cool
double<00:01:56.630> click<00:01:56.810> for<00:01:56.989> the<00:01:57.079> strobe<00:01:57.489> this<00:01:58.489> one<00:01:58.700> has

double click for the strobe this one has

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.330 
double click for the strobe this one has
three<00:01:59.720> levels<00:02:00.049> which<00:02:00.500> I'll<00:02:00.679> do<00:02:00.920> here<00:02:00.950> in<00:02:01.280> a
