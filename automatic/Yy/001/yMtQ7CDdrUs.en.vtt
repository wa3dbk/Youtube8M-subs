00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 i 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.860
 no no 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:29.250
 hi today I will talk about how to try 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:32.669
 a fuse but before I start I want 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.440
 talk a little about what a 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.039
 fuse 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:42.000
 First of all a fuse is a 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:45.629
 protection device that 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.630
 finds in a circuit between a 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:56.040
 electric source and its associated charge 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:59.880
 when the energy flow exceeds or 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.620
 alters the resistance with which the 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.270
 fuse 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.270
 it was designed 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.640
 in this case it would be 15 camper yos 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:21.000
 the fuse self-destructs 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:25.560
 to cut the passage of the source of 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.900
 energy and thus be able to save not only the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.369
 life of the device that is 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:35.840
 protecting but also protects 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:40.830
 about overheating in the 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:44.930
 electrical system and thus prevent a 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.930
 internal fire 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:52.560
 the possible unlike the 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:56.820
 circuit breakers or breakers that 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:01.600
 can be readjusted to allow the 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:04.390
 flow of energy again 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.170
 circuit breakers are 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.650
 commonly found in houses are 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.510
 those that shoot when there are 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:17.659
 when there is an overload 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.840
 but the fuses once they have 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:24.460
 fulfilled his first and only mission 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:30.640
 which is to give life 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:33.650
 in an overload they must be discarded and 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.230
 replaced by a new one 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.530
 The fuses are designed 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:43.140
 specifically to transport a 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:46.440
 certain amount of energy 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:50.280
 and if the current flow exceeds said 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:53.550
 design limit then it 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:58.310
 overheat and melt 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:01.910
 when the flow of energy is altered 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.989
 the capacity of the fuse in this case 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.989
 it would be at 15 amps 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:12.630
 this low resistance wire is 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:16.920
 overheats and melts in other 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:20.069
 words are burned to prevent it from 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:24.469
 burn what he would be 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.469
 hurts and the lamp 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:33.040
 now what to do in an emergency case 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.890
 for example it burns you as possible and 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.680
 I'm possible allows the car 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.810
 work 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.810
 without a given emergency case 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.200
 that you have no other option 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:55.599
 what you can do is change is the 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:04:00.640
 fuse with another possible of the same type 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:06.690
 amps will be 15 amps but what 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.690
 do if you do not have another 15 amp 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:13.880
 what you can do in this case is 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:17.840
 replace with another minor 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:22.010
 capacity in this case could be of 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:26.270
 day amps never replace a 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:28.520
 possible of 15 empires by another 20 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.520
 amps 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:35.080
 remember what 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.080
 you have to take into account 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:42.189
 that the fuse that you are going to remove 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:45.580
 it's something that the car can work 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:47.320
 without that fuse for example the fuse 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.370
 of the radius 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:53.740
 this possible is not to say much 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.110
 importance the car can survive 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.960
 without that possible 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:03.270
 let's say for a period of time let's say 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.270
 in a moment of emergency 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:10.919
 when you get to the house you have to 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:15.689
 immediately replace the fuse with 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:20.249
 the 15 amp fuse 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:25.060
 also remember to replace what 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:28.069
 impossible with a higher classification 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:31.620
 greatly increases the risk of damage 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:35.850
 the electrical system 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:39.330
 without replacing the fuse with one of the 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:42.810
 same number of amps burns in a 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:45.690
 period of a few days 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:49.500
 it's a sign that you have a very problem 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:56.040
 serious in your vehicle duty fuse 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:59.810
 burned in your vehicle and takes your car 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:03.910
 to a qualified mechanic 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:07.820
 now with regards to how to test 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:10.940
 a fuse to test a fuse is not 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:13.640
 it requires a lot of technology 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:16.040
 at a glance you can see when a 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.300
 Fuse is blown because the fuses 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:21.629
 They are transparent 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.810
 now how do you see a fuse when it is 

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:25.970
 Burned 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:30.250
 when a fuse is burned you could see 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:35.030
 well with this melted center part 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:36.550
 but if you're not happy if you're not 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:40.010
 safe 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:44.440
 and I 'll show you next 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:47.920
 how can you try a fuse 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:51.300
 here I have a fuse this fuses 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.300
 15 amps 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:59.380
 and to test this fuse 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:02.850
 we are going to use this device that 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:06.010
 you can get in any auto parts 

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:09.660
 just place you to make contact with 

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:12.280
 the two terminals and turn on 

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:16.000
 practically a soto is indicating that 

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:18.370
 the fuse is good too if you have 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.820
 a multimeter you can try it with a 

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.820
 Multimeter 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:27.460
 now that sound would be indicating you 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:29.910
 that the fuse is good that is not 

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.910
 Burned 

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:36.670
 Now that's the way you can 

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:39.570
 try a fuse 

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:42.790
 here you can really see the fuse 

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:45.600
 internally so when the fuse 

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.600
 it's burned 

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.969
 you practically do not need any 

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:54.829
 instrument because 

00:07:50.969 --> 00:07:57.629
 you can see clearly internally 

00:07:54.829 --> 00:07:59.180
 this has been all about what a 

00:07:57.629 --> 00:08:03.850
 fuse 

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:03.850
 this has been all thanks
