00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
fastest way to do that is by giving it

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.620 
fastest way to do that is by giving it
more<00:00:16.230> gears<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:17.010> work<00:00:17.160> with<00:00:17.460> that's<00:00:18.210> why<00:00:18.390> we

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
more gears to work with that's why we

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.950 
more gears to work with that's why we

cars<00:00:41.640> when<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.390> was<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.629> boy<00:00:42.809> driving<00:00:43.170> growing<00:00:44.070> up

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
cars when I was a boy driving growing up

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.520 
cars when I was a boy driving growing up
we<00:00:44.340> had<00:00:44.489> three<00:00:45.149> speed<00:00:45.539> automatic<00:00:45.570> snow<00:00:46.320> you've

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
we had three speed automatic snow you've

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.520 
we had three speed automatic snow you've
got<00:00:46.739> nine<00:00:47.129> speeds<00:00:47.640> why<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.239> many<00:00:48.390> gears<00:00:48.690> the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
got nine speeds why so many gears the

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.319 
got nine speeds why so many gears the
reason<00:00:49.920> for<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.280> many<00:00:50.430> gears<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.180> we

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
reason for the many gears is that we

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.340 
reason for the many gears is that we
have<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.570> very<00:00:51.899> broad<00:00:52.559> spread<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:54.020> ratios<00:00:55.020> in

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
have a very broad spread of ratios in

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.290 
have a very broad spread of ratios in
the<00:00:55.379> transmission<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.699> difference<00:00:57.090> between

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
the transmission the difference between

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.360 
the transmission the difference between
the<00:00:57.660> lowest<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.289> highest<00:00:58.379> ratio<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.250> was

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
the lowest and the highest ratio it was

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.209 
the lowest and the highest ratio it was
close<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.120> 10<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.690> have<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.859> have<00:01:01.980> more

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
close to 10 and you have to have more

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.250 
close to 10 and you have to have more
than<00:01:02.370> three<00:01:02.670> gears<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.120> handle<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:04.049> keep

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
than three gears to handle that to keep

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.140 
than three gears to handle that to keep
the<00:01:04.409> drivability<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.309> transmission<00:01:05.880> and

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
the drivability in the transmission and

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.359 
the drivability in the transmission and
that<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.570> reason<00:01:06.720> why<00:01:07.020> we<00:01:07.260> have<00:01:07.650> nine<00:01:08.040> at

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
that is the reason why we have nine at

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.359 
that is the reason why we have nine at
that<00:01:08.640> case<00:01:08.880> nine<00:01:09.450> was<00:01:09.750> not<00:01:10.020> our<00:01:10.350> let's<00:01:11.159> say

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
that case nine was not our let's say

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.149 
that case nine was not our let's say
target<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.330> target<00:01:12.600> was<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.170> have<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.770> spread

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
target the target was to have the spread

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.609 
target the target was to have the spread
of<00:01:14.189> close<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:15.060> 10

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
of close to 10

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.370 
of close to 10
well<00:01:16.369> and<00:01:16.729> I<00:01:16.939> imagine<00:01:17.420> then<00:01:17.600> that<00:01:17.630> that<00:01:18.049> helps

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
well and I imagine then that that helps

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.389 
well and I imagine then that that helps
in<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:18.590> performance<00:01:19.100> of<00:01:19.219> the<00:01:19.280> vehicle

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
in the performance of the vehicle

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:21.849 
in the performance of the vehicle
especially<00:01:20.179> from<00:01:20.450> a<00:01:20.600> fuel<00:01:20.960> efficiency<00:01:21.409> stamp

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:21.859 
especially from a fuel efficiency stamp

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:24.730 
especially from a fuel efficiency stamp
right<00:01:22.219> that<00:01:22.520> is<00:01:22.670> that's<00:01:23.119> exactly<00:01:24.049> the<00:01:24.200> point<00:01:24.409> I

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
right that is that's exactly the point I

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.910 
right that is that's exactly the point I
think<00:01:24.859> in<00:01:25.429> the<00:01:25.609> IAA<00:01:25.969> show<00:01:26.450> of<00:01:26.750> this<00:01:27.079> year<00:01:27.409> it<00:01:27.740> is

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
think in the IAA show of this year it is

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.999 
think in the IAA show of this year it is
all<00:01:28.189> about<00:01:28.369> efficiency<00:01:28.789> fuel<00:01:29.600> efficiency<00:01:30.319> co2

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
all about efficiency fuel efficiency co2

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.699 
all about efficiency fuel efficiency co2
but<00:01:31.759> also<00:01:31.909> light<00:01:32.240> weight<00:01:32.509> and<00:01:32.750> so<00:01:32.990> we<00:01:33.409> want<00:01:33.619> to

00:01:33.699 --> 00:01:33.709 
but also light weight and so we want to

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:35.620 
but also light weight and so we want to
contribute<00:01:34.009> to<00:01:34.369> that<00:01:34.399> and<00:01:34.789> so<00:01:34.939> we<00:01:35.209> bring<00:01:35.420> that

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
contribute to that and so we bring that

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.240 
contribute to that and so we bring that
product<00:01:36.140> that<00:01:36.619> helps<00:01:37.490> save<00:01:38.090> you<00:01:39.250> something

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
product that helps save you something

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.849 
product that helps save you something
like<00:01:40.399> 16<00:01:41.030> percent<00:01:41.509> compared<00:01:42.439> to<00:01:42.560> the

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:42.859

gears<00:02:04.429> into<00:02:05.030> each<00:02:05.479> other<00:02:05.719> and<00:02:06.020> that<00:02:06.349> makes<00:02:06.619> it

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
gears into each other and that makes it

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.809 
gears into each other and that makes it
that<00:02:07.069> short<00:02:07.429> having<00:02:08.410> 9-speed<00:02:09.410> not<00:02:10.099> longer

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
that short having 9-speed not longer

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.180 
that short having 9-speed not longer
than<00:02:11.000> a<00:02:11.120> six-speed<00:02:11.780> man<00:02:12.190> automatic

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
than a six-speed man automatic

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.009 
than a six-speed man automatic
transmission<00:02:13.760> as<00:02:13.970> we<00:02:14.239> have<00:02:14.390> it<00:02:14.510> on<00:02:14.629> the<00:02:14.720> market

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
transmission as we have it on the market

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:15.309 
transmission as we have it on the market
today

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
today

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.470 
today
so<00:02:15.620> these<00:02:15.799> gears<00:02:16.160> nest<00:02:16.579> inside<00:02:17.060> one<00:02:17.450> another

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
so these gears nest inside one another

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.809 
so these gears nest inside one another
that<00:02:18.200> is<00:02:18.349> the<00:02:18.500> reason<00:02:18.739> why<00:02:19.069> it's<00:02:19.310> just<00:02:19.459> that

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
that is the reason why it's just that

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.470 
that is the reason why it's just that
short

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
short

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.570 
short
because<00:02:22.050> of<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.230> very<00:02:22.470> is<00:02:22.739> a<00:02:22.769> very<00:02:23.370> much<00:02:23.550> a

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
because of the very is a very much a

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.759 
because of the very is a very much a
compact<00:02:24.239> design<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.110> compact<00:02:25.590> design

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
compact design it is a compact design

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.130 
compact design it is a compact design
the<00:02:26.519> second<00:02:26.940> issue<00:02:27.060> that<00:02:27.180> is<00:02:27.510> important<00:02:28.019> on

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
the second issue that is important on

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.960 
the second issue that is important on
that<00:02:28.349> is<00:02:28.849> normally<00:02:29.849> he<00:02:30.360> use<00:02:31.430> like<00:02:32.430> clutch

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
that is normally he use like clutch

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.949 
that is normally he use like clutch
packages<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:34.489> break<00:02:35.489> or<00:02:35.760> connect<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:36.629> parts

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
packages to break or connect the parts

packages to break or connect the parts
of<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.230> transmission<00:02:37.860> we<00:02:38.280> used<00:02:38.549> our<00:02:38.760> clutches

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
of the transmission we used our clutches

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.539 
of the transmission we used our clutches
for<00:02:39.930> two<00:02:40.110> of<00:02:40.290> them<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.680> they<00:02:41.010> are<00:02:41.160> also<00:02:41.310> very

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
for two of them and they are also very

the<00:02:56.579> powertrain<00:02:57.000> experts<00:02:57.540> tell<00:02:57.810> me<00:02:57.989> that

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
the powertrain experts tell me that

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.349 
the powertrain experts tell me that
we're<00:02:58.349> soon<00:02:58.560> going<00:02:58.829> to<00:02:58.920> see<00:02:59.190> 10<00:02:59.879> speed

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
we're soon going to see 10 speed

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.080 
we're soon going to see 10 speed
transmissions<00:03:01.319> they<00:03:02.069> say<00:03:02.310> that's<00:03:02.579> going<00:03:02.879> to

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
transmissions they say that's going to

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.880 
transmissions they say that's going to
be<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.390> max<00:03:03.690> that<00:03:03.989> we're<00:03:04.140> ever<00:03:04.290> going<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.620> see

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
be the max that we're ever going to see

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.890 
be the max that we're ever going to see
but<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:05.700> remember<00:03:06.180> when<00:03:06.329> they<00:03:06.450> said<00:03:06.480> we'll

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
but I remember when they said we'll

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.500 
but I remember when they said we'll
never<00:03:07.079> get<00:03:07.349> more<00:03:07.620> than<00:03:07.799> seven<00:03:08.489> gears<00:03:08.730> get<00:03:09.390> a

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
never get more than seven gears get a

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.539 
never get more than seven gears get a
transmission<00:03:12.620> what<00:03:13.620> if<00:03:13.739> we<00:03:13.890> always<00:03:14.040> settled

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
transmission what if we always settled

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.509 
transmission what if we always settled
for<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.879> first<00:03:15.150> thing<00:03:15.420> that<00:03:15.450> came<00:03:15.959> along<00:03:16.519> then

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
for the first thing that came along then

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.860 
for the first thing that came along then
we'd<00:03:17.819> never<00:03:18.030> have<00:03:18.269> gotten<00:03:18.510> here<00:03:20.870> introducing

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
we'd never have gotten here introducing

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.030 
we'd never have gotten here introducing
