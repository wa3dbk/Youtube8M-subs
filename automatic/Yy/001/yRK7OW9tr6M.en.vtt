00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.620 

okay<00:00:08.580> we've<00:00:08.790> talked<00:00:09.060> about

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
okay we've talked about

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.710 
okay we've talked about
the<00:00:10.010> materials<00:00:11.010> that<00:00:11.250> we<00:00:11.460> need<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:12.510> start

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:12.720 
the materials that we need to start

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.820 
the materials that we need to start
drawing<00:00:12.990> let's<00:00:13.470> just<00:00:13.680> take<00:00:14.340> a

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:14.830 
drawing let's just take a

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.760 
drawing let's just take a
the<00:00:15.100> drawing<00:00:16.260> techniques<00:00:17.260> that<00:00:17.470> we<00:00:17.590> have

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
the drawing techniques that we have

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.410 
the drawing techniques that we have
first<00:00:17.980> of<00:00:18.100> all<00:00:18.190> what<00:00:18.700> I'm<00:00:18.790> gonna<00:00:18.910> do<00:00:19.090> is<00:00:19.300> I'm

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.420 
first of all what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.150 
first of all what I'm gonna do is I'm
simply<00:00:19.780> going<00:00:19.930> to<00:00:20.140> take<00:00:20.350> a<00:00:20.380> look<00:00:20.680> at<00:00:20.890> some

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
simply going to take a look at some

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.550 
simply going to take a look at some
basic<00:00:21.280> line<00:00:21.670> quality<00:00:22.000> so<00:00:22.840> when<00:00:23.140> I'm<00:00:23.260> sketching

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
basic line quality so when I'm sketching

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.890 
basic line quality so when I'm sketching
we'll<00:00:24.310> draw<00:00:24.520> a<00:00:24.550> line<00:00:24.760> on<00:00:24.970> here<00:00:25.150> for<00:00:25.390> you<00:00:25.510> and

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
we'll draw a line on here for you and

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.120 
we'll draw a line on here for you and
we're<00:00:26.110> gonna<00:00:26.230> make<00:00:26.320> that<00:00:26.439> nice<00:00:26.650> and<00:00:26.830> dark<00:00:26.950> and

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
we're gonna make that nice and dark and

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.500 
we're gonna make that nice and dark and
you<00:00:27.250> can<00:00:27.369> see<00:00:27.550> that<00:00:27.730> we<00:00:27.849> have<00:00:27.939> a<00:00:27.970> nice<00:00:28.210> dark

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.510 
you can see that we have a nice dark

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.499 
you can see that we have a nice dark
line<00:00:28.810> now<00:00:29.439> I'm<00:00:29.619> getting<00:00:29.950> good<00:00:30.270> consistency<00:00:31.270> in

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509 
line now I'm getting good consistency in

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.740 
line now I'm getting good consistency in
my<00:00:31.540> lines<00:00:31.930> and<00:00:32.529> sketching<00:00:33.160> by<00:00:33.550> keeping<00:00:34.030> my

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
my lines and sketching by keeping my

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.069 
my lines and sketching by keeping my
pencil<00:00:35.350> as<00:00:35.730> perpendicular<00:00:36.730> to<00:00:36.970> the<00:00:37.630> paper<00:00:37.810> as

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
pencil as perpendicular to the paper as

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.020 
pencil as perpendicular to the paper as
possible<00:00:38.620> and<00:00:38.980> what<00:00:39.100> that<00:00:39.250> does<00:00:39.430> is<00:00:39.700> allows

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
possible and what that does is allows

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.540 
possible and what that does is allows
the<00:00:40.720> lead<00:00:41.020> width<00:00:41.350> which<00:00:41.890> in<00:00:42.070> this<00:00:42.190> case<00:00:42.370> is

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
the lead width which in this case is

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.000 
the lead width which in this case is
0.92<00:00:44.970> transfer<00:00:45.970> completely<00:00:46.780> and<00:00:46.989> if<00:00:47.620> we<00:00:47.800> can

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
0.92 transfer completely and if we can

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.680 
0.92 transfer completely and if we can
zoom<00:00:48.219> in<00:00:48.489> let's<00:00:48.699> see<00:00:48.789> if<00:00:48.850> we<00:00:48.940> can<00:00:49.090> zoom<00:00:49.120> in<00:00:49.480> here

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
zoom in let's see if we can zoom in here

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.660 
zoom in let's see if we can zoom in here
a<00:00:49.750> little<00:00:49.809> bit<00:00:49.989> on<00:00:50.530> the<00:00:50.649> line<00:00:50.859> you're<00:00:51.550> gonna

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
a little bit on the line you're gonna

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.380 
a little bit on the line you're gonna
see<00:00:51.910> that<00:00:52.120> we<00:00:52.269> have<00:00:52.510> good<00:00:53.250> wine<00:00:54.250> quality<00:00:54.640> say

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
see that we have good wine quality say

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.410 
see that we have good wine quality say
that<00:00:55.629> and<00:00:56.230> we'll<00:00:56.530> do<00:00:56.649> another<00:00:56.829> one<00:00:56.949> right<00:00:57.420> here

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
that and we'll do another one right here

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.380 
that and we'll do another one right here
so<00:00:59.109> we<00:00:59.559> have<00:00:59.679> nice<00:00:59.949> thick<00:01:00.339> lines<00:01:00.609> an<00:01:00.969> old

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
so we have nice thick lines an old

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.910 
so we have nice thick lines an old
technique<00:01:01.719> in<00:01:01.899> drafting<00:01:02.379> that<00:01:02.440> we<00:01:02.739> don't

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
technique in drafting that we don't

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.049 
technique in drafting that we don't
typically<00:01:03.219> apply<00:01:03.519> in<00:01:03.579> sketching<00:01:03.850> because

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
typically apply in sketching because

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.030 
typically apply in sketching because
sketching<00:01:04.809> is<00:01:04.930> supposed<00:01:05.140> to<00:01:05.170> be<00:01:05.260> a<00:01:05.290> quick<00:01:05.800> tool

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
sketching is supposed to be a quick tool

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.980 
sketching is supposed to be a quick tool
but<00:01:06.400> what<00:01:06.520> we<00:01:06.580> used<00:01:06.790> to<00:01:06.880> do<00:01:07.060> is<00:01:07.480> take<00:01:07.810> that

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
but what we used to do is take that

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.340 
but what we used to do is take that
pencil<00:01:08.320> and<00:01:08.740> as<00:01:08.920> we<00:01:09.510> ran<00:01:10.510> across<00:01:10.780> we<00:01:11.140> would

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
pencil and as we ran across we would

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.130 
pencil and as we ran across we would
spin<00:01:11.950> it<00:01:12.100> so<00:01:12.970> let<00:01:13.150> me<00:01:13.180> zoom<00:01:13.300> back<00:01:13.480> out<00:01:13.780> so<00:01:14.020> that

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
spin it so let me zoom back out so that

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.100 
spin it so let me zoom back out so that
you<00:01:14.260> can<00:01:14.290> see<00:01:14.710> that<00:01:15.480> and<00:01:16.480> watch<00:01:16.870> my<00:01:17.880> pencil<00:01:19.110> as

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
you can see that and watch my pencil as

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.910 
you can see that and watch my pencil as
I<00:01:20.320> move<00:01:20.560> it<00:01:20.740> so<00:01:21.220> I<00:01:21.550> take<00:01:21.760> it<00:01:21.790> and<00:01:22.150> I<00:01:22.210> spin<00:01:22.630> it

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
I move it so I take it and I spin it

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.720 
I move it so I take it and I spin it
typically<00:01:23.920> what<00:01:24.070> we<00:01:24.160> would<00:01:24.190> do<00:01:24.460> is<00:01:24.580> we<00:01:24.700> would

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:24.730 
typically what we would do is we would

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.520 
typically what we would do is we would
do<00:01:24.970> that<00:01:25.090> with<00:01:25.240> a<00:01:25.300> ruler<00:01:25.540> so<00:01:26.140> we<00:01:26.260> could<00:01:26.410> take

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
do that with a ruler so we could take

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.340 
do that with a ruler so we could take
that<00:01:26.590> and<00:01:27.550> we<00:01:27.790> put<00:01:27.970> that<00:01:28.000> on<00:01:28.120> get<00:01:28.960> that<00:01:29.110> ruler

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
that and we put that on get that ruler

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.170 
that and we put that on get that ruler
on<00:01:29.590> there<00:01:29.830> and<00:01:30.100> then<00:01:30.340> we<00:01:30.430> take<00:01:30.580> that<00:01:30.790> and<00:01:31.030> then

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
on there and then we take that and then

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.370 
on there and then we take that and then
there's<00:01:31.360> we're<00:01:31.480> putting<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:31.960> line<00:01:32.140> down

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
there's we're putting the line down

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.660 
there's we're putting the line down
we're<00:01:32.590> spinning<00:01:32.890> it<00:01:33.130> so<00:01:33.250> that<00:01:33.400> we<00:01:33.460> get<00:01:33.580> a<00:01:33.610> good

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
we're spinning it so that we get a good

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.940 
we're spinning it so that we get a good
transference<00:01:34.570> of<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:34.870> web<00:01:35.110> and<00:01:35.710> we<00:01:35.800> get<00:01:35.920> a

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
transference of the web and we get a

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.470 
transference of the web and we get a
nice<00:01:36.130> dark<00:01:36.310> line<00:01:36.610> you<00:01:36.790> can<00:01:36.910> see<00:01:37.150> how<00:01:37.330> much

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
nice dark line you can see how much

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.170 
nice dark line you can see how much
darker<00:01:37.810> this<00:01:38.710> line<00:01:39.010> is<00:01:39.370> from<00:01:39.640> just<00:01:39.850> a<00:01:39.910> regular

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
darker this line is from just a regular

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.490 
darker this line is from just a regular
sketch<00:01:40.420> line<00:01:40.630> now<00:01:40.780> again<00:01:40.990> that's<00:01:41.110> more<00:01:41.350> for

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
sketch line now again that's more for

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.950 
sketch line now again that's more for
drafting<00:01:42.010> so<00:01:42.190> we<00:01:42.310> probably<00:01:42.520> won't<00:01:42.880> spend<00:01:43.210> any

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
drafting so we probably won't spend any

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.510 
drafting so we probably won't spend any
time<00:01:44.050> talking<00:01:44.500> about<00:01:44.740> that<00:01:44.980> but<00:01:45.220> just<00:01:45.370> so<00:01:45.430> you

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
time talking about that but just so you

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.070 
time talking about that but just so you
can<00:01:45.640> see<00:01:45.790> the<00:01:45.910> differences<00:01:46.360> so<00:01:46.750> in<00:01:46.840> sketching

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
can see the differences so in sketching

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.620 
can see the differences so in sketching
it's<00:01:47.350> just<00:01:47.980> simply<00:01:48.430> doing<00:01:48.790> lines<00:01:49.120> and<00:01:49.420> you<00:01:49.480> can

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
it's just simply doing lines and you can

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.270 
it's just simply doing lines and you can
see<00:01:49.750> I've<00:01:49.870> got<00:01:50.020> a<00:01:50.050> lot<00:01:50.170> of<00:01:50.320> basic<00:01:51.040> straight

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
see I've got a lot of basic straight

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.510 
see I've got a lot of basic straight
lines<00:01:51.550> here<00:01:51.880> no<00:01:52.840> big<00:01:52.990> deal<00:01:53.200> there<00:01:53.500> and<00:01:54.010> now

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
lines here no big deal there and now

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.580 
lines here no big deal there and now
that's<00:01:54.700> with<00:01:54.940> an<00:01:55.120> HB<00:01:55.600> point<00:01:55.900> now<00:01:56.050> let<00:01:56.410> me<00:01:56.470> show

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
that's with an HB point now let me show

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.990 
that's with an HB point now let me show
you<00:01:56.620> what<00:01:56.770> happens<00:01:57.040> when<00:01:57.190> you<00:01:57.250> break<00:01:57.760> out<00:01:57.880> the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
you what happens when you break out the

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.660 
you what happens when you break out the
old<00:01:58.150> construction<00:01:58.300> grade<00:01:58.840> and<00:01:59.670> construction

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
old construction grade and construction

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
old construction grade and construction
weight<00:02:00.820> again<00:02:01.210> is<00:02:01.360> 2h<00:02:02.080> -<00:02:02.380> 7<00:02:02.800> h<00:02:02.920> or<00:02:03.400> 6h<00:02:03.970> and<00:02:04.480> we<00:02:04.570> do

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
weight again is 2h - 7 h or 6h and we do

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.210 
weight again is 2h - 7 h or 6h and we do
a<00:02:04.720> line<00:02:04.990> and<00:02:05.260> you<00:02:05.350> can<00:02:05.500> see<00:02:05.650> that<00:02:05.740> that<00:02:05.890> line

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
a line and you can see that that line

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.860 
a line and you can see that that line
now<00:02:06.430> this<00:02:06.520> is<00:02:06.670> a<00:02:06.700> 2h<00:02:07.090> I<00:02:07.210> wanted<00:02:07.480> it<00:02:07.600> to<00:02:07.720> be<00:02:07.840> a

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
now this is a 2h I wanted it to be a

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.869 
now this is a 2h I wanted it to be a
little<00:02:08.110> bit<00:02:08.289> darker<00:02:08.679> for<00:02:09.220> this<00:02:09.369> demonstration

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
little bit darker for this demonstration

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.030 
little bit darker for this demonstration
the<00:02:10.539> 2h<00:02:10.869> is<00:02:10.899> a<00:02:11.080> little<00:02:11.560> bit<00:02:11.680> thinner<00:02:11.860> we

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
the 2h is a little bit thinner we

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.290 
the 2h is a little bit thinner we
usually<00:02:12.340> try<00:02:12.489> and<00:02:12.519> keep<00:02:12.670> this<00:02:12.910> point

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
usually try and keep this point

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.869 
usually try and keep this point
sharpened<00:02:13.930> right<00:02:14.290> here<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:15.010> then<00:02:15.430> we<00:02:15.550> can<00:02:15.730> use

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
sharpened right here and then we can use

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.520 
sharpened right here and then we can use
that<00:02:16.030> there's<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.480> basic<00:02:16.629> construction<00:02:17.290> now<00:02:17.440> if

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
that there's a basic construction now if

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.200 
that there's a basic construction now if
I'm<00:02:17.650> doing<00:02:17.950> it<00:02:18.040> correctly<00:02:18.550> I<00:02:18.640> can<00:02:18.730> do

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
I'm doing it correctly I can do

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.990 
I'm doing it correctly I can do
light<00:02:19.540> lining<00:02:20.050> with<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:20.710> very<00:02:21.070> light<00:02:21.310> touch<00:02:21.610> and

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
light lining with a very light touch and

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.820 
light lining with a very light touch and
you<00:02:22.270> see<00:02:22.450> that<00:02:22.540> those<00:02:22.690> are<00:02:22.840> very<00:02:23.020> difficult<00:02:23.230> to

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
you see that those are very difficult to

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.240 
you see that those are very difficult to
see<00:02:24.450> so<00:02:25.450> that's<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.290> basics<00:02:26.770> of<00:02:26.980> blind

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
see so that's the basics of blind

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.780 
see so that's the basics of blind
quality<00:02:27.880> so<00:02:28.390> go<00:02:28.540> use<00:02:28.810> your<00:02:29.280> construction<00:02:30.280> to

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
quality so go use your construction to

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.420 
quality so go use your construction to
map<00:02:31.780> out<00:02:32.080> your<00:02:32.350> drawing<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:33.070> do<00:02:33.220> some

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
map out your drawing to do some

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.710 
map out your drawing to do some
construction<00:02:33.700> just<00:02:34.240> like<00:02:34.360> we<00:02:34.510> talked<00:02:34.690> about

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
construction just like we talked about

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.210 
construction just like we talked about
doing<00:02:35.140> some<00:02:35.260> construction<00:02:35.530> with<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.130> we'll

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
doing some construction with and we'll

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.270 
doing some construction with and we'll
do<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.400> little<00:02:36.460> bit<00:02:36.670> more<00:02:36.900> construction

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
do a little bit more construction

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.260 
do a little bit more construction
techniques<00:02:39.280> we<00:02:39.490> use<00:02:39.610> some<00:02:39.760> more<00:02:39.880> construction

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
techniques we use some more construction

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.550 
techniques we use some more construction
techniques<00:02:40.750> I<00:02:40.840> should<00:02:41.020> say<00:02:41.200> when<00:02:41.290> we<00:02:41.350> start

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
techniques I should say when we start

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.290 
techniques I should say when we start
doing<00:02:41.620> circles<00:02:42.100> and<00:02:42.280> some<00:02:42.370> other<00:02:42.550> things<00:02:42.790> then

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
doing circles and some other things then

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.300 
doing circles and some other things then
when<00:02:43.960> you're<00:02:44.080> ready<00:02:44.110> to<00:02:44.440> lay<00:02:44.680> led<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:44.950> paper

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
when you're ready to lay led the paper

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.180 
when you're ready to lay led the paper
and<00:02:45.670> really<00:02:45.910> put<00:02:46.690> your<00:02:46.960> drawing<00:02:47.320> down<00:02:47.770> on

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
and really put your drawing down on

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.090 
and really put your drawing down on
paper<00:02:48.670> then<00:02:49.210> you<00:02:49.300> want<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.480> back<00:02:49.830> take<00:02:50.830> this

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
paper then you want to back take this

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.040 
paper then you want to back take this
pencil<00:02:51.370> and<00:02:51.730> then<00:02:51.850> go<00:02:51.940> back<00:02:52.120> over<00:02:52.300> your

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
pencil and then go back over your

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.250 
pencil and then go back over your
construction<00:02:53.560> lines<00:02:53.740> to<00:02:54.190> give<00:02:54.370> you<00:02:54.490> a<00:02:54.760> nice

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
construction lines to give you a nice

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.720 
construction lines to give you a nice
dark<00:02:56.260> drawing<00:02:56.800> so<00:02:56.950> that<00:02:56.980> people<00:02:57.310> can<00:02:57.430> see<00:02:57.610> it

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
dark drawing so that people can see it

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.090 
dark drawing so that people can see it
so<00:02:58.270> those<00:02:58.930> are<00:02:59.050> the<00:02:59.110> basics<00:02:59.470> of<00:02:59.590> line<00:02:59.830> quality

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
so those are the basics of line quality

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.360 
so those are the basics of line quality
and<00:03:00.930> hopefully<00:03:01.930> that<00:03:02.110> will<00:03:02.200> help<00:03:02.410> you<00:03:02.680> to<00:03:02.950> see

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
and hopefully that will help you to see

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.770 
and hopefully that will help you to see
the<00:03:03.520> difference<00:03:03.850> between<00:03:04.000> a<00:03:04.180> construction

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
the difference between a construction

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.180 
the difference between a construction
and<00:03:05.430> actual<00:03:06.430> object<00:03:06.970> lines
