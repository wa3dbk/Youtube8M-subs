00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
it's now time to reveal the results of

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.050 
it's now time to reveal the results of
our<00:00:02.190> non-surgical<00:00:03.149> eyebrow<00:00:03.629> lift<00:00:04.020> procedure

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:05.060 
our non-surgical eyebrow lift procedure

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.000 
our non-surgical eyebrow lift procedure
gentlemen<00:00:06.089> and<00:00:06.210> before<00:00:06.990> we<00:00:07.290> show<00:00:07.649> you<00:00:07.710> the

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
gentlemen and before we show you the

gentlemen and before we show you the
results<00:00:08.580> of<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:08.880> work<00:00:09.090> that<00:00:09.120> dr.<00:00:09.480> Chopra<00:00:10.110> and

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
results of the work that dr. Chopra and

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.280 
results of the work that dr. Chopra and
I<00:00:10.320> did<00:00:10.559> let's<00:00:10.830> once<00:00:11.400> again<00:00:11.820> remind<00:00:12.330> you<00:00:12.599> of<00:00:12.870> how

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
I did let's once again remind you of how

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.099 
I did let's once again remind you of how
Anya<00:00:13.650> looked<00:00:14.130> before<00:00:14.759> we<00:00:15.330> treated<00:00:15.719> her<00:00:15.839> brows

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
Anya looked before we treated her brows

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.990 
Anya looked before we treated her brows
so<00:00:16.830> there<00:00:17.010> she<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.250> you<00:00:17.369> can<00:00:17.670> see<00:00:17.820> that

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
so there she is you can see that

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.120 
so there she is you can see that
heaviness<00:00:18.359> in<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.750> brows<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.859> and

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
heaviness in the brows and and the and

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.910 
heaviness in the brows and and the and
the<00:00:20.699> upper<00:00:20.850> so<00:00:21.150> now<00:00:21.390> let's<00:00:21.900> have<00:00:22.439> her<00:00:22.590> look

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
the upper so now let's have her look

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:34.190 
the upper so now let's have her look
into<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.369> camera<00:00:32.059> all<00:00:33.059> we<00:00:33.450> did<00:00:33.660> was<00:00:33.840> do<00:00:34.050> an

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
into the camera all we did was do an

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.100 
into the camera all we did was do an
injection<00:00:34.500> about<00:00:34.860> one<00:00:35.130> cc

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
injection about one cc

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.290 
injection about one cc
it's<00:00:37.110> called<00:00:37.290> sculptor<00:00:37.800> Ed's<00:00:38.129> L<00:00:38.280> lactic<00:00:38.879> acid

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
it's called sculptor Ed's L lactic acid

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.090 
it's called sculptor Ed's L lactic acid
it's<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.540> sugar<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:39.899> we<00:00:40.140> find<00:00:40.440> normally<00:00:40.890> in

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
it's a sugar that we find normally in

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.190 
it's a sugar that we find normally in
the<00:00:41.280> dermis<00:00:41.670> filler<00:00:41.940> substance<00:00:42.540> why<00:00:42.960> do<00:00:43.020> we

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
the dermis filler substance why do we

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.260 
the dermis filler substance why do we
like<00:00:43.410> using<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.190> because<00:00:44.820> we<00:00:44.969> can<00:00:45.090> use<00:00:45.239> a

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
like using that because we can use a

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.229 
like using that because we can use a
bigger<00:00:45.570> volume<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.579> it's<00:00:47.579> gonna<00:00:47.820> last<00:00:48.030> about

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
bigger volume and it's gonna last about

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.209 
bigger volume and it's gonna last about
a<00:00:48.390> year<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.840> think<00:00:49.020> it's<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.260> bigger<00:00:49.469> lift<00:00:49.710> she

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
a year I think it's a bigger lift she

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.740 
a year I think it's a bigger lift she
know<00:00:50.340> she<00:00:50.399> had<00:00:50.730> like<00:00:50.940> we<00:00:51.030> saw<00:00:51.180> in<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.420> before

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
know she had like we saw in the before

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.799 
know she had like we saw in the before
is<00:00:52.140> not<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.860> lot<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.280> skin<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.090> we<00:00:54.449> had<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.660> pull

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
is not a lot of skin that we had to pull

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:55.670 
is not a lot of skin that we had to pull
up<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.110> it's<00:00:55.230> like<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.350> balloon<00:00:55.620> that's

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
up so it's like a balloon that's

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.330 
up so it's like a balloon that's
deflated

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
deflated

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.860 
deflated
we<00:00:57.829> blow<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.859> up<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.550> we<00:00:59.730> hold<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.300> we<00:01:00.719> kind

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
we blow it up and we hold it and we kind

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.599 
we blow it up and we hold it and we kind
of<00:01:00.989> moved<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.379> brow<00:01:01.559> up<00:01:01.770> without<00:01:02.129> any<00:01:02.370> scars

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
of moved the brow up without any scars

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.270 
of moved the brow up without any scars
and<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.539> would<00:01:03.840> Anya<00:01:04.110> need<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:04.439> then<00:01:04.710> yearly

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
and so would Anya need this then yearly

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.770 
and so would Anya need this then yearly
if<00:01:05.430> she<00:01:05.580> wanted<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.880> have<00:01:06.000> permanent<00:01:06.270> results

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
if she wanted to have permanent results

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.039 
if she wanted to have permanent results
about<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.979> should<00:01:08.189> last<00:01:08.400> about<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.880> year

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
about this should last about a year

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.390 
about this should last about a year
exactly<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.710> what<00:01:10.860> we<00:01:11.010> know<00:01:11.189> that

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
exactly and this is what we know that

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.280 
exactly and this is what we know that
part<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.790> aging<00:01:12.119> process<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.810> not<00:01:12.990> just

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
part of the aging process is not just

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.499 
part of the aging process is not just
the<00:01:13.740> gravitational<00:01:14.490> thing<00:01:14.700> that's<00:01:14.850> losing

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
the gravitational thing that's losing

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.899 
the gravitational thing that's losing
volume<00:01:16.140> that's<00:01:16.560> why<00:01:16.830> part<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.640> what<00:01:17.759> we're

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
volume that's why part of what we're

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.940 
volume that's why part of what we're
doing<00:01:18.240> now<00:01:18.450> we're<00:01:18.750> avoiding<00:01:19.290> bigger

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
doing now we're avoiding bigger

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.060 
doing now we're avoiding bigger
procedures<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:21.450> know<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.630> her<00:01:21.750> case<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.380> get

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
procedures you know in her case to get

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.710 
procedures you know in her case to get
the<00:01:23.189> same<00:01:23.430> result<00:01:23.880> would<00:01:24.060> have<00:01:24.090> involved

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
the same result would have involved

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.899 
the same result would have involved
incisions<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.710> hair<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.340> incision<00:01:26.820> in

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
incisions in the hair and incision in

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.660 
incisions in the hair and incision in
the<00:01:26.939> upper<00:01:27.240> eyelid<00:01:27.810> sure<00:01:28.470> she<00:01:29.400> would<00:01:29.549> have

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
the upper eyelid sure she would have

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.580 
the upper eyelid sure she would have
gotten<00:01:29.880> more<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.600> left<00:01:30.840> but<00:01:31.079> she<00:01:31.409> actually

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
gotten more of a left but she actually

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.039 
gotten more of a left but she actually
is<00:01:31.829> pretty<00:01:32.100> tight<00:01:32.340> now<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.390> rate<00:01:33.689> but

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
is pretty tight now and that rate but

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.899 
is pretty tight now and that rate but
much<00:01:34.500> bigger<00:01:34.799> procedure<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.400> we<00:01:35.490> just<00:01:35.700> did<00:01:35.820> it

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
much bigger procedure and we just did it

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.630 
much bigger procedure and we just did it
with<00:01:36.060> with<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> quick<00:01:37.040> injection<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.460> is

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
with with a quick injection so this is

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.210 
with with a quick injection so this is
this<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.060> cool<00:01:39.270> stuff<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.530> know<00:01:40.979> your

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
this is cool stuff and I know your

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.800 
this is cool stuff and I know your
grandmother<00:01:41.640> although<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.210> don't<00:01:42.450> look<00:01:42.600> it

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
grandmother although you don't look it

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.780 
grandmother although you don't look it
look<00:01:43.200> like<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.740> we're<00:01:43.890> saying<00:01:44.040> if<00:01:44.399> someone<00:01:44.700> at

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
look like so we're saying if someone at

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.280 
look like so we're saying if someone at
home<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.030> watching<00:01:45.509> when<00:01:45.750> would<00:01:45.960> be<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.079> good

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
home is watching when would be a good

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.499 
home is watching when would be a good
age<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.619> consider<00:01:46.950> something<00:01:47.310> like<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:47.729> you

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
age to consider something like this you

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.910 
age to consider something like this you
know<00:01:48.570> for<00:01:48.780> most<00:01:48.899> people's<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.500> probably

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
know for most people's that probably
