my Iron Man account guys as for this
video<00:00:05.400> I<00:00:05.790> think<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.150> main<00:00:06.299> skill<00:00:06.569> be<00:00:06.690> focusing

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
video I think the main skill be focusing

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.410 
video I think the main skill be focusing
on<00:00:07.379> is<00:00:07.500> probably<00:00:07.649> thieving<00:00:08.340> just<00:00:08.970> because

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
on is probably thieving just because

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.330 
on is probably thieving just because
I've<00:00:10.320> been<00:00:10.530> putting<00:00:10.800> it<00:00:10.889> off<00:00:10.920> for<00:00:10.980> quite<00:00:11.250> a

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
I've been putting it off for quite a

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.860 
I've been putting it off for quite a
while<00:00:11.550> now<00:00:11.610> I<00:00:11.880> think<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.210> lot<00:00:12.240> of<00:00:12.420> iron<00:00:12.660> men

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
while now I think a lot of iron men

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.709 
while now I think a lot of iron men
probably<00:00:13.110> get<00:00:13.410> LCD<00:00:13.799> access<00:00:14.570> probably<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.599> lot

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
probably get LCD access probably a lot

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:16.939 
probably get LCD access probably a lot
of<00:00:15.780> them<00:00:15.900> have<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.109> do<00:00:16.230> put<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:16.619> off<00:00:16.710> for<00:00:16.920> a

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
of them have to do put it off for a

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.439 
of them have to do put it off for a
while<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.369> be<00:00:17.460> honest<00:00:17.670> with<00:00:17.789> Stephen<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.270> not

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
while to be honest with Stephen is not

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.820 
while to be honest with Stephen is not
that<00:00:18.630> much<00:00:18.779> fun<00:00:18.990> when<00:00:19.199> you<00:00:19.289> think<00:00:19.470> about<00:00:19.500> elf

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
that much fun when you think about elf

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.070 
that much fun when you think about elf
City<00:00:20.160> thieving<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.029> then<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:21.869> still

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
City thieving and then you still

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.390 
City thieving and then you still
actually<00:00:22.199> have<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.590> go<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:22.890> be<00:00:22.980> legit

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
actually have to go and be legit

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.700 
actually have to go and be legit
thieving<00:00:23.880> for<00:00:24.119> at<00:00:24.510> least<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.810> level<00:00:24.990> 90<00:00:25.289> or<00:00:25.560> so

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
thieving for at least a level 90 or so

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.980 
thieving for at least a level 90 or so
so<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.789> way<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:26.910> feeding<00:00:27.359> obviously<00:00:27.810> is

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
so the way that feeding obviously is

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.990 
so the way that feeding obviously is
starting<00:00:28.740> off<00:00:28.830> with<00:00:28.949> blackjack<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.640> did

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
starting off with blackjack I did

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.640 
starting off with blackjack I did
blackjack<00:00:30.570> for<00:00:30.720> just<00:00:30.960> about<00:00:31.170> all<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.439> my

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
blackjack for just about all of my

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.110 
blackjack for just about all of my
thieving<00:00:32.009> speed<00:00:32.340> besides<00:00:32.730> uh

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
thieving speed besides uh

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.630 
thieving speed besides uh
up<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:34.110> level<00:00:34.320> 61<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.770> believe<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.130> was<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.460> did

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
up to level 61 I believe it was I did

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.950 
up to level 61 I believe it was I did
just<00:00:35.969> don't<00:00:36.149> like<00:00:36.300> parent<00:00:36.600> plunder<00:00:36.840> and

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
just don't like parent plunder and

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.240 
just don't like parent plunder and
things<00:00:37.079> like<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.590> not<00:00:37.739> too<00:00:37.860> sure<00:00:38.040> why<00:00:38.219> I

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
things like that and not too sure why I

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
things like that and not too sure why I
think<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.579> was<00:00:38.700> finding<00:00:38.879> through<00:00:39.120> better

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
think I was finding through better

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.750 
think I was finding through better
expending<00:00:39.780> doing<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.379> bandits<00:00:40.800> but<00:00:41.430> once<00:00:41.610> I

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
expending doing the bandits but once I

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.340 
expending doing the bandits but once I
was<00:00:41.850> able<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.090> do<00:00:42.239> these<00:00:42.360> ones<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.750> just<00:00:42.780> started

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
was able to do these ones I just started

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.619 
was able to do these ones I just started
teaming<00:00:43.890> them<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.219> ever<00:00:44.579> since<00:00:44.789> then<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.090> got<00:00:45.600> a

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
teaming them and ever since then I got a

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:46.970 
teaming them and ever since then I got a
little<00:00:45.809> bit<00:00:45.989> speed<00:00:46.230> from<00:00:46.350> quest<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.829> things

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
little bit speed from quest and things

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.040 
little bit speed from quest and things
like<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.239> but<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.390> most<00:00:48.539> where<00:00:48.750> I've<00:00:48.870> done

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
like that but the most where I've done

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.260 
like that but the most where I've done
it<00:00:49.230> all<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.559> way<00:00:49.620> from<00:00:49.800> at<00:00:49.890> least<00:00:50.039> 71<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.789> 81

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
it all the way from at least 71 to 81

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.840 
it all the way from at least 71 to 81
all<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.719> way<00:00:51.980> from<00:00:52.980> just<00:00:53.129> doing<00:00:53.280> blackjack

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
all the way from just doing blackjack

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.029 
all the way from just doing blackjack
now<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.600> do<00:00:54.719> believe<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.199> most<00:00:55.350> efficient<00:00:55.920> way

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
now I do believe the most efficient way

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.350 
now I do believe the most efficient way
to<00:00:56.070> do<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.640> do<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:56.910> all<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.270> way

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
to do this is to do this all the way

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.110 
to do this is to do this all the way
till<00:00:57.600> 91<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.340> well<00:00:59.520> obviously<00:00:59.670> there<00:01:00.030> was

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
till 91 and so well obviously there was

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.540 
till 91 and so well obviously there was
no<00:01:00.210> L<00:01:00.390> City<00:01:00.660> that's<00:01:00.840> what<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.079> would<00:01:01.230> do

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
no L City that's what you would do

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.000 
no L City that's what you would do
however<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.850> RS<00:01:03.239> 3<00:01:03.600> there<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:03.989> obviously<00:01:04.619> dwarf

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
however on RS 3 there is obviously dwarf

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.289 
however on RS 3 there is obviously dwarf
traders<00:01:05.430> now<00:01:05.549> when<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.700> first<00:01:05.970> thought<00:01:06.119> about

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
traders now when I first thought about

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.250 
traders now when I first thought about
doing<00:01:06.479> they<00:01:06.659> definitely<00:01:07.020> think<00:01:07.229> about

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
doing they definitely think about

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.750 
doing they definitely think about
actually<00:01:07.470> doing<00:01:07.650> them<00:01:07.950> until<00:01:08.189> my<00:01:08.220> friend<00:01:08.580> told

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
actually doing them until my friend told

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.789 
actually doing them until my friend told
me<00:01:08.850> about<00:01:08.909> them<00:01:09.240> obviously<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.380> did<00:01:10.560> them<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:10.680> my

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
me about them obviously I did them in my

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.190 
me about them obviously I did them in my
pass<00:01:10.979> on<00:01:11.250> my<00:01:11.400> alkie<00:01:12.390> an<00:01:12.450> account<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:12.930> going<00:01:13.049> for

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
pass on my alkie an account is going for

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.590 
pass on my alkie an account is going for
5.2<00:01:13.770> that's<00:01:14.400> like<00:01:14.549> where<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.729> got<00:01:14.850> 120<00:01:15.299> thieving

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
5.2 that's like where I got 120 thieving

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.840 
5.2 that's like where I got 120 thieving
and<00:01:15.720> stuff<00:01:16.100> but<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.130> didn't<00:01:17.400> really<00:01:17.549> know<00:01:17.640> if<00:01:17.759> it

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
and stuff but I didn't really know if it

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.310 
and stuff but I didn't really know if it
was<00:01:17.939> going<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.119> be<00:01:18.180> worth<00:01:18.390> doing<00:01:18.869> at<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.170> lower

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
was going to be worth doing at the lower

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.039 
was going to be worth doing at the lower
levels<00:01:19.650> even<00:01:19.770> though<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:19.979> can<00:01:20.280> boost<00:01:20.640> your

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
levels even though you can boost your

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.499 
levels even though you can boost your
thievin<00:01:22.049> level<00:01:22.200> by<00:01:22.290> four<00:01:22.590> with<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.580> Bissell

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
thievin level by four with the Bissell

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.550 
thievin level by four with the Bissell
lurker<00:01:24.689> which<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.110> would<00:01:25.229> definitely

- I do even pick from black jacking it's

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.500 
- I do even pick from black jacking it's
like<00:02:15.260> I<00:02:15.530> think<00:02:16.010> it's<00:02:16.130> like<00:02:16.250> 60%<00:02:16.760> fast<00:02:17.270> or

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
like I think it's like 60% fast or

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.730 
like I think it's like 60% fast or
something<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.840> do<00:02:17.930> blackjack<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:18.530> so<00:02:18.620> it's

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
something to do blackjack and so it's

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.530 
something to do blackjack and so it's
just<00:02:18.920> not<00:02:19.130> worth<00:02:19.310> doing<00:02:19.430> pure<00:02:20.090> and<00:02:20.210> blender

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
just not worth doing pure and blender

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.360 
just not worth doing pure and blender
might<00:02:21.020> suck<00:02:21.290> doing<00:02:21.590> blackjack<00:02:22.070> and<00:02:22.160> cuz<00:02:22.310> you

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
might suck doing blackjack and cuz you

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.590 
might suck doing blackjack and cuz you

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.810 
gotta get out your mouse keys and stuff
but<00:02:23.960> it's<00:02:24.110> totally<00:02:24.470> worth<00:02:24.620> on<00:02:25.340> top<00:02:25.580> of<00:02:25.700> that<00:02:25.760> I

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
but it's totally worth on top of that I

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.270 
but it's totally worth on top of that I
did<00:02:26.090> go<00:02:26.240> and<00:02:26.300> get<00:02:26.450> myself<00:02:26.870> 83<00:02:27.290> summoning<00:02:27.860> just

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
did go and get myself 83 summoning just

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.150 
did go and get myself 83 summoning just
mostly<00:02:28.760> for<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.270> lava<00:02:29.600> Titan<00:02:30.080> pouch<00:02:30.320> I'm<00:02:31.010> not

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.590 
mostly for the lava Titan pouch I'm not
too<00:02:31.340> sure<00:02:31.490> why<00:02:31.640> I<00:02:31.670> didn't<00:02:31.880> get<00:02:31.970> that<00:02:32.120> before<00:02:32.270> to

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
too sure why I didn't get that before to

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.880 
too sure why I didn't get that before to
be<00:02:32.690> honest<00:02:32.930> I<00:02:32.959> just<00:02:33.170> didn't<00:02:33.560> really<00:02:33.709> want<00:02:33.830> to

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
be honest I just didn't really want to

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.980 
be honest I just didn't really want to
bother<00:02:34.070> but<00:02:34.300> yeah<00:02:35.300> lava<00:02:35.510> Titan<00:02:35.840> pouch

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990

bother but yeah lava Titan pouch
obviously<00:02:36.380> for<00:02:36.560> mining<00:02:36.950> it's<00:02:37.100> like<00:02:37.220> I<00:02:37.370> think

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
obviously for mining it's like I think

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.850 
obviously for mining it's like I think
it's<00:02:37.610> invisible<00:02:38.000> eight<00:02:38.420> or<00:02:38.780> is<00:02:38.870> it<00:02:39.020> ten<00:02:39.380> do

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
it's invisible eight or is it ten do

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.680 
it's invisible eight or is it ten do
something<00:02:40.280> like<00:02:40.400> that<00:02:40.610> I<00:02:40.820> never<00:02:41.090> understood

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
something like that I never understood

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.630 
something like that I never understood
the<00:02:41.810> whole<00:02:41.930> like<00:02:42.170> an<00:02:42.350> invisible<00:02:42.680> boost<00:02:43.310> thing

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
the whole like an invisible boost thing

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.280 
the whole like an invisible boost thing
it's<00:02:43.820> kind<00:02:44.030> of<00:02:44.120> just<00:02:44.270> like<00:02:44.450> why<00:02:44.959> didn't<00:02:45.230> this

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
it's kind of just like why didn't this

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.920 
it's kind of just like why didn't this
boost<00:02:45.830> your<00:02:46.040> startup<00:02:46.430> but<00:02:46.550> you<00:02:46.670> can't<00:02:46.970> use<00:02:47.750> it

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
boost your startup but you can't use it

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.660 
boost your startup but you can't use it
as<00:02:48.050> like<00:02:48.290> an<00:02:48.440> actual<00:02:48.709> stat<00:02:49.070> boost<00:02:49.370> I<00:02:49.489> don't

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
as like an actual stat boost I don't

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
as like an actual stat boost I don't
really<00:02:49.790> know<00:02:49.940> why<00:02:50.060> it<00:02:50.090> doesn't<00:02:50.300> just<00:02:50.510> work

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.230 
minutes I can only do four thieving so

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.830 
minutes I can only do four thieving so
that's<00:05:06.710> friggin<00:05:07.400> it<00:05:08.030> might<00:05:08.270> be<00:05:08.390> tempting

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
that's friggin it might be tempting

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.480 
that's friggin it might be tempting
to<00:05:08.870> start<00:05:09.140> feeding<00:05:09.440> early<00:05:09.860> I<00:05:09.890> mean<00:05:10.040> obviously

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
to start feeding early I mean obviously

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.490 
to start feeding early I mean obviously
I<00:05:10.610> think<00:05:10.730> level<00:05:11.150> 91<00:05:11.540> thieving<00:05:12.140> is<00:05:12.260> where<00:05:12.410> you

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
I think level 91 thieving is where you

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.500 
I think level 91 thieving is where you
can<00:05:12.650> start<00:05:12.920> thieving<00:05:13.370> the<00:05:13.490> lowest<00:05:13.970> level<00:05:14.270> clan

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
can start thieving the lowest level clan

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.600 
can start thieving the lowest level clan
which<00:05:15.020> means<00:05:15.260> if<00:05:15.380> you<00:05:15.470> are<00:05:15.500> 87th<00:05:16.250> diamond<00:05:16.550> you

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
which means if you are 87th diamond you

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.850 
which means if you are 87th diamond you
can<00:05:16.640> boost<00:05:16.970> it<00:05:17.210> with<00:05:17.240> a<00:05:17.360> lurker<00:05:17.780> up<00:05:18.020> to<00:05:18.200> 91<00:05:18.650> and

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
can boost it with a lurker up to 91 and

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.590 
can boost it with a lurker up to 91 and
you<00:05:19.190> can<00:05:19.280> technically<00:05:19.700> start<00:05:19.970> doing<00:05:20.210> LCD

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
you can technically start doing LCD

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.970 
you can technically start doing LCD
themed<00:05:20.750> but<00:05:21.080> hold<00:05:21.320> that<00:05:21.470> off<00:05:21.620> for<00:05:21.800> a<00:05:21.830> little

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:21.980 
themed but hold that off for a little

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.860 
themed but hold that off for a little
bit<00:05:22.100> just<00:05:22.460> go<00:05:22.940> ahead<00:05:23.060> need<00:05:23.300> warp<00:05:23.540> shooters<00:05:23.780> in

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
bit just go ahead need warp shooters in

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.620 
bit just go ahead need warp shooters in
level<00:05:24.110> 86<00:05:24.500> to<00:05:24.740> like<00:05:25.100> level<00:05:25.490> 90

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
level 86 to like level 90

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.770 
level 86 to like level 90
I<00:05:26.660> wouldn't<00:05:27.410> say<00:05:27.500> 93<00:05:28.220> from<00:05:28.580> level<00:05:28.940> like<00:05:29.060> 86<00:05:29.600> and

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
I wouldn't say 93 from level like 86 and

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.540 
I wouldn't say 93 from level like 86 and
then<00:05:29.870> you<00:05:29.960> can<00:05:30.080> basically<00:05:30.230> boost<00:05:30.620> up<00:05:30.830> to<00:05:30.920> 97

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
then you can basically boost up to 97

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.670 
then you can basically boost up to 97
and<00:05:31.670> do<00:05:32.090> just<00:05:32.360> about<00:05:32.510> every<00:05:32.780> clan<00:05:33.020> besides<00:05:33.410> a

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
and do just about every clan besides a

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.560 
and do just about every clan besides a
mil<00:05:34.040> year<00:05:34.280> claim<00:05:34.520> which<00:05:34.700> is<00:05:34.730> like<00:05:34.940> level<00:05:35.240> 98

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
mil year claim which is like level 98

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.600 
mil year claim which is like level 98
thieving<00:05:35.990> requirement<00:05:36.500> but<00:05:37.040> yes<00:05:37.190> it<00:05:37.370> is<00:05:37.430> quite

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
thieving requirement but yes it is quite

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.370 
thieving requirement but yes it is quite
a<00:05:37.730> hassle<00:05:38.030> to<00:05:38.270> get<00:05:38.750> into<00:05:38.990> feeding<00:05:39.200> but

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
a hassle to get into feeding but

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.350 
a hassle to get into feeding but
obviously<00:05:39.710> once<00:05:39.920> you<00:05:40.040> get<00:05:40.220> 99<00:05:40.640> it's<00:05:40.850> very<00:05:41.060> easy

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
obviously once you get 99 it's very easy

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.850 
obviously once you get 99 it's very easy
and<00:05:41.540> simply<00:05:41.870> you<00:05:41.990> just<00:05:42.200> go<00:05:42.350> to<00:05:42.410> whatever<00:05:42.560> claim

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
and simply you just go to whatever claim

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.780 
and simply you just go to whatever claim
you<00:05:42.980> want<00:05:43.100> you<00:05:43.250> not<00:05:43.370> to<00:05:43.430> worry<00:05:43.550> about<00:05:43.640> the

you want you not to worry about the

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.270 
you want you not to worry about the
lurkers<00:05:44.180> anymore<00:05:44.650> so<00:05:45.650> hopefully<00:05:46.040> I'll<00:05:46.130> get

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
lurkers anymore so hopefully I'll get

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.910 
lurkers anymore so hopefully I'll get

man high scores for thieving is 100
formula<00:07:03.760> P<00:07:03.910> basically<00:07:04.180> for<00:07:04.510> top<00:07:04.630> page<00:07:05.040> but

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:06.040 
formula P basically for top page but

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.830 
formula P basically for top page but
there's<00:07:06.190> like<00:07:06.310> 10<00:07:06.610> people<00:07:06.850> with<00:07:07.090> like<00:07:07.210> 100<00:07:07.390> for

can<00:07:11.530> maintain<00:07:12.010> top<00:07:12.430> page<00:07:12.640> I<00:07:12.850> guess<00:07:13.000> I'm<00:07:13.120> not

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:13.270 
can maintain top page I guess I'm not

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.370 
can maintain top page I guess I'm not
too<00:07:13.390> sure<00:07:13.540> those<00:07:13.660> people<00:07:13.810> will<00:07:13.990> continue

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:14.380 
too sure those people will continue

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.590 
too sure those people will continue
thieving<00:07:14.680> or<00:07:14.800> not<00:07:14.950> but<00:07:15.250> I<00:07:15.670> would<00:07:16.270> like<00:07:16.420> to

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:16.600 
thieving or not but I would like to

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.000 
thieving or not but I would like to
finish<00:07:16.750> it<00:07:16.900> sometime<00:07:17.290> in<00:07:17.380> the<00:07:17.440> future<00:07:17.590> I<00:07:17.800> think

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.010 
finish it sometime in the future I think

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:19.650 
finish it sometime in the future I think
it's<00:07:18.100> like<00:07:18.250> almost<00:07:18.580> three<00:07:18.790> hundred<00:07:18.850> mill<00:07:19.150> GPU
