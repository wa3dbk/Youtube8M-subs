it facing this way er yeah just this way
then<00:00:35.730> place<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.390> minecart<00:00:37.320> there<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.680> then

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
then place a minecart there and then

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.060 
then place a minecart there and then
break<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.190> now<00:00:38.940> what<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.180> want<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.420> do<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:40.070> dig

break it now what you want to do is dig

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.680 
break it now what you want to do is dig
two<00:00:41.280> lofts<00:00:41.489> underneath<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.030> place<00:00:42.210> at<00:00:42.420> least

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
two lofts underneath and place at least

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.310 
two lofts underneath and place at least
two<00:00:43.219> so<00:00:44.219> if<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:45.270> place<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.719> run<00:00:45.870> cars<00:00:46.110> like

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
two so if you place to run cars like

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.340 
two so if you place to run cars like
this<00:00:46.530> it'll<00:00:47.520> make<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:48.629> kind<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:48.960> explosion

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
this it'll make this kind of explosion

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.520 
this it'll make this kind of explosion
if<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.890> place<00:00:50.250> five<00:00:50.550> it'll<00:00:51.030> make<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.690> if

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
pressure plate over the TT carts so if

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.050 
pressure plate over the TT carts so if
you<00:01:16.890> step<00:01:17.159> on<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.460> on<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.729> choose<00:01:17.909> my

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
you step on it on you choose my

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.990 
you step on it on you choose my
game-mode<00:01:18.450> actually<00:01:20.150> see<00:01:21.150> if<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.360> die<00:01:22.970> all<00:01:23.970> I

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
game-mode actually see if I die all I

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.990 
game-mode actually see if I die all I
didn't<00:01:24.360> get<00:01:24.479> lunch<00:01:24.630> stuff<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.890> died<00:01:26.130> yeah

explosion will be get ready I'll seize
my<00:01:45.149> game<00:01:45.390> mode<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:46.409> I'll<00:01:46.530> go<00:01:46.680> flying<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.100> there

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
my game mode so I'll go flying to there

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.210 
my game mode so I'll go flying to there
I<00:01:47.579> think<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.119> go<00:01:48.299> above<00:01:48.750> cloud<00:01:49.020> level<00:01:49.380> I'm<00:01:50.100> not

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
I think I go above cloud level I'm not

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.940 
I think I go above cloud level I'm not
really<00:01:50.399> sure<00:01:50.670> let's<00:01:51.390> see<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:52.439> I'll<00:01:52.530> press<00:01:52.770> f3

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
so we can look at the y-coordinate and

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.420 
so we can look at the y-coordinate and
you<00:01:56.280> step<00:01:56.549> on<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.850> boom
