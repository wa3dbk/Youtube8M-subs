00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
hey guys welcome to a quick tutorial for

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.220 
hey guys welcome to a quick tutorial for
the<00:00:13.740> people<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.160> junkyard<00:00:14.370> server<00:00:15.230> we've

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
the people of the junkyard server we've

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.510 
the people of the junkyard server we've
installed<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.619> new<00:00:16.770> plug-in<00:00:17.010> on<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.279> server

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
installed the new plug-in on the server

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.480 
installed the new plug-in on the server
called<00:00:17.789> voxel<00:00:18.270> chat<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:19.470> essentially<00:00:20.369> what

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
called voxel chat and essentially what

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.210 
called voxel chat and essentially what
that<00:00:20.520> allows<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:20.910> for<00:00:21.590> you<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.710> get<00:00:22.890> people's

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
that allows is for you to get people's

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.130 
that allows is for you to get people's
chatting<00:00:23.609> speech<00:00:23.939> bubbles<00:00:24.359> on<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.600> screen

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
chatting speech bubbles on the screen

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.710 
chatting speech bubbles on the screen
so<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.070> thought<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.670> does<00:00:26.849> require<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.240> client

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
so I thought it does require a client

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.509 
so I thought it does require a client
mod<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.170> we<00:00:28.380> thought<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.830> we'd<00:00:28.949> do<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.160> quick

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
mod so we thought that we'd do a quick

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.009 
mod so we thought that we'd do a quick
tutorial<00:00:29.670> for<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.240> guys<00:00:30.420> showing<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.869> how<00:00:30.990> to

tutorial for you guys showing you how to
install<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.529> it's<00:00:32.250> really<00:00:32.730> straightforward

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
install it it's really straightforward

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.229 
install it it's really straightforward
but<00:00:35.040> yeah<00:00:35.219> we<00:00:35.399> thought<00:00:35.550> we'd<00:00:35.700> do<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.820> video<00:00:36.030> just

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
you can see I prize distance changing in

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.640 
you can see I prize distance changing in
the<00:06:38.669> background<00:06:39.030> there<00:06:39.240> you<00:06:39.870> can<00:06:40.050> have<00:06:40.259> color

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650 
the background there you can have color

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.689 
the background there you can have color
names<00:06:40.949> I<00:06:41.250> think<00:06:42.060> that<00:06:42.509> depends<00:06:43.020> on<00:06:43.830> the<00:06:44.460> server

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:44.699 
names I think that depends on the server

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:46.010 
names I think that depends on the server
settings<00:06:45.030> we'll<00:06:45.509> have<00:06:45.630> to<00:06:45.690> have<00:06:45.750> a<00:06:45.810> look<00:06:45.900> at

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 
settings we'll have to have a look at

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.870 
settings we'll have to have a look at
that<00:06:46.110> and<00:06:46.289> you<00:06:46.710> can<00:06:46.860> turn<00:06:47.039> the<00:06:47.280> chat<00:06:47.580> bubbles

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 
that and you can turn the chat bubbles

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.939 
that and you can turn the chat bubbles
on<00:06:48.000> and<00:06:48.150> off<00:06:48.240> and<00:06:48.509> how<00:06:49.080> many<00:06:49.259> seconds<00:06:49.770> they

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:49.949 
on and off and how many seconds they

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:52.969 
on and off and how many seconds they
stay<00:06:50.130> on<00:06:50.159> the<00:06:50.370> screen<00:06:50.550> for<00:06:51.440> and<00:06:52.440> one<00:06:52.770> last

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:52.979 
stay on the screen for and one last

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:56.300 
stay on the screen for and one last
thing<00:06:53.070> you<00:06:53.130> can<00:06:53.219> change<00:06:53.580> their<00:06:53.759> name<00:06:53.969> size<00:06:55.310> so

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:56.310 
thing you can change their name size so

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.510 
thing you can change their name size so
you<00:06:56.370> can<00:06:56.520> make<00:06:56.669> a<00:06:56.699> huge<00:06:57.120> or<00:06:58.020> tiny<00:06:58.349> so<00:06:59.159> tiny<00:06:59.190> we

00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 
you can make a huge or tiny so tiny we

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.459 
you can make a huge or tiny so tiny we
can't<00:06:59.699> even<00:06:59.789> see<00:06:59.969> it

00:07:00.459 --> 00:07:00.469 
can't even see it

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:02.600 
can't even see it
and<00:07:01.469> you<00:07:01.590> can<00:07:01.710> change<00:07:01.800> the<00:07:01.979> bubble<00:07:02.250> size<00:07:02.400> as

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:02.610 
and you can change the bubble size as

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.249 
and you can change the bubble size as
well<00:07:02.789> so<00:07:03.000> I<00:07:03.030> thought<00:07:03.240> I'd<00:07:03.360> just<00:07:03.719> quickly<00:07:04.050> cover

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:04.259 
well so I thought I'd just quickly cover

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:06.230 
well so I thought I'd just quickly cover
that<00:07:04.409> and<00:07:04.710> you<00:07:05.250> can<00:07:05.400> also<00:07:05.550> change<00:07:06.090> the

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 
that and you can also change the

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.020 
that and you can also change the
distance<00:07:06.889> after<00:07:07.889> sixty<00:07:08.340> four<00:07:08.550> blocks<00:07:08.849> you

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:09.030 
distance after sixty four blocks you

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.399 
distance after sixty four blocks you
won't<00:07:09.210> be<00:07:09.330> able<00:07:09.539> to<00:07:09.630> see<00:07:09.780> the<00:07:09.900> players<00:07:10.080> name

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:10.409 
won't be able to see the players name

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:12.920 
won't be able to see the players name
but<00:07:11.340> you<00:07:11.430> could<00:07:11.550> change<00:07:11.759> that<00:07:12.000> in<00:07:12.180> there<00:07:12.360> to<00:07:12.509> 32

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:12.930 
but you could change that in there to 32

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.439 
but you could change that in there to 32
or<00:07:13.169> 128<00:07:14.039> you<00:07:14.250> know<00:07:14.370> whatever<00:07:14.909> you<00:07:15.150> whatever

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:22.969 
guys know him I'll show the name see if
I<00:07:21.690> put<00:07:22.050> the<00:07:22.139> name<00:07:22.259> size<00:07:22.469> all<00:07:22.650> the<00:07:22.680> way<00:07:22.740> down<00:07:22.889> to

00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:22.979 
I put the name size all the way down to

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:24.709 
I put the name size all the way down to
minimum<00:07:23.219> it<00:07:23.430> basically<00:07:24.150> makes<00:07:24.389> it<00:07:24.449> invisible

00:07:24.709 --> 00:07:24.719 
minimum it basically makes it invisible

00:07:24.719 --> 00:07:27.400 
minimum it basically makes it invisible
i<00:07:25.669> poisoning

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:27.410 
i poisoning

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.130 
i poisoning
yeah<00:07:28.400> I<00:07:28.610> think<00:07:28.700> that's<00:07:28.970> a<00:07:29.060> decent<00:07:29.240> size<00:07:29.870> and

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:30.140 
yeah I think that's a decent size and

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.320 
yeah I think that's a decent size and
the<00:07:30.620> bubble<00:07:30.860> size<00:07:31.010> is<00:07:31.250> you<00:07:31.760> can<00:07:31.910> experiment

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:32.330 
the bubble size is you can experiment

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.600 
the bubble size is you can experiment
with<00:07:32.570> those<00:07:32.810> but<00:07:33.050> that's<00:07:33.230> the<00:07:33.320> f6<00:07:33.860> and<00:07:34.010> the<00:07:34.130> f9

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:34.610 
with those but that's the f6 and the f9

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.160 
with those but that's the f6 and the f9
menu<00:07:35.000> go<00:07:35.180> so<00:07:35.330> you<00:07:35.420> might<00:07:35.570> want<00:07:35.720> to<00:07:35.750> have<00:07:35.900> a<00:07:35.960> look
