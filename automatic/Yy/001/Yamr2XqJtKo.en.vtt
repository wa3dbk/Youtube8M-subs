Need for Speed Carbon - Spike Strip Pursuit (Part 5)

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.780
This... um... pursuit is gonna make you palpitate with fear!

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.820
(Sequel to Part 4) Eventually we escaped.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.740
So we thought. On our way to the safehouse we were spotted by Corvette cops.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.860
I: "Get out of our way, idiots! You think you can get Corrow's Audi that easily? We ain't that stupid! Of course the only rational thing to do now is... BOUNCE!!!

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.580
I: "Ram him!"

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.040
Haha! What a stupid guy! We can just drive by him!

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.560
Ad: *gulp* They grow in numbers!

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.580
I: Watch out for those SUVs!

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.800
Ad: Good idea avoiding the roadblock by taking the shortcut.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.200
Corrow: "Uiuiuiui! The tires are slippery because of the water barrel" (of course that doesn't make any sense)

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.960
I: Don't mess this up! There are too many of them!

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.500
Corrow: we're not to blame if you wreck your own cars!

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.520
I: Holy Christ! A roadblock with spike strips!

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.980
I: Thank heaven the car's still working. But the handling is a bit... strange.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.020
Corrow: I need to reset the car!

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.460
Cross: Just surrender! You stand no chance against my minions!

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.340
Cross: Got you now!

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.860
I: No!

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.340
Corrow: let's find a breaker per GPS.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.260
I: What this car needs is nitro. Lots of boost!

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.720
I: This is Neon Mile, the high street.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.520
Ad: But there was a stopper! -Corrow: So what?

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.940
I: This cop's a tough nut! But now's the time to finish him!

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.480
Corrow: Now they lost sight of us.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:28.220
I: Staying here makes the cooldown go faster.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:41.060
That was thrilling, right? And do you also agree that the best part was Corrow seeing the spike strips for the first time?

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.180
I honestly didn't except the car to be working even after hitting the spikes in this game. In MW the pursuit would've been over in an instant.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.240
Thanks for watching!
