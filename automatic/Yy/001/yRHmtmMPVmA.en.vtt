00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.139
 this project is a usb interface that 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.269
 has 32 outputs capable of driving 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.190
 simple help or triac objects 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.860
 to feed hiring is 230 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:18.430
 volts this interface is built 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:22.289
 around a spade 18f 45 50 and 2 2 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.240
 pork expanders 85 74 pcf 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.609
 without the expander of pigs that are 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.980
 Optional the interface has sixteen 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.810
 native outings 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.880
 the peak software was developed in 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.470
 the micro-pascal environment and the 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.559
 tests were performed on a platinum 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.809
 development isip x is the prototype 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.650
 visible in this video only makes 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.379
 pilot led 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.629
 everything was designed to be piloted 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.910
 directly through my proxy software that a 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.720
 which is a sequencer software 32 votes 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.720
 and runs on windows
