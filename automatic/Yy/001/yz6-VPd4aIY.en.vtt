00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
to duck it all the way down and do a

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.180 
to duck it all the way down and do a
regular<00:00:34.910> commentary<00:00:35.600> and<00:00:35.809> right<00:00:36.379> there<00:00:36.680> we're

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
regular commentary and right there we're

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.819 
regular commentary and right there we're
playing<00:00:37.399> on<00:00:37.760> cows<00:00:38.300> on<00:00:38.510> temple<00:00:38.899> and<00:00:39.079> you

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
playing on cows on temple and you

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:41.500 
playing on cows on temple and you
definitely<00:00:40.129> do<00:00:40.730> not<00:00:40.760> want<00:00:41.090> to<00:00:41.180> let<00:00:41.239> the<00:00:41.390> other

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
definitely do not want to let the other

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.290 
definitely do not want to let the other
team<00:00:41.570> have<00:00:42.050> the<00:00:42.320> be<00:00:42.590> the<00:00:43.190> beef<00:00:43.340> leg<00:00:43.610> because

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
team have the be the beef leg because

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.090 
team have the be the beef leg because
it's<00:00:44.480> a<00:00:44.539> very<00:00:44.570> choked<00:00:44.960> pony<00:00:45.230> map<00:00:45.500> so<00:00:45.800> if<00:00:45.980> they

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
it's a very choked pony map so if they

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.799 
it's a very choked pony map so if they
get<00:00:46.309> that<00:00:46.489> and<00:00:46.760> they<00:00:46.789> start<00:00:47.270> to<00:00:47.360> push<00:00:47.539> you<00:00:47.660> back

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
get that and they start to push you back

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.290 
get that and they start to push you back
then<00:00:48.140> it's<00:00:48.739> a<00:00:48.860> big<00:00:49.039> problem<00:00:49.309> and<00:00:49.640> we<00:00:49.879> both<00:00:50.090> make

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
then it's a big problem and we both make

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.750 
then it's a big problem and we both make
a<00:00:50.329> quick<00:00:50.780> push<00:00:50.989> I<00:00:51.230> die<00:00:51.320> right<00:00:52.039> off<00:00:52.190> the<00:00:52.340> bat<00:00:52.489> but

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
a quick push I die right off the bat but

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.910 
a quick push I die right off the bat but
we<00:00:53.539> do<00:00:53.660> get<00:00:53.809> the<00:00:53.930> cap<00:00:54.140> and<00:00:54.410> as<00:00:54.559> you'll<00:00:54.739> see

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.790 
not just instinct yet i have to actually
put<00:04:42.419> some<00:04:42.449> thought<00:04:42.720> into<00:04:42.780> it<00:04:43.020> which<00:04:43.530> is<00:04:43.680> why

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
put some thought into it which is why

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.010 
put some thought into it which is why
you'll<00:04:44.009> see<00:04:44.190> sometimes<00:04:44.639> that<00:04:44.789> i<00:04:45.389> take<00:04:45.810> some

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
you'll see sometimes that i take some

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.080 
you'll see sometimes that i take some
silly<00:04:46.229> deaths<00:04:46.470> and<00:04:46.830> i'll<00:04:47.220> fail<00:04:47.580> trying<00:04:47.909> to

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
silly deaths and i'll fail trying to

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.850 
silly deaths and i'll fail trying to
switch<00:04:48.330> between<00:04:48.509> weapons<00:04:49.139> and<00:04:49.409> that<00:04:49.500> sort<00:04:49.800> of

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
switch between weapons and that sort of

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.890 
switch between weapons and that sort of
thing<00:04:49.919> when<00:04:50.879> i'm<00:04:51.030> in<00:04:51.210> a<00:04:51.300> pressure<00:04:51.569> situation

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
thing when i'm in a pressure situation

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.869 
thing when i'm in a pressure situation
and<00:04:52.500> when<00:04:52.740> everything's<00:04:53.039> going<00:04:53.340> well<00:04:53.520> that's

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:53.879 
and when everything's going well that's

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:55.939 
and when everything's going well that's
typically<00:04:54.240> not<00:04:54.389> a<00:04:54.449> problem<00:04:54.930> but<00:04:55.110> getting

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
typically not a problem but getting

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.550 
typically not a problem but getting
better<00:04:56.069> and<00:04:56.750> have<00:04:57.750> lots<00:04:57.960> more<00:04:58.050> videos<00:04:58.169> to<00:04:58.440> come

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
better and have lots more videos to come

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.589 
better and have lots more videos to come
that's<00:04:59.460> pretty<00:04:59.639> much<00:04:59.819> the<00:04:59.879> end<00:05:00.030> of<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.360> game<00:05:00.389> i

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:00.599 
that's pretty much the end of the game i

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:03.050 
that's pretty much the end of the game i
think<00:05:01.020> it<00:05:01.500> was<00:05:01.710> it<00:05:02.069> was<00:05:02.250> really<00:05:02.699> quick<00:05:02.880> i

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
think it was it was really quick i

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.850 
think it was it was really quick i
