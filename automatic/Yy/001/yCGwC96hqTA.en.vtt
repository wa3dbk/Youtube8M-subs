 our goods we arrived at the glass though 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.189

 do not yet be like him on 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.980
 rope pull really was 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.950
 it can be traced to him since me 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.510
 I chose a man who is already the best here 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.670
 but from a professional point of view, 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.870
 stationary point of view I don't even 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.480
 I tried not to get used to it so much 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.699
 morning tokens of something taldychil experience I do not 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.680
 I understand the kivins to share to where they even 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.489
 can't hear the music just the music turned on 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:03.180
 she and at times up to 5 and here on stage me 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.000
 honestly hit but only from 20 minutes to 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.520
 going to the scene cut the girls lectured 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.520
 and rap this work I'm my job 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:20.509
 you can spend on them type take 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:23.960
 no shoulders here I understood I can sing 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:26.150
 rehearse for a long time and perform poorly 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.479
 can minimally rehearse and manage 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.399
 ok concentrate on the stage already 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.330
 No, but if it is so of course 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:34.009
 if this play 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.820
 they were not seriously please here 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.820
 just not serious 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:55.350
 something jalla law 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.350
 an actor sketch can start what 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:09.000
 she doesnâ€™t finish everything so much 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:12.380
 thats all not finished foolishly when 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.380
 she is dancing stupidly 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.890
 it is generally hard this is the theater of the young spectator 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.730
 it's accuracy with that here 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.730
 Yoshkar-Ola 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.430
 coloring bedtime story 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:40.099
 she didn't finish the other replayed everything 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.769
 what happened i didn't even understand whose 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:45.620
 general idea 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:50.750
 cartoon well who cartoon looked from 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:54.170
 I mean you, my idea is excellent and what 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:57.170
 Nastya about the cartoon told that 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:01.819
 there was such a girl she had strength in 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:05.569
 her hair was stolen by an evil witch 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.640
 this hair was like an elixir of youth but 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.700
 watch your duet really 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.079
 interesting direction but nothing can 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.560
 say good 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:17.269
 about its implementation, do you think 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.459
 This choreography corresponds to the level 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.620
 in till found it just a compromise 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.900
 choreography what is the night compromise then 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.819
 choreography let's say so i was not originally 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.099
 wanted to offer choreography strong 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:33.200
 as I understood that it is unreal and 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:36.049
 stay alone human and do me 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.510
 my level would have done her job 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.450
 as if you are not blowing very strange 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.840
 the solution I can say that all that we 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.660
 today saw this small town 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:51.349
 provincial theater of the young spectator tyuz 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.450
 On the whole, it looked but not interesting . 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:59.180
 I think that all the same 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:04:00.170
 he made a lot of me so what 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.500
 regret something 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:06.440
 I don't know, then Mom tried to do 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:11.170
 definitely made me help here 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.170
 do all we understand search
