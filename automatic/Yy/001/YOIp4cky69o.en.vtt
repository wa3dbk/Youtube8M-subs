and it's going to come down and they'll

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.740 
and it's going to come down and they'll
so<00:03:06.870> maybe<00:03:07.140> have<00:03:07.379> another<00:03:07.470> one<00:03:07.769> right<00:03:07.950> in<00:03:08.099> here

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
just the point that's sticking out here

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:27.280 
just the point that's sticking out here
normal<00:03:13.769> in<00:03:14.159> the<00:03:14.310> water

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290

back up the hill here and then we can

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.370 
back up the hill here and then we can
see<00:03:43.950> just<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:44.280> little<00:03:44.310> bit<00:03:44.550> of<00:03:44.700> a<00:03:44.790> cottage<00:03:45.209> just

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
to help block that back into the trees

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.110 
to help block that back into the trees
and<00:04:14.020> then<00:04:15.020> there's<00:04:15.230> smart<00:04:15.910> there's<00:04:16.910> more

trees in this line here I'll put another
one<00:04:21.500> in<00:04:21.530> right<00:04:21.920> in<00:04:22.100> here<00:04:22.370> perhaps<00:04:22.880> something

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
one in right in here perhaps something

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.850 
one in right in here perhaps something
like<00:04:24.140> that<00:04:25.630> and<00:04:26.630> then<00:04:26.780> this<00:04:27.200> line<00:04:27.470> here<00:04:27.740> I'll

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
like that and then this line here I'll

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.880 
like that and then this line here I'll
continue<00:04:28.280> across<00:04:28.700> back<00:04:29.630> there<00:04:31.210> put<00:04:32.210> a<00:04:32.240> couple

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
continue across back there put a couple

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:40.750 
continue across back there put a couple
Deadwood<00:04:33.890> sticking<00:04:34.310> up<00:04:34.490> there<00:04:39.310> and<00:04:40.310> some<00:04:40.580> more

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
Deadwood sticking up there and some more

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.940 
Deadwood sticking up there and some more
have<00:04:41.630> it<00:04:41.780> have<00:04:41.900> a<00:04:41.930> couple<00:04:42.290> more<00:04:42.470> coming<00:04:42.860> up

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
have it have a couple more coming up

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:49.480 
have it have a couple more coming up
this<00:04:43.190> is<00:04:43.700> here<00:04:44.120> someplace<00:04:46.060> so<00:04:48.040> the<00:04:49.040> idea<00:04:49.340> is

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
this is here someplace so the idea is

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.170 
this is here someplace so the idea is
that<00:04:49.520> the<00:04:49.910> building<00:04:50.720> is<00:04:50.900> not<00:04:51.770> in<00:04:52.610> real<00:04:52.910> plain

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
that the building is not in real plain

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.510 
that the building is not in real plain

view of the lake and then there's

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.400 
view of the lake and then there's
there's<00:04:58.730> some<00:04:59.030> shoreline<00:04:59.570> showing<00:04:59.960> up<00:05:00.110> over

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
there's some shoreline showing up over

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.180 
there's some shoreline showing up over
here<00:05:00.770> and<00:05:01.370> some<00:05:02.120> work<00:05:02.300> some<00:05:02.780> more<00:05:02.960> tree<00:05:03.770> trunks

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
here and some work some more tree trunks

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:10.690 
here and some work some more tree trunks
in<00:05:04.340> here<00:05:04.580> in<00:05:04.790> places<00:05:08.140> and<00:05:09.140> now<00:05:10.040> the<00:05:10.100> water<00:05:10.520> is

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
in here in places and now the water is

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.430 
in here in places and now the water is
pretty<00:05:10.880> active<00:05:11.390> right<00:05:11.570> now<00:05:11.600> earlier<00:05:12.110> this

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
pretty active right now earlier this

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.060 
pretty active right now earlier this
morning

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
morning

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.760 
morning
it<00:05:13.430> was<00:05:13.610> it<00:05:14.180> was<00:05:14.240> like<00:05:14.420> a<00:05:14.870> mirror<00:05:15.320> reflection

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
it was it was like a mirror reflection

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.680 
it was it was like a mirror reflection
but<00:05:16.100> with<00:05:16.370> the<00:05:16.520> but<00:05:16.850> the<00:05:16.970> breeze<00:05:17.180> right<00:05:17.510> now

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
but with the but the breeze right now

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.530 
but with the but the breeze right now
why<00:05:17.870> the<00:05:18.530> reflections<00:05:19.160> are<00:05:19.310> pretty<00:05:19.490> well<00:05:19.700> gone

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:20.540 
why the reflections are pretty well gone

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.900 
why the reflections are pretty well gone
but<00:05:21.470> I'm<00:05:21.590> gonna<00:05:21.800> I'm<00:05:22.160> gonna<00:05:22.310> show<00:05:22.640> some

but I'm gonna I'm gonna show some

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:28.840 
but I'm gonna I'm gonna show some
reflections<00:05:23.540> in<00:05:23.750> here<00:05:26.110> and<00:05:27.110> it'll<00:05:27.950> be<00:05:28.070> it'll

reflections in here and it'll be it'll

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:29.800 
reflections in here and it'll be it'll

way across there and in these bushes

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.780 
way across there and in these bushes
that<00:05:35.780> are<00:05:36.410> coming<00:05:36.920> around<00:05:37.130> on<00:05:37.370> the<00:05:37.490> shoreline

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790 
that are coming around on the shoreline

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.050 
that are coming around on the shoreline
here<00:05:39.220> they're<00:05:40.220> gonna<00:05:40.400> be<00:05:40.610> coming<00:05:40.910> in<00:05:41.030> here

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060

like<00:05:41.450> so

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
like so

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.760 
like so
and<00:05:43.760> again<00:05:44.540> I<00:05:44.570> just<00:05:44.690> I'm<00:05:45.140> not<00:05:45.320> going<00:05:45.470> to<00:05:45.560> try<00:05:45.710> to

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
and again I just I'm not going to try to

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.910 
and again I just I'm not going to try to
copy<00:05:46.100> and<00:05:46.370> I'm<00:05:46.460> just<00:05:46.670> trying<00:05:46.880> to<00:05:47.000> put<00:05:47.900> stuff<00:05:48.710> in

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920 
copy and I'm just trying to put stuff in

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.550 
copy and I'm just trying to put stuff in
here<00:05:49.070> that<00:05:49.130> it's<00:05:49.550> going<00:05:49.610> to<00:05:49.880> be<00:05:50.530> look<00:05:51.530> like

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
here that it's going to be look like

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.210 
here that it's going to be look like
that<00:05:52.190> line<00:05:52.940> of<00:05:53.120> bushes<00:05:53.680> that<00:05:54.680> are<00:05:54.800> growing<00:05:55.070> up

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
that line of bushes that are growing up

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.370 
that line of bushes that are growing up
here<00:05:55.430> along<00:05:55.640> the<00:05:55.760> shoreline<00:05:58.660> and<00:05:59.660> then<00:06:00.140> maybe

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
here along the shoreline and then maybe

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.280 
here along the shoreline and then maybe
one<00:06:00.650> right<00:06:00.890> down<00:06:01.070> here<00:06:01.520> where<00:06:02.450> that<00:06:02.600> goes<00:06:03.110> off

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:03.290 
one right down here where that goes off

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:04.090 
one right down here where that goes off
the<00:06:03.320> papers

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.100 
the papers

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.460 
the papers
stop<00:06:04.700> that<00:06:04.910> line<00:06:06.850> and<00:06:07.850> then<00:06:08.840> the<00:06:08.990> hillsides

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.470 
stop that line and then the hillsides

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.590 
stop that line and then the hillsides
coming<00:06:09.800> up<00:06:09.920> here<00:06:10.130> I'll<00:06:10.580> probably<00:06:11.060> have<00:06:11.390> some

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 
coming up here I'll probably have some

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.830 
coming up here I'll probably have some
shadows<00:06:12.110> coming<00:06:12.380> up<00:06:12.590> on<00:06:13.010> this<00:06:13.520> hillside

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.640 

shadows<00:06:16.840> from<00:06:16.990> the<00:06:17.080> bushes

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:25.139 

and<00:06:20.650> we're<00:06:20.830> ready<00:06:21.009> to<00:06:21.219> paint<00:06:21.749> just<00:06:22.749> like<00:06:22.900> that
