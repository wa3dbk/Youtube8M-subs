00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
out with MCC yeah it felt good for the

first<00:00:09.719> few<00:00:10.050> laps<00:00:10.170> in<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.469> middle<00:00:10.679> I<00:00:10.740> was

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
first few laps in the middle I was

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.709 
first few laps in the middle I was
definitely<00:00:11.040> definitely<00:00:11.610> feeling<00:00:12.090> it<00:00:12.179> but

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
definitely definitely feeling it but

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.570 
definitely definitely feeling it but
yeah<00:00:13.410> that<00:00:13.530> was<00:00:13.620> kind<00:00:13.799> of<00:00:13.830> my<00:00:13.920> race<00:00:14.130> plan<00:00:14.340> going

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
yeah that was kind of my race plan going

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.640 
yeah that was kind of my race plan going
in<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:14.969> didn't<00:00:15.150> want<00:00:15.299> it<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.480> be<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.630> slow<00:00:15.990> race<00:00:16.230> so

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
in I didn't want it to be a slow race so

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.220 
in I didn't want it to be a slow race so
I<00:00:16.920> figured<00:00:17.609> even<00:00:17.789> like<00:00:18.330> last<00:00:18.630> year<00:00:18.960> it<00:00:18.990> went

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
I figured even like last year it went

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.560 
I figured even like last year it went
out<00:00:19.380> really<00:00:19.710> really<00:00:19.800> slow<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.609> my<00:00:21.210> plan<00:00:21.420> was

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
out really really slow and my plan was

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.870 
out really really slow and my plan was
just<00:00:21.779> kind<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.470> go<00:00:22.740> out<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.310> if<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:23.699> wouldn't

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
just kind of go out and if it wouldn't

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.400 
just kind of go out and if it wouldn't
that<00:00:24.000> slow<00:00:24.210> them<00:00:24.420> just<00:00:24.600> like<00:00:24.810> me<00:00:24.869> push<00:00:25.260> the

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
that slow them just like me push the

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.290 
that slow them just like me push the
pace<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.800> if<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.010> didn't<00:00:26.310> then<00:00:26.460> just<00:00:27.150> hang

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
pace and if it didn't then just hang

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.299 
pace and if it didn't then just hang
onto<00:00:27.449> whoever<00:00:27.720> rose<00:00:28.050> out<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.380> front<00:00:33.260> yeah
