00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.410 

okay<00:00:08.050> so<00:00:08.350> let's<00:00:08.740> take<00:00:08.980> a<00:00:09.010> look<00:00:09.250> at<00:00:09.490> a<00:00:09.550> common

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:10.420 
okay so let's take a look at a common

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.039 
okay so let's take a look at a common
water-based<00:00:11.020> filler<00:00:12.010> on<00:00:12.309> styrofoam<00:00:12.910> and<00:00:13.630> this

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:14.049 
water-based filler on styrofoam and this

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:16.109 
water-based filler on styrofoam and this
is<00:00:14.260> once<00:00:15.010> we've<00:00:15.220> got<00:00:15.370> a<00:00:15.400> form<00:00:15.730> that<00:00:15.790> we're

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:16.119 
is once we've got a form that we're

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:18.960 
is once we've got a form that we're
happy<00:00:16.299> with<00:00:16.480> we<00:00:17.320> can<00:00:17.619> finish<00:00:18.040> it<00:00:18.189> so<00:00:18.640> that<00:00:18.820> it

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
happy with we can finish it so that it

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.600 
happy with we can finish it so that it
means<00:00:19.150> it's<00:00:19.480> suitable<00:00:19.689> for<00:00:19.990> spray-painting

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:20.610 
means it's suitable for spray-painting

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.240 
means it's suitable for spray-painting
quite<00:00:21.610> often<00:00:21.790> spray<00:00:22.630> paints<00:00:23.110> are<00:00:23.290> have

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
quite often spray paints are have

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.970 
quite often spray paints are have
basically<00:00:24.849> an<00:00:25.360> aggressive<00:00:26.169> solvent<00:00:26.680> in<00:00:26.829> it

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
basically an aggressive solvent in it

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.710 
basically an aggressive solvent in it
which<00:00:27.130> will<00:00:27.279> actually<00:00:27.579> dissolve<00:00:27.759> styrofoam

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
which will actually dissolve styrofoam

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.150 
which will actually dissolve styrofoam
so<00:00:29.410> our<00:00:29.950> coating<00:00:30.610> it<00:00:30.730> in<00:00:30.849> PVA<00:00:31.300> glue<00:00:31.390> or<00:00:32.160> using

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
so our coating it in PVA glue or using

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.920 
so our coating it in PVA glue or using
something<00:00:33.399> like<00:00:33.550> poly<00:00:33.940> filler<00:00:34.329> or<00:00:34.510> I<00:00:34.540> think<00:00:34.660> in

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
something like poly filler or I think in

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.620 
something like poly filler or I think in
America<00:00:35.050> it's<00:00:35.620> spackle<00:00:36.160> or<00:00:36.370> speckle<00:00:36.790> anyway

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.630 
America it's spackle or speckle anyway

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.110 
America it's spackle or speckle anyway
that<00:00:38.260> basically<00:00:38.710> gives<00:00:39.190> it<00:00:39.340> a<00:00:39.489> sort<00:00:40.030> of

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
that basically gives it a sort of

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.900 
that basically gives it a sort of
protective<00:00:40.600> layer<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.890> sort<00:00:42.100> of<00:00:42.190> inhibit<00:00:42.699> that

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
protective layer to sort of inhibit that

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.779 
protective layer to sort of inhibit that
from<00:00:43.300> destroying<00:00:43.719> the<00:00:43.929> foam<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:45.309> a<00:00:45.339> couple<00:00:45.640> of

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:45.789 
from destroying the foam so a couple of

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:47.669 
from destroying the foam so a couple of
tips<00:00:46.000> on<00:00:46.390> how<00:00:46.629> to<00:00:46.660> work<00:00:46.989> with<00:00:47.230> this<00:00:47.410> is

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:47.679 
tips on how to work with this is

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:50.160 
tips on how to work with this is
obviously<00:00:48.670> get<00:00:48.820> the<00:00:48.940> best<00:00:49.149> finish<00:00:49.510> you<00:00:49.660> can<00:00:49.870> as

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
obviously get the best finish you can as

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.160 
obviously get the best finish you can as
that<00:00:50.379> will<00:00:50.500> help<00:00:50.649> you<00:00:51.269> this<00:00:52.269> is<00:00:52.329> for<00:00:52.690> example

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
that will help you this is for example

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.069 
that will help you this is for example
is<00:00:53.499> the<00:00:54.160> coarse<00:00:54.399> surface<00:00:54.879> that's<00:00:55.749> sort<00:00:55.989> of

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
is the coarse surface that's sort of

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.329 
is the coarse surface that's sort of
pretty<00:00:56.230> rough<00:00:56.469> and<00:00:56.649> will<00:00:56.800> take<00:00:56.920> quite<00:00:57.160> a<00:00:57.219> bit

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.339 
pretty rough and will take quite a bit

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:59.639 
pretty rough and will take quite a bit
of<00:00:57.460> filling<00:00:57.640> and<00:00:57.910> this<00:00:58.510> is<00:00:58.659> it<00:00:58.809> filed<00:00:59.140> much

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
of filling and this is it filed much

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.740 
of filling and this is it filed much
smoother<00:01:00.190> or<00:01:00.370> you<00:01:00.519> could<00:01:00.699> use<00:01:00.850> sandpaper<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:02.530> I

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
smoother or you could use sandpaper so I

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.420 
smoother or you could use sandpaper so I
find<00:01:04.750> if<00:01:04.900> you<00:01:04.989> get<00:01:05.170> it<00:01:05.320> in<00:01:05.560> this<00:01:05.770> style<00:01:06.040> then

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
find if you get it in this style then

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.040 
find if you get it in this style then
what's<00:01:06.640> really<00:01:06.790> handy<00:01:07.120> about<00:01:07.480> it<00:01:07.659> is<00:01:07.780> that<00:01:07.960> you

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
what's really handy about it is that you

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.690 
what's really handy about it is that you
can<00:01:08.200> actually<00:01:08.350> sort<00:01:08.740> of<00:01:08.770> gun<00:01:09.040> it<00:01:09.190> on<00:01:09.340> to<00:01:09.580> the

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
can actually sort of gun it on to the

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.069 
can actually sort of gun it on to the
piece<00:01:10.799> like<00:01:11.799> this<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.570> it's<00:01:13.570> relatively

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:14.079 
piece like this and it's relatively

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:16.999 
piece like this and it's relatively
cheap<00:01:14.200> so<00:01:14.590> you<00:01:14.649> can<00:01:14.860> remove<00:01:15.130> the<00:01:15.310> excess<00:01:15.670> and

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
cheap so you can remove the excess and

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.260 
cheap so you can remove the excess and
let's<00:01:18.009> just<00:01:18.159> have<00:01:18.280> a<00:01:18.310> go<00:01:18.520> at<00:01:18.640> smoothing<00:01:19.149> that

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
let's just have a go at smoothing that

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.740 
let's just have a go at smoothing that
out<00:01:19.329> and<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:21.549> can<00:01:21.700> see<00:01:21.880> that<00:01:22.090> some<00:01:22.299> of<00:01:22.450> it<00:01:22.600> is

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
out and you can see that some of it is

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.959 
out and you can see that some of it is
still<00:01:23.049> sort<00:01:23.350> of<00:01:23.759> coming<00:01:24.759> through<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.759> so<00:01:27.880> you

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:27.969 
still sort of coming through and so you

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:29.819 
still sort of coming through and so you
can<00:01:28.119> see<00:01:28.299> here<00:01:28.630> I'm<00:01:28.990> gonna<00:01:29.170> have<00:01:29.409> to<00:01:29.590> sort<00:01:29.740> of

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
can see here I'm gonna have to sort of

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:32.010 
can see here I'm gonna have to sort of
stand<00:01:30.369> it<00:01:30.520> back<00:01:30.700> and<00:01:31.000> decide<00:01:31.299> what<00:01:31.780> I'm<00:01:31.899> gonna

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
stand it back and decide what I'm gonna

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.690 
stand it back and decide what I'm gonna
do<00:01:32.229> about<00:01:32.350> that<00:01:32.740> which<00:01:32.950> is<00:01:32.979> a<00:01:33.130> little<00:01:33.399> bit<00:01:33.520> of<00:01:33.610> a

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
do about that which is a little bit of a

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.690 
do about that which is a little bit of a
faff<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.960> if<00:01:35.380> we<00:01:35.799> take<00:01:35.950> it<00:01:36.100> on<00:01:36.189> the<00:01:36.340> smoother

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
faff so if we take it on the smoother

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.090 
faff so if we take it on the smoother
side<00:01:37.020> we<00:01:38.020> can<00:01:38.200> apply<00:01:38.469> it<00:01:38.530> and<00:01:40.740> we've<00:01:41.740> had<00:01:41.890> any

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
side we can apply it and we've had any

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.399 
side we can apply it and we've had any
real<00:01:42.369> surprise<00:01:42.880> it<00:01:43.450> obviously<00:01:43.780> makes<00:01:43.990> life<00:01:44.259> a

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
real surprise it obviously makes life a

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.410 
real surprise it obviously makes life a
lot<00:01:44.530> easier<00:01:44.950> because<00:01:45.130> it<00:01:45.430> it<00:01:45.700> covers<00:01:45.939> it<00:01:46.240> more

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
lot easier because it it covers it more

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.749 
lot easier because it it covers it more
evenly<00:01:46.780> and<00:01:47.380> so<00:01:47.680> I<00:01:47.710> find<00:01:48.009> that<00:01:48.100> I<00:01:48.219> even<00:01:48.579> need

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
evenly and so I find that I even need

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.200 
evenly and so I find that I even need
less<00:01:49.060> to<00:01:49.600> do<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:49.930> same<00:01:50.170> surface<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:52.060> it's

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
less to do the same surface so it's

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.230 
less to do the same surface so it's
going<00:01:52.390> on<00:01:52.570> much<00:01:52.810> smoother<00:01:53.259> there<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:54.460> I<00:01:54.850> bought

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
going on much smoother there so I bought

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.300 
going on much smoother there so I bought
the<00:01:55.359> quick<00:01:55.600> quick<00:01:55.960> dry<00:01:56.140> stuff<00:01:56.530> that<00:01:56.859> obviously

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
the quick quick dry stuff that obviously

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.709 
the quick quick dry stuff that obviously
means<00:01:57.520> you<00:01:57.640> don't<00:01:57.759> have<00:01:57.880> quite<00:01:58.180> as<00:01:58.329> long<00:01:58.479> to

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 
means you don't have quite as long to

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:03.120 
means you don't have quite as long to
work<00:01:58.930> on<00:01:59.170> it<00:02:00.090> but<00:02:01.090> another<00:02:01.390> nice<00:02:01.600> tip<00:02:01.930> is<00:02:02.740> that

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
work on it but another nice tip is that

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.010 
work on it but another nice tip is that
if<00:02:03.609> for<00:02:03.640> example<00:02:03.820> you<00:02:04.299> wanted<00:02:04.600> to<00:02:04.750> do<00:02:04.869> any

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
if for example you wanted to do any

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.310 
if for example you wanted to do any
profiling<00:02:05.710> you<00:02:06.640> could<00:02:06.789> always<00:02:06.939> use<00:02:07.899> something

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
profiling you could always use something

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.469 
profiling you could always use something
with<00:02:08.470> a<00:02:08.500> D<00:02:08.830> type<00:02:09.070> detail<00:02:09.729> like<00:02:10.000> that<00:02:10.030> or

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
with a D type detail like that or

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.840 
with a D type detail like that or
profile<00:02:10.929> and<00:02:12.030> put<00:02:13.030> your<00:02:13.210> excess<00:02:13.630> on<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.920> then

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
profile and put your excess on and then

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.190 
profile and put your excess on and then
if<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.090> dip<00:02:16.270> it<00:02:16.420> in<00:02:16.510> a<00:02:16.600> little<00:02:16.810> bit<00:02:16.930> of<00:02:17.020> water

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
if you dip it in a little bit of water

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.470 
if you dip it in a little bit of water
then<00:02:18.190> it<00:02:18.310> stops<00:02:18.520> it's<00:02:18.700> sticking<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.270> tool

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
then it stops it's sticking to the tool

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.150 
then it stops it's sticking to the tool
and<00:02:20.170> then<00:02:20.350> you<00:02:20.470> can<00:02:20.620> get<00:02:20.770> detail

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
and then you can get detail

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.310 
and then you can get detail
like<00:02:21.430> that<00:02:21.640> I<00:02:21.880> can't<00:02:22.540> say<00:02:22.690> I've<00:02:22.840> done<00:02:22.990> it<00:02:23.140> very

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
like that I can't say I've done it very

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.960 
like that I can't say I've done it very
often<00:02:23.500> but<00:02:23.890> occasionally<00:02:24.130> it's<00:02:24.550> handy

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
often but occasionally it's handy

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.420 
often but occasionally it's handy
generally<00:02:25.960> things<00:02:26.170> like<00:02:26.410> radii<00:02:26.830> are<00:02:27.100> also

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
generally things like radii are also

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.340 
generally things like radii are also
quite<00:02:27.640> useful<00:02:27.690> so<00:02:28.690> that<00:02:28.840> if<00:02:28.960> you're<00:02:29.110> working

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
quite useful so that if you're working

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.660 
quite useful so that if you're working
in<00:02:29.890> somewhere<00:02:30.820> like<00:02:30.850> this<00:02:32.490> which<00:02:33.490> has<00:02:33.640> a

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
in somewhere like this which has a

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.740 
in somewhere like this which has a
natural<00:02:34.180> radius<00:02:34.570> to<00:02:34.780> it<00:02:36.300> then<00:02:37.300> it<00:02:37.420> can<00:02:37.570> help

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
natural radius to it then it can help

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.990 
natural radius to it then it can help
you<00:02:37.960> sort<00:02:38.170> of<00:02:38.230> work<00:02:38.470> in<00:02:38.710> there<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:39.310> as<00:02:39.700> you<00:02:39.730> see

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
you sort of work in there and as you see

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.730 
you sort of work in there and as you see
to<00:02:40.210> be<00:02:40.300> honest<00:02:40.570> sometimes<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:41.050> best<00:02:41.230> tool<00:02:41.500> is

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
to be honest sometimes the best tool is

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.620 
to be honest sometimes the best tool is
actually<00:02:42.040> just<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.340> wet<00:02:42.490> your<00:02:42.640> fingers<00:02:43.060> and

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
actually just to wet your fingers and

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.110 
actually just to wet your fingers and
you<00:02:44.410> find<00:02:44.650> that<00:02:44.890> that<00:02:45.430> little<00:02:45.670> bit<00:02:45.790> of<00:02:45.820> water

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
you find that that little bit of water

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.240 
you find that that little bit of water
will<00:02:46.390> stop<00:02:46.570> it<00:02:46.720> sticking<00:02:46.960> quite<00:02:47.590> as<00:02:47.710> easily<00:02:47.890> to

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
will stop it sticking quite as easily to

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.160 
will stop it sticking quite as easily to
your<00:02:48.400> hands<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:49.510> because<00:02:49.750> it's<00:02:49.900> water-based

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
your hands and because it's water-based

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.170 
your hands and because it's water-based
all<00:02:50.770> that<00:02:51.010> does<00:02:51.190> is<00:02:51.220> just<00:02:51.550> mean<00:02:51.730> it<00:02:51.880> takes<00:02:52.030> a

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
all that does is just mean it takes a

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.170 
all that does is just mean it takes a
tiny<00:02:52.420> bit<00:02:52.660> longer<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:53.080> dry<00:02:53.320> so<00:02:54.160> I<00:02:54.700> hope<00:02:54.970> that's

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
tiny bit longer to dry so I hope that's

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.880 
tiny bit longer to dry so I hope that's
useful<00:02:55.360> and<00:02:56.850> obviously<00:02:57.850> keep<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.090> cap<00:02:58.360> on<00:02:58.890> so

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
useful and obviously keep the cap on so

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.100 
useful and obviously keep the cap on so
there<00:03:00.010> we<00:03:00.070> go
