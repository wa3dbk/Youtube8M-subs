00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 or the air friends to that arturo commenting 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.359
 in this new video this time 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.670
 guys, I bring what is a small 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.820
 tutorial on how to increase performance 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.009
 of our minecraft is worth good we should 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.049
 keep in mind several things what kind of 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:21.359
 see what version of windows we have in 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:23.939
 Project 97 and 8 or Elvis is saying 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.910
 everything is the same now what version 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.750
 of system we have if we have it to 32 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.270
 bits or if we have it to 64 now you 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.719
 you will wonder what difference there is between 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:39.629
 these two what happens is that 32 bits 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.860
 the maximum is 4 of Aran that is, but for 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.350
 dedicate 32 gigas of ram to minecraft is 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.719
 difficult because you can not be worth it but 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.820
 now a 64 bit structure we 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.340
 allows you to increase what is the size of 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.250
 memory and also the dedicated size 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.739
 towards some game or we can say yes 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.590
 we have 8 gigas of ram and we want 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.519
 dedicate 4 minecraft we could do it 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.359
 in a very easy way 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.730
 if we have the 32 bit and we want 

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:11.980
 add minecraft 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.550
 that same amount of 4 gigas does not 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.770
 we could since 32 bits simply 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.520
 we could dedicate what is a giga like 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.860
 maximum and 1.5 in 1.6 but one gigabyte 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.260
 at most previously in the other 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.650
 minecraft versions if you could but 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:32.790
 now in this one can not be worth then 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.020
 let's continue and you guys 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.410
 they investigate what kind of operating system 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:42.310
 has and so for that we 're going to team 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:44.080
 a right click properties and here where 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.250
 says system type operating system yes 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.690
 24 if you have it to 32 I recommend you 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.150
 that you do what I am going to do 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.820
 I want you have 64 you have to know that if 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.920
 you have more than eight more than four faces 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.430
 you could dedicate two gigs to 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.650
 increase what is the performance something 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.070
 well we 're going to al though and we 're not going to 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.390
 edit profile now if you do not have this 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.710
 activated window 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:14.230
 where it says 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:18.790
 jv vm ar gÃ³mez if you do not have it activated 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.880
 active and if you have good to those of 32 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.940
 bits I recommend you activate this 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.520
 ok and what about bengasi now if you have 64 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.070
 you could take the 1 and put a 2 that 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.590
 is dedicating the 2 will arrive if 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.570
 you have 8 could dedicate 4 and so 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.870
 successively it is worth I will leave it in 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.340
 1 and so we are going to continue now inside 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.920
 of the game I will show you what configuration 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.440
 give the minecraft to get what 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.000
 it's a few returns 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.700
 but it escaped me that I wanted 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.760
 teach them good this is a way 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.350
 correct and easy to do it worth but 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.630
 everything depends on the configuration that you 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.750
 that you give him or that you are going to give him 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.020
 minecraft is going to have noticeably how 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.790
 will increase my frames per second 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.270
 when I create a world you will see 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.270
 very well 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.010
 let's see let's create the world and 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:17.790
 let's see how the game goes 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.790
 you are going to realize 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.740
 or how do we go if it is third good 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.740
 let's see 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.250
 well here we are already in minecraft 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.610
 Boys 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:41.720
 as you can see, it has been new 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.000
 I say that that drink of alcohol has 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.570
 created 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.570
 come 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:54.330
 now let's give you options we 're going to 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.660
 video sitting but before this we are going to 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.520
 see how much frame does not go wrong it's not going to 30 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.150
 frames per second 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.290
 recording 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.829
 to two options 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.760
 we go to options this what is normal 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.760
 we put it in 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:21.009
 dorsey here where it says maxima good that 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.740
 it's good we take this off and we put it 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:25.870
 here a limit is valid as there are no limits 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.840
 for the francs instead of this in short 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.540
 if we misdirect be quick you 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.270
 we remove this 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:40.110
 now we go to what is in quality and 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:43.660
 well we put we do not go in what is 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.720
 personalization and here then that is here 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:50.020
 we put a work worth we give here we 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.990
 animation we put everything on off 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.700
 let's accept here because we leave this 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.730
 same 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.660
 here we can and this is here what 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:03.529
 we put on the face 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:06.889
 ok we deactivate it now we see 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:10.969
 how are you doing then we leave more noise - 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:13.399
 lager and good they move us Havana 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:14.539
 they gave better frames per second than that 

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:16.699
 is what we were looking for in the 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:18.769
 minecraft that does not increase what is the 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:21.709
 performance thing that we had not had 

00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:23.280
 before but I'm recording for 

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:25.020
 that's how it goes 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.410
 at so many fronts per second I understand 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.880
 Now if you have a much more PC 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:34.800
 bad I recommend you to do 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:37.169
 some exaggerations like train 4 in 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.600
 4 is fine and so the performance 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:45.480
 would advance a little better we deactivated 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:49.160
 the clouds in here we are skype this 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:54.220
 this and this is worth 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:57.220
 Now I am that too and this is ok 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.470
 and be without minecraft now, I do not know 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.750
 will move us faster the fronts by 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.160
 second will increase and well this is 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.630
 simply for people who have 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.490
 a bad PC 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.070
 good is not bad but more or less good 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.810
 a bit passable and right now yesterday because 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.030
 believe what the pack is for 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.710
 you are worth 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.840
 that the truth moves very well and 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.830
 I hope you enjoy it and good 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.830
 guys we will not be seeing 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:26.099
 for the next one and this was all so 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:26.099
 my way
