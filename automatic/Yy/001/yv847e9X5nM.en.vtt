00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.639
 my name is martin danner I have to 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.740
 work as ballet master waldpÃ¤dagoge 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.270
 dance theorist lately 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.270
 more also literary 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.120
 next to the state opera here on 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.430
 Hackescher Markt both as a student 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.470
 used to become a dancer and then 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.810
 inland later after I meanwhile 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.150
 studied in moscow and also in 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.440
 hessen agah ballet director was again 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.440
 moved back to Berlin 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.949
 one of my biggest wishes 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.780
 was a wanderlust when traveling as a kid 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.089
 for me more and more as homesick 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.070
 the function of this apartment is playing one 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.199
 big role because even if I'm in here 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.809
 I have this apartment at home 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.780
 an incredible view in the distance 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.890
 So I can go from her to the potsdamer 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.320
 tv tower so if you look 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.289
 So to speak, this apartment comes in one 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.689
 out steps over the clouds 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:17.490
 That's easy to do because if you 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.890
 Looks over here and so high above Berlin 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.460
 is the weather the clouds the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.920
 Sun 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.119
 the weather change a completely different 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.000
 roll as if you were down on the 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.170
 street moves so i have here 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.429
 I already had experiences 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.740
 my whole life had not yet 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:34.979
 on the right the sun goes under and left 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.170
 it rains and is storm so and this 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.539
 I wanted to receive contrasts 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.729
 Rental exactly that succeeded in me 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:44.459
 all this was opened 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.289
 and then an architect came up with the idea 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:49.229
 then we just make holes in the 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.939
 walls where you go through the holes of one 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.960
 room through the other room again 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.960
 can look into the free 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.659
 I have ever built a house and 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.479
 there was the rad the patronage chapel where 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.610
 you could look into the outdoors and this 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.819
 Idea I realized here similarly 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.380
 and it is so glazed so if 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:15.660
 I can stand under the shower 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.660
 looking at the berlin dom, so to speak 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.930
