00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:44.419 
like doing this I set the volume down

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:48.220 
like doing this I set the volume down
about<00:03:44.870> half<00:03:45.079> way<00:03:45.349> and<00:03:45.590> that<00:03:46.750> usually<00:03:47.750> streams

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
about half way and that usually streams

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.710 
about half way and that usually streams
and<00:03:48.379> music<00:03:48.709> to<00:03:48.980> the<00:03:49.160> best<00:03:49.940> quality<00:03:50.359> I<00:03:50.389> can<00:03:50.569> get

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
and music to the best quality I can get

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.170 
and music to the best quality I can get
you<00:03:51.169> can<00:03:51.319> lower<00:03:51.500> it<00:03:51.620> less<00:03:52.370> than<00:03:52.549> half<00:03:52.760> and

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
you can lower it less than half and

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.900 
you can lower it less than half and
you'll<00:03:53.870> be<00:03:54.019> a<00:03:54.049> bit<00:03:54.260> quieter<00:03:54.739> and<00:03:55.040> of<00:03:55.700> course

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
you'll be a bit quieter and of course

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.300 
you'll be a bit quieter and of course
that's<00:03:56.209> kind<00:03:56.959> of<00:03:57.079> it'll<00:03:57.620> be<00:03:57.709> better<00:03:57.889> quality

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
that's kind of it'll be better quality

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.159 
that's kind of it'll be better quality
but<00:03:58.669> also<00:03:58.819> to<00:03:59.090> the<00:03:59.239> benefit<00:03:59.599> of<00:03:59.660> more<00:03:59.840> players

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:00.169 
but also to the benefit of more players
