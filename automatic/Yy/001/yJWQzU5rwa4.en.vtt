00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.420
 hello to all and all his rages da 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.430
 krew I hope you're fine and I 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.740
 ask you the question directly 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.980
 Do you think that call of duty black ops 3 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.570
 will be available on xbox 360 and ps3 and 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.059
 wej putting on nothing at all today 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.309
 I have a direct relationship in the subject 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.330
 because because yes it keeps me at 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.160
 heart why every hour breast 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.320
 because I'm in a situation 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.449
 like many of you I think where 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.680
 we have an older generation and we did not 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.500
 not necessarily the means or the envied 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.059
 to buy a new or a pc and so 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.890
 we wonder if we can play 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.530
 next call of duty in november 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.510
 next on our little console of 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.410
 living room 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.180
 several arguments for several 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.950
 arguments against why I redo 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.220
 this video because I had already done 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:06.200
 Video batch this telling 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.789
 the end that everything was going to be confirmed the 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.880
 day of the release of the trailer is not 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:13.100
 nothing at all the carrot we do not know anything 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.580
 and several arguments still oppose 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.560
 at this availability on old 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.880
 generations of coding to go around 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.890
 a little little soul and I will tell you 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.299
 what do you think about weighing in and 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.960
 the counter and then I think to make a 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:30.110
 little poll we will get to know the 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.970
 embers that will really happen what I 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.070
 remind you that the game's release this 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.170
 will be in november 6 november 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.210
 So here first argument against the 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.520
 it is safe in generation 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.610
 whether they are on the compensation eh 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.650
 well it's this little screen price on 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.270
 amazon.fr who offers to buy from 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.479
 pre-order call of duty black ops 3 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.310
 on xbox one on ps4 and on pc which 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.250
 is normal but who does not propose it to us 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.340
 on ps3 and xbox 360 in passing the price 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.520
 will be 70 euros on ps4 xbox live and 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.520
 on thresholds will be 60 euros at cap 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.170
 the cheapest on pc since 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.960
 vision will decide to renew the link 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.729
 with the pc players in this opus 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.810
 even if you want to throw it for sure 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.300
 always cheaper but finally brief 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.280
 it's not the subject of video here 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.310
 so amazon who only offers on 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.260
 current gen and on pc 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.170
 already a bad point for us second 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.610
 thing creating the eesc 16 32 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.349
 players in the game 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.560
 literally impossible to put on 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:31.480
 old generation 32 players 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.569
 no no it's impossible it can not 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.030
 not hold on call of duty black ops 3 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.459
 on ps3 and xbox 360 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.670
 they will never be supported 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:45.760
 why not imagine a version 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.220
 light of the game with 10.9 of the nine draws 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.690
 of the six but in any case version 16 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.099
 it may not be possible 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.860
 last point that can make me too 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.569
 dread the non-release of this game on 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.010
 the older generation is the creation 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.400
 of the new graphics engine that 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.079
 will host black ops 3 and yes it was 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.640
 announced by sir v12 who received 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.810
 official information acts 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.849
 humiliating where there is a new engine 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.569
 graph on this game which will be so on 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:13.090
 a box one and s4 and pc new engine 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.549
 graphic it's often different from 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.870
 the older generation has spent 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.609
 others are words you see 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.139
 tony moss people of the term who can 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.299
 cross and who by bus 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:24.310
 no but seriously a new engine 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.530
 graph I do not think they do not 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.330
 combine that with an older generation 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.760
 so why not again 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.950
 imagined to imagine it's our last 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.380
 experience the imagination a light game 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.959
 with the same graphical engine as the 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.790
 old ones so here's blackhawks 3 also a 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.590
 graphic engine on the old 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.720
 generation why not or so 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.849
 really the new graphical engine on 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.950
 the old generation but then it will be 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.780
 really hot to bear for fishing 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.930
 for inter 3 and xbox 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.239
 nothing but advent warfare or when a 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.100
 graphics engine has been pushed to the maximum 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.630
 well i can tell you that my oil 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.549
 sorry I'm sure you too 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.220
 you have a few display bugs 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.750
 in the beginning and then even now on 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.549
 old generation adÃ¨le part bankrupt 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.830
 galley turned in menus etc 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:11.319
 must not forget now what is it 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.810
 who tells me that it can still be 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.580
 available on the older generation there 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.220
 there is simply this screen 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.709
 first of all that was taken by a site 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.010
 American sales quite 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.320
 official finally the site is real what 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.330
 know i do not know i did not see the name 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.330
 whole but in any case we can see the 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:34.720
 jacket black ops 3 on xbox 360 and the one 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.810
 here on ps3 so here it is ordered 60 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.850
 euros I have not it seems credible and in 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.800
 same time it can be easily 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.150
 retouching at bhl to three rats do not 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.090
 believe and tell me what you 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:49.479
 do you think second thing the creation 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.430
 the return of studio mode on black ops 3 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.289
 and yes because I wonder why 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.820
 to make a studio mode on consoles 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:57.280
 who can true that a gameplay 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.260
 actually thanks to the expensive ps 4 and 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.850
 thanks to the xbox one I do not know what we 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.490
 can have the gameplay I believe that these 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.650
 15 minutes or more or what directly 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.270
 recorded on his console is broadcast 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.770
 on youtube social networks etc 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.560
 so what is the use of a mode 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.900
 studio in a game where can do that to 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.789
 not put it on a console where you do not 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.250
 could not adjust gameplay like this 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:20.729
 is the only one of manga the cost of a real 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.139
 maybe still hope 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.450
 last thing that can tip the 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.979
 balance of our players side to 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.090
 the older generation 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:28.840
 it's just taking 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.150
 consciousness that may have 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.430
 activision-blizzard no the market 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.930
 represents whether it is in France or in 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.030
 america where in the whole world I 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.039
 believe that more players are safe in 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.289
 generation scene that on new everything 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.729
 simply because we do not find that 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.710
 the new generations brings 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:46.450
 something much more than the 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.270
 old ones what and so we're still 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:51.400
 not swinging but hey it's 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.240
 another debate this so maybe they 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.000
 are still thinking 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.520
 since nothing has been announced 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.409
 it may be a reason for the tent 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.909
 who do we subject maybe they do not 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:03.130
 do not even know them even maybe 

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:03.720
 that they will not look too much 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.800
 perhaps 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.620
 I hope that soon we will have the 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.630
 confirmation and I hope it will be on 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.830
 the older generation also if not ben 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.659
 here I am, I would have stopped playing 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.099
 call of duty then I would recommend 

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:17.020
 only when I have a pc but good 

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:18.190
 call of duty on pc is not that much 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.720
 what finally 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.640
 tell me what you think about it all 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.110
 as I wanted to ask for this draw of 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.390
 holes I hope you enjoyed it all 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:28.479
 likewise all these little arguments for 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:30.880
 against you to ask you have the 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:32.169
 balance and the for his prints of addicts 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.030
 I wish a good day a good day 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:36.030
 and a good appetite to appreciate them
