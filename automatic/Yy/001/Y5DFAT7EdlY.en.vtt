00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
diesel engine very reliable lots of

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.780 
diesel engine very reliable lots of
power

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
power

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.130 
power
um<00:02:13.489> decent<00:02:14.489> on<00:02:14.579> fuel<00:02:14.849> I<00:02:15.090> would<00:02:15.930> say<00:02:16.519> American

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
um decent on fuel I would say American

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.130 
um decent on fuel I would say American
numbers<00:02:19.140> this<00:02:19.980> thing<00:02:20.250> probably<00:02:20.640> on<00:02:21.269> the

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
numbers this thing probably on the

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.800 
numbers this thing probably on the
highway<00:02:22.500> would<00:02:22.950> get<00:02:24.200> I'm<00:02:25.200> guessing<00:02:26.040> 32<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:27.180> 35

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
highway would get I'm guessing 32 to 35

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:28.729 
highway would get I'm guessing 32 to 35
miles<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.409> gallon

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
miles a gallon

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.750 
miles a gallon
American<00:02:29.510> Canadian<00:02:30.510> of<00:02:30.900> course<00:02:31.459> yeah<00:02:32.459> you<00:02:32.549> can

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
American Canadian of course yeah you can

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.229 
American Canadian of course yeah you can
mix<00:02:32.970> up<00:02:33.060> those<00:02:33.239> numbers<00:02:33.420> quite<00:02:33.810> easily<00:02:33.989> but

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
mix up those numbers quite easily but

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.550 
mix up those numbers quite easily but
for<00:02:36.239> example<00:02:36.359> the<00:02:36.780> best<00:02:36.959> I've<00:02:37.109> ever<00:02:37.140> got

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
for example the best I've ever got

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.580 
for example the best I've ever got
Canadian<00:02:38.069> as<00:02:38.189> far<00:02:38.519> as<00:02:38.609> leaders<00:02:39.000> goes

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
Canadian as far as leaders goes

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.259 
Canadian as far as leaders goes
eight-point<00:02:42.079> add<00:02:43.079> it<00:02:43.230> down<00:02:43.409> to<00:02:43.939> seven<00:02:44.939> point

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
eight-point add it down to seven point

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.960 
eight-point add it down to seven point
eight<00:02:46.010> I<00:02:47.010> think<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:47.760> was<00:02:47.849> seven<00:02:48.150> point<00:02:48.359> eight

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
eight I think it was seven point eight

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.020 
eight I think it was seven point eight
per<00:02:50.970> hundred<00:02:51.329> kilometers<00:02:51.919> which<00:02:52.919> is<00:02:52.950> not<00:02:53.639> too

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
per hundred kilometers which is not too

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.659 
per hundred kilometers which is not too
bad<00:02:54.269> at<00:02:54.419> all<00:02:54.680> so<00:02:57.049> real<00:02:58.049> good<00:02:58.260> engine<00:02:58.669> solid

00:02:59.659 --> 00:02:59.669 
bad at all so real good engine solid

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:03.140 
bad at all so real good engine solid
again<00:02:59.970> it's<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.299> Mercedes<00:03:00.629> diesel<00:03:01.849> lots<00:03:02.849> of

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
again it's a Mercedes diesel lots of

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.420 
again it's a Mercedes diesel lots of
power<00:03:03.389> once<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.379> turbo<00:03:04.709> kicks<00:03:04.889> in<00:03:05.129> on<00:03:05.310> this

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430

Cherokee does have a diesel engine it's
not<00:05:51.150> from<00:05:51.390> Mercedes<00:05:51.900> it's<00:05:52.200> a<00:05:53.150> it's<00:05:54.150> a<00:05:54.270> division

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
not from Mercedes it's a it's a division

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.690 
not from Mercedes it's a it's a division
an<00:05:54.930> engine<00:05:55.500> built<00:05:57.020> off<00:05:58.020> of<00:05:58.080> yet<00:05:58.800> I<00:05:59.130> can't<00:05:59.580> be

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
an engine built off of yet I can't be

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.460 
an engine built off of yet I can't be
quoted<00:06:00.060> on<00:06:00.180> this<00:06:00.390> because<00:06:00.570> I'm<00:06:00.810> not<00:06:00.960> sure<00:06:01.230> it's

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
quoted on this because I'm not sure it's

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.930 
quoted on this because I'm not sure it's
it's<00:06:02.070> a<00:06:02.220> company<00:06:02.580> that<00:06:03.150> Fiat<00:06:03.990> would<00:06:04.560> know<00:06:04.940> but

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
it's a company that Fiat would know but

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.580 
it's a company that Fiat would know but
it's<00:06:06.060> a<00:06:06.180> it<00:06:06.600> sounds<00:06:06.930> like<00:06:07.050> a<00:06:07.080> good<00:06:07.320> diesel

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 
it's a it sounds like a good diesel

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.550 
it's a it sounds like a good diesel
engine<00:06:07.890> it's<00:06:08.070> it's<00:06:08.460> puts<00:06:09.240> out<00:06:09.420> this<00:06:10.080> one<00:06:10.320> puts

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
engine it's it's puts out this one puts

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.970 
engine it's it's puts out this one puts
out<00:06:10.940> 390<00:06:11.940> foot-pounds<00:06:12.450> of<00:06:12.510> torque<00:06:12.680> in<00:06:13.680> around

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:13.980 
out 390 foot-pounds of torque in around

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.340 
out 390 foot-pounds of torque in around
there<00:06:14.280> and<00:06:14.490> I<00:06:15.030> think<00:06:15.090> that<00:06:15.300> new<00:06:15.630> diesel<00:06:16.050> engine

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:16.350 
there and I think that new diesel engine

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:21.730 
there and I think that new diesel engine
puts<00:06:16.590> out<00:06:17.390> 400<00:06:18.390> and<00:06:19.070> I'm<00:06:20.070> going<00:06:20.250> to<00:06:20.310> say<00:06:20.430> 420<00:06:20.970> or

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
puts out 400 and I'm going to say 420 or

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.110 
puts out 400 and I'm going to say 420 or
430<00:06:22.740> foot-pounds<00:06:23.730> of<00:06:23.790> torque

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
430 foot-pounds of torque

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.120 
430 foot-pounds of torque
so<00:06:25.160> either<00:06:26.160> way<00:06:26.310> it's<00:06:26.490> it's<00:06:27.210> really<00:06:27.450> good<00:06:27.690> so

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
so either way it's it's really good so

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.670 
so either way it's it's really good so
if<00:06:29.130> you're<00:06:29.400> looking<00:06:29.670> at<00:06:29.760> a<00:06:29.790> diesel<00:06:30.530> and<00:06:31.530> you

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 
if you're looking at a diesel and you

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.290 
if you're looking at a diesel and you
can't<00:06:31.920> pick<00:06:32.070> up<00:06:32.190> these<00:06:32.400> ones<00:06:32.670> they're<00:06:32.910> like

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
can't pick up these ones they're like

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.520 
can't pick up these ones they're like
well<00:06:33.510> you<00:06:33.630> can't<00:06:33.840> pick<00:06:34.020> these<00:06:34.140> up<00:06:34.200> they're

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.530 
well you can't pick these up they're

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.960 
well you can't pick these up they're
very<00:06:34.740> hard<00:06:35.010> to<00:06:35.070> get<00:06:35.280> though

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
very hard to get though

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:38.820 
very hard to get though
they're<00:06:37.360> limited<00:06:37.840> quantity<00:06:38.260> out<00:06:38.410> there<00:06:38.620> but

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830 
they're limited quantity out there but

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.500 
they're limited quantity out there but
you<00:06:38.920> can<00:06:39.100> still<00:06:39.340> find<00:06:39.610> them<00:06:39.730> if<00:06:39.850> you're<00:06:40.030> if<00:06:40.360> you

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:40.510 
you can still find them if you're if you

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.290 
you can still find them if you're if you
look<00:06:40.690> hard<00:06:40.870> enough<00:06:41.020> and<00:06:41.850> if<00:06:42.850> you<00:06:43.030> want<00:06:43.210> to

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
look hard enough and if you want to

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.240 
look hard enough and if you want to
travel<00:06:43.540> to<00:06:43.840> get<00:06:44.290> it<00:06:44.440> but<00:06:44.940> that<00:06:46.080> being<00:06:47.080> said<00:06:47.250> the

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.250 
travel to get it but that being said the

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.740 
travel to get it but that being said the
14s<00:06:49.500> Jeep<00:06:50.500> Grand<00:06:50.650> Cherokees<00:06:51.190> are<00:06:52.150> coming<00:06:52.630> out

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:52.750 
14s Jeep Grand Cherokees are coming out

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.480 
14s Jeep Grand Cherokees are coming out
with<00:06:52.780> that<00:06:52.930> diesel<00:06:53.230> engine<00:06:53.620> option<00:06:53.980> again<00:06:54.250> and

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.490 
with that diesel engine option again and

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.480 
with that diesel engine option again and
it's<00:06:55.090> I<00:06:55.330> guess<00:06:55.480> even<00:06:55.750> a<00:06:55.960> cleaner<00:06:56.490> running

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:57.490 
it's I guess even a cleaner running

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.900 
it's I guess even a cleaner running
diesel<00:06:57.880> engines<00:06:58.240> so<00:06:59.400> yeah<00:07:00.400> let's<00:07:00.610> just<00:07:00.760> go

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:00.910 
diesel engines so yeah let's just go

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.730 
diesel engines so yeah let's just go
outside<00:07:01.060> here<00:07:01.390> take<00:07:01.630> a<00:07:01.660> look<00:07:01.840> at<00:07:01.990> that<00:07:02.110> motor

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:02.740 
outside here take a look at that motor

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:20.119 
outside here take a look at that motor
when<00:07:03.040> it's<00:07:03.160> running

00:07:20.119 --> 00:07:20.129 

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:21.979 

I<00:07:20.249> would<00:07:20.789> Rev<00:07:20.969> the<00:07:21.149> throttle<00:07:21.569> up<00:07:21.689> on<00:07:21.869> this

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:21.989 
I would Rev the throttle up on this

00:07:21.989 --> 00:07:24.200 
I would Rev the throttle up on this
thing<00:07:22.229> but

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:24.210 
thing but

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:29.740 
thing but
I<00:07:24.590> don't<00:07:25.590> know<00:07:26.250> where<00:07:26.520> the<00:07:26.699> throttle<00:07:26.940> body

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:29.750 
I don't know where the throttle body

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:37.810 
I don't know where the throttle body
mechanism<00:07:30.750> is<00:07:30.930> it's<00:07:31.800> probably<00:07:32.009> electronic<00:07:35.000> so

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:37.820 
mechanism is it's probably electronic so

00:07:37.820 --> 00:08:05.000 
mechanism is it's probably electronic so
yeah<00:07:38.420> that's<00:07:38.960> that's<00:07:39.350> pretty<00:07:39.620> much<00:07:39.740> it

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:05.010
