00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.090 
you can customize but so far not that we
have<00:03:43.810> discovered<00:03:44.730> so<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:47.440> Darth<00:03:47.590> Vader<00:03:47.829> one

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
have discovered so the Darth Vader one

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.710 
have discovered so the Darth Vader one
now<00:03:48.549> you<00:03:48.609> know<00:03:48.850> if<00:03:48.940> he<00:03:49.030> comes<00:03:49.180> in<00:03:49.390> different

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
now you know if he comes in different

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.460 
now you know if he comes in different
pieces<00:03:50.049> at<00:03:50.320> all<00:03:50.440> or<00:03:50.620> not<00:03:50.769> so<00:03:51.519> just<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:52.470> heavier

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
pieces at all or not so just the heavier

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.830 
pieces at all or not so just the heavier
it<00:03:53.560> ever<00:03:53.680> comes<00:03:53.950> off<00:03:54.190> so<00:03:54.489> I<00:03:54.760> see<00:03:55.480> you<00:03:55.570> can't

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
it ever comes off so I see you can't

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.470 
it ever comes off so I see you can't
just<00:03:56.769> like<00:03:56.920> change<00:03:57.160> the<00:03:57.280> faces<00:03:57.609> and<00:03:57.640> these<00:03:58.299> two

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
just like change the faces and these two

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.050 
just like change the faces and these two
or<00:03:58.569> anything<00:03:58.750> like<00:03:58.780> that<00:03:58.900> but<00:03:59.700> they<00:04:00.700> do<00:04:00.819> have

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
or anything like that but they do have

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.240 
or anything like that but they do have
some<00:04:01.359> pieces<00:04:01.630> this<00:04:02.470> one<00:04:02.620> I<00:04:02.650> assume<00:04:02.980> is<00:04:03.100> just

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
some pieces this one I assume is just

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.009 
some pieces this one I assume is just
one<00:04:03.400> piece<00:04:03.670> not<00:04:04.359> a<00:04:04.390> lot<00:04:04.600> would<00:04:04.690> be<00:04:04.750> more<00:04:04.930> than

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
one piece not a lot would be more than

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.890 
one piece not a lot would be more than
one<00:04:05.109> piece<00:04:05.319> so<00:04:06.250> it's<00:04:06.970> might<00:04:07.090> be<00:04:07.209> like<00:04:07.450> a<00:04:07.480> racer

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
one piece so it's might be like a racer

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.569 
one piece so it's might be like a racer
that<00:04:07.989> in<00:04:08.079> oil<00:04:08.200> that<00:04:08.290> is<00:04:08.350> one<00:04:08.530> piece<00:04:08.769> well<00:04:09.250> both

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
that in oil that is one piece well both

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.720 
that in oil that is one piece well both
ships<00:04:09.880> probably<00:04:10.299> but<00:04:11.079> this<00:04:11.440> one<00:04:11.650> I<00:04:11.950> believe

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
ships probably but this one I believe

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.520 
ships probably but this one I believe
this<00:04:13.180> is<00:04:13.299> a<00:04:13.329> stormtrooper<00:04:13.840> not<00:04:14.230> a<00:04:14.260> clone

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
this is a stormtrooper not a clone

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.460 
this is a stormtrooper not a clone
