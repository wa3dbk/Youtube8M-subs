miniscule for me what makes this card
somewhat<00:01:06.970> playable<00:01:07.390> is<00:01:07.570> the<00:01:07.689> fact<00:01:07.869> that<00:01:07.930> you

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
somewhat playable is the fact that you

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:09.570 
somewhat playable is the fact that you
