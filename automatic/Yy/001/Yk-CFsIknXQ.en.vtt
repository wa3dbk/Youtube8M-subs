I<00:00:17.529> use<00:00:17.740> on<00:00:18.039> my<00:00:18.119> desktop<00:00:19.119> and<00:00:19.359> it's<00:00:20.050> basically<00:00:20.770> a

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
I use on my desktop and it's basically a

I use on my desktop and it's basically a
square<00:00:21.250> Minecraft<00:00:21.880> world<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:23.230> took<00:00:23.800> the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:23.920 
square Minecraft world I took the

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.880 
square Minecraft world I took the
picture<00:00:24.280> and<00:00:24.310> it<00:00:25.180> took<00:00:25.480> me<00:00:25.690> days<00:00:25.720> to<00:00:26.020> replicate

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
picture and it took me days to replicate

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.460 
picture and it took me days to replicate
this<00:00:27.070> thing<00:00:27.370> as<00:00:27.640> perfectly<00:00:28.210> as<00:00:28.300> possible<00:00:28.600> even

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
this thing as perfectly as possible even

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.249 
this thing as perfectly as possible even
then<00:00:29.860> it's<00:00:30.070> not<00:00:30.130> an<00:00:30.400> exact<00:00:30.850> replica<00:00:31.420> and<00:00:31.660> I<00:00:32.110> had

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
then it's not an exact replica and I had

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.080 
then it's not an exact replica and I had
to<00:00:32.379> use<00:00:32.529> a<00:00:32.559> couple<00:00:32.860> of<00:00:33.039> texture<00:00:33.579> tricks<00:00:33.879> to

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
to use a couple of texture tricks to

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.210 
to use a couple of texture tricks to
make<00:00:34.239> it<00:00:34.390> look<00:00:34.690> more<00:00:35.410> realistic

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
make it look more realistic

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.220 
make it look more realistic
since<00:00:36.790> grass<00:00:37.180> can't<00:00:37.480> grow<00:00:37.660> on<00:00:37.720> the<00:00:37.840> sides<00:00:38.020> and

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
ahead and show you the rest of the

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.680 
ahead and show you the rest of the
things<00:00:54.340> if<00:00:54.969> you're<00:00:55.090> wondering<00:00:55.420> how<00:00:55.570> I'm

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
things if you're wondering how I'm

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.870 
things if you're wondering how I'm
keeping<00:00:55.989> the<00:00:56.079> water<00:00:56.230> bank<00:00:56.530> I<00:00:56.800> edited<00:00:57.430> the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 
keeping the water bank I edited the

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.760 
keeping the water bank I edited the
glass<00:00:58.329> texture<00:00:58.870> to<00:00:58.989> be<00:00:59.079> completely<00:00:59.559> invisible

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
glass texture to be completely invisible

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.410 
glass texture to be completely invisible
so<00:01:00.160> it<00:01:00.250> holds<00:01:00.370> back<00:01:00.610> the<00:01:00.670> water<00:01:00.940> perfectly

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
so it holds back the water perfectly

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.079 
so it holds back the water perfectly
same<00:01:02.260> with<00:01:02.379> the<00:01:02.469> lava<00:01:02.649> over<00:01:02.950> here<00:01:03.190> as<00:01:03.370> you<00:01:04.030> can

same with the lava over here as you can

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.730 
same with the lava over here as you can
see<00:01:04.180> it's<00:01:04.420> still<00:01:04.570> flowing<00:01:04.809> it<00:01:05.079> is<00:01:05.229> actual

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
see it's still flowing it is actual

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.029 
see it's still flowing it is actual
water<00:01:05.950> not<00:01:06.369> just<00:01:06.850> a<00:01:07.210> recolored<00:01:07.689> skin<00:01:08.079> over

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:09.039 
water not just a recolored skin over

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:11.160 
water not just a recolored skin over
here<00:01:09.429> if<00:01:10.119> you're<00:01:10.270> wondering<00:01:10.600> how<00:01:10.719> I<00:01:10.749> got<00:01:10.899> the

door sideways like this I actually took

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.840 
door sideways like this I actually took
my<00:01:13.539> door<00:01:14.020> texture<00:01:14.439> turn<00:01:15.219> it<00:01:15.340> on<00:01:15.459> its<00:01:15.609> side<00:01:15.819> and

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
my door texture turn it on its side and

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.330 
my door texture turn it on its side and
put<00:01:16.329> and<00:01:16.509> pasted<00:01:16.959> it<00:01:17.079> across<00:01:17.319> the<00:01:17.829> top<00:01:18.039> two

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
put and pasted it across the top two

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.969 
put and pasted it across the top two
halves<00:01:18.549> of<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:18.759> other<00:01:19.479> doors<00:01:19.749> so<00:01:20.649> you<00:01:20.679> see

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
halves of the other doors so you see

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.590 
halves of the other doors so you see
this<00:01:21.130> is<00:01:21.279> a<00:01:21.310> wooden<00:01:21.729> door<00:01:21.909> with<00:01:21.939> the<00:01:22.240> top<00:01:22.420> half

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
this is a wooden door with the top half

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.529 
this is a wooden door with the top half
of<00:01:22.719> that<00:01:22.899> one<00:01:23.079> and<00:01:23.259> this<00:01:23.319> is<00:01:23.380> a<00:01:23.529> iron<00:01:24.159> door

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
of that one and this is a iron door

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:26.910 
of that one and this is a iron door
inside<00:01:25.539> here<00:01:25.779> the<00:01:25.899> little<00:01:25.990> house<00:01:26.259> it's<00:01:26.590> empty

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
inside here the little house it's empty

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.109 
inside here the little house it's empty
because<00:01:27.130> I<00:01:27.279> couldn't<00:01:27.729> really<00:01:27.850> see<00:01:28.090> the

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
because I couldn't really see the

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:29.999 
because I couldn't really see the
details<00:01:28.539> on<00:01:28.659> the<00:01:28.779> inside<00:01:29.049> and<00:01:29.380> I<00:01:29.649> don't<00:01:29.709> think

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
details on the inside and I don't think

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:31.289 
details on the inside and I don't think
I<00:01:30.069> could<00:01:30.219> really<00:01:30.249> do<00:01:30.639> anything<00:01:30.850> with<00:01:30.999> that

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
I could really do anything with that

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.739 
I could really do anything with that
either<00:01:32.939> getting<00:01:33.939> the<00:01:34.060> trees<00:01:34.299> on<00:01:34.450> the<00:01:34.509> sides

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:34.749 
either getting the trees on the sides

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:35.789 
either getting the trees on the sides
were<00:01:35.170> pretty<00:01:35.439> easy

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
were pretty easy

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.889 
were pretty easy
I<00:01:35.950> had<00:01:36.340> to<00:01:36.459> rescan<00:01:36.849> a<00:01:37.060> couple<00:01:37.299> of<00:01:37.389> textures<00:01:37.749> to

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
I had to rescan a couple of textures to

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:39.870 
I had to rescan a couple of textures to
make<00:01:38.020> it<00:01:38.109> look<00:01:38.289> like<00:01:38.409> the<00:01:38.560> trees<00:01:38.770> were<00:01:38.950> growing

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
make it look like the trees were growing

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.919 
make it look like the trees were growing
sideways<00:01:40.119> as<00:01:40.450> well<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:42.579> brick<00:01:43.509> was<00:01:43.719> pretty

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
sideways as well the brick was pretty

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:46.230 
sideways as well the brick was pretty
easy<00:01:44.079> to<00:01:44.229> do<00:01:44.439> it<00:01:44.859> was<00:01:44.979> just<00:01:45.039> a<00:01:45.310> spare<00:01:45.789> texture

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
easy to do it was just a spare texture

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.909 
easy to do it was just a spare texture
probably<00:01:46.990> the<00:01:47.079> one<00:01:47.169> I'm<00:01:47.259> going<00:01:47.439> to<00:01:47.499> be<00:01:47.590> using

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:47.919 
probably the one I'm going to be using

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:51.149 
probably the one I'm going to be using
in<00:01:48.009> the<00:01:48.099> 1.8<00:01:48.579> update<00:01:48.969> over<00:01:49.899> here<00:01:50.439> all<00:01:50.889> this

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
in the 1.8 update over here all this

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.919 
in the 1.8 update over here all this
just<00:01:51.429> took<00:01:51.579> so<00:01:51.880> much<00:01:51.999> effort<00:01:52.209> digging<00:01:52.810> this

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
just took so much effort digging this

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:54.899 
just took so much effort digging this
mine<00:01:53.200> was<00:01:53.529> probably<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.520> hardest<00:01:54.639> part

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
mine was probably the hardest part

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.349 
mine was probably the hardest part
considering<00:01:55.689> how<00:01:56.259> much<00:01:56.380> detail<00:01:56.950> it<00:01:57.369> digging<00:01:58.270> a

00:01:58.349 --> 00:01:58.359 
considering how much detail it digging a

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:01.559 
considering how much detail it digging a
hole<00:01:58.599> took<00:01:59.079> I<00:01:59.579> basically<00:02:00.579> had<00:02:00.880> to<00:02:00.999> build<00:02:01.270> all

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569 
hole took I basically had to build all

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.010 
hole took I basically had to build all
of<00:02:01.749> these<00:02:01.899> mountains<00:02:02.319> all<00:02:03.130> of<00:02:03.429> this<00:02:03.520> terrain

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
of these mountains all of this terrain

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.739 
of these mountains all of this terrain
every<00:02:05.130> attention<00:02:06.130> to<00:02:06.579> the<00:02:06.700> terrain<00:02:07.209> detail

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:07.749 
every attention to the terrain detail

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:10.979 
every attention to the terrain detail
block<00:02:08.259> by<00:02:08.530> block<00:02:08.709> I<00:02:09.160> did<00:02:10.030> use<00:02:10.179> Minecraft<00:02:10.630> edit

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
block by block I did use Minecraft edit

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.670 
block by block I did use Minecraft edit
to<00:02:11.460> make<00:02:12.460> the<00:02:13.120> giant<00:02:13.360> block<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.290> begin<00:02:14.530> with

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
to make the giant block to begin with

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.040 
to make the giant block to begin with
it's<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:15.040> 32<00:02:15.400> by<00:02:15.550> 32<00:02:15.850> square<00:02:16.330> but

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
it's a 32 by 32 square but

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.400 
it's a 32 by 32 square but
I basically<00:02:18.360> hand-dug<00:02:19.360> out<00:02:19.540> all<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:20.020> detail

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
I basically hand-dug out all the detail

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.710 
I basically hand-dug out all the detail
and<00:02:20.860> then<00:02:21.700> built<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.150> mountains<00:02:22.420> up<00:02:22.570> and

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
and then built the mountains up and

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.080 
and then built the mountains up and
everything<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.380> as<00:02:23.980> far<00:02:24.190> as<00:02:24.250> I<00:02:24.430> can<00:02:24.490> tell<00:02:24.820> this

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
everything and as far as I can tell this

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.570 
everything and as far as I can tell this
is<00:02:25.390> an<00:02:25.750> exact<00:02:26.380> replica<00:02:26.920> or<00:02:27.160> at<00:02:27.400> least

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
is an exact replica or at least

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.580 
is an exact replica or at least
extremely<00:02:28.360> close<00:02:28.600> judging<00:02:29.110> by<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.260> picture

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
extremely close judging by the picture

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.860 
extremely close judging by the picture
of<00:02:29.830> course<00:02:30.400> again<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.820> picture<00:02:30.970> was<00:02:31.240> artwork

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
of course again the picture was artwork

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.550 
of course again the picture was artwork
which<00:02:32.380> doesn't<00:02:32.800> really<00:02:34.170> fit<00:02:35.170> well<00:02:35.320> with

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
which doesn't really fit well with

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.310 
which doesn't really fit well with
Minecraft<00:02:36.130> physics<00:02:36.520> so<00:02:36.640> I<00:02:36.700> wasn't<00:02:37.000> able<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.320> do

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
Minecraft physics so I wasn't able to do

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.580 
Minecraft physics so I wasn't able to do
everything<00:02:38.800> perfectly<00:02:39.340> on<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:40.870> other<00:02:40.990> hand<00:02:41.260> I

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
everything perfectly on the other hand I

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.980 
everything perfectly on the other hand I
really<00:02:41.890> wanted<00:02:42.340> to<00:02:42.400> do<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.940> back<00:02:43.300> sides<00:02:43.600> but

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
really wanted to do the back sides but

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.100 
really wanted to do the back sides but
sadly<00:02:44.230> I<00:02:44.620> had<00:02:45.340> no<00:02:45.610> idea<00:02:45.760> what<00:02:46.450> world<00:02:46.630> was<00:02:46.990> on

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
sadly I had no idea what world was on

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.420 
sadly I had no idea what world was on
the<00:02:47.230> back<00:02:47.380> side<00:02:47.590> since<00:02:47.890> they<00:02:48.010> only<00:02:48.160> have<00:02:48.340> the

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
the back side since they only have the

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.240 
the back side since they only have the
front<00:02:48.670> view<00:02:49.480> of<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.690> picture<00:02:49.870> but<00:02:50.680> still<00:02:50.950> the

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
front view of the picture but still the

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.330 
front view of the picture but still the
rest<00:02:51.460> of<00:02:51.580> its<00:02:51.730> just<00:02:51.880> damn<00:02:52.870> amazing<00:02:53.140> if<00:02:54.130> you're

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
rest of its just damn amazing if you're

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.340 
rest of its just damn amazing if you're
interested<00:02:54.970> in<00:02:55.090> actually<00:02:55.270> flying<00:02:55.690> around<00:02:56.020> and

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
interested in actually flying around and

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.640 
interested in actually flying around and
playing<00:02:56.770> on<00:02:57.070> this<00:02:57.460> cube<00:02:58.210> world<00:02:58.450> I'm<00:02:59.320> going<00:02:59.530> to

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
playing on this cube world I'm going to

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.080 
playing on this cube world I'm going to
be<00:02:59.740> linking<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.220> texture<00:03:00.580> pack<00:03:00.730> what<00:03:00.970> you

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
be linking the texture pack what you

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.530 
be linking the texture pack what you
need<00:03:01.330> or<00:03:01.540> it<00:03:01.630> will<00:03:01.810> look<00:03:02.140> weird<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:04.360> world

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
need or it will look weird the world

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.140 
need or it will look weird the world
itself<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.320> a<00:03:05.860> schematic<00:03:06.310> file<00:03:06.520> of<00:03:06.820> the

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
itself and a schematic file of the

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.850 
itself and a schematic file of the
little<00:03:07.570> world<00:03:07.780> so<00:03:08.110> you<00:03:08.200> can<00:03:08.320> post<00:03:08.470> it<00:03:08.590> in<00:03:08.710> your

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
little world so you can post it in your

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.800 
little world so you can post it in your
world<00:03:09.100> or<00:03:09.340> whatever<00:03:09.610> and<00:03:10.000> have<00:03:10.420> fun<00:03:10.570> with<00:03:10.750> it

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
world or whatever and have fun with it

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.440 
world or whatever and have fun with it
so<00:03:11.440> everything<00:03:11.950> you<00:03:12.040> need<00:03:12.220> will<00:03:12.430> be<00:03:12.460> in<00:03:12.880> a<00:03:13.030> zip

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
so everything you need will be in a zip

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.720 
so everything you need will be in a zip
file<00:03:13.690> below<00:03:14.110> all<00:03:14.800> three<00:03:15.190> things<00:03:15.430> will<00:03:15.580> be<00:03:15.640> in

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
file below all three things will be in

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:16.920 
file below all three things will be in
the<00:03:15.820> same<00:03:16.000> folder<00:03:16.360> so<00:03:16.510> you<00:03:16.540> don't<00:03:16.720> have<00:03:16.840> to

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
the same folder so you don't have to

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.570 
the same folder so you don't have to
worry<00:03:17.080> about<00:03:17.140> different<00:03:17.920> downloads<00:03:18.280> and

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
worry about different downloads and

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.150 
worry about different downloads and
that's<00:03:19.540> about<00:03:19.660> it<00:03:19.930> I<00:03:20.110> hope<00:03:20.440> all<00:03:20.650> of<00:03:20.680> you<00:03:20.920> enjoy
