00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.120
 when windows 8 came out last year, that caused a lot of reactions to the one 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.639
 side 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.259
 if you people who were mostly positive about the new man a new ipad vs 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:15.389
 dax art 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.479
 months on the side where also a lot of test on users that completely 

00:00:18.479 --> 00:00:20.640
 had nothing to do with the new interface 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.259
 and to make matters worse 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.460
 hallmark will also be in the old and familiar start menu for those people 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.560
 decreased 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.259
 there was also quite a bit of criticism on windows 8 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.700
 and some people even made the comparison with windows vista 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.700
 and of course the PR department of microsoft was not waiting for that 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.640
 will have to make between 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.460
 something to test that group of frustrated users 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.190
 to accommodate a bit 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.840
 and they do so in part 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.750
 with windows 8 points and and signed later this year should come out and 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.670
 among others 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.609
 the start button 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:53.609
 returns to the taskbar 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.460
 for the people who have never used windows 8 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.680
 just a little explanation 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.850
 the winners no longer see a start button in the lower left-hand corner if you are new with your mouse 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.220
 book will stand we see kind of tern wants to appear from new home screen 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.680
 but the is no knock 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.950
 saw inside right away 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.900
 it brings the start button 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.610
 but when you click on it 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.660
 then you will not get to see the old start as you may be used to 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.610
 windows 7 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.290
 but the model milla your home screen 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.320
 the solo itself is not really big from a functional point of view 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.300
 change 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.860
 but luckily there is something to do about it 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.630
 for example, you can set an overview by pressing the start button 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.390
 opens all applications that are on the system 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.340
 and that way a functionality seems a bit to me again 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.350
 the old one now starts with you click on the button 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.670
 I have a list of applications 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.689
 the overview is therefore a new house style in that man for clarity 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.540
 people who are unlucky that windows 7 start wanting back now 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.710
 they will have to look very closely at the program, because they will gain juice immediately 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.700
 simply get that 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.620
 Another common criticism of windows 8 is that the two interfaces 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.850
 the old test on one side marjoram on the other side completely separate from 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.489
 each other seem to stand to see the bowl 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:18.570
 play to peel booty 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.899
 and they also do not integrate perfectly well with each other 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:22.999
 well because it's a bit better 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:26.029
 can you now once again behind the one election for both the plague 

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:29.809
 use the same lbo peppered eastermar January 

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:31.280
 and that left not so exciting 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.309
 but it really makes sure that the two interface is 

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:35.430
 visually 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.250
 crawl a little closer to each other and that's why it's a whole 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:43.729
 furthermore there are some small tweaks from the user the best one that is easier 

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:47.329
 make so you can set that computer with this desktop to show as pop 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.689
 not first someone new a business and that is a feature that actually 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:53.579
 Of course, it should have been in Windows 8, especially for people who have the 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.339
 working an example packs all day behind computer work 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:59.619
 I can now also see the musis tenth time if you move the mouse to the left or 

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:00.900
 top right corner 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.159
 they can hide 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.010
 With all that option together the piece has become easier to put on asbestos 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.920
 user that man just completely avoid a new line 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.380
 also has fewer consequences 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.380
 that it is forced on and that gets in the way 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:32.349
 maike he was not only looking for the best or user focused far from 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.519
 even because that man has a new ipod touch screens 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:35.859
 our companies have m 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:36.819
 the future 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:37.840
 and they have it 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.669
 improved 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:42.749
 for example, what is very nice is that if your application installs you do not immediately 

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:46.679
 anp has a live language on your home screen as anp gets a lot of people 

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:50.109
 installs start tomorrow went quickly under about nice brought in 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:50.819
 people 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.210
 in windows 8 points one 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.950
 it simply appears between the application overview but it is also on you 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.210
 home screen we have then you have to do that yourself and that makes the home screen 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.209
 a lot of Gordon and clearer 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.429
 the west between those two screens is also a lot easier than a windows 

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:05.899
 8 

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:09.069
 and there you must first call for a minute then press button and then you can 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:10.540
 you knew between the home screen 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.029
 and that katie overview 

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:14.790
 well bendter what a simple way up now 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:15.980
 or wear down 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.400
 and on a pretty okay we managed to click on a small arrow at the bottom left 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.050
 furthermore, some new formats have been added for that list on city 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.870
 home screen 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:25.820
 from very large 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.729
 to a very small chance also to move a bit easier to rank a little easier 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:30.760
 and also nice 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.940
 is that from now on you only adjust the settings less often the normal 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.389
 best to open the control panel 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.819
 because many more institutions can now be seen from that man were a new one 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:40.830
 especially by bus 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.069
 is that very handy 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:46.680
 microsoft also indicates multitasking worked windows 8 she was already reasonable 

00:04:46.679 --> 00:04:47.330
 good at 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.640
 namely, the two applications could run simultaneously via something 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:55.009
 snapshot has 41 on about one third of the screen and others have 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:57.309
 on the remaining two thirds 

00:04:57.309 --> 00:05:00.559
 well i saw inside right away you can decide for yourself how that ratio lies 

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:02.099
 vollenhoven fiftyfifty going 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:04.749
 I had more than two worst draws 

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:08.789
 for this term the maximum is the reds next to each other but if your screen with 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.789
 became a high resolution then you can write even more 

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:16.469
 used to be 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:24.389
 The last major changes to Windows 8 is the Microsoft search function 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:26.430
 namely his own search engine bing 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.220
 linked to the operating system 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.969
 and ladies also not just on the computer itself 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:33.039
 but also online on the web 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:35.849
 the imagine you are on the home screen starts with 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:37.129
 thick for search term 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:40.999
 Amsterdam for example, you will immediately see results on the right 

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:43.029
 of things that look good on your computer 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:44.460
 but the nodes enter 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.969
 then you will see a new screen 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:48.030
 with that claim results from your pc 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.030
 but also webpages videos or photos that are online 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:55.009
 according to microsoft even gets very nice with some search results 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:58.560
 designed total result with large photos and beautiful backgrounds they go 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.439
 for example 

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:02.699
 what you see is reported monaco index it is very nice 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:04.490
 nakheel graphic search results 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.910
 on the other hand, for both previews, it should appear a little to Kuipers 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.910
 buddy 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.990
 Julien behind thinks exactly comes true that is not yet known but probably is 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.419
 still sometime before the end of the year 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:22.550
 and that time is a good use for me because the preview 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.500
 if there is some buddy we will get to work on it, then make sure to get one first 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.900
 pack up 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.160
 at least it is clear that martens want to think behind 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.219
 the desktop and laptop users 

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:35.039
 and that actually had to be 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:36.720
 and i have to say i really do this 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.150
 is an improvement 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.350
 you can more easily avoid that man you like and the start button 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.419
 and the application overview are real improvements 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:47.960
 it's really no return to the Windows 7 start menu and if you're out of luck 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.280
 not without being so tight now how could I see again right away that didn't do much 

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:53.130
 continue to be 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.280
 then you better install a tool like 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.260
 classic shell 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.439
 with which the old start menu can simulate you 

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:03.029
 furthermore mike slott is finished with. a crap went where they were doing 

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:04.099
 with windows 8 

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:07.310
 you may not be there where it is now more extensive you can set more 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.779
 you have more functionality 

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:11.369
 and it just seems a bit better thought out 

00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:15.819
 And certainly noticeable on a thematic difference is very nice that you 

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:19.020
 less often need the old test environment 

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.110
 change settings to get other things done 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.849
 although so know a lot about 8, they also think enough reason to go to that 

00:07:25.849 --> 00:07:28.399
 final release later this year 

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:31.589
 at that time, many of the items supplied will be quickly updated 

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:34.310
 there is also a whole new generation 

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:35.659
 soft inside the store
