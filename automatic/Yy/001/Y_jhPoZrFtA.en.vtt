 string3 the television more also more 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:10.500
 never very many very many thanks 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.259
 and dalí horacio and indeed what heat 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.490
 is making the country's capital makes 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.859
 a few moments , our 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.770
 partner ever are approximately 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.390
 16 degrees Celsius already at this time of 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.039
 day we continue with circulation 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.720
 anticyclonic which is bringing in 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.090
 much of our country temperatures 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.340
 quite pretty hot and we're going to 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.289
 see in this image precisely the one of 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.579
 Satellite Satellite of the 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.320
 conagua what is happening 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.300
 we have humidity intake affecting 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.559
 precisely the Mexican shoal in the 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.079
 extreme northwest skies mostly 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.629
 cleared that creates a new system 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.120
 frontal the number 49 of the season 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.250
 is bringing with it affectation 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.320
 in the northeastern states we continue 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.789
 with strong winds not only in 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.129
 Chihuahua not only in Ciudad Juarez 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.510
 where we send a warm greeting but 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.449
 also in the northeast of our 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.329
 territory in the 9 national among the 40 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.800
 50 and up to 60 kilometers per hour in the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.049
 center of our country skies mostly 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.060
 cleared at some points there are some 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.399
 cloudiness we continue with an event 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.869
 affecting precisely the coastline of 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:11.909
 gulf of mexico which is bringing 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.930
 again I repeat probability of 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.939
 precipitation 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.470
 the high temperatures continue and over 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.780
 all in the south southeast of our 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.430
 national territory so take the 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.470
 due precautions to keep us well 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.049
 hydrated and dalí horacio all our 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.220
 public besides that we have to cover 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.539
 very good ray index 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.610
 ultraviolet that remains as 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.679
 quite high enough let's see this 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.210
 image of satellites precisely for 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:34.920
 see what is happening in this 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.960
 moment what I said income 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.179
 increased humidity throughout this area 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.459
 in the Mexican shoal a little bit from 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:42.810
 sinaloa in durango enters luís potosí in 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:44.640
 zacatecas again returns the 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.959
 precipitation probability what 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.069
 important will continue to be in the 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:49.080
 north of our country 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:50.310
 the winds I repeat strong gusts 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.780
 whirlwind are those who wait 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.399
 again for today so that 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.810
 take the proper precautions but what 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.640
 it seems to you if we are going to see the 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.049
 maximum temperatures in some of the 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.789
 Main cities of our country 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.770
 for you to make plans the 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.750
 Today, Monday, as I say, it is not enough 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.640
 27 degrees in the case of Mexicalli look 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.740
 nothing more up to 34 degrees centigrade 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.929
 hermosillo stays very similar in the 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.180
 case study which 23 cloudiness 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.980
 the same situation in capital chivas with 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.750
 27 degrees centigrade as maximum 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.730
 Mazatlan stays today with 30 degrees 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.590
 centigrade while in tower in 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.049
 saltillo in durango cloudiness is how you 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.329
 he said temperatures that go from 28 31 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.769
 and up to 34 degrees Celsius in the 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.629
 Mexican lowland let's see 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.790
 continuation the situation that happens the 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.590
 today as I said cloudiness in 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.299
 all this area for this income from 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.189
 moisture precisely entering by the 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.870
 Vallarta Mexican Pacific port 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:39.000
 remains with 29 degrees centigrade in 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.040
 zacatecas 26 similar hot springs 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.720
 as well as the morelia we reach today 28 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.269
 degrees Celsius in the case of tampico 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.650
 35 degrees very hot temperatures with 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.900
 quite damp a pretty panorama 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.849
 embarrassing while san luis potosí 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.379
 again help of 29 degrees stays 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.359
 similar in lion with cloudiness is a 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.250
 so dense around the district 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:58.049
 federal what is missing are we going to 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.430
 see it below and that is in all 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.019
 this area in some points and the 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.629
 mostly clear pachuca other 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.040
 scale 25 28 degrees in the case of Puebla 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.139
 it stays similar with 28 degrees 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.030
 centigrade as the maximum in querétaro 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:11.159
 in toluca cuernavaca and acapulco we 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.569
 we will keep the 26 and up to the 33 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.489
 degrees in the case of Cuernavaca with 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.770
 skies mostly clear as you 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.690
 it said in some points if there are clouds 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.970
 there is even humidity in the environment 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.950
 discards the possibility of territory 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.050
 national here the important thing will continue 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.180
 being the high temperatures throughout 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.740
 this veracruz area stays with 33 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.840
 degrees rain probability in the 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.130
 north in the south and clear skies the 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.650
 Same situation in Villahermosa Tabasco 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.720
 with 39 degrees senses imagine in 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.330
 and we were exceeding 100 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.490
 degrees this in scale so oaxaca 36 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.250
 in tuxtla we are left with 37 campeche 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:47.610
 likewise 36 degrees measure 42 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.710
 degrees centigrade a lot of heat in the 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.270
 mexican caribbean cancún around 31 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.830
 degrees centigrade that is what happens 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.000
 here in the federal district we are going to 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.710
 see it below 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.570
 and is that as the drought as we have 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.520
 been observing the temperatures were 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.530
 they keep quite warm enough today 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.990
 skies mostly clear a lot of heat 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.030
 29 degrees Celsius for next days 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.250
 we will have 28 for tomorrow next 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.570
 Wednesday we have a slight decline 23 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.700
 degrees are quite temperatures 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.800
 stable while the minimum will be around 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.840
 before 3 of the 14 degrees already for 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.940
 next days we will not have 22 23 degrees 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.920
 and will return the probability of 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.790
 precipitation here to the country's capital 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.440
 for the 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.730
 For now, what happens in 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.100
 Monterrey Nuevo Leon told you about the 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.940
 northeast coahuila new lion tamaulipas 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.590
 Instability in time probability 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.240
 of rain as well as some 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.680
 cloudiness is in the case of monterrey is 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.360
 interesting to mention what the 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.590
 Precipitation probability descends 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.600
 for him so far today 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.000
 we reach 29 degrees centigrade for 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.400
 next days we will stay 27 28 29 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.260
 degrees the minimum hovering around 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.940
 the 12 the 13 until the 15 degrees with 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.140
 some cloudiness since I repeat we are going to 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.690
 close the week with skies mostly 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.460
 cleared this so far what is 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.080
 what happens in guadalajara jalisco in the 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.150
 pearl tapatía in this case skies 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.010
 cleared today we reach 29 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.930
 degrees centigrade in spite of it eye 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.940
 there is enough humidity in the environment to 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.680
 next days we will keep 27 of 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.660
 same shape 29 degrees centigrade the 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.280
 minimum hovering between 12 and 13 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.840
 degrees I repeat if with some 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.370
 cloudiness is and with some humidity 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.780
 there is even a slight chance of 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.160
 precipitation that mostly goes to 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.630
 stay in the coastal area of ​​the bonito 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.160
 Jalisco state 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.990
 Later I'll come back with more 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.640
 information not without before good 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.950
 recommend them as always to keep 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.410
 well moisturized and dalí horacio must be 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.000
 cover us from the sun's rays use 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.580
 cap everything that is necessary because 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.110
 at this point the index turns violet 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.000
 arnaldo can attract us multiple 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.680
 diseases like skin cancer between 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.900
 other questions so it is better 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.879
 prevent waiting I have an excellent and 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.069
 wonderful day boys come back with
