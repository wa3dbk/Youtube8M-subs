00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.440
 Well, admit that you really 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.660
 never thought of guy ramsey as 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.550
 one of the best players of his 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.830
 teams did not think do not lie 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.470
 he never appeared on the first roles 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.840
 he didn't give the impression of super talent 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.010
 Do u midfielder moreover in 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.679
 hit composition 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.930
 We have always had problems like so 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.149
 it happened that now we have to 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.700
 hypocrite about whether or not he 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:46.860
 was a talent and all he needed was 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:49.649
 trust time yes nothing fell situation with 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.110
 renzo it without similar progress find 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.420
 some one but exactly the most important 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.789
 factor can't be it 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.340
 just doesn't exist almost certainly 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.750
 dealing with several 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.750
 reasons and here they are 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.980
 when the team are laughing at 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.440
 absolutely everyone comes almost 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.050
 half a million and they mix ozil hard 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.720
 become not only competitors in opel 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.710
 but by the arsenal players themselves 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.620
 in this case 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.560
 another place in the attacking group took 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.840
 someone other than you later 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.720
 mother of flamini also appeared in the role 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.840
 the second time to the conclusion is second place 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.119
 disappeared right from under your feet and in all this 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.630
 The hectic was clearly visible that Aaron 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.780
 ramzi not exactly the same and but so so 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.990
 perspectives let one of either remsi 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.170
 playing with the stars or looking at them with 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.170
 parties 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.530
 finally making it to the base 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.799
 it is logical you get the company to the best 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.470
 the goat has already cut the show and Santi Cazorla 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.849
 then shine on the field so 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.640
 more score balls 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:16.340
 it gets so much easier 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.709
 that Arsen Wenger himself was on baldel from 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.709
 weekly takes mountain for flight 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.659
 of course when you fly out of football 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.450
 almost a year is very tempting 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:41.090
 finish football well or be in 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.819
 any kind of birmingham yes and yes on 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.370
 bench and the fact that aaron ramsey right 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:49.250
 now before in the arsenal clearly speaks of 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.280
 gene Arsene Wenger after waiting for so many 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.769
 wait absolutely incomprehensible what perhaps 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.709
 can only arsen but he damn 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.450
 take rights and in front of him clearly stood 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.200
 that story with the brazilian 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.200
 Edward 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.219
 if we talk about the position of Reims on the field 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.680
 then she also changed if 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:20.290
 previously blamed performed central shooting 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.409
 midfielder then aaron ramsey 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.629
 right now midfielder attacking 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:31.689
 Speaking easier, Randy started to play much 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:33.819
 closer to the same growth of their heads of houses is true 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:36.639
 there is still a bunch of banal or fidelity 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.579
 sort of strong that psychology at the end 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:42.510
 all terrible fact but hardly all of it 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:45.579
 confused at least some logic is 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.439
 the main thing is that thorin ramsey 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.930
 stopped killing everyone around 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:52.019
 now he kills teams on football 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.019
 field 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.450
 but 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.790
 let's go 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.459
 clear
