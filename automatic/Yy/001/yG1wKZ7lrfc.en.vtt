or good defense yes sir I think that's

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.649 
or good defense yes sir I think that's
that<00:01:14.250> if<00:01:15.250> you<00:01:15.549> can't<00:01:15.790> hit<00:01:15.909> an<00:01:16.060> opponent<00:01:16.299> if

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
that if you can't hit an opponent if

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.990 
that if you can't hit an opponent if
you're<00:01:17.260> very<00:01:17.830> good<00:01:18.010> defense<00:01:18.310> to<00:01:18.430> be<00:01:18.580> able<00:01:18.700> to

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000
