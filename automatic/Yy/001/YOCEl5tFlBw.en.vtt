cool<00:01:20.100> ok<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:22.020> colors<00:01:22.440> you<00:01:22.920> know<00:01:23.070> nothing

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
cool ok the colors you know nothing

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.810 
cool ok the colors you know nothing
special<00:01:24.240> but<00:01:24.570> hey<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.560> looks<00:01:25.680> great<00:01:25.950> ok<00:01:26.550> so<00:01:26.610> now

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
special but hey it looks great ok so now

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.640 
special but hey it looks great ok so now
ok<00:01:27.360> we'll<00:01:27.870> get<00:01:28.020> into<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.320> transformation

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
ok we'll get into the transformation

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.130 
ok we'll get into the transformation
which<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.490> actually<00:01:29.760> I<00:01:30.330> think<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.900> coolest

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
which is actually I think the coolest

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.070 
which is actually I think the coolest
part<00:01:31.680> because<00:01:32.010> his<00:01:32.190> transformation<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:33.270> not

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
part because his transformation is not

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.060 
part because his transformation is not
the<00:01:34.380> average<00:01:35.450> so<00:01:36.450> it's<00:01:36.480> really<00:01:37.380> kind<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.860> neat

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
the average so it's really kind of neat

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.260 
the average so it's really kind of neat
ok<00:01:38.580> so<00:01:39.270> let<00:01:39.780> me<00:01:39.870> try<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.080> do<00:01:40.260> this<00:01:40.440> right<00:01:40.680> here

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
ok so let me try to do this right here

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.290 
ok so let me try to do this right here
ok<00:01:42.270> if<00:01:42.510> I<00:01:42.660> even

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
ok if I even

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.170 
ok if I even
remember<00:01:43.540> the<00:01:43.660> order<00:01:43.830> ok<00:01:44.830> so<00:01:44.890> now<00:01:45.180> separate

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
remember the order ok so now separate

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.620 
remember the order ok so now separate
this<00:01:46.570> and<00:01:46.980> this<00:01:47.980> is<00:01:48.190> the<00:01:48.340> crazy<00:01:48.730> part<00:01:49.210> this<00:01:49.480> is

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
this and this is the crazy part this is

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.760 
this and this is the crazy part this is
real<00:01:50.020> crazy<00:01:50.350> look<00:01:50.650> you<00:01:51.220> rotate<00:01:51.910> that<00:01:52.780> that<00:01:53.380> is

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
real crazy look you rotate that that is

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.220 
real crazy look you rotate that that is
so<00:01:54.100> unique<00:01:54.520> in<00:01:55.150> my<00:01:55.360> opinion<00:01:55.630> right<00:01:55.870> there<00:01:56.020> you

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
so unique in my opinion right there you

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.350 
so unique in my opinion right there you
rotate<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:56.830> wings<00:01:56.950> like<00:01:57.220> that<00:01:57.460> and<00:01:57.700> these

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
rotate the wings like that and these

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.410 
rotate the wings like that and these
become<00:01:58.600> his<00:01:58.900> huge<00:01:59.260> feet<00:01:59.710> so<00:02:00.040> you<00:02:00.100> know<00:02:00.550> you<00:02:01.210> bet

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
become his huge feet so you know you bet

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.970 
become his huge feet so you know you bet
he's<00:02:01.630> going<00:02:01.780> to<00:02:01.840> be<00:02:01.930> able<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.170> stand<00:02:02.350> really

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 
he's going to be able to stand really

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.430 
he's going to be able to stand really
well<00:02:03.190> and<00:02:03.490> you<00:02:04.450> just<00:02:04.630> rotate<00:02:04.960> these<00:02:05.140> things

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
well and you just rotate these things

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.600 
well and you just rotate these things
all<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.670> way<00:02:06.820> and<00:02:07.500> let's<00:02:08.500> see<00:02:08.710> I<00:02:09.130> don't<00:02:09.550> know

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
all the way and let's see I don't know

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.310 
all the way and let's see I don't know
if<00:02:09.670> I<00:02:09.790> flip<00:02:10.060> that<00:02:10.270> yeah<00:02:10.750> I<00:02:10.810> think<00:02:10.899> I<00:02:11.110> flipped

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
if I flip that yeah I think I flipped

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.400 
if I flip that yeah I think I flipped
that<00:02:11.440> right<00:02:11.910> okay<00:02:12.910> and<00:02:13.210> then<00:02:13.420> his<00:02:13.630> arms<00:02:14.170> as

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
that right okay and then his arms as

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.520 
that right okay and then his arms as
