00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
covering that and you're going to do the

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:39.030 
covering that and you're going to do the
same<00:03:33.700> idea<00:03:33.880> same<00:03:34.299> rhythm<00:03:37.590> now<00:03:38.590> if<00:03:38.709> I<00:03:38.769> play

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
same idea same rhythm now if I play

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.880 
same idea same rhythm now if I play
through<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.370> song<00:03:39.640> that<00:03:40.360> that<00:03:40.810> section<00:03:41.200> it's

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
through the song that that section it's

00:03:41.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
through the song that that section it's
going<00:03:42.130> to<00:03:42.190> go

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.900 

that<00:04:04.750> goes<00:04:05.020> back<00:04:05.290> into<00:04:05.560> after<00:04:06.280> that<00:04:06.460> you're

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
that goes back into after that you're

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:16.380 
that goes back into after that you're
going<00:04:07.030> to<00:04:07.060> go<00:04:07.180> back<00:04:07.360> into<00:04:07.570> do<00:04:07.840> enough<00:04:15.330> now<00:04:16.330> the

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
going to go back into do enough now the

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.720 
going to go back into do enough now the
difference<00:04:17.049> is<00:04:17.200> here<00:04:17.680> I<00:04:17.830> think<00:04:18.190> this<00:04:18.489> is<00:04:18.549> the

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
difference is here I think this is the

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:27.840 
difference is here I think this is the
chorus<00:04:19.060> part<00:04:19.180> so<00:04:19.360> you're<00:04:19.450> going<00:04:19.570> to<00:04:19.630> go<00:04:26.850> it

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
chorus part so you're going to go it

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:42.720 
chorus part so you're going to go it
goes<00:04:28.030> that<00:04:28.330> gia<00:04:28.690> we<00:04:28.960> just<00:04:29.170> played<00:04:41.700> there's<00:04:42.700> a

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
goes that gia we just played there's a

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.470 
goes that gia we just played there's a
breakdown<00:04:43.150> part<00:04:43.510> okay<00:04:43.930> we'll<00:04:44.080> stop<00:04:44.290> it<00:04:44.440> there
