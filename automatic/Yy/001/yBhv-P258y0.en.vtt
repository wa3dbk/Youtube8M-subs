00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.980
 inspired by the most famous world heart 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.660
 online it was panda in the initial incipit 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.640
 but developing the plot in a way 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.250
 completely different 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.130

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.119
 bimestrial 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.240
 sakamoto Wheel is a 22 year old unemployed 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.490
 who lives with her mother in the lives of 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.560
 everyday an ordinary person but 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.960
 online is famous for being in the top ten 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.520
 of the world boot ranking an e 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.170
 simultaneously the best player 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.090
 of japan 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.159
 on a private day he wakes up on an island 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.560
 tropical having no idea how it could 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.659
 having ended up seeing someone in 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.280
 distance calls for help but for all 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.680
 answer the launch of a stranger 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.640
 bomb on wheel realizes 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.470
 to be finished in some way 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.720
 trapped in a real version of the 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.060
 bluetooth game and therefore will have to do 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.069
 everything possible to survive like 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.280
 I always avoid going further to avoid 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.280
 spoiler 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.030
 regarding the graphic aspect 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.610
 I consider this anime technically 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.290
 indiscreet six characters that landscapes 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.630
 they are well done and the same speech 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.670
 applies to animations and explosions 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.100
 which are really very frequent being 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.630
 bluetooth a game based on grenades 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.610
 as for the audio I found it 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.530
 generally good or particularly 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.110
 loved the opening that one of mine 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.880
 favorite along with cross in field and in 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.319
 meaning the two opening this world heart on 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.450
 line 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.450
 the opening is called no pain no gain 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.940
 sung by nano the second opening yes 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.250
 titled exis always sung by the dwarf 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.360
 while lending is called aurora e 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.360
 decanted by main 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.629
 you do well 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.819
 even if the authors of these years 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:03.739
 they were inspired by sau personally 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.810
 this anime reminds me much more about me 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.060
 rainey who why just like the sights 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.590
 who is there a continuous sense of anxiety and the 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.750
 awareness that the protagonist does not 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.640
 can trust no one always has the 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.140
 feeling that the protagonist can 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.269
 to be betrayed by others for a moment 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.430
 to the other and that that character to whom 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.739
 maybe you could become ill 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.090
 a great asshole obviously the 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.040
 plot a logical sense is the protagonist 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.409
 is on this island for a reason 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.599
 very precise and everything will be explained 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:31.220
 with the continuation of it to the control 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.440
 of viewfinder, however, the plot is not 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.090
 concludes with the end of the soul are 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.250
 therefore waiting for a second season 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.930
 Having said this, I greet you and invite you to 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.010
 leave me a nice like is a comment 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.010
 if you go to the next one
