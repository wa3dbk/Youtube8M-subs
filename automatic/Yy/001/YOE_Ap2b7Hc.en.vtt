00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.770
 good afternoon here in our tutorial 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.759
 this time about the song of the 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.070
 romanesca 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:12.280
 has to do with Chinese issues some 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:15.130
 rare pod go but consider others 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.810
 it's like classical music 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.700
 today we are going to start with the right hand 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.700
 with the slow melody 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.950
 that is repeated 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:16.150
 and that basically of the whole song with 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.710
 the right hand so 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.200
 let's see now as in the hand 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.740
 left I will continue here with the 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.160
 melody but you think as with the 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.160
 left hand 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.820
 i 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.820
 ah 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.770
 ah 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.110
 notice that the left hand 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.140
 the way to touch it is like that 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.140
 forever 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.460
 here 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.450
 they understand what it is about 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.830
 today we are going to give it again slow 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.989
 ah 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.220
 ah 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.659
 if it comes back to repeat already we go with the 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.659
 another part so as not to do the annoying 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.040
 ah 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.140
 Y 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.129
 ah 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.540
 again 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.540
 ah 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.260
 ah 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.660
 basically that 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:48.170
 the song is not so difficult 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.170
 and well I hope it can be ideal
