00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:15.280
 well it is everyone is sure 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.050
 win as much for a new video 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.560
 so today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.930
 to lift a quad on take a look at 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.939
 ps4 where it's still all the tastes 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:29.169
 all platforms its margin of any 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:32.489
 way so I comment not finally indicated 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:35.020
 I'm just starting off, so there 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.110
 if I do not speak if I'm not 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.520
 synchronized with the video it's normal 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.970
 so then there as you see on the screen 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.050
 I play case for magnetic man comes 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.230
 finally beautifully well we do not like 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.140
 not but here I am, I will 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.690
 learn to pitch up but just before that 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.480
 I will tell you that I realize this 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.780
 small assembly with with sheikh factory 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.780
 so here is so first video so 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.839
 here I use expensive factory directly 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.939
 since ps4 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.770
 so now we are going to 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:10.719
 to interest in topics to fit 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.640
 you simply level up 

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:16.140
 down where I am and bar of 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.600
 traction precisely then you have to 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.549
 really roll slowly 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.009
 once your head touches the bar 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.560
 you accelerate but you see that 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.149
 your quad starts to get up 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.740
 you go there gradually that wants 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.520
 to say you're not going there you 're not going 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.619
 hold your key to move forward 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.310
 fully you go kind went 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:41.319
 gently so here's like on screen 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.030
 to try not to fall 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:45.429
 so you'll see that at one point 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.539
 I wanted to do it quickly for you 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:50.859
 show and that I fell so he 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:55.259
 just put the joystick 

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:57.819
 left down while accelerating 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.759
 after to turn once you 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:03.959
 get well to stay once you 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:06.729
 get to control your your line 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:07.840
 so to simply turn if 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.149
 you want to turn right 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.360
 you put your joystick to the 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.430
 left so basically it's simple 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.380
 turn your wheels if you put your 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.670
 wheels to the left you will go to the right 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.240
 if you turn your wheels to the right 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.340
 you will go to the left so I think that 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.880
 I will miss 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.380
 he was not sure so it's simple 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.030
 also also if you want more 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.160
 other videos of this type 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.560
 do not hesitate to subscribe to leave 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.020
 a blue thumb when it could even 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.610
 encourage for the future to get you out 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:45.420
 little utopias like doing the two 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.820
 wheels in what do you do i cross 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.220
 turn while making a euro and 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.400
 also know how to do with motorcycles 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.070
 with all the bikes normally finally 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.140
 I have not tried with everything so there like 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.090
 you see I turn to meyrueis open 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.620
 the right so I turn to the left 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.820
 but also open the left now 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.100
 so I turn to the right 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.350
 it's like I said after you 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.459
 see if you listen well to the fact you 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.489
 wait until I even have little aces 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:17.040
 cool I'm not going to stay pressed I 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:19.620
 lets you listen quickly to the 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.269
 then we bubble as you see I 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.959
 I really do small lakes where his 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.940
 limits and I support but I love games 2d 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.360
 that I see that I'm going too fast I have 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.780
 slow motion 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.940
 I stop supporting and do not worry 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.530
 if if you have too much people 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.269
 speed 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.280
 and well, it's still going to leave you 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.989
 how to say if you have too much 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.730
 high speed if you have been sped up 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:46.440
 you will continue the interventions 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.260
 so here I think I went around 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.970
 so I leave you and I tell you to the 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.330
 next it's Saturday 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.330
