00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.010
 Thursday the masne hello you are 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.740
 nutritionist so how do foods 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.049
 does it influence the brain then the 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.730
 foods are very important because 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.189
 the brain is very demanding in energy 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.170
 he needs vitamin vitamins from 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.470
 protein so it's more meat 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.090
 fish of sugars and fats 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.710
 and so all that will be brought by 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.630
 food and especially a 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.700
 balanced diet of quality and 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.110
 varied for example a student who 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.329
 pass the ferry right now what is this 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.480
 they ate to boost the brain 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.010
 so today we can not say 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.420
 that we can boost the brain 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.410
 if we have a bad diet yes we 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.180
 may decrease performance 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.670
 intellectuals so the diet 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.760
 balanced she will bring us all 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.280
 interesting things for the brain 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.050
 for the body generally after 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.789
 within the balanced diet 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.469
 some foods are more interesting 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.399
 than other hens for memory 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.879
 concretely what we ate 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.329
 to promote the acquisition of 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.040
 knowledge 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.020
 so it's going to be food 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.520
 accurate in each group of 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.900
 balanced diet so in the 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.820
 vegetables starchy foods proteins 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.290
 floor fruits in the vegetables we go 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.720
 prefer green vegetables that go 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.189
 decrease the acidity the acidity that is 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.470
 created by the stress that consume the 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.330
 vitamins and minerals in starchy foods 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.710
 will prefer starchy rather complete 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.450
 who will bring us energy on 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.250
 the long term that will allow us to 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.340
 do not be hungry and the brain is very 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.170
 sugar consumers so brought in by 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.400
 these complete starchy foods at the level of 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.280
 proteins we are going to have proteins 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.659
 rather lean meat poultry 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.509
 white ham of eggs or 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.810
 fish to avoid a food 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.640
 too rich that we digest badly at the level 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.009
 fruits we will prefer fruits 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.689
 rather rich in vitamins so there for 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.500
 the revisions the orange grapefruit 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.100
 lemon 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.380
 all that will be interesting 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.150
 all that will be what will bring 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.680
 a lot of energy and for dairy products 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.479
 rather dairy lean yoghurt 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.159
 Swiss small white cheese 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.170
 many students also in the morning do 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.530
 the impasse his breakfast for lack 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.790
 of time 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.360
 it's really important that they come 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.950
 before before a big day it's very 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.450
 important because the night one consumes 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.010
 energy we consume disappointed we 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.330
 consumes proteins and if we do not 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.459
 do not start our day eating 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.170
 we will have problems our body is going 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.000
 tap into his stocks in his reserves 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.950
 and automatically will not put all the 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.600
 chances on our side for to have 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.400
 good intellectual performance 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.959
 which concretely a breakfast 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.400
 ideal for a student who spend the 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.170
 bac hours the assistant a breakfast 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.760
 the ideal it would be for me a muesli which 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.739
 will contain oatmeal which will 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.050
 are more interesting than cereals 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.209
 with dried fruits fruits china 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.739
 is a cheese to read then fruit 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.780
 oleaginous this cd almonds hazelnuts 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.430
 nut nuts dried fruits it's 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.590
 all the fruits but that have been dried 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.170
 in which we remove the water with a 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.730
 so dairy white cheese what is it 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.190
 whatever and a good fruit juice 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.959
 fresh squeezed it's perfect if not bread 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.120
 full butter jam fruit juice 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.440
 it's also very good and after the evening 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.810
 the day before that there are elements that 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.760
 will influence this until the next day 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.769
 so we will have priority 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.090
 starchy foods to bring energy through 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.489
 against it tries to have a digestion 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.769
 rather easier so we will cook well 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.049
 our starchy rice pasta potatoes 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.010
 no problem we will avoid the protein the 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.900
 evening we do not need it 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.160
 rather cooked vegetables so 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.109
 zucchini green beans things 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.060
 like that and then we can finish on a 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:23.420
 cottage cheese a compote the foods to 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.519
 avoid a revision to avoid we will 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.320
 avoid all the exciting coffee the tea 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.120
 they have an opposite effect ie 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.310
 that they will increase the stress the hyper 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.739
 excellent excitability they will bring 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.970
 dehydration for the day but 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.170
 language revision of the role often 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.049
 drinks coffee because he just remembered 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.100
 the blow is the same the revision is 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.440
 a bit like performance 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.250
 physical training the revision 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.739
 it is she who will condition 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.450
 finally the exam so you have to 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.800
 be good on revisions a 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.750
 dehydration 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.890
 not worn by the coffee but so 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.430
 general may decrease performance 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:58.820
 interac so no kepa 2 coffee the 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.290
 morning in the morning what we will avoid is 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.610
 anything that will hinder the transit so the 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.100
 fats the fats cooked the 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.780
 fermentable foods so cabbage 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.340
 broccoli all those things that are going 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.320
 hinder digestion that will get tired 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.900
 mcdo body scrambled kebab 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.070
 we avoid we are going to avoid everything 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.630
 just because those rich 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.100
 it tires the body and we will not have 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.350
 not all the essential nutrients for 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.850
 we observe okay woods are 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.280
 also invited in addition sodas which 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.100
 conversely sodas are going to be avoided 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.110
 because they will provoke 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.640
 reactive hypoglycemia actually putting 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.800
 too much sugar at once in the body 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.540
 is going to be tired and 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.040
 we can very badly started a day in 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.780
 doing that is by cons during 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.980
 the test a small to small bars 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.670
 chocolate or something like that 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.650
 can be an evil too 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.390
 yes yes or so a handful of fruits 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.920
 dry with almonds and hazelnuts or 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.510
 so a few squares of chocolate is 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.750
 ok also very well thank you 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.750
 a lot
