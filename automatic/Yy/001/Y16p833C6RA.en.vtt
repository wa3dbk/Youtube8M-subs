00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.080
 hello in a previous video I did the 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.960
 comment that I do not wash the 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.090
 hair with shampoo then they uploaded me 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.609
 the questions of how it is that I wash 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.430
 the hair they put if it is not greater science 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:26.529
 I hear it once I tried it and I liked it 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.439
 and it was still a year ago 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.840
 doing it anti that my hair stayed more 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:35.530
 gentle in doing two less than a minute 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.790
 and the name of this is howard koh for 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.430
 equal conditioner 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.530
 by bones 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.270
 this is based on the idea that the shampoo 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.380
 and the conditioner have exactly 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.970
 the same ingredients or very similar 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.010
 except for people who do 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.070
 foam that this would be the sulfates and 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.930
 the impacts dry out the hair 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.640
 because not if they have practically what 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.920
 I wash my hair with 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.739
 conditioner this method is for 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.290
 people who have their hair fluffed 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:10.590
 Chinese wavy or dried out if you have the 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.990
 very greasy hair do not recommend it 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.810
 I do not have greasy and I do it and I am 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.590
 sincere the days that I'm lazy and not what 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.440
 I do well if I have a little bit of greasy 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.000
 but if I do it right and I do not need more or 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.190
 be with the pure conditioner the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.899
 hair is not free was the hit 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.530
 about this way of washing your hair 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:33.560
 that many companies took 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:37.790
 cleaning conditioners 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.820

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.000
 first it came out to be washed on 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.579
 hair with conditioner I use 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.250
 I use this one because it's the most 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.929
 cheap and you use a lot 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.670
 Many girls use the most 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:55.130
 like it and leave it like this I grabbed this 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.890
 As if it were shampoo I wet my hair 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.710
 I put it on I let it opt ​​for 5 minutes 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.450
 and then I enter it and I keep it and 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.600

 Chávez comments that visions of 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.980
