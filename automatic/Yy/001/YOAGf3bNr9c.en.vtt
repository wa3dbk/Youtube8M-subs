is<00:02:21.450> my<00:02:21.750> mom

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.320 

here<00:02:28.500> was<00:02:28.740> your<00:02:29.340> scallop<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:29.940> as<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.180> can<00:02:30.270> see

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
here was your scallop and as you can see

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.660 
here was your scallop and as you can see
it<00:02:30.600> looks<00:02:30.720> like<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.960> ball<00:02:31.230> when<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.220> needle<00:02:32.580> was

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
it looks like a ball when the needle was

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.120 
it looks like a ball when the needle was
in<00:02:32.820> the<00:02:32.910> center<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.810> put<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.320> needle<00:02:34.830> on<00:02:35.040> the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
in the center I put the needle on the

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.210 
in the center I put the needle on the
left<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.700> it<00:02:35.790> turned<00:02:36.000> into<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.240> scallop<00:02:36.720> so<00:02:37.500> it

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
left and it turned into a scallop so it

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.700 
left and it turned into a scallop so it
does<00:02:38.430> depend<00:02:38.460> or<00:02:39.090> where<00:02:39.360> your<00:02:39.510> needle<00:02:39.690> is<00:02:40.020> set

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
does depend or where your needle is set

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.440 
does depend or where your needle is set
as<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.160> what<00:02:41.370> your<00:02:41.490> decorations<00:02:42.120> your

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
as to what your decorations your

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.020 
as to what your decorations your
patterns<00:02:42.840> look<00:02:43.080> like<00:02:43.370> so<00:02:44.370> ultimately<00:02:44.670> this

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
patterns look like so ultimately this

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:55.480 
patterns look like so ultimately this
machine<00:02:45.570> has<00:02:46.380> like<00:02:46.770> one<00:02:47.130> two<00:02:47.310> three

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.390 

twenty-eight<00:02:56.490> patterns<00:02:57.120> basic<00:02:57.870> times<00:02:58.400> 3

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
twenty-eight patterns basic times 3

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.790 
twenty-eight patterns basic times 3
because<00:03:00.000> 3<00:03:00.390> different<00:03:00.750> needle<00:03:00.990> positions<00:03:01.470> so

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
because 3 different needle positions so

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.150 
because 3 different needle positions so
you've<00:03:01.950> got<00:03:02.190> like<00:03:03.590> basically<00:03:04.590> 90<00:03:05.040> different

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
you've got like basically 90 different

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.280 
you've got like basically 90 different
patterns<00:03:05.790> that<00:03:05.910> this<00:03:06.150> machine<00:03:06.360> can<00:03:06.720> make<00:03:06.780> with

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
patterns that this machine can make with

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.710 
patterns that this machine can make with
no<00:03:07.500> cams<00:03:07.830> if<00:03:08.190> everything<00:03:08.730> is<00:03:08.850> built-in<00:03:09.210> so

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
no cams if everything is built-in so

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.930 
no cams if everything is built-in so
that's<00:03:09.930> pretty<00:03:10.170> neat

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
that's pretty neat

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.970 
that's pretty neat
