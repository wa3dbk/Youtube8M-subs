fatty acids essential is the word really
we're<00:00:10.480> always<00:00:10.630> hearing<00:00:10.930> of<00:00:11.110> the<00:00:11.230> importance

we're always hearing of the importance
of<00:00:11.950> the<00:00:12.220> right<00:00:12.400> balance<00:00:12.670> of<00:00:13.030> Amiga<00:00:13.660> 3<00:00:13.900> and

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:14.020 
of the right balance of Amiga 3 and

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.650 
of the right balance of Amiga 3 and
Omega<00:00:14.290> 6<00:00:14.560> and<00:00:14.830> I<00:00:15.250> reckon<00:00:15.610> even<00:00:16.359> if<00:00:16.449> we're<00:00:16.630> not

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:16.660 
Omega 6 and I reckon even if we're not

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.779 
Omega 6 and I reckon even if we're not
vegetarians<00:00:17.410> even<00:00:17.529> if<00:00:17.680> we<00:00:17.830> do<00:00:18.039> eat<00:00:18.220> fish<00:00:18.250> most

vegetarians even if we do eat fish most
of<00:00:18.939> us<00:00:19.029> couldn't<00:00:19.269> eat<00:00:19.419> enough<00:00:19.779> oily<00:00:20.199> fish<00:00:20.410> to

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
of us couldn't eat enough oily fish to

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.710 
of us couldn't eat enough oily fish to
really<00:00:20.919> provide<00:00:21.220> us<00:00:21.249> with<00:00:21.579> the<00:00:22.119> amount<00:00:22.509> that

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
really provide us with the amount that

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.439 
really provide us with the amount that
we<00:00:22.869> need<00:00:23.079> I<00:00:23.400> did<00:00:24.400> tell<00:00:24.730> many<00:00:25.089> of<00:00:25.210> you<00:00:25.300> recently

we need I did tell many of you recently
about<00:00:25.900> an<00:00:25.989> omega-3<00:00:26.380> test<00:00:26.859> that<00:00:27.009> I<00:00:27.039> did<00:00:27.130> and<00:00:27.519> I

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:27.579 
about an omega-3 test that I did and I

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:29.339 
about an omega-3 test that I did and I
figure<00:00:28.060> my<00:00:28.210> diet<00:00:28.449> is<00:00:28.599> pretty<00:00:28.720> healthy<00:00:28.989> but<00:00:29.319> I

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:29.349 
figure my diet is pretty healthy but I

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:31.859 
figure my diet is pretty healthy but I
was<00:00:29.529> shocked<00:00:29.800> to<00:00:29.980> find<00:00:30.220> how<00:00:30.369> low<00:00:30.669> my<00:00:31.300> levels<00:00:31.659> of

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
was shocked to find how low my levels of

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.100 
was shocked to find how low my levels of
omega-3<00:00:32.590> were<00:00:32.770> so<00:00:33.579> to<00:00:33.970> increase<00:00:34.149> our<00:00:34.630> health

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
omega-3 were so to increase our health

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.480 
omega-3 were so to increase our health
and<00:00:35.290> well-being<00:00:35.470> I<00:00:35.830> really<00:00:36.070> believe<00:00:36.310> we<00:00:36.340> need

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:36.490 
and well-being I really believe we need

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.670 
and well-being I really believe we need
a<00:00:36.670> mega<00:00:37.060> three<00:00:37.270> and<00:00:37.360> six<00:00:37.630> fats<00:00:37.960> particularly

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
a mega three and six fats particularly

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.440 
a mega three and six fats particularly
because<00:00:39.340> much<00:00:39.490> of<00:00:39.520> the<00:00:39.730> fat<00:00:39.940> and<00:00:40.120> the<00:00:40.210> oil<00:00:40.240> that

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
because much of the fat and the oil that

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.630 
because much of the fat and the oil that
we<00:00:40.660> eat<00:00:40.780> each<00:00:40.960> day<00:00:41.230> is<00:00:41.560> quite<00:00:42.010> damaged<00:00:42.490> by

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
we eat each day is quite damaged by

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.790 
we eat each day is quite damaged by
processing<00:00:43.300> or<00:00:43.540> heating<00:00:44.110> it<00:00:44.230> through<00:00:44.410> cooking

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
processing or heating it through cooking

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.520 
processing or heating it through cooking
or<00:00:45.100> its<00:00:45.490> saturated<00:00:45.940> fat<00:00:46.360> what<00:00:47.110> we<00:00:47.200> need<00:00:47.320> to<00:00:47.440> do

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
or its saturated fat what we need to do

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.320 
or its saturated fat what we need to do
is<00:00:47.620> replace<00:00:47.770> these<00:00:48.280> damaged<00:00:48.700> or<00:00:48.880> saturated

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.330 
is replace these damaged or saturated

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.540 
is replace these damaged or saturated
fats<00:00:49.690> with<00:00:49.870> a<00:00:49.930> greater<00:00:50.260> quantity<00:00:50.590> over<00:00:51.250> Omega

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
fats with a greater quantity over Omega

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.390 
fats with a greater quantity over Omega
3<00:00:51.760> and<00:00:51.790> 6<00:00:52.390> and<00:00:52.750> that<00:00:53.140> will<00:00:53.200> lead<00:00:53.500> us<00:00:53.530> to<00:00:53.770> optimum

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
3 and 6 and that will lead us to optimum

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
already know about this fantastic

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.460 
already know about this fantastic
ultimate<00:01:00.550> oil<00:01:00.790> blend<00:01:01.120> this<00:01:01.720> really<00:01:02.350> is

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
ultimate oil blend this really is

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.039 
ultimate oil blend this really is
amazing<00:01:02.950> it<00:01:03.400> has<00:01:03.579> exactly<00:01:03.970> the<00:01:04.329> right<00:01:04.509> ratio

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
amazing it has exactly the right ratio

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.710 
amazing it has exactly the right ratio
of<00:01:05.110> oils<00:01:05.740> the<00:01:06.430> ratio<00:01:06.790> of<00:01:06.880> Omega<00:01:07.210> 3<00:01:07.420> and<00:01:07.450> 6

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
of oils the ratio of Omega 3 and 6

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.300 
of oils the ratio of Omega 3 and 6
particularly<00:01:08.380> important<00:01:08.800> and<00:01:08.950> it's<00:01:09.070> in<00:01:09.190> the

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
particularly important and it's in the

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.550 
particularly important and it's in the
imbalance<00:01:10.000> that<00:01:10.270> leads<00:01:10.810> to<00:01:11.080> a<00:01:11.110> number<00:01:11.440> of

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
imbalance that leads to a number of

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.850 
imbalance that leads to a number of
symptoms<00:01:11.890> so<00:01:12.820> what<00:01:13.300> we<00:01:13.420> need<00:01:13.630> is<00:01:13.960> what<00:01:14.380> synodos

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
symptoms so what we need is what synodos

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.850 
symptoms so what we need is what synodos
oil<00:01:15.250> which<00:01:15.460> is<00:01:15.640> a<00:01:15.670> ratio<00:01:15.880> of<00:01:16.120> 2<00:01:16.510> to<00:01:16.750> 1<00:01:16.780> Omega<00:01:17.590> 3

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
oil which is a ratio of 2 to 1 Omega 3

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.420 
oil which is a ratio of 2 to 1 Omega 3
to<00:01:18.040> 6<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:19.420> that's<00:01:19.510> 2<00:01:19.840> to<00:01:20.020> 1<00:01:20.260> omega-3<00:01:21.159> to<00:01:21.400> omega-6

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
to 6 so that's 2 to 1 omega-3 to omega-6

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.940 
to 6 so that's 2 to 1 omega-3 to omega-6
and<00:01:22.210> that<00:01:22.659> brings<00:01:22.870> the<00:01:23.020> ratio<00:01:23.440> in<00:01:23.560> our<00:01:23.680> bodies

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
and that brings the ratio in our bodies

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.100 
and that brings the ratio in our bodies
to<00:01:24.340> more<00:01:24.490> like<00:01:24.670> 1<00:01:25.000> to<00:01:25.240> 1<00:01:25.420> that's<00:01:25.659> how<00:01:25.810> it<00:01:25.900> works

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
to more like 1 to 1 that's how it works

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.810 
to more like 1 to 1 that's how it works
when<00:01:26.320> it<00:01:26.409> hits<00:01:26.590> our<00:01:26.740> bodies<00:01:27.070> and<00:01:27.280> that's<00:01:27.640> the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
when it hits our bodies and that's the

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.330 
when it hits our bodies and that's the
ideal<00:01:28.180> optimum<00:01:28.690> balance<00:01:28.840> we<00:01:29.740> also<00:01:29.860> need<00:01:30.190> to

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
ideal optimum balance we also need to

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.430 
ideal optimum balance we also need to
eat<00:01:30.370> fat<00:01:30.850> to<00:01:31.240> keep<00:01:31.390> well<00:01:31.659> and<00:01:31.810> stay<00:01:31.990> fit<00:01:32.260> and

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
eat fat to keep well and stay fit and

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.200 
eat fat to keep well and stay fit and
lean<00:01:32.560> but<00:01:32.830> it<00:01:32.920> needs<00:01:33.100> to<00:01:33.159> be<00:01:33.280> a<00:01:33.310> good<00:01:33.640> fat<00:01:33.909> good

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
lean but it needs to be a good fat good

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.690 
lean but it needs to be a good fat good
sources<00:01:34.630> of<00:01:34.810> fat<00:01:35.049> so<00:01:35.620> a<00:01:35.650> balanced<00:01:36.070> blend<00:01:36.220> of

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
sources of fat so a balanced blend of

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.990 
sources of fat so a balanced blend of
Omega<00:01:37.060> 3<00:01:37.330> and<00:01:37.540> 6<00:01:37.750> oils<00:01:38.080> will<00:01:38.229> help<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:38.710> body<00:01:39.000> to

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
Omega 3 and 6 oils will help the body to

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.210 
Omega 3 and 6 oils will help the body to
