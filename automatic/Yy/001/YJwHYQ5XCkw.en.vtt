00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
before and this stump took me like

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:17.939 
before and this stump took me like
forever<00:04:16.870> sitting<00:04:17.380> there<00:04:17.500> looking<00:04:17.829> at

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
forever sitting there looking at

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:20.189 
forever sitting there looking at
pictures<00:04:18.370> and<00:04:18.639> I<00:04:19.180> still<00:04:19.419> haven't<00:04:19.479> done<00:04:19.900> the

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:20.199 
pictures and I still haven't done the

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:22.830 
pictures and I still haven't done the
branches<00:04:20.859> of<00:04:20.889> a<00:04:21.130> fallen<00:04:21.519> tree<00:04:21.549> by<00:04:22.419> the<00:04:22.449> stump

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
branches of a fallen tree by the stump

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.610 
branches of a fallen tree by the stump
either<00:04:23.050> so<00:04:23.500> I'm<00:04:24.220> just<00:04:24.570> I<00:04:25.570> don't<00:04:26.110> want<00:04:26.229> to<00:04:26.320> do<00:04:26.440> it

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
either so I'm just I don't want to do it

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.520 
either so I'm just I don't want to do it
don't<00:04:26.770> make<00:04:26.919> me<00:04:27.070> do<00:04:27.250> it<00:04:27.280> and<00:04:27.930> then<00:04:28.930> this<00:04:29.110> is<00:04:29.349> my

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
don't make me do it and then this is my

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.779 
don't make me do it and then this is my
ways<00:04:29.740> when<00:04:30.039> I<00:04:30.070> finished<00:04:30.520> rather<00:04:30.970> simplistic

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
ways when I finished rather simplistic

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:36.390 
ways when I finished rather simplistic
this<00:04:33.789> is<00:04:33.970> my<00:04:34.180> purification<00:04:34.510> girl<00:04:35.260> and<00:04:36.250> you'll

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
this is my purification girl and you'll

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.339 
this is my purification girl and you'll
note<00:04:36.580> again<00:04:36.909> there<00:04:37.419> is<00:04:37.659> three<00:04:37.990> fairies

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:38.349 
note again there is three fairies

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:40.050 
note again there is three fairies
usually<00:04:38.740> always<00:04:38.919> if<00:04:39.159> I<00:04:39.250> include<00:04:39.550> fairies<00:04:39.880> have

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
usually always if I include fairies have

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.260 
usually always if I include fairies have
three<00:04:40.360> and<00:04:40.630> I<00:04:41.199> use<00:04:41.409> them<00:04:41.620> to<00:04:41.770> help<00:04:41.889> the

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
three and I use them to help the

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.330 
three and I use them to help the
composition<00:04:43.270> so<00:04:43.659> I<00:04:44.020> place<00:04:44.530> them<00:04:44.740> different

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
composition so I place them different

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.000 
composition so I place them different
places<00:04:45.520> but<00:04:45.909> your<00:04:46.060> eye<00:04:46.090> will<00:04:46.180> follow<00:04:46.919> which<00:04:47.919> is

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
places but your eye will follow which is

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.620 
places but your eye will follow which is
also<00:04:48.190> i<00:04:48.340> painted<00:04:48.729> the<00:04:48.849> bubbles<00:04:49.150> with<00:04:49.300> water

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
also i painted the bubbles with water

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.379 
also i painted the bubbles with water
down<00:04:49.900> acrylic<00:04:50.349> again<00:04:50.889> much<00:04:51.789> like<00:04:52.060> it<00:04:52.240> looks

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
down acrylic again much like it looks

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:53.879 
down acrylic again much like it looks
like<00:04:52.510> watercolors<00:04:53.050> I<00:04:53.229> like<00:04:53.380> the<00:04:53.500> effect<00:04:53.740> i

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
like watercolors I like the effect i

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.290 
like watercolors I like the effect i
don't<00:04:54.070> like<00:04:54.159> watercolors<00:04:54.669> don't<00:04:54.880> ask

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.240 
don't like watercolors don't ask
um<00:04:56.050> for<00:04:56.830> the<00:04:56.919> backgrounds<00:04:57.639> I<00:04:57.819> basically<00:04:58.750> just

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
um for the backgrounds I basically just

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.540 
um for the backgrounds I basically just
blend<00:05:00.250> it<00:05:00.370> in<00:05:00.520> the<00:05:00.940> whole<00:05:01.180> background<00:05:01.419> and
