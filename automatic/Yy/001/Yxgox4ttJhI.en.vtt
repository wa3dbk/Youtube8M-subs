I'm doing this video my first tip is
when<00:01:05.700> you've<00:01:05.880> got<00:01:05.909> your<00:01:06.210> deck<00:01:06.420> list<00:01:06.600> written

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
when you've got your deck list written

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.929 
when you've got your deck list written
start<00:01:07.590> by<00:01:07.740> looking<00:01:08.159> through<00:01:08.460> your<00:01:08.610> deck<00:01:08.729> list

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
start by looking through your deck list

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.550 
start by looking through your deck list
and<00:01:09.150> counting<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.570> cards<00:01:09.750> through<00:01:10.260> your<00:01:10.409> deck

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
and counting the cards through your deck

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.609 
and counting the cards through your deck
so<00:01:10.830> turn<00:01:11.490> over<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.880> cards<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.600> as<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.470> go

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
so turn over the cards and as you go

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.740

through<00:01:13.890> your<00:01:13.979> deck<00:01:14.159> list<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:15.720> know

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
through your deck list and you know

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.170

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
three eclipses it flips Y them and that

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.609 
three eclipses it flips Y them and that

for example this card could be done if I

for example this card could be done if I
can<00:02:07.079> seem<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.350> like<00:02:07.770> particularly<00:02:08.220> well<00:02:09.770> but

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
can seem that like particularly well but

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.500 
can seem that like particularly well but
it's<00:02:10.950> it's<00:02:11.220> got<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.459> bit<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.700> crease<00:02:11.910> on<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.239> on

it's it's got a bit of a crease on it on

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.530 
it's it's got a bit of a crease on it on
the<00:02:12.629> back<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.810> it

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
and this just happens with general wear

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.209 
and this just happens with general wear
and<00:02:16.719> tear<00:02:16.930> that<00:02:17.230> you<00:02:17.319> just<00:02:17.680> need<00:02:17.829> to<00:02:17.920> make<00:02:18.040> sure

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:18.219 
and tear that you just need to make sure

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:20.179

deck for example if you should shut the
deck<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:34.409> find<00:02:35.409> the<00:02:35.530> same<00:02:35.709> card<00:02:36.010> popping<00:02:36.370> out

deck and find the same card popping out

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.399 
deck and find the same card popping out
that's<00:02:36.760> whether<00:02:37.090> it's<00:02:37.299> a<00:02:37.359> bent<00:02:37.569> card<00:02:37.870> or

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
that's whether it's a bent card or

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.319 
that's whether it's a bent card or
whether<00:02:38.680> it's<00:02:38.920> got<00:02:39.489> any<00:02:39.639> particular<00:02:40.120> weight

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
whether it's got any particular weight

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.660 
whether it's got any particular weight
foil<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:41.019> it<00:02:41.170> it's<00:02:41.650> a<00:02:41.739> stackable<00:02:42.069> card<00:02:42.400> and

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
foil to it it's a stackable card and

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.550 
foil to it it's a stackable card and
it's<00:02:43.599> very<00:02:43.870> likely<00:02:44.049> that<00:02:44.980> you<00:02:45.849> will<00:02:46.500> get<00:02:47.500> a

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
it's very likely that you will get a

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.470 
it's very likely that you will get a
penalty<00:02:47.739> foot<00:02:48.129> for<00:02:48.400> that<00:02:48.579> I'll<00:02:49.000> actually<00:02:49.150> just

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
penalty foot for that I'll actually just

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.089 
penalty foot for that I'll actually just
put<00:02:49.629> two<00:02:49.750> cards<00:02:49.989> in<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.260> same<00:02:50.409> sleeve<00:02:50.680> here<00:02:50.920> so

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
put two cards in the same sleeve here so

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.670 
put two cards in the same sleeve here so
that<00:02:51.310> I<00:02:51.519> can<00:02:52.000> prove<00:02:52.239> the<00:02:52.389> point<00:02:52.629> tip<00:02:53.500> number

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
that I can prove the point tip number

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.099 
that I can prove the point tip number
four<00:02:53.980> and<00:02:54.280> my<00:02:54.639> last<00:02:54.849> tip<00:02:55.120> is<00:02:55.629> to<00:02:55.780> make<00:02:55.840> sure

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
four and my last tip is to make sure

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.069 
four and my last tip is to make sure
that<00:02:56.230> all<00:02:56.409> your<00:02:56.439> sleeves<00:02:56.799> are<00:02:57.189> the<00:02:57.370> same<00:02:57.579> size

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
that all your sleeves are the same size

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.750 
that all your sleeves are the same size
for<00:02:59.079> example<00:02:59.500> you<00:03:00.010> can<00:03:00.159> see<00:03:00.370> these<00:03:00.519> two

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
for example you can see these two

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.220 
for example you can see these two
sleeves<00:03:03.180> actually<00:03:04.180> slightly<00:03:04.780> bigger<00:03:05.079> than

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
sleeves actually slightly bigger than

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.349 
sleeves actually slightly bigger than
the<00:03:05.319> rest<00:03:05.470> of<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.799> sleeves<00:03:06.579> in<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.760> pack<00:03:07.000> I

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
the rest of the sleeves in the pack I

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:09.599 
the rest of the sleeves in the pack I
mean<00:03:08.349> that<00:03:08.560> you<00:03:08.620> can<00:03:08.769> find<00:03:09.159> them<00:03:09.310> when<00:03:09.459> you're

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
mean that you can find them when you're

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.599 
mean that you can find them when you're
shuffling<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:10.409> in<00:03:11.409> general<00:03:11.799> you'll<00:03:12.370> get<00:03:12.579> a

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
shuffling and in general you'll get a

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.039 
shuffling and in general you'll get a
game<00:03:12.849> loss<00:03:13.030> I'm<00:03:13.299> at<00:03:13.419> loss<00:03:13.689> or<00:03:13.989> a

game loss I'm at loss or a

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.679 
game loss I'm at loss or a
