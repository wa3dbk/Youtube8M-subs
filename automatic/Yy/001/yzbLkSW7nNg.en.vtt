00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
idea is I upload this it goes into the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.859 
idea is I upload this it goes into the
community<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.670> then<00:01:39.090> people<00:01:39.270> can<00:01:39.540> guess<00:01:39.840> it

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
community and then people can guess it

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.899 
community and then people can guess it
and<00:01:40.229> like<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.560> if<00:01:40.979> they<00:01:41.340> guess<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.729> correctly

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
and like it if they guess it correctly

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.940 
and like it if they guess it correctly
they<00:01:42.329> win<00:01:42.540> candies<00:01:43.170> which<00:01:43.380> means<00:01:43.649> then<00:01:43.829> they

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
they win candies which means then they
