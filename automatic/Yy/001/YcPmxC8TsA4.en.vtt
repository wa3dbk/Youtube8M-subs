formations<00:00:19.100> every<00:00:19.430> now<00:00:19.520> and<00:00:19.699> then<00:00:19.789> but

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:20.089 
formations every now and then but

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:23.980 
formations every now and then but
nothing<00:00:20.480> really<00:00:20.720> new<00:00:21.170> or<00:00:21.529> monumental<00:00:22.810> so<00:00:23.810> the

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
nothing really new or monumental so the

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.499 
nothing really new or monumental so the
obvious<00:00:24.289> answer<00:00:24.589> is<00:00:24.710> custom<00:00:25.429> maps<00:00:25.609> and<00:00:25.939> it

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:26.509 
obvious answer is custom maps and it

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.329 
obvious answer is custom maps and it
would<00:00:26.630> be<00:00:26.720> a<00:00:26.749> pretty<00:00:27.199> good<00:00:27.380> answer<00:00:27.560> except<00:00:28.160> for

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:28.339 
would be a pretty good answer except for

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:30.880 
would be a pretty good answer except for
the<00:00:28.460> fact<00:00:28.699> that<00:00:28.869> a<00:00:29.869> lot<00:00:30.320> of<00:00:30.349> them<00:00:30.529> are<00:00:30.679> just<00:00:30.829> the

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
the fact that a lot of them are just the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.819 
the fact that a lot of them are just the
