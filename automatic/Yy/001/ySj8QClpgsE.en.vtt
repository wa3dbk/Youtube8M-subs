under<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.689> ball<00:00:27.869> as<00:00:28.699> it<00:00:29.699> approaches<00:00:30.269> so<00:00:30.599> I've

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
under the ball as it approaches so I've

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.650 
under the ball as it approaches so I've
got<00:00:30.929> 12<00:00:31.289> inches<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.769> lift<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.219> I've<00:00:33.090> got<00:00:33.329> 12

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
if you're trying to spin the ball you

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.479 
if you're trying to spin the ball you
need<00:00:44.070> two<00:00:44.280> feet<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.730> lift<00:00:46.219> whereas<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.340> other

two now here have some fun with this
when<00:00:50.129> you're<00:00:50.280> using<00:00:50.430> footwork<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.120> tennis<00:00:51.510> I

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
when you're using footwork in tennis I

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.600 
when you're using footwork in tennis I
can<00:00:52.590> hit<00:00:52.680> off<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.980> back<00:00:53.160> foot

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
can hit off the back foot

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.189 
can hit off the back foot
I<00:00:53.840> can<00:00:54.840> hit<00:00:54.930> off<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.260> front<00:00:55.500> foot<00:00:55.739> or<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.850> can

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
I can hit off the front foot or you can

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.360 
I can hit off the front foot or you can
push<00:00:58.199> off<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:59.219> two<00:00:59.370> feet<00:00:59.399> and<00:01:00.559> in<00:01:01.559> my<00:01:01.770> mind<00:01:02.070> and

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
push off of two feet and in my mind and

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.490 
push off of two feet and in my mind and
I<00:01:02.789> guess<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:03.059> lot<00:01:03.300> these<00:01:03.480> days<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:04.080> think<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
I guess a lot these days I think the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.800 
I guess a lot these days I think the
best<00:01:04.680> top<00:01:04.949> spins<00:01:05.339> have<00:01:05.909> what's<00:01:06.150> called<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.479> dual

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
best top spins have what's called a dual

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.500 
best top spins have what's called a dual
leg<00:01:07.470> Drive<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.640> when<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.880> racket<00:01:09.270> slow

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
leg Drive so that when the racket slow

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.710 
leg Drive so that when the racket slow
and<00:01:09.689> accelerating<00:01:10.350> up<00:01:10.500> both<00:01:11.280> legs<00:01:11.720> are

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
and accelerating up both legs are

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.789 
and accelerating up both legs are
contributing<00:01:13.470> both<00:01:14.340> legs<00:01:15.229> come<00:01:16.229> up<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.619> I

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
contributing both legs come up and I

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.609 
contributing both legs come up and I
think<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.189> really<00:01:17.450> mimics<00:01:18.450> how<00:01:19.080> Sampras

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
think this really mimics how Sampras

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.749 
think this really mimics how Sampras
looked<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.130> mimics<00:01:20.909> how<00:01:21.560> Federer<00:01:22.560> looks<00:01:22.890> it

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
looked it mimics how Federer looks it

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.990 
looked it mimics how Federer looks it
mimics<00:01:24.210> how<00:01:24.439> Wawrinka<00:01:25.439> looks<00:01:25.790> but<00:01:26.790> if<00:01:26.880> you're

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
mimics how Wawrinka looks but if you're

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.819 
mimics how Wawrinka looks but if you're
trying<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.330> get<00:01:27.450> topspin<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.170> must<00:01:28.439> commit<00:01:28.770> to

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
trying to get topspin you must commit to

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.950 
trying to get topspin you must commit to
get<00:01:29.070> under<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.430> ball<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.450> must<00:01:30.689> commit

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
get under the ball and you must commit

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.840 
get under the ball and you must commit
to<00:01:31.079> accelerate<00:01:31.650> up<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.100> through<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.640> ball

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
to accelerate up and through the ball

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.539 
to accelerate up and through the ball
two<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.689> two

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
two and two

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.370 
two and two
I'm<00:01:35.549> not<00:01:35.759> sure<00:01:35.939> two<00:01:36.150> plus<00:01:36.390> two<00:01:36.570> equals<00:01:36.900> four

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
I'm not sure two plus two equals four

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.700 
I'm not sure two plus two equals four
but<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.130> regard<00:01:39.020> it's<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.170> lot<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.439> fun<00:01:40.619> to

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
but in this regard it's a lot of fun to

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.340 
but in this regard it's a lot of fun to
hit<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.860> topspin<00:01:41.369> backhand<00:01:41.640> will<00:01:42.090> have<00:01:42.299> a

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
hit a topspin backhand will have a

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.410 
hit a topspin backhand will have a
better<00:01:43.350> player<00:01:43.649> than<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:44.390> demonstrate<00:01:45.390> this

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
better player than I demonstrate this

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.990 
better player than I demonstrate this
with<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> lot<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.049> snap<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.710> little<00:01:47.670> bit<00:01:47.909> of

with a lot of snap a little bit of

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.910 
with a lot of snap a little bit of
history<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:49.020> intrigues<00:01:49.409> me<00:01:49.500> how<00:01:49.680> few<00:01:49.890> people

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
history it intrigues me how few people

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.450 
history it intrigues me how few people
know<00:01:50.310> all<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:51.500> who<00:01:52.500> was<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.979> Sampras

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
know all this who was it the Sampras

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.450 
know all this who was it the Sampras

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
idolized growing up Rod Laver

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.789 
idolized growing up Rod Laver
how<00:01:57.149> did<00:01:57.329> rod<00:01:57.509> laver<00:01:57.659> finish<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.290> backhand

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
how did rod laver finish that backhand

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.420 
how did rod laver finish that backhand
I'll<00:01:59.549> go<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.909> camera<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.009> racket<00:02:02.310> was

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
I'll go to the camera and the racket was

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.399 
I'll go to the camera and the racket was
way<00:02:02.939> up<00:02:03.270> here<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.719> obviously<00:02:04.049> the

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
way up here and obviously the

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.959 
way up here and obviously the
acceleration<00:02:05.159> was<00:02:05.280> there<00:02:05.490> but<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.820> a

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
acceleration was there but this is a

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.130 
acceleration was there but this is a
unintended<00:02:07.039> consequence<00:02:08.750> so<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.780> really

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
unintended consequence so I really

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.809 
unintended consequence so I really
believe<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.470> when<00:02:10.800> Sampras<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.370> watching

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
believe that when Sampras is watching

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.070 
believe that when Sampras is watching
this<00:02:11.910> he<00:02:12.090> says<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.420> know<00:02:12.540> I'm<00:02:12.690> gonna<00:02:12.810> copy

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
that

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.310 
that
because<00:02:14.190> labor<00:02:14.400> was<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.760> greatest<00:02:15.320> then

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
because labor was the greatest then

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.960 
because labor was the greatest then
Sampras<00:02:16.800> was<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.100> greatest<00:02:17.490> so<00:02:17.640> then<00:02:17.790> who's

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
Sampras was the greatest so then who's

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.430 
Sampras was the greatest so then who's
Federer<00:02:18.960> copying<00:02:19.520> and<00:02:20.520> I'm<00:02:21.420> fascinated<00:02:21.900> at
